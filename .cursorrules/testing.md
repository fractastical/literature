# Testing Guidelines

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### TDD Workflow
- Always use test-driven development (TDD) with a unified modular approach
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Follow the red-green-refactor cycle
- Ensure tests drive design decisions

### Unified Modular Approach
- Apply consistent testing patterns across all modules
- Use unified test structure and organization
- Maintain modular test organization that mirrors code structure
- Ensure tests are reusable and maintainable

## Testing Principles

### Real Data Analysis
- **No mock methods** - always do real data analysis
- Use actual data sources and real implementations
- Test with realistic data scenarios
- Verify behavior with genuine system interactions

### Comprehensive Testing
- Test all methods, tests, documentation, signposting, logging, orchestration, validation, functionality, completeness, and accuracy
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure cases
- Include edge case testing
- Verify error handling and validation

### Test Quality
- Write professional, effective, real test methods
- Ensure tests are documented and informative
- Use clear, descriptive test names
- Make tests maintainable and easy to understand

## Test Organization

### Module Structure
- Organize tests to mirror code structure
- Place tests in corresponding test directories
- Maintain clear test module boundaries
- Follow project test directory conventions

### Test Files
- Create test files for each module
- Use descriptive test file names
- Group related tests logically
- Maintain consistent test file structure

### Test Cases
- Write focused, single-purpose test cases
- Use clear test case names that describe what is being tested
- Keep test cases independent and repeatable
- Ensure tests can run in any order

## Test Implementation

### Test Methods
- Write real test methods that exercise actual functionality
- Avoid mocking unless absolutely necessary
- Use real data and real implementations
- Verify actual system behavior

### Test Data
- Use real data for testing
- Create realistic test scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure test data is representative of production data

### Assertions
- Write clear, meaningful assertions
- Verify expected behavior explicitly
- Check both positive and negative cases
- Ensure assertions provide useful failure messages

## Test Coverage

### Coverage Expectations
- Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- Ensure critical paths are thoroughly tested
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify integration between modules

### Coverage Analysis
- Use coverage tools to identify gaps
- Focus on meaningful coverage, not just percentages
- Ensure tests validate actual behavior
- Review coverage reports regularly

## Test Documentation

### Test Documentation
- Document test purpose and scope
- Explain test scenarios and expected outcomes
- Note any special test setup requirements
- Document test data sources and assumptions

### Test Comments
- Add comments to explain complex test logic
- Document why certain test approaches are used
- Note any test limitations or known issues
- Keep test comments clear and concise

## Test Maintenance

### Keeping Tests Current
- Update tests when code changes
- Remove obsolete or redundant tests
- Refactor tests to maintain clarity
- Ensure tests remain relevant and useful

### Test Review
- Review tests for completeness and accuracy
- Verify tests are still valid after code changes
- Check for test redundancy
- Ensure tests follow current best practices

## Integration Testing

### System Integration
- Test integration between modules
- Verify end-to-end workflows
- Test system behavior under realistic conditions
- Ensure integration tests use real components

### Workflow Testing
- Test complete workflows and pipelines
- Verify orchestration and coordination
- Test error handling in integrated systems
- Ensure workflows handle edge cases appropriately

## Performance Testing

### Performance Considerations
- Test performance with realistic data volumes
- Verify system behavior under load
- Test with actual data processing requirements
- Ensure performance meets expectations

### Realistic Scenarios
- Use real-world data scenarios for performance testing
- Test with actual system configurations
- Verify performance under production-like conditions
- Measure actual performance characteristics
