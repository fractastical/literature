# Architecture and Design Principles

## Modular Architecture

### Modular Design
- Prefer modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned architecture
- Organize code into logical, reusable modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Design modules to be independent and testable

### Module Organization
- Structure modules to reflect system architecture
- Maintain consistent module organization patterns
- Use clear module boundaries and interfaces
- Ensure modules have well-defined responsibilities

### Module Dependencies
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Design for loose coupling and high cohesion

## Design Patterns

### Appropriate Pattern Selection
- Choose design patterns that fit the problem
- Avoid over-engineering with unnecessary patterns
- Use patterns to improve maintainability and clarity
- Document pattern usage and rationale

### Common Patterns
- Use appropriate patterns for common problems
- Apply patterns consistently across the codebase
- Document pattern implementations
- Ensure patterns enhance rather than complicate code

## System Organization

### Directory Structure
- Organize code to reflect system architecture
- Maintain consistent directory structure
- Use clear naming conventions
- Group related functionality together

### Code Organization
- Organize code logically within modules
- Maintain clear file and class organization
- Use appropriate abstraction levels
- Keep related code together

### Interface Design
- Design clear, well-defined interfaces
- Keep interfaces focused and minimal
- Document interface contracts clearly
- Ensure interfaces are stable and maintainable

## Integration Considerations

### Module Integration
- Design modules for easy integration
- Use clear integration patterns
- Document integration requirements
- Ensure integration points are well-defined

### System Integration
- Design for system-wide integration
- Consider integration with external systems
- Plan for scalability and extensibility
- Document integration patterns and requirements

### Dependency Management
- Manage dependencies carefully
- Minimize external dependencies
- Document dependency requirements
- Ensure dependencies are well-maintained

## Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- Separate concerns clearly and consistently
- Avoid mixing responsibilities
- Design focused, single-purpose components
- Maintain clear boundaries between concerns

### Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Use appropriate levels of abstraction
- Encapsulate implementation details
- Expose only necessary interfaces
- Hide complexity behind clear abstractions

### Scalability and Extensibility
- Design for future growth and changes
- Plan for extensibility
- Consider scalability requirements
- Design flexible, adaptable architectures

## Design Quality

### Clear Reasoning
- Document architectural decisions clearly
- Explain design choices and trade-offs
- Provide rationale for architectural patterns
- Make reasoning accessible to others

### Maintainability
- Design for long-term maintainability
- Keep architecture understandable
- Plan for future modifications
- Ensure architecture supports maintenance

### Testability
- Design architecture to support testing
- Ensure components are testable in isolation
- Plan for integration testing
- Make testing straightforward and reliable

## System Structure

### Layered Architecture
- Use appropriate layering when beneficial
- Maintain clear layer boundaries
- Define layer responsibilities clearly
- Ensure layers communicate through well-defined interfaces

### Component Design
- Design components with clear responsibilities
- Ensure components are reusable
- Make components independently testable
- Document component interfaces and behavior

### Data Flow
- Design clear data flow patterns
- Document data transformations
- Ensure data flow is traceable
- Plan for error handling in data flow

## Architecture Documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- Document system architecture comprehensively
- Explain architectural decisions and rationale
- Provide architecture diagrams when helpful
- Keep architecture documentation current

### Design Documentation
- Document design patterns and their usage
- Explain module organization and structure
- Provide integration guidelines
- Document system-wide conventions

## Evolution and Refactoring

### Architecture Evolution
- Plan for architecture evolution
- Design for incremental improvements
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document architectural changes

### Refactoring Guidelines
- Refactor to improve architecture
- Maintain architectural consistency
- Document refactoring decisions
- Ensure refactoring improves maintainability
