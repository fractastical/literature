# General Coding Practices

## Principles

### Thoughtful Application of Best Practices
- Apply programming best practices thoughtfully, not dogmatically
- Consider context and trade-offs when making decisions
- Review and improve methods, tests, documentation, signposting, logging, orchestration, validation, functionality, completeness, and accuracy

### Comprehensive Review
- Always consider and review possible improvements before finalizing code
- Assess where and how you are in what kind of file and total context
- Scan the repository entirely before acting to ensure intelligent decisions
- Avoid redundant code sections and scripts

### Professional Standards
- Write professional, effective, real methods
- Ensure all code is documented and tested
- Use informative logging throughout
- Maintain clear, interpretable code

## Code Organization

### Modular Design
- Prefer modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned code
- Organize code into logical, reusable modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Avoid tight coupling between modules

### Code Structure
- Keep functions and classes focused and single-purpose
- Use clear, descriptive names that convey intent
- Organize imports logically and group by source
- Maintain consistent code structure across the project

### Context Awareness
- Assess where and how you are in what kind of file and total context
- Understand the full system before making changes
- Consider downstream effects of modifications
- Maintain awareness of related modules and dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Pre-Implementation
- Scan the repository entirely before acting
- Understand existing patterns and conventions
- Identify related code and potential impacts
- Plan changes thoughtfully

### During Implementation
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain

### Post-Implementation
- Review code for improvements
- Ensure tests are comprehensive
- Verify documentation is accurate
- Check for redundant or unnecessary code

## Code Quality

### Clarity and Interpretability
- Write code that clearly expresses intent
- Use comments to explain "why" not "what"
- Make code self-documenting through good naming
- Ensure code is interpretable by others

### Thoughtful Design
- Apply intelligent chains of thought
- Consider multiple approaches before choosing
- Balance simplicity with functionality
- Design for maintainability and extensibility

### Professional Standards
- Write professional, functional, intelligent, wise code
- Maintain modular, concise, elegant, thoughtful code
- Use clearly-commented, interpretable code
- Follow established conventions consistently

## Summary and Communication

### Expressing Rationale
- Summary and express intelligent chains of thought
- Provide comprehensive coherent rationale for decisions
- Document reasoning in code comments when appropriate
- Explain trade-offs and design choices

### Observations
- At end of transmissions, add any other observations or needed edits
- Note potential improvements or follow-up work
- Identify areas that may need attention
- Document any deviations from standard practices
