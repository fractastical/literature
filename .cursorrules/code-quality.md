# Code Quality Standards

## Code Style

### Professional and Functional
- Write professional, effective, real methods
- Use functional programming principles where appropriate
- Prefer pure functions when possible
- Avoid side effects unless necessary

### Intelligent and Elegant
- Write intelligent, wise code that solves problems elegantly
- Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
- Balance readability with performance

### Modular and Concise
- Keep code modular and well-organized
- Write concise code that expresses intent clearly
- Remove unnecessary complexity
- Avoid redundant code sections and scripts

### Thoughtful and Clear
- Write thoughtful, clearly-commented, interpretable code
- Use comments to explain reasoning, not obvious operations
- Make code self-documenting through good naming
- Ensure code can be understood by others

## Code Review Considerations

### Method Quality
- Ensure methods are well-designed and focused
- Verify methods handle edge cases appropriately
- Check for proper error handling and validation
- Review method signatures for clarity

### Test Coverage
- Verify all methods have appropriate test coverage
- Ensure tests are meaningful and comprehensive
- Check that tests validate both success and failure cases
- Confirm tests use real data, not mocks

### Documentation Quality
- Ensure methods are properly documented
- Verify documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- Check that examples in documentation are correct
- Review documentation for clarity and completeness

### Signposting and Logging
- Include informative logging throughout code
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Ensure log messages are clear and actionable
- Add signposting to guide users through complex operations

## Best Practices

### Methods
- Write methods that do one thing well
- Use descriptive method names that convey intent
- Keep methods focused and maintainable
- Document method purpose, parameters, and return values

### Tests
- Write tests that validate real behavior
- Use real data analysis, not mock methods
- Ensure tests are independent and repeatable
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) practices

### Documentation
- Document code clearly and accurately
- Use "show not tell" principle in documentation
- Keep documentation understated and factual
- Ensure documentation reflects actual implementation

### Orchestration
- Design orchestration that is clear and maintainable
- Use appropriate patterns for workflow management
- Ensure error handling is comprehensive
- Provide clear feedback during long-running operations

### Validation
- Validate inputs and outputs appropriately
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Ensure validation is consistent across the codebase

### Functionality
- Ensure functionality is complete and accurate
- Verify all requirements are met
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Document functionality clearly

- Plan for maintainability and extensibility
- Document reasoning and trade-offs

### Clearly-Commented
- Add comments that explain "why" not "what"
- Use comments to document complex logic
- Keep comments accurate and up-to-date
- Ensure comments enhance understanding

### Interpretable
- Write code that is easy to understand
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Structure code logically
- Make code self-documenting
