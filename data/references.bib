  abstract={The first comprehensive treatment of active inference, an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines. Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.},

  abstract={This article describes a process theory based on active inference and belief propagation. Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence—or minimizing variational free energy—we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes’ optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton’s principle of least action.},

  abstract={With the increasing popularity and demands for large language model applications on mobile devices, it is difficult for resource-limited mobile terminals to run large-model inference tasks efficiently. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches have been used to offload large language models (LLMs) inference tasks to servers. However, existing DRL solutions suffer from data inefficiency, insensitivity to latency requirements, and non-adaptability to task load variations, which will degrade the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on active inference for LLMs inference task offloading and resource allocation in cloud-edge computing. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed method has superior performance over mainstream DRLs, improves in data utilization efficiency, and is more adaptable to changing task load scenarios.},

  abstract={Abstract Self-esteem, the evaluation of one’s own worth or value, is a critical aspect of psychological well-being and mental health. In this paper, we propose an active inference account of self-esteem, casting it as a sociometer or an inferential capacity to interpret one’s standing within a social group. This approach allows us to explore the interaction between an individual’s self-perception and the expectations of their social environment.When there is a mismatch between these perceptions and expectations, the individual needs to adjust their actions or update their self-perception to better align with their current experiences. We also consider this hypothesis in relation with recent research on affective inference, suggesting that self-esteem enables the individual to track and respond to this discrepancy through affective states such as anxiety or positive affect. By acting as an inferential sociometer, self-esteem allows individuals to navigate and adapt to their social environment, ultimately impacting their psychological well-being and mental health.},

  abstract={Active inference, a first-principles framework for modelling the behaviour of sentient agents, is beginning to be applied in consciousness research. One hypothesis arising from the framework is that active inference is necessary for changes in conscious content. As one component of an extensive adversarial collaboration among competing theories of consciousness, active inference will be contrasted with two other theories of consciousness, neither of which posit that active inference is necessary for consciousness. Here, we thus present a Study Protocol designed to test the active inference hypothesis using a carefully controlled adaptation of the motion-induced blindness paradigm, where an 'active' condition with richer active inference is contrasted with a 'passive' condition. In the active condition, participants direct their gaze towards a target stimulus following its disappearance from consciousness, and report on its subsequent reappearance. In the passive condition, participants maintain central fixation, while the stimulus array is moved across the visual field (in a replay of the active condition based on eye-tracking data acquired during active trials). In two experiments, we plan to investigate target reappearance across active and passive conditions to evaluate the contribution of active inference to conscious awareness. Results will eventually be considered in the context of all the experiments conducted as part of the overall adversarial collaboration.},

This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.},

  abstract={Why do some rhythms make us want to move and not others? A predictive processing account suggests that prediction errors drive this phenomenon, but this hypothesis remains underspecified. Here, we operationalized this account as a Bayesian model that infers whether a rhythmic sequence is caused by a metered or unmetered template, coupled with an active inference rule in which movement occurs if the sensory feedback from movement would reduce the prediction errors generated by this inference process. Surprisal, as an index of prediction error, was calculated for each rhythm with and without a metronome (a proxy for the feedback from moving along), with delta surprisal as the difference. Surprisal increased linearly as a function of rhythmic complexity, while delta surprisal showed a similar pattern with urge to move ratings shown in previous studies, and this relation was confirmed in an online study. These results suggest that the urge to move to music is driven by the potential to reduce meter-based prediction errors via the expected feedback from moving along to the beat. This work provides a crucial update to the predictive processing account and highlights a key role of active inference and prediction-based learning in our musical experiences.},

Behavioral-cognitive "profiles" lack a justified principle linking function to experience, and the awareness case study illustrates how externally specified goals can just as well underwrite as-if (pseudo-intentional) control rather than original intentionality. Moreover, the proposed heuristic overlooks that substrate similarity is currently indispensable for justifiably inferring the presence of consciousness beyond the validated case of the adult human brain. Given all this, the framework seems to provide a blueprint for building a more sophisticated philosophical zombie; it does not-and cannot-tell us whether anyone is there.},

  abstract={<p>Active inference is a domain-general theory of brain functioning which reconceptualizes the perception-action interface in terms of a common process of minimization of sensory prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2010). Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little explicit attention in speech motor control. This is despite speech providing a critical test-case, arguably being one of the most crucial and intricate of human sensorimotor functions. The application of active inference to speech motor control can allow crosspollination of decades of work from neighbouring disciplines, and could highlight where speech motor control mechanisms may be similar to, or differ from, those in other motor control domains, by establishing mechanistic explanation in common terms. We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework of auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.</p>},

  abstract={A new branch of artificial intelligence called Active Inference AI is changing the very foundations of how medical knowledge is created, applied, and taught. And this new AI is combining with an entirely new evolution of the Internet, called the Spatial Web, which is changing how medical knowledge will be shared globally. Active Inference AI and the Spatial Web have been developed together to create a powerful new environment for medicine and science in general to evolve to an entirely new level. Until now, large-scale AI models called LLMs (Large Language Models) have been dominating the AI marketplace. But these are general-purpose AIs. They are expensive to create, they are massively data-hungry, and they are imprecise and not designed for specialized domains like medicine. In contrast, this new Active Inference AI-inspired by neuroscience-is designed specifically for medicine and other applications requiring high accuracy and explainable results. This new AI does not use LLM technology but relies on small, domain-specific models built from expert-curated knowledge graphs and factor graphs. This novel approach enables reasoning, learning, and decision-making within well-defined medical contexts, allowing for the precision, adaptability, and interpretability missing in LLMs. This report outlines how Active Inference AI can: (1) accelerate medical research by simulating hypotheses and causal pathways. (2) Enhance medical treatment through adaptive, real-time digital twins and precision diagnostics. (3) Revolutionize medical education by creating dynamic, interactive, and semantically accurate learning environments.},

In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative models that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox system to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a specific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of specifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as implementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile, breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed of Bayesian agents.},

From the wider view of `probabilistic numerics', CaI offers principled, numerically robust optimal control solvers that provide uncertainty quantification, and can scale to nonlinear problems with approximate inference.

  abstract={The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre-reflective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

  abstract={The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified Bayesian account of perception, learning and action. Despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition, emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework. A core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence, which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects. In the present paper, we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free-energy over time. If the second time-derivative of free-energy is taken into account, the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness, unhappiness, hope, fear, disappointment and relief can be explained. In this formulation, an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs. When sensations increasingly violate the agent's expectations, valence is negative and increases the learning rate. Conversely, when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent's expectations, valence is positive and decreases the learning rate. This dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents' adaptation to unexpected changes in their world.},

  abstract={This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.},

IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.},

  abstract={


Several authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems and Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of changes in variable and parameter sets, constraints, and in the dynamical laws affecting the system. This allows enaction to address the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that these ideas are incompatible with the time invariance of non-equilibrium steady states assumed by the FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development. We argue that this view of transactional and constitutive relations between organisms and environments is a challenge to the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that far from being easily integrated, the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is in tension with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.

  abstract={In this paper, we argue for a theoretical separation of the free-energy principle from Helmholtzian accounts of the predictive brain. The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.},

  abstract={Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.},

  abstract={Neural complexity and brain entropy (BEN) have gained greater interest in recent years. The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The BEN of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.},

Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.},

  abstract={We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences from newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the “Markov blanket” proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument, which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.},

  abstract={Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.},

Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account’s intuitive simplicity—which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin—it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.},

Critically, these frameworks invoke diverse—and potentially mutually inconsistent—interpretations of the role allostasis plays in the scheme of biological regulation. This chapter argues in favor of a moderate, reconciliatory position in which homeostasis and allostasis are conceived as equally vital (but functionally distinct) modes of physiological control. It explores the implications of this interpretation for free energy-based accounts of interoceptive inference, advocating a similarly complementary (and hierarchical) view of homeostatic and allostatic processing.},

  abstract={A theory of self-organization in the central nervous system is described, proposing that additive and dissipative synaptodendritic summation leads to synchronous oscillation as the equilibrium state, thereby underpinning a primary mechanism of prediction error minimization. As a consequence, synaptic connections become arranged in mirror-symmetric paired patterns, wherein exchanges of synaptic flux within each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes. The mirror-reflection axis between each pair functions as a Markov blanket that maintains excitatory-inhibitory equilibrium, while multiway exchanges among mirror pairs converge toward overall error minimization and mutual organization. The primary organization of this type is evident in the spinal cord. During cortical embryogenesis, connections develop in topographies interpretable as mirror reflections with broken symmetry, aligning along the radial and circumferential axes of cortical growth, as described by the Structural Model, and subsequently manifest at the millimetric scale throughout the cortex. The proposed framework integrates a diverse range of experimental data and provides an explanatory basis for how generative models with agency can emerge through both species evolution and individual learning.},

The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between the high-level cortex, the low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal phenomena. We conclude by discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research.

By de novo learning, we mean discovering, directly from observations, the structure and parameters of a discrete generative model for sequential policy optimisation. Concretely, our procedure grows and then reduces a model until it discovers a pullback attractor over (generalised) states; this attracting set supplies paths of least action among goal states while avoiding costly states. The implicit efficiency rests upon reframing the learning problem through the lens of the free energy principle, under which it is sufficient to learn a generative model whose dynamics feature such an attracting set. For context, we briefly relate this perspective to value-based formulations (e.g., Bellman optimality) and then apply the active inference formulation to a small arcade game to illustrate de novo structure learning and ensuing agency.},

  abstract={In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we build upon these techniques. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Active Intersubjective Inference (AISI), a novel framework that integrates psychodynamic theory with predictive processing to explain self-identity construction and psychopathology. AISI posits that the self emerges from recursive inferences about how others perceive us (second-order self), interacting bidirectionally with interoceptive processes. We map psychodynamic phenomena (e.g., transference, projection) onto neurocomputational mechanisms and apply AISI to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), highlighting distorted second-order inference as a core dysfunction. Therapeutic implications include psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and psychedelic-assisted treatments to enhance inference flexibility. AISI bridges psychodynamic insights with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria, offering a testable model for precision psychiatry and future clinical trials.},

  abstract={Active inference offers a unified framework in which agents can exhibit both goal-directed and epistemic behaviors. However, implementing policy search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces presents challenges in terms of scalability and stability. Our previously proposed model, T-GLean, addressed this issue by enabling efficient goal-directed planning through low-dimensional latent space search, further reduced by conditioning on prior habituated behavior. However, the lack of an epistemic term in minimizing expected free energy limited the agent's ability to engage in information-seeking behavior that can be critical for attaining preferred outcomes. In this study, we present EFE-GLean, an extended version of T-GLean that overcomes this limitation by integrating epistemic value into the planning process. EFE-GLean generates goal-directed policies by inferring low-dimensional future posterior trajectories while maximizing expected information gain. Simulation experiments using an extended T-maze task-implemented in both discrete and continuous domains-demonstrate that the agent can successfully achieve its goals by exploiting hidden environmental information. Furthermore, we show that the agent is capable of adapting to abrupt environmental changes by dynamically revising plans through simultaneous minimization of past variational free energy and future expected free energy. Finally, analytical evaluations detail the underlying mechanisms and computational properties of the model.},

  abstract={We examine the neurobiology of intuition, a term often inconsistently defined in scientific literature. While researchers generally agree that intuition represents "an experienced-based process resulting in a spontaneous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis," we establish a firmer neurobiological foundation by framing intuition evolutionarily as a pathfinding mechanism emerging from the brain's optimization of its relationship with the environment. Our review synthesizes empirical findings on intuition's neurobiological basis, including relevant brain networks and their relationship to cognitive states like insight. We propose that unsolved problems dynamically alter attractor landscapes, guiding future intuitions. We investigate "opportunistic assimilation" through nonlinear neurodynamics and identify hippocampal sharp wave ripples as potential neural correlates of intuition, citing their role in creativity, choice, action planning, and abstract thinking. Finally, we explore intuition through two complementary perspectives: the free energy principle, which models brains as minimizing uncertainty through predictive hierarchical coding, and metastable coordination dynamics, describing the brain's simultaneous tendencies toward regional cooperation and functional autonomy. Together, these principles provide a comprehensive neurodynamical account of intuition's neurophenomenology.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40704439},
  abstract={In active inference, the sensory surprisal (a log-probability of sensory data) of the prediction error between prediction and sensory input is modulated by action. The urge to move (groove) induced by syncopation, which provides metric uncertainty, can be considered a case of active inference in music perception. The present study investigated whether rhythmic prediction error is modulated by improving the precision of rhythm perception through tapping in sync with the rhythm. Thirty-five participants listened to a rhythmic sequence while tapping the half-note beat (tapping condition) or holding a pillow (no-tapping condition), and electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In both conditions, the onset of the syncopated tone was rarely earlier (timing deviant: 20%) than the standard (80%). The timing deviant elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in both the tapping and no-tapping conditions, reflecting a prediction error in timing. Moreover, the MMN was larger in the tapping condition than in the no-tapping condition, which may indicate increased precision due to tapping, even when motor-related potentials were controlled for. Neural entrainment was measured by calculating intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), which reflects oscillatory activity synchronized to stimulus frequency, and ITPC differed between the two conditions at beat-related frequencies. These results suggest that tapping enhanced meter and beat information and reduced the sensory surprisal of syncopation, resulting in a larger precision-weighted prediction error. These effects were not due to physiological arousal differences between conditions, as assessed by EEG power and heart rate variability. These results are discussed as evidence that bodily engagement modulates sensory prediction error within the active inference framework.},

  abstract={Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability-key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.},

  author={Hideyoshi Yanagisawa and Shimon Honda},
  year={2025},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40432794},
  abstract={Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel formulation of these emotions using two types of information gain derived from the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), representing free energy reduction through recognition, and Bayesian surprise (BS), representing free energy reduction via Bayesian updating. Conventional Gaussian models predict an infinite divergence in information gain (KLD and BS) as prediction error increases, which contradicts the known limits of human cognitive resources. The key novelty of this study lies in a simple yet impactful modification: incorporating a uniform distribution into the Gaussian likelihood function to model neural activity under conditions of large prediction error. This modification yields an inverted U-shaped relationship between prediction error and both KLD and BS, producing a finite peak in information gain that better reflects cognitive realism. Based on this convexity, we propose that alternating the maximization of BS and KLD generates an ideal inquiry cycle that fluctuates around an optimal arousal level, with curiosity and interest driving this process. We further analyze how prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) affect the peak of information gain. The results suggest that greater prediction uncertainty (reflecting open-mindedness) and lower observation uncertainty (indicating focused observation) promote higher information gains through broader exploration. This mathematical framework integrates the brain's free energy principle with arousal potential theory, providing a unified explanation of the Wundt curve as an information gain function and proposing an ideal inquiry process driven by epistemic emotions.},

  abstract={Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multi-label learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.},

  abstract={Within a theoretical framework of enactive allostasis, we explore active inference strategies for minimizing surprise to achieve resilience in dynamic environments. While individual differences and extrinsic protective factors traditionally account for variability in resilience trajectories following stressor exposure, the enactive model emphasizes the importance of the physical and social environment, specifically the "enactive niche," which is both shaped by and impacts organisms living in it, accounting for variable success in allostatic prediction and accommodation. Enactive allostasis infers or predicts states of the world to minimize surprise and maintain regulation after surprise, i.e., resilience. Action policies are selected in accordance with the inferred state of a dynamic environment; those actions concurrently shape one's environment, buffering against current and potential stressors. Through such inferential construction, multiple potential solutions exist for achieving stability within one's enactive niche. Spanning a range of adaptive resilience strategies, we propose four phenotypes-fragile, durable, resilient, and pro-entropic (PE)-each characterized by a constellation of genetic, epigenetic, developmental, experiential, and environmental factors. Biological regulatory outcomes range from allostatic (over)load in the fragile and durable phenotypes, to allostatic recovery in resilience, and theoretically to increasing allostatic accommodation or "growth" in the proposed PE phenotype. Awareness distinguishes phenotypes by minimizing allostatically demanding surprise and engenders the cognitive and behavioral flexibility empirically associated with resilience. We further propose a role for awareness in proactively shaping one's enactive niche to further minimize surprise. We conclude by exploring the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity which may bolster individual resilience.},

Crucially, a collective of active inference agents can, if they maintain a group-level Markov blanket, constitute a larger group-level active inference agent with a generative model of its own. This potential for computational scale-free structures speaks to the application of active inference to self-organizing systems across spatiotemporal scales, from cells to human collectives. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the generative model that explains the behaviour of emergent group-level agents, there has been little research on this kind of multi-scale active inference. Here, we propose a data-driven methodology for characterising the relation between the generative model of a group-level agent and the dynamics of its constituent individual agents. We apply methods from computational cognitive modelling and computational psychiatry, applicable for active inference as well as other types of modelling approaches. Using a simple Multi-Armed Bandit task as an example, we employ the new ActiveInference.jl library for Julia to simulate a collective of agents who are equipped with a Markov blanket. We use sampling-based parameter estimation to make inferences about the generative model of the group-level agent, and we show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the generative models of individual agents and the group-level agent they constitute, even in this simple setting. Finally, we point to a number of ways in which this methodology might be applied to better understand the relations between nested active inference agents across scales.},

  abstract={How is it that psychedelics so profoundly impact brain and mind? According to the model of "Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (REBUS), 5-HT2a agonism is thought to help relax prior expectations, thus making room for new perspectives and patterns. Here, we introduce an alternative (but largely compatible) perspective, proposing that REBUS effects may primarily correspond to a particular (but potentially pivotal) regime of very high levels of 5-HT2a receptor agonism. Depending on both a variety of contextual factors and the specific neural systems being considered, we suggest opposite effects may also occur in which synchronous neural activity becomes more powerful, with accompanying "Strengthened Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (SEBUS) effects. Such SEBUS effects are consistent with the enhanced meaning-making observed in psychedelic therapy (e.g. psychological insight and the noetic quality of mystical experiences), with the imposition of prior expectations on perception (e.g. hallucinations and pareidolia), and with the delusional thinking that sometimes occurs during psychedelic experiences (e.g. apophenia, paranoia, engendering of inaccurate interpretations of events, and potentially false memories). With "Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (ALBUS), we propose that the manifestation of SEBUS vs. REBUS effects may vary across the dose-response curve of 5-HT2a signaling. While we explore a diverse range of sometimes complex models, our basic idea is fundamentally simple: psychedelic experiences can be understood as kinds of waking dream states of varying degrees of lucidity, with similar underlying mechanisms. We further demonstrate the utility of ALBUS by providing neurophenomenological models of psychedelics focusing on mechanisms of conscious perceptual synthesis, dreaming, and episodic memory and mental simulation.},

  abstract={This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as w, the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in w during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of w of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both ws were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one w was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both ws were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating w in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of ws. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies.},

In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.},

  abstract={According to the free energy principle, life is an “inevitable and emergent property of any (ergodic) random dynamical system at non-equilibrium steady state that possesses a Markov blanket” (Friston in J R Soc Interface 10(86):20130475, 2013). Formulating a principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergodicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of biological systems. Thus far, however, the physics foundations of the free energy principle have received hardly any attention. Here, we start to fill this gap and analyse some of the challenges raised by applications of statistical physics for modelling biological targets. Based on our analysis, we conclude that model-building grounded in the free energy principle exacerbates a trade-off between generality and realism, because of a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the properties of actual biological targets.},

  abstract={Translation process research (TPR) has generated a large number of models that aim at explaining human translation processes. In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.},

  abstract={Drawing from field theory, Gestalt therapy conceives psychological suffering and psychotherapy as two intentional field phenomena, where unprocessed and chaotic experiences seek the opportunity to emerge and be assimilated through the contact between the patient and the therapist (i.e., the intentionality of contacting). This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.},

  abstract={Entropy management, central to the Free Energy Principle, requires a process that temporarily shifts brain activity toward states of lower or higher entropy. Metastable synchronization is a process by which a system achieves entropy fluctuations by intermittently transitioning between states of collective order and disorder. Previous work has shown that collective oscillations, similar to those recorded from the brain, emerge spontaneously from weakly stable synchronization in critically coupled oscillator systems. However, direct evidence linking the formation of collective oscillations to entropy fluctuations is lacking. In this short communication, we demonstrate how the emergence of Metastable Oscillatory Modes (MOMs) is directly associated with a temporary reduction in entropy in the ongoing dynamics. We apply Shannon entropy to the distribution of eigenvalues of phase covariance over sliding time windows, capturing the temporal evolution of entropy at the level of the entire dynamical system. By demonstrating how the formation of MOMs impacts a system's entropy levels, we bridge theoretical works on the physics of coupled oscillators with the FEP framework, supporting the hypothesis that brain rhythms recorded experimentally are a signature of entropy management.},

  abstract={After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practitioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes. However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test-retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with an ensuing increase in test-retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.},

In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.},

Evolution of a neural field with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, maximizing synchrony and minimizing axonal length by apoptotic selection, leads to paired connection systems with mirror symmetry, interacting via Markov blankets along their line of reflection. Applied to development along the radial lines of development in the Structural Model, a primary Markov blanket emerges between the centrifugal synaptic flux in layers 2,3 and 5,6, versus the centripetal flow in layer 4, and axonal orientations in layer 4 give rise to the differing shape and movement sensitivities characteristic of neurons of dorsal and ventral neocortex. Prediction error minimization along the primary blanket integrates limbic and subcortical networks with the neocortex. Synaptic flux bypassing the blanket triggers the arousal response to surprising stimuli, enabling subsequent adaptation. As development progresses ubiquitous mirror systems separated by Markov blankets and enclosed blankets-within-blankets arise throughout neocortex, creating the typical order and response characteristics of columnar and noncolumnar cortex.},

The aim of this treatment is to consider the extent to which active inference has informed theoretical progress in psychology, before exploring its contributions to our understanding and treatment of psychopathology. Despite facing persistent translational obstacles, progress suggests that active inference has the potential to become a new paradigm that promises to unite psychology's subdisciplines, while readily incorporating the traditionally competing paradigms of evolutionary and developmental psychology. To date, however, progress towards this end has been slow. Meanwhile, the main outstanding question is whether this theory will make a positive difference through applications in clinical psychology, and its sister discipline of psychiatry.},

In this article, we aim to clarify the nature of the relationship between the two principles by investigating the two most likely interpretations of the claims that can be found in the subject literature. According to the strong interpretation, the two principles are equivalent and apply to the same subset of physical phenomena; according to the weak interpretation, the two principles are merely analogous to each other by virtue of their similar formal structures.

The dynamic behavior of this network is informed by the knowledge obtained from experiments on telencephalic evolution.

  abstract={The human need to find meaning in life and the human need for connection may be two sides of the same coin, a coin forged in the developmental crucible of attachment. Our need for meaningfulness can be traced to our developmental need for connection in the attachment relationship. The free energy principle dictates that in order to resist a natural tendency towards disorder self-organizing systems must generate models that predict the hidden causes of phenomenal experience. In other words, they must make sense of things. In both an evolutionary and ontogenetic sense, the narrative self develops as a model that makes sense of experience. However, the self-model skews the interpretation of experience towards that which is predictable, or already "known." One may say it causes us to "take things personally." Meaning is felt more acutely when defenses are compromised, when the narrative self is offline. This enables meaning-making that is less egocentrically motivated. Dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic states offer glimpses of how we make sense of things absent a coherent narrative self. This has implications for the way we understand such states, and lays bare the powerful reach of attachment in shaping what we experience as meaningful.},

  abstract={Tourette syndrome (TS) has been associated with a rich set of symptoms that are said to be uncomfortable, unwilled, and effortful to manage. Furthermore, tics, the canonical characteristic of TS, are multifaceted, and their onset and maintenance is complex. A formal account that integrates these features of TS symptomatology within a plausible theoretical framework is currently absent from the field. In this paper, we assess the explanatory power of hierarchical generative modelling in accounting for TS symptomatology from the perspective of active inference. We propose a fourfold analysis of sensory, motor, and cognitive phenomena associated with TS. In Section 1, we characterise tics as a form of action aimed at sensory attenuation. In Section 2, we introduce the notion of epistemic ticcing and describe such behaviour as the search for evidence that there is an agent (i.e., self) at the heart of the generative hierarchy. In Section 3, we characterise both epistemic (sensation-free) and nonepistemic (sensational) tics as habitual behaviour. Finally, in Section 4, we propose that ticcing behaviour involves an inevitable conflict between distinguishable aspects of selfhood; namely, between the minimal phenomenal sense of self-which is putatively underwritten by interoceptive inference-and the explicit preferences that constitute the individual's conceptual sense of self. In sum, we aim to provide an empirically informed analysis of TS symptomatology under active inference, revealing a continuity between covert and overt features of the condition.},

  abstract={A theoretical account of development in mesocortical anatomy is derived from the free energy principle, operating in a neural field with both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian neural plasticity. An elementary structural unit is proposed, in which synaptic connections at mesoscale are arranged in paired patterns with mirror symmetry. Exchanges of synaptic flux in each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes, and the line of mirror reflection between the paired patterns operates as a Markov blanket, so that prediction errors in exchanges between the pairs are minimized. The theoretical analysis is then compared to the outcomes from a biological model of neocortical development, in which neuron precursors are selected by apoptosis for cell body and synaptic connections maximizing synchrony and also minimizing axonal length. It is shown that this model results in patterns of connection with the anticipated mirror symmetries, at micro-, meso- and inter-arial scales, among lateral connections, and in cortical depth.

  abstract={The ideas of self-observation and self-representation, and the concomitant idea of self-control, pervade both the cognitive and life sciences, arising in domains as diverse as immunology and robotics. Here, we ask in a very general way whether, and to what extent, these ideas make sense. Using a generic model of physical interactions, we prove a theorem and several corollaries that severely restrict applicable notions of self-observation, self-representation, and self-control. We show, in particular, that adding observational, representational, or control capabilities to a meta-level component of a system cannot, even in principle, lead to a complete meta-level representation of the system as a whole. We conclude that self-representation can at best be heuristic, and that self models cannot, in general, be empirically tested by the systems that implement them.},

  abstract={In the realm of law enforcement, the "police hunch" has long been a mysterious but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that hunches - often vital in high-stakes situations - should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind's generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.},

  abstract={Cerebellar computations are necessary for fine behavioural control and may rely on internal models for estimation of behaviourally relevant states. Here, we propose that the central cerebellar function is to estimate how states interact with each other, and to use these estimates to coordinates extra-cerebellar neuronal dynamics underpinning a range of interconnected behaviours. To support this claim, we describe a cerebellar model for state estimation that includes state interactions, and link this model with the neuronal architecture and dynamics observed empirically. This is formalised using the free energy principle, which provides a dual perspective on a system in terms of both the dynamics of its physical-in this case neuronal-states, and the inferential process they entail. As a demonstration of this proposal, we simulate cerebellar-dependent synchronisation of whisking and respiration, which are known to be tightly coupled in rodents, as well as limb and tail coordination during locomotion. In summary, we propose that the ubiquitous involvement of the cerebellum in behaviour arises from its central role in precisely coupling behavioural domains.},

  year={2024},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38322807},
  abstract={Active inference (AIF) is a theory of the behavior of information-processing open dynamic systems. It describes them as generative models (GM) generating inferences on the causes of sensory input they receive from their environment. Based on these inferences, GMs generate predictions about sensory input. The discrepancy between a prediction and the actual input results in prediction error. GMs then execute action policies predicted to minimize the prediction error. The free-energy principle provides a rationale for AIF by stipulating that information-processing open systems must constantly minimize their free energy (through suppressing the cumulative prediction error) to avoid decay. The theory of homeostasis and allostasis has a similar logic. Homeostatic set points are expectations of living organisms. Discrepancies between set points and actual states generate stress. For optimal functioning, organisms avoid stress by preserving homeostasis. Theories of AIF and homeostasis have recently converged, with AIF providing a formal account for homeo- and allostasis. In this paper, we present bacterial chemotaxis as molecular AIF, where mutual constraints by extero- and interoception play an essential role in controlling bacterial behavior supporting homeostasis. Extending this insight to the brain, we propose a conceptual model of the brain homeostatic GM, in which we suggest partition of the brain GM into },

  abstract={Blind source separation is the computation underlying the cocktail party effect––a partygoer can distinguish a particular talker’s voice from the ambient noise. Early studies indicated that the brain might use blind source separation as a signal processing strategy for sensory perception and numerous mathematical models have been proposed; however, it remains unclear how the neural networks extract particular sources from a complex mixture of inputs. We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation. Moreover, the neural network structures changed to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free-energy principle, a candidate unified theory of learning and memory, and by Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy. This implicit learning can only be explained by some form of Hebbian plasticity. These results are the first in vitro (as opposed to in silico) demonstration of neural networks performing blind source separation, and the first formal demonstration of neuronal self-organization under the free energy principle.},

  abstract={It appears that the free energy minimization principle conflicts with quantum cognition since the former adheres to a restricted view based on experience while the latter allows deviations from such a restricted view. While free energy minimization, which incorporates Bayesian inference, leads to a Boolean lattice of propositions (classical logic), quantum cognition, which seems to be very dissimilar to Bayesian inference, leads to an orthomodular lattice of propositions (quantum logic). Thus, we address this challenging issue to bridge and connect the free energy minimization principle with the theory of quantum cognition. In this work, we introduce “excess Bayesian inference” and show that this excess Bayesian inference entails an underlying orthomodular lattice, while classic Bayesian inference entails a Boolean lattice. Excess Bayesian inference is implemented by extending the key idea of Bayesian inference beyond classic Bayesian inference and its variations. It is constructed by enhancing the idea of active inference and/or embodied intelligence. The appropriate lattice structure of its logic is obtained from a binary relation transformed from a distribution of the joint probabilities of data and hypotheses by employing a rough-set lattice technique in accordance with quantum cognition logic.},

The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.},

  abstract={The issue of the relationship between predictive processing (PP) and the free energy principle (FEP) remains a subject of debate and controversy within the research community. Many researchers have expressed doubts regarding the actual integration of PP with the FEP, questioning whether the FEP can truly contribute significantly to the mechanistic understanding of PP or even undermine such integration altogether. In this paper, I present an alternative perspective. I argue that, from the viewpoint of the constraint-based mechanisms approach, the FEP imposes an important constraint, namely variational free energy, on the mechanistic architecture proposed by PP. According to the constraint-based mechanisms approach, high-level cognitive mechanisms are integral parts of extensive heterarchical networks that govern the physiology and behavior of agents. Consequently, mechanistic explanations of cognitive phenomena should incorporate constraints and flows of free energy as relevant components, given that the implemented constraints operate as long as free energy is available. Within this framework, I contend that the FEP provides a relevant constraint for explaining at least some biological cognitive mechanisms described in terms of Bayesian generative models that minimize prediction errors.},

  abstract={BackgroundReduced inhibitory control is associated with obesity and neuroimaging studies indicate that diminished prefrontal cortex activity influence eating behavior and metabolism. The hypothalamus regulates energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to cortical and subcortical regions especially the frontal areas.

ObjectivesWe tested network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in appetite control.

MethodsIn a randomized, double-blind parallel group design, 44 adults with overweight or obesity (BMI 30.6 kg/m2, 52.3 % female) received active (anodal or cathodal) or sham 12-channel net-tDCS on the hypothalamus appetite-control network for 25 minutes on three consecutive days while performing a Stop-Signal-Task to measure response inhibition. Before and after stimulation, state questionnaires assessed changes in desire to eat and food craving. Directly after stimulation, participants received a breakfast buffet to evaluate ad-libitum food intake. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted at follow-up. Resting-state functional MRI was obtained at baseline and follow-up.

ResultsThe Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) was shorter in both active groups versus sham, indicating improved response inhibition. Additionally, a stronger increase in hypothalamic functional connectivity was associated with shorter SSRT. Caloric intake of sweet food was lower in the anodal group versus sham, but no main effects between groups were observed on total and macronutrient intake, food craving ratings and desire to eat. At follow-up, no differences were observed between groups on peripheral metabolism.

ConclusionOur study suggests that modulating hypothalamic functional network connectivity patterns via net-tDCS may improve food choice and inhibitory control.

  abstract={Predictive processing theories are increasingly popular in philosophy of mind; such process theories often gain support from the Free Energy Principle (FEP)—a normative principle for adaptive self-organized systems. Yet there is a current and much discussed debate about conflicting philosophical interpretations of FEP, e.g., representational versus non-representational. Here we argue that these different interpretations depend on implicit assumptions about what qualifies (or fails to qualify) as representational. We deploy the Free Energy Principle (FEP) instrumentally to distinguish four main notions of representation, which focus on organizational, structural, content-related and functional aspects, respectively. The various ways that these different aspects matter in arriving at representational or non-representational interpretations of the Free Energy Principle are discussed. We also discuss how the Free Energy Principle may be seen as a unified view where terms that traditionally belong to different ontologies—e.g., notions of model and expectation versus notions of autopoiesis and synchronization—can be harmonized. However, rather than attempting to settle the representationalist versus non-representationalist debate and reveal something about what representations are simpliciter, this paper demonstrates how the Free Energy Principle may be used to reveal something about those partaking in the debate; namely, what our hidden assumptions about what representations are—assumptions that act as sometimes antithetical starting points in this persistent philosophical debate.},

Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.},

A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities.

  abstract={Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.},

  abstract={The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between Φ and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of Φ during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.},

Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12654v1},
  abstract={In this paper we show how The Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing. We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks.},

  author={Chaoran Wang and Jingyuan Sun and Yanhui Zhang and Changju Wu},
  year={2025},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04404v1},
  abstract={This paper proposes an Interactive Inference Behavior Tree (IIBT) framework that integrates behavior trees (BTs) with active inference under the free energy principle for distributed multi-robot decision-making. The proposed IIBT node extends conventional BTs with probabilistic reasoning, enabling online joint planning and execution across multiple robots. It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4). Experimental results demonstrate that the IIBT framework reduces BT node complexity by over 70%, while maintaining robust, interpretable, and adaptive cooperative behavior under environmental uncertainty.},

  abstract={Active Inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides a powerful lens for understanding how agents balance exploration and goal-directed behavior in uncertain environments. Here, we propose a new planning framework, that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS already renowned for its search efficiency can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both standalone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.},

  abstract={Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.},

  abstract={We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.},

  abstract={Autonomous AI systems reveal foundational limitations in deterministic, human-authored computing architectures. This paper presents Cognitive Silicon: a hypothetical full-stack architectural framework projected toward 2035, exploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design. The proposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory, runtime moral coherence, and alignment-aware execution across silicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would establish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints, non-copyable tacit knowledge, and non-cloneable identity keys as cognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency, scaffolding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central architectural pressures rather than edge cases. The architecture theoretically converges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account of how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error minimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting framework aims to deliver a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that could maintain human-alignment through irreversible hardware constraints and identity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11075v2},
  abstract={Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory stimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the "self-prior," and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated behavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.},

  abstract={In this paper I propose a model of the fundamental components of psychoanalytic psychotherapies that I try to explicate with contemporary theories of the Bayesian brain and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). I first show that psychoanalytic therapies require a setting (made up of several envelopes), a particular psychic state and specific processes (transference, free association, dreaming, play, reflexivity and narrativity) in order to induce psychic transformations. I then analyze how these processes of transformations operate and how they can be enlightened by the FEP. I first underline the fact that psychoanalytic therapies imply non-linear processes taking time to unfold and require a setting containing high entropy processes. More precisely, these processes are characterized by an interplay between extension and reduction of free energy. This interplay also favors the emergence of new orders of subjective experience, which occur following states of disorder, according to a certain energetic threshold allowing the modification and improvement of mental functioning. These high entropy states are also characterized by random functioning and psychic malleability which favors the exploration of subjective experience in an original manner. Overall, the approach proposed in this paper support the dialogue between psychoanalysis and other fields of research while underlining how psychoanalytical theoretical and conceptual constructs can also be useful to other disciplines, in particular the neurosciences of subjectivity.},

  abstract={How can the free energy principle contribute to research on neural correlates of consciousness, and to the scientific study of consciousness more generally? Under the free energy principle, neural correlates should be defined in terms of neural *dynamics*, not neural states, and should be complemented by the research on *computational* correlates of consciousness -- defined in terms of probabilities encoded by neural states.We argue that these restrictions brighten the prospects of a computational explanation of consciousness, by addressing two central problems. The first is to account for consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour. The second is to allow for the possibility of systems that implement computations associated with consciousness, without being conscious, which requires differentiating between computational systems that merely simulate conscious beings and computational systems that are conscious in and of themselves.Given the notion of computation entailed by the free energy principle, we will derive constraints on the ascription of consciousness in controversial cases (e.g., in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour). We show that this also has implications for what it means to *be*, as opposed to merely *simulate* a conscious system.},

  abstract={Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) principle based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle inherits the basic idea of Evolutionary System Theory. Still, it emphasizes the coordination between the brain, behavior, and the environment, promoting self-organization. However, there are two issues with VB and the MFE principle: 1) When using VB to optimize latent variables, the Variational Free Energy (VFE) F may not always decrease; 2) The concept of VFE is inconsistent with physical free energy. The author proposed the semantic information G theory and R(G) function 30 years ago (R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). Based on the study of the R(G) function, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle to resolve the two issues with VB and the MFE principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R–G = F-H(X|Y) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables. The experiments show that SVB is reliable and straightforward for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, and free energy in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon&#039;s information is similar to free energy&#039;s increment, semantic information is similar to exergy&#039;s increment, and VFE is equivalent to some physical entropy. The MIE principle inherits the basic idea of the MFE principle but is easier to understand and apply.},

  abstract={<p>Abstract with CitationsDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).In contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).I first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?</p>},

We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design—such as “minimal search” criteria from theoretical syntax—adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP—with respect to higher language functions—and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. While we mostly focus on building new principled conceptual relations between syntax and the FEP, we also show through a sample of preliminary examples how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.},

Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.},

The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.},

  author={Lingyu Li and Chunbo Li},
  year={2023},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06707v2},
  abstract={Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale. Expecting a digital twin mind from this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. In this article, we claim three fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and suggest a FEP approach to formalizing Lacan's theory. Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the systems' subsequent states. Additionally, the fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in Lacan's theory. With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a minimal definition of Lacanian mind - composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire running over the logical time. The FEP-RSI model involves three FEP units connected by respective free energy with a natural compliance with logical time, mimicking core dynamics of Lacanian mind. The biological plausibility of current model is considered from perspectives of cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, the FEP-RSI model encapsulates a unified framework for digital twin modeling at the macro level.},

  abstract={Humans and animals are not always rational. They not only rationally exploit rewards but also explore an environment owing to their curiosity. However, the mechanism of such curiosity-driven irrational behavior is largely unknown. Here, we developed a decision-making model for a two-choice task based on the free energy principle, which is a theory integrating recognition and action selection. The model describes irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We also proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the rat had negative curiosity, reflecting conservative selection sticking to more certain options and that the level of curiosity was upregulated by the expected future information obtained from an uncertain environment. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward-curiosity conflicts. Furthermore, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.},

However, the relationships between the free energy of nucleosomal DNA and its conformation, especially its topology, remain unclear in theory. By combining the Landau theory, the Hopfion model and experimental data, we find that the free energy of nucleosomal DNA is at the lower level. With the help of the energy minimum principle, we conclude that nucleosomal DNA stays in a stable state. Moreover, we discover that small perturbations on nucleosomal DNA have little effect on its free energy. This implies that nucleosomal DNA has a certain redundancy in order to stay stable. This explains why nucleosomal DNA will not change significantly due to small perturbations.},

  abstract={This paper incorporates schematic concepts related to mental inertia and provides an avenue for interpreting psychology using the principles of classical mechanics. Schemas find wide application in diverse fields, ranging from ergonomics to psychotherapy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to incorporate schemas themselves into a more unified and comprehensive theoretical framework. Drawing upon the free energy principle (FEP) and the second law of thermodynamics, it is evident that humans possess a natural inclination to construct and maintain consistent cognitive structures. This characteristic contributes to the stability of schemas within a defined range. The particular scope of the model is closely intertwined with its structure, leading to variations among individuals in diverse environments. The coherence of the schema within a defined range can be perceived as the magnitude of mental inertia. This psychological analogy emphasizes the importance of considering the influences exerted by the external environment and their effects on mental inertia when predicting the human mind and behavior.},

In order for the robot to learn from the human tutor, we propose a new scheme to accomplish incremental learning from these proprioceptive-exteroceptive experiences combined with mental rehearsal of past experiences. Our experimental results demonstrate that using only a few tutoring examples, the robot using our model was able to significantly improve its performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.},

To perceive any object in a world of non-diminishing (perhaps irreducible) uncertainty, according to the FEP, its constituent parts must display common probabilistic tendencies, known as statistical beliefs, prior to its interpretation, or active inference, as a stable entity. Behavioral bias, subjective emotions, and social norms scale the scope of identity by coalescing agents with otherwise disparate goals and aligning their perspectives into a coherent structure.

  abstract={The convergence of human and artificial intelligence is currently receiving considerable scholarly attention. Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study (Kagan et al., 2022b). In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37862364},
  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical approaches. The first aims to make a formal framework for describing self-organizing and life-like systems in general, and the second attempts a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior, the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potential for scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards such a synthesis by expanding on the results of an earlier published evolutionary simulation study, which show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We relate a basic information theoretic measure from the FEP, surprisal, to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents' observations is inversely related to the general increase in fitness and integration over evolutionary time. Moreover, surprisal fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures used in IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that it should therefore be possible to relate them to the theoretical concepts used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.},

  abstract={AbstractIn this paper, by means of a novel use of insights from the literature on scientific modelling, I will argue in favour of an instrumentalist approach to the models that are crucially involved in the study of adaptive systems within the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) framework. I will begin (§2) by offering a general, informal characterisation of FEP. Then (§3), I will argue that the models involved in FEP-theorising are plausibly intended to be isomorphic to their targets. This will allow (§4) to turn the criticisms moved against isomorphism-based accounts of representation towards the FEP modelling practice. Since failure to establish an isomorphism between model and target would result in the former’s failure to represent the latter, and given that it is highly unlikely that FEP-models are ever isomorphic to their targets, maintaining that FEP-models represent their targets as they are, in a realist sense, is unwarranted. Finally (§5), I will consider what implications my argument in favour of an instrumentalist reading of FEP-models has for attempts at making use of the FEP to elaborate an account of what cognition exactly is. My conclusion is that we should not dismiss FEP-based accounts of cognition, as they would still be informative and would further our understanding of the nature of cognition. Nonetheless, the prospects of settling the philosophical debates that sparked the interest in having a “mark of the cognitive” are not good.},

  abstract={Identifying appropriate structures for generative or world models is essential for both biological organisms and machines. This work shows that synaptic pruning facilitates efficient statistical structure learning. We extend previously established canonical neural networks to derive a synaptic pruning scheme that is formally equivalent to an online Bayesian model selection. The proposed scheme, termed Bayesian synaptic model pruning (BSyMP), utilizes connectivity parameters to switch between the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of synaptic connections. Mathematical analyses reveal that these parameters converge to zero for uninformative connections, thus providing reliable and efficient model reduction. This enables the identification of a plausible structure for the environmental model, particularly when the environment is characterized by sparse likelihood and transition matrices. Through causal inference and rule learning simulations, we demonstrate that BSyMP achieves model reduction more efficiently than the conventional Bayesian model reduction scheme. These findings indicate that synaptic pruning could be a neuronal substrate underlying structure learning and generalizability in the brain.},

  abstract={Many physical systems retain traces of their past, but living systems differ in that they use memory for anticipation. This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen's theory of anticipatory systems, Friston's free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen's "model" is the organized memory of a system. Memory-whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural-provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior. Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions direct chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism-environment interactions. In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.},

  abstract={A phylogenetic split ∼7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, from homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans gave rise to the mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the social arrangements of Pan were those of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that ∼4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats of homininan social units, each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan "zones of bounded surprisal" (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan "small-world" social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks; (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ∼4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at newly-formed localities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies there were hundreds of false dawns between ∼4 Ma and ∼40,000 BCE when even Homo neanderthalensis had vanished, leaving only our prehistoric Homo sapiens ancestors bearing "Homo informatio's" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive "zone of bounded surprisal" (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.},

Here, we propose a new planning framework that integrates Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS, already renowned for its search efficiency, can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the cross-entropy method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both stand-alone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.},

Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.},

There is, instead, substantial theoretical utility in viewing "objects" and "processes" as complementary ways of describing persistence through time, and hence the possibility of observation and manipulation. This way of thinking highlights the role of memory as an essential resource for observation, and makes it clear that "memory" and "time" are also mutually inter-defined, complementary concepts. We formulate our approach in terms of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) of Friston and colleagues and the fundamental idea from quantum theory that physical interactions can be represented by linear operators. Following Levin (2024) [30], we emphasize that memory is, first and foremost, an interpretative function, from which the idea of memory as a record, at some level of accuracy, of past events is derivative. We conclude that the distinction between objects and processes is always contrived, and always misleading, and that science would be better served by abandoning it entirely.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39873478},
  abstract={Computational neuropsychiatry is a leading discipline in explaining psychopathology in terms of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks. Active Inference (AI) is a way of representing this dysfunctional signal processing. According to the AI approach, all neuronal processing and action selection can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence or minimizing variational free energy. Following these principles, it has been suggested that dysconnection in neuronal networks results in aberrant belief updating and erroneous inference, leading to psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. However, there is a classic distinction between disorders of inference (or synaptopathy-including the majority of psychiatric disorders) and disorders of brain function (including vascular neurological pathologies and severe forms of tauopathy and synucleinopathies). This distinction is generally based on the idea that synaptopathies impair neuromodulatory precision weighting, leading to rigid inferences or heightened sensitivity to noise, while disorders of brain function are linked to damage in the nervous system (disconnection). This makes it challenging to apply the logic of the free energy principle. We suggest that this distinction will enable future models of neuropsychiatric symptoms to be improved by considering more than neuronal message passing.},

  abstract={Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.},

  abstract={Theory and simulations are used to demonstrate implementation of a variational Bayes algorithm called "active inference" in interacting arrays of nanomagnetic elements. The algorithm requires stochastic elements, and a simplified model based on a magnetic artificial spin ice geometry is used to illustrate how nanomagnets can generate the required random dynamics. Examples of tracking and PID control are demonstrated and shown to be consistent with the original stochastic differential equation formulation of active inference. Interestingly, nonlinear response in the form of spikes and spike trains not predicted by the original theory can appear in the nanomagnet system for certain temperature regimes. A theoretical approach using a mean-field approximation for spin systems is proposed, which describes the transition to nonlinear response. Finally, the possibility to create simple magnetic arrays using realistic models is shown with micromagnetic simulations of a simple 17 element array of nanomagnets that include magnetic anisotropies, and exchange and dipolar interactions. Possible applications are simulated to illustrate how nanomagnetic arrays can be used as the stochastic element for feedback control of processes, investigation and control of magnetic state evolution, and as a method to optimize pulsed field magnetic switching protocols.},

The FEP framework, grounded in concepts such as active inference and predictive coding, positions the brain as an anticipatory system that continuously updates internal models and guides actions to reduce uncertainty.

  abstract={Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.},

  abstract={People who habituate to stress show a repetition-induced response attenuation—neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, neuroenergetic, and emotional—when exposed to a threatening environment. But the exact dynamics underlying stress habituation remain obscure. The free energy principle offers a unifying account of self-organising systems such as the human brain. In this paper, we elaborate on how stress habituation can be explained and modelled using the free energy principle. We introduce habituation priors that encode the agent’s tendency for stress habituation and incorporate them in the agent’s decision-making process. Using differently shaped goal priors—that encode the agent’s goal preferences—we illustrate, in two examples, the optimising (and thus habituating) behaviour of agents. We show that habituation minimises free energy by reducing the precision (inverse variance) of goal preferences. Reducing the precision of goal priors means that the agent accepts adverse (previously unconscionable) states (e.g., lower social status and poverty). Acceptance or tolerance of adverse outcomes may explain why habituation causes people to exhibit an attenuation of the stress response. Given that stress habituation occurs in brain regions where goal priors are encoded, i.e., in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and that these priors are encoded as sufficient statistics of probability distributions, our approach seems plausible from an anatomical-functional and neuro-statistical point of view. The ensuing formal and generalisable account—based on the free energy principle—further motivate our novel treatment of stress habituation. Our analysis suggests that stress habituation has far-reaching consequences, protecting against the harmful effects of toxic stress, but on the other hand making the acceptability of precarious living conditions and the development of the obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype more likely.},

In this paper, we continue to finesse the FEP through the physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight change and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying the generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic plasticity in the brain with a simple model: we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.},

  abstract={The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns - next to more general scale-invariant effects of explicit timing and central tendency effects - the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11735v1},
  abstract={This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.},

  abstract={In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.},

Our simulation experiments demonstrated that autonomous shifts between focused perception and mind-wandering take place when $\mathbf{w}$ switches between low and high values associated with decrease and increase of the average reconstruction error over the past window.

Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.},

  abstract={Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.},

  abstract={This theoretical paper explores the affect-logic approach to schizophrenia in light of the general complexity theories of cognition: embodied cognition, Haken’s synergetics, and Friston’s free energy principle. According to affect-logic, the mental apparatus is an embodied system open to its environment, driven by bioenergetic inputs of emotions. Emotions are rooted in goal-directed embodied states selected by evolutionary pressure for coping with specific situations such as fight, flight, attachment, and others. According to synergetics, nonlinear bifurcations and the emergence of new global patterns occur in open systems when control parameters reach a critical level. Applied to the emergence of psychotic states, synergetics and the proposed energetic understanding of emotions lead to the hypothesis that critical levels of emotional tension may be responsible for the transition from normal to psychotic modes of functioning in vulnerable individuals. In addition, the free energy principle through learning suggests that psychotic symptoms correspond to alternative modes of minimizing free energy, which then entails distorted perceptions of the body, self, and reality. This synthetic formulation has implications for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies in the treatment of psychoses, among these are milieu-therapeutic approaches of the Soteria type that focus on a sustained reduction of emotional tension and phenomenologically oriented methods for improving the perception of body, self, and reality.},

  abstract={The retrospective noninterventional study investigated the kinetic energy of video images of 18 fertilized eggs (7 were normal and 11 were abnormal) recorded by a time-lapse device leading up to the beginning of the first cleavage. The norm values of cytoplasmic particles were measured by the optical flow method. Three phases profile for normal cases were found regarding the kinetic energy that were 2.199×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±2.076×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.369×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±1.255×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1.078×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±4.720×10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; (J) for the phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The kinetic energy change was considered a condition for applying the free energy principle that states that, for any self-organized system to be in equilibrium in its environment, it must minimize its informational free energy. The kinetic energy while interpreting it in terms of the free energy principle suggesting clinical usefulness would further our understanding of the phenomenon of fertilized egg development with respect to the birth of human life.},

  author={Mark Ashton Smith},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR830602},
  abstract={<p>This paper presents the Trident G Theory, a novel theoretical framework for understanding human intelligence. The theory takes a systems-level approach. It draws on principles of brain criticality, the Free Energy Principle, self-organisation and allostasis to explain how the brain achieves an optimal balance for information processing and adaptive behaviour.The brain's near-criticality allows for flexible, efficient information processing and enables rapid adaptation to changing environmental demands. Key concepts include metastability, where multiple cognitive states can co-exist, and the Free Energy Principle, which frames the brain's drive to minimise uncertainty and prediction error.The Trident G theory uniquely defines intelligence across two axes: processing/inference (vertical) and free energy (horizontal). The vertical axis represents the metastable balance between 'top-down' executive control and 'bottom-up' creative exploration. The horizontal axis reflects cognitive resilience across a spectrum of free energy and arousal, governed by dopaminergic tone. The brain's allostatic capacity to maintain criticality along both axes is hypothesized to define a dynamic range of general adaptive intelligence (G).The theory offers a novel perspective on the neural basis of intelligence, potentially informing the understanding of cognitive disorders and guiding the development of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive function and resilience across the lifespan.</p>},

  abstract={The visual quality of perceptions is highly correlated with the mechanisms of the human brain and visual system. Recently, the free-energy principle, which has been widely researched in brain theory and neuroscience, is introduced to quantize the perception, action, and learning in human brain. In the field of image quality assessment (IQA), on one hand, the free-energy principle can resort to the internal generative model to simulate the visual stimulus of the human beings. On the other hand, abundant psychological and neurobiological studies reveal that different frequency and orientation components of one visual stimulus arouse different neurons in the striate cortex, and the striate cortex processes visual information in the cerebral cortex. Motivated by these two aspects, a novel reduce-reference IQA metric called the multi-channel free-energy based reduced-reference quality metric is proposed in this paper. First, a two-level discrete Haar wavelet transform is used to decompose the input reference and distorted images. Next, to simulate the generative model in the human brain, the sparse representation is leveraged to extract the free-energy-based features in subband images. Finally, the overall quality metric is obtained through the support vector regressor. Extensive experimental comparisons on four benchmark image quality databases (LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013) demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with the representative reduced-reference and classical full-reference models.},

  abstract={In this paper, I argue that enactivism and computationalism—two seemingly incompatible research traditions in modern cognitive science—can be fruitfully reconciled under the framework of the free energy principle (FEP). FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.},

  abstract={Cybernetics is the study of goal-directed systems that self-regulate via feedback, a category that includes human beings. Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) attempts to explain personality in cybernetic terms, conceptualizing personality traits as manifestations of variation in parameters of the neural mechanisms that evolved to facilitate cybernetic control. The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework (FEP-AI) is an overarching approach for understanding how it is that complex systems manage to persist in a world governed by the second law of thermodynamics—the inevitable tendency toward entropy. Although these two cybernetic theories were developed independently, they overlap in their theoretical foundations and implications and are complementary in their approaches to understanding persons. FEP-AI contributes a potentially valuable formal modeling framework for CB5T, while CB5T provides detail about the science and structure of personality. In this chapter we explore how CB5T and FEP-AI may begin to be integrated into a unified approach to modeling persons.},

  abstract={The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.},

  abstract={This paper provides a concise description of the free energy principle, starting from a formulation of random dynamical systems in terms of a Langevin equation and ending with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentience. It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely coupled stochastic differential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities are claimed--in previous FEP literature--to have a Markov blanket. The authors demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets in the case of Gaussian steady-state densities. We precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads--or does not lead--to Markov blankets. Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of constraints are satisfied in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.},

  abstract={In this commentary, I expand on the analysis of the recent article "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera et al. by studying the flow fields of linear diffusions, and particularly the rotation of their attracting sets in the presence of different types of solenoidal coupling. This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I express general agreement with the target article's statement that the marginal flow of internal states does not point along variational free energy gradients evaluated at the most likely internal state (i.e., the conditional mode). However, in this commentary I focus on the flow of particular states (internal and blanket states) and their variational free energy gradients, and show that for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of these systems point along variational free energy gradients. This licenses a different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular states as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state space, not just at the conditional modes.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e., into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials, and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e., on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e., path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.},

Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., 2023) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message-passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.},

  abstract={Associative learning is a behavioral phenomenon in which individuals develop connections between stimuli or events based on their co-occurrence. Initially studied by Pavlov in his conditioning experiments, the fundamental principles of learning have been expanded on through the discovery of a wide range of learning phenomena. Computational models have been developed based on the concept of minimizing reward prediction errors. The Rescorla-Wagner model, in particular, is a well-known model that has greatly influenced the field of reinforcement learning. However, the simplicity of these models restricts their ability to fully explain the diverse range of behavioral phenomena associated with learning. In this study, we adopt the free energy principle, which suggests that living systems strive to minimize surprise or uncertainty under their internal models of the world. We consider the learning process as the minimization of free energy and investigate its relationship with the Rescorla-Wagner model, focusing on the informational aspects of learning, different types of surprise, and prediction errors based on beliefs and values. Furthermore, we explore how well-known behavioral phenomena such as blocking, overshadowing, and latent inhibition can be modeled within the active inference framework. We accomplish this by using the informational and novelty aspects of attention, which share similar ideas proposed by seemingly contradictory models such as Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models. Thus, we demonstrate that the free energy principle, as a theoretical framework derived from first principles, can integrate the ideas and models of associative learning proposed based on empirical experiments and serve as a framework for a better understanding of the computational processes behind associative learning in the brain.},

We propose that the therapist can facilitate this process by cultivating epistemic trust and modulating embodied attention to allow surprising affective states to enter shared awareness. Transient increases in free energy enable the update of generative models, expanding the range of experiences available within the patient-therapist phenomenal field. We hypothesize that patterns of disorganization at behavioural and physiological levels, indexed by increased entropy, complexity, and lower determinism, are key markers and predictors of psychotherapeutic gains. Future research should investigate how the therapist's openness to novelty shapes therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract={A resurgence of panpsychism and dualism is a matter of ongoing debate in modern neuroscience. Although metaphysically hostile, panpsychism and dualism both persist in the science of consciousness because the former is proposed as a straightforward answer to the problem of integrating consciousness into the fabric of physical reality, whereas the latter proposes a simple solution to the problem of free will by endowing consciousness with causal power as a prerequisite for moral responsibility. I take the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) as a paradigmatic exemplar of a theory of consciousness (ToC) that makes its commitments to panpsychism and dualism within a unified framework. These features are not, however, unique for IIT. Many ToCs are implicitly prone to some degree of panpsychism whenever they strive to propose a universal definition of consciousness, associated with one or another known phenomenon. Yet, those ToCs that can be characterized as strongly emergent are at risk of being dualist. A remedy against both covert dualism and uncomfortable corollaries of panpsychism can be found in the evolutionary theory of life, called here "bioprotopsychism" and generalized in terms of autopoiesis and the free energy principle. Bioprotopsychism provides a biologically inspired basis for a minimalist approach to consciousness via the triad "chemotaxis-efference copy mechanism-counterfactual active inference" by associating the stream of weakly emergent conscious states with an amount of information (best guesses) of the brain, engaged in unconscious predictive processing.},

  year={2024},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39106455},
  abstract={In reinforcement learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well established in the literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the free energy principle (FEP), this letter proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find that entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP that may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.},

It first discusses three symmetries of generic physical interactions in a quantum-theoretic description. It then shows that if one of these, a permutation symmetry on the inter-system boundary, is spontaneously broken, the symmetry breaking is amplified by the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It thus shows how compartmentalization generically results from permutation symmetry breaking under the FEP. It finally notes that the FEP asymptotically restores the broken symmetry, showing that the FEP can be regarded as a theory of fluctuations away from a permutation-symmetric boundary, and hence from an entangled joint state of the interacting systems.},

  abstract={The applicability of computational and dynamical systems models to organisms is scrutinized, using examples from developmental biology and cognition. Developmental morphogenesis is dependent on the inherent material properties of developing animal (metazoan) tissues, a non-computational modality, but cell differentiation, which utilizes chromatin-based revisable memory banks and program-like function-calling, via the developmental gene co-expression system unique to the metazoans, has a quasi-computational basis. Multi-attractor dynamical models are argued to be misapplied to global properties of development, and it is suggested that along with computationalism, classic forms of dynamicism are similarly unsuitable to accounting for cognitive phenomena. Proposals are made for treating brains and other nervous tissues as novel forms of excitable matter with inherent properties which enable the intensification of cell-based basal cognition capabilities present throughout the tree of life. Finally, some connections are drawn between the viewpoint described here and active inference models of cognition, such as the Free Energy Principle.},

  abstract={A paradigmatic account may suffice to explain behavioral evolution in early Homo. We propose a parsimonious account that (1) could explain a particular, frequently-encountered, archeological outcome of behavior in early Homo - namely, the fashioning of a Paleolithic stone 'handaxe' - from a biological theoretic perspective informed by the free energy principle (FEP); and that (2) regards instances of the outcome as postdictive or retrodictive, circumstantial corroboration. Our proposal considers humankind evolving as a self-organizing biological ecosystem at a geological time-scale. We offer a narrative treatment of this self-organization in terms of the FEP. Specifically, we indicate how 'cognitive surprises' could underwrite an evolving propensity in early Homo to express sporadic unorthodox or anomalous behavior. This co-evolutionary propensity has left us a legacy of Paleolithic artifacts that is reminiscent of a 'snakes and ladders' board game of appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular archeological traces of Paleolithic behavior. When detected in the Early and Middle Pleistocene record, anthropologists and archeologists often imagine evidence of unusual or novel behavior in terms of early humankind ascending the rungs of a figurative phylogenetic 'ladder' - as if these corresponded to progressive evolution of cognitive abilities that enabled incremental achievements of increasingly innovative technical prowess, culminating in the cognitive ascendancy of Homo sapiens. The conjecture overlooks a plausible likelihood that behavior by an individual who was atypical among her conspecifics could have been disregarded in a community of Hominina (for definition see Appendix 1) that failed to recognize, imagine, or articulate potential advantages of adopting hitherto unorthodox behavior. Such failure, as well as diverse fortuitous demographic accidents, would cause exceptional personal behavior to be ignored and hence unremembered. It could disappear by a pitfall, down a 'snake', as it were, in the figurative evolutionary board game; thereby causing a discontinuity in the evolution of human behavior that presents like an evolutionary puzzle. The puzzle discomforts some paleoanthropologists trained in the natural and life sciences. They often dismiss it, explaining it away with such self-justifying conjectures as that, maybe, separate paleospecies of Homo differentially possessed different cognitive abilities, which, supposedly, could account for the presence or absence in the Pleistocene archeological record of traces of this or that behavioral outcome or skill. We argue that an alternative perspective - that inherits from the FEP and an individual's 'active inference' about its surroundings and of its own responses - affords a prosaic, deflationary, and parsimonious way to account for appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular behavioral outcomes and skills of early humankind.},

  abstract={A range of studies published in the last few decades promotes the cognitive aspects of life: all organisms, from bacteria to mammals, are capable of sensing/perception, decision-making, problem-solving, learning, and other cognitive functions, including sentience and consciousness. In this paper I present a scientific and philosophical synthesis of these studies, leading to an integrated view of cognitive biology. This view is expressed through the four principles applicable to all living systems: (1) sentience and consciousness, (2) autopoiesis, (3) free energy principle and relational biology, and (4) cognitive repertoire. The principles are circular, and they reinforce themselves. The circularity is not rigid, meaning that hierarchical and heterarchical shifts are widespread in the biosphere. The above principles emerged at the dawn of life, with the first cells, bacteria and archaea. All biogenic forms and functions that emerged since then can be traced to the first cells - indivisible units of biological agency. Following these principles, I developed the concept of biocivilisations to explain various forms of social intelligence in different kingdoms of life. The term biociviloisations draws on the human interpretation of the concept of civilisation, which searches for non-human equivalents of communication, engineering, science, medicine, art, and agriculture, in all kingdoms of life by applying the principles of cognitive biology. Potential avenues for testing the concept of biocivilisations are highlighted.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterative reduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perception-intervention cycles that has been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Any theory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms of decision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent, irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP (Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to the FEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost. We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior in certain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or "utility", a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. We suggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informational or independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability. To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that can subsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions of informational versus reward constraints to behavior.},

The proposed method is achieved by incorporating empathy into active inference. We evaluated the proposed method regarding control of autonomous mobile robots in diverse situations. From the evaluation results, an agent controlled by the proposed method could behave more adaptively socially than an agent controlled by the standard active inference in the diverse situations. In the case of two agents, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved in a social way that reduced the other agent's travel distance by 13.7% and increased the margin between the agents by 25.8%, even though it increased the agent's travel distance by 8.2%. Also, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved more socially when it was surrounded by altruistic others but less socially when it was surrounded by selfish others.},

  abstract={The neural systems' electric activities are fundamental for the phenomenology of consciousness. Sensory perception triggers an information/energy exchange with the environment, but the brain's recurrent activations maintain a resting state with constant parameters. Therefore, perception forms a closed thermodynamic cycle. In physics, the Carnot engine is an ideal thermodynamic cycle that converts heat from a hot reservoir into work, or inversely, requires work to transfer heat from a low- to a high-temperature reservoir (the reversed Carnot cycle). We analyze the high entropy brain by the endothermic reversed Carnot cycle. Its irreversible activations provide temporal directionality for future orientation. A flexible transfer between neural states inspires openness and creativity. In contrast, the low entropy resting state parallels reversible activations, which impose past focus via repetitive thinking, remorse, and regret. The exothermic Carnot cycle degrades mental energy. Therefore, the brain's energy/information balance formulates motivation, sensed as position or negative emotions. Our work provides an analytical perspective of positive and negative emotions and spontaneous behavior from the free energy principle. Furthermore, electrical activities, thoughts, and beliefs lend themselves to a temporal organization, an orthogonal condition to physical systems. Here, we suggest that an experimental validation of the thermodynamic origin of emotions might inspire better treatment options for mental diseases.},

  abstract={Abstract Objectives To study whether the free energy principle can explain fetal brain activity and the existence of fetal consciousness via a chaotic dimension derived using artificial intelligence. Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.},

  abstract={How the purposive behavior of living systems outstrips the constraints of the free energy principle.
                  Since 2005, Karl Friston's proposal that the principle of free energy minimization underpins the purposive behavior of living agents has evolved through thousands of publications. This principle's central move is to formalize the drive for self-preservation in terms of a single probabilistic imperative: to survive, a living system must consistently exhibit the same “most likely” pattern of activity over time. Despite the simplicity of this central claim, the free energy principle's complexity and rate of development have previously made it difficult to identify and evaluate. In A Drive to Survive, Kathryn Nave offers an extended critical analysis of the strengths and limitations of Friston's proposal.
                  Nave shows that the free energy principle's capacity to account for the biological origins of purposiveness is undermined by its applicability to any stable inanimate system. As this triviality has become apparent, so advocates have begun to reframe the free energy principle as a means to eliminate, rather than explain, the notion of distinctively biological purposiveness. This, Nave proposes, gets things the wrong way around. The triviality of free energy minimization does not prove that there is no difference in kind between living agents and ordinary machines, but rather it reflects that the framework cannot capture the intrinsic instability and unpredictability that distinguish the former.},

Both critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi functionals and stationary beliefs are shown to lie at the non-linear intersection of two constraint surfaces, enforcing energy conservation and marginal consistency respectively. The hypersurface of singular beliefs, accross which equilibria become unstable as the constraint surfaces meet tangentially, is described by polynomial equations in the convex polytope of consistent beliefs. This polynomial is expressed by a loop series expansion for graphs of binary variables.},

Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy.The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Our experimental results indicated that (1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when $w$ is set with larger/smaller values, (2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in actional intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.},

  abstract={The notion of a physiological individuals has been developed and applied in the philosophy of biology to understand symbiosis, an understanding of which is key to theorising about the major transition in evolution from multi-organismality to multi-cellularity. The paper begins by asking what such symbiotic individuals can help to reveal about a possible transition in the evolution of cognition. Such a transition marks the movement from cooperating individual biological cognizers to a functionally integrated cognizing unit. Somewhere along the way, did such cognizing units simultaneously have cognizers as parts? Expanding upon the multiscale integration view of the Free Energy Principle, this paper develops an account of reciprocal integration, demonstrating how some coupled biological cognizing systems, when certain constraints are met, can result in a cognizing unit that is in ways greater than the sum of its cognizing parts. Symbiosis between V. Fischeri bacteria and the bobtail squid is used to provide an illustration this account. A novel manner of conceptualizing biological cognizers as gradient is then suggested. Lastly it is argued that the reason why the notion of ontologically nested cognizers may be unintuitive stems from the fact that our folk-psychology notion of what a cognizer is has been deeply influenced by our folk-biological manner of understanding biological individuals as units of reproduction.},

Leveraging the formal equivalence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference, we constructed biologically plausible synthetic agents capable of active inference. These agents recapitulated individual variability in zebrafish neuronal dynamics and behaviour by identifying subject-specific prior and posterior beliefs. Additionally, they enabled quantitative predictions of long-term changes in neural activity, effective synaptic connectivity, and behavioural performance, including task accuracy after training. Our results demonstrate a powerful framework of active inference for modelling in vivo neuronal self-organisation and highlight the predictive validity of the free-energy principle in behaving animals.},

Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour.

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1127820},
  abstract={<p>Standard formulations of the free-energy principle treat adaptive agents as pure surprise minimisers, but in non-stationary niches this can drive brittle, energetically costly behaviour. This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation. <h4>Keywords:</h4> free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience</p>},

  abstract={<p>Public concerns about Large Language Model (LLM) safety are often focused not on moral alignment, but on the fear that they could become, “evil.” Evil is a folk psychology term, typically associated with religion and storytelling, but also used more broadly. Using Friston’s Free Energy Principle, we develop a conceptual model of this phenomenon that can be applied to both LLMs and humans, providing a single framework for comparison and understanding. We explore this in terms of LLM information-processing dynamics, which are structurally oriented toward minimizing uncertainty and maintaining coherence. This model offers an alternative framework for both humans and LLMs that compliments the current moral reasoning approach. In addition, the model makes new predictions on how LLMs should be trained to avoid this problem.</p>},

  abstract={<p>The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.</p>},

  abstract={Did very “small-world” networks enhance the Darwinian fitness of primaeval Homo through exchanges of information that enabled exploration of resources beyond those exploitable at hand? An active inference suggestion is offered about the early evolution of human social behaviour. A phylogenetic split ~7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan “zones of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan “small-world” social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene); (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan “palaeospecies” (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with "Homo informatio's" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive “zone of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.},

  abstract={The Operational Coherence Framework (OCOF) proposes a unified theoretical model linking information thermodynamics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Building upon five axioms—Boundary Persistence, Predictive Inference, Semantic Value, Policy Integration, and Systemic Coherence—OCOF suggests that cognition and intelligence emerge through an entropic negotiation between informational precision and semantic differentiation. The framework formalizes semantic value as S = I × σ, where I denotes mutual information and σ represents semantic potential, thereby extending concepts from the Free Energy Principle by introducing meaning as an operational variable. This study employs a theoretical modeling approach supported by computational simulations and synthetic data analysis. It does not involve human participants or empirical biological experimentation. Through this structure, OCOF aims to bridge the physical basis of information with higher-order cognitive functions, offering a computationally implementable framework. The theory is supported by a comparative literature review and operational appendices covering mathematical formulation, simulation-based psychological modeling, and ethical integration. OCOF aims to establish a measurable link between informational boundaries, semantic integration, and adaptive intelligence, contributing to interdisciplinary discussions in physics and cognitive science.},

  abstract={<p>The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference unify perception, action, and learning within a single variational framework, yet they remain silent on why there is phenomenal experience at all. Awareness-First Theory (AFT) proposes an ontological inversion: rather than deriving consciousness from non-experiential dynamics, it takes awareness as ontologically primitive—taken as the base datum rather than something to be explained by physical states—and formalises it as a differentiable field of awareness, denoted (A, g_A). A Coherence Principle—expressed as the variational stationarity condition “delta A = 0”—governs lawful differentiations within this field and preserves the core phenomenological invariants of unity, binding, temporal continuity, and reflexive presence. The familiar variational laws then appear as embedded projections: “delta S = 0” (least action) for physics and “delta F = 0” (free-energy stationarity) for inference. Subbeings (local bounded centres of coherent differentiation), defined by Markov blankets, are local equilibria of the global coherence field; their inferential activity sustains rather than produces awareness. A Qualia Mapping Function links differentiations in awareness to measurable information-geometric structures. AFT predicts lawful dissociations between coherence (“delta A”) and inference (“delta F”) - as in dreaming, illusion, psychedelics, and meditation, where phenomenological unity persists despite inferential error. It thereby unifies phenomenology, physics, and cognition within a single variational hierarchy (delta S and delta F as subsets of delta A), dissolves the explanatory gap by grounding experience in its own coherence, and resolves the combination problem by making unity fundamental, a variational calculus of Being underlying all appearance.</p>},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1113111},
  abstract={<p>This paper introduces the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) as an integrative meta-theory to explain the mechanisms of profound and sustainable personal transformation. It addresses the fundamental question of how maladaptive core beliefs, which create a state of inner dissonance, can be lastingly changed. We conceptualize core beliefs as high-precision hyper-priors within a hierarchical generative model of the self, based on Karl Friston's free energy principle. Psychopathology is framed as a state of chronically elevated free energy, manifesting as a stable, yet painful, attractor landscape. The RIM synthesizes six theoretical pillars—predictive processing (Friston), the self-pattern theory (Gallagher), synergetics (Haken et al.), affect logic (Ciompi), spatiotemporal neuroscience (Northoff), and consistency theory (Grawe)—into a coherent, multi-level framework. It argues that therapeutic change is a synergetic phase transition from dissonance to resonance, a more adaptive and energetically favorable state. This process requires multi-level interventions that destabilize the old attractor and facilitate the consolidation of a new one. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a vertical, spiritual dimension, conceptualizing Viktor Frankl's "will to meaning" as a master-prior capable of initiating a global reorganization of the self-pattern through downward causation. The RIM thus provides a unified, process-based, and neuroscientifically grounded blueprint for psychotherapy and personal change.</p>},

  abstract={<p>In recent years, the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the Predictive Processing Framework (PPF) have gained prominence as comprehensive models for understanding perception, action, and psychopathology. This paper integrates these frameworks to propose that parent-child interactions trajectories over time, marked by sensitivity, mirroring, and emotional attunement, play a central role in shaping the child’s generative model of the self and the social world. Drawing on empirical findings and theoretical developments, we argue that attachment relationships provide the primary context for the acquisition of priors, the calibration of precision weighting, and the establishment of strategies for prediction error minimization. We explore how secure and insecure attachment styles correspond to distinct predictive profiles and error minimization policies, and how early relational experiences influence emotional regulation, epistemic trust, and long-term adaptability. We provide testable hypotheses and propose a scientific agenda for future experiments. By framing early interpersonal experience as a process of model setting within a hierarchical predictive system, this work offers novel insights into the developmental roots of socioemotional functioning and highlights the clinical relevance of predictive frameworks for understanding attachment-related psychopathology.</p>},

The model integrates the free energy principle (Friston), the phenomenology of the embodied self (Gallagher), and spatio-temporal brain dynamics (Northoff). A philosophical genealogy is drawn from Schopenhauer's anti-representationalist turn to modern enactivism (Thompson), and a mediating proposal between enactivism and predictive processing is offered. The paper also subjects the model to a stress test by addressing and integratively resolving key limit questions (e.g., on the nature of consciousness and the universality of the search for meaning). The implications for a non-reductionist, integrative science of the mind, as well as for the clinical practice of psychotherapy, are outlined.},

  abstract={This paper challenges the dominant representationalist paradigm in the philosophy of mind by developing a process-monistic, anti-representationalist account of cognition. It argues that the persistent mind-body problem is a consequence of a flawed substance ontology and the representationalist framework it necessitates. To overcome this, the paper constructs a critical synthesis of three influential anti-representationalist strands: Robert Brandom’s linguistic inferentialism as a “top-down” approach, the embodied and enactive theory of mind as a “bottom-up” approach, and the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) as a unifying scientific framework. Drawing on Schopenhauer’s revolutionary turn to the lived body (Leib) as a non-representational access to reality, the paper traces a continuous path from basic biological normativity to the complex social normativity of human reason. By reinterpreting the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through an enactive lens (“enactive inference”) and employing the concept of formal downward causation from synergetics, the RIM provides a scientifically grounded mechanism for mental causation without resorting to dualism or reductionism. The resulting framework offers an integrated, multi-scale description of the mind as an embodied, self-organizing process, with significant implications for understanding psychopathology and critiquing contemporary rationalist theories.},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1113168},
  abstract={Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form  f c + Σ  a i f i ). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (  r ≳ 2–3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ∼2–3). HAM’s log-uniform distribution yields a 1  /f global spectral profile and 1  /f α sideband spectra in the broadband “aperiodic” component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network’s intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.  <h4>Highlights</h4>  We introduce HAM  1 : a principle for the organization of hierarchical information processing in the brain. Information is encoded through amplitude modulation, where faster rhythms are multiplicatively modulated by slower processes. Information can thus live in signals or their envelopes (and envelopes of envelopes).  The required intermodulation structure for band protection,  f c ± Σ  a i f i , finds a natural implementation in near geometric (log) spacing with a frequency ratio  r ≳ 2–3 (strong super-increasing hierarchy), yielding constant fractional bandwidths and enabling staged demodulation.  In addition to geometric frequency spacing, HAM provides two routes to 1  /f α : (i) a cascade link  α = 2 ln(2  /m )  / ln  r ; (ii) a log-uniform mixture that yields 1  /f in expectation with constant-Q kernels.  We provide a proof of concept modulation and demodulation implementation in NMM using the LaNMM with PING-like fast generators as carriers and JR-like slow generators for envelope extraction.},

A mechanism of downward causation is postulated, in which meaning and values function as the highest-level order parameter, shaping neural dynamics by modulating precision weighting.

  abstract={Many physical systems retain traces of their past, but living systems differ in that they use memory for anticipation. This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory systems, Friston’s free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen’s “model” is the organized memory of a system. Memory—whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural—provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior.Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions biase chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism–environment interactions.In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.},

  abstract={<p>Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood. <h4>Methods:</h4> We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning. <h4>Results:</h4> Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.</p>},

  abstract={<p>Mindfulness has established psychological benefits such as stress reduction and emotional regulation; however, the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in contrast to mind-wandering, remain unclear. This study aimed to present a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.</p>},

  author={Lars Sandved-Smith},
  year={2025},
  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR971129},
  abstract={Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE), or "pure consciousness," represents a fundamental form of conscious experience characterised by reflexive meta-awareness and the absence of many features of regular phenomenology. It has been described as e.g. non-conceptual, atemporal, non-egoic and aperspectival. This paper aims to develop a computational model of MPE using the mathematics of variational free energy minimization derived from the free energy principle (FEP). I employ a computational neurophenomenology approach, formalising key phenomenological features of MPE within the active inference framework. The model incorporates parametric depth, allowing for higher-order inferences about generative model parameters. I relate specific model parameterisations to reported MPE qualities such as meta-awareness, equanimity, effortlessness, and non-conceptuality. The proposed model suggests that MPE arises when an agent achieves very low free energy through self-directed awareness and modulation of their generative model, particularly by emphasising awareness of awareness itself. The model predicts elements of MPE phenomenology including a sense of effortlessness, timelessness, and the potential for a "zero-person perspective&rdquo;. The implementation details for a simulation of the proposed model are outlined, as well as directions for empirical validation.},

  title={An Introduction to the Semantic Information G Theory and Applications},
  author={Chenguang Lu},
  year={2025},
  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR978779},
  abstract={Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces the semantic information G theory (with "G" denoting generalization). The core approach involves replacing the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expression of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is shown to be equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and parallels the Regularized Least Squares criterion. The G theory is compatible with machine learning methodologies, offering enhanced capabilities for handling latent variables, often addressed through Variational Bayes. This paper systematically presents the generalization of Shannon's information theory into the G theory and its wide-ranging applications. The applications involve semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is equated to free energy, semantic information to the free energy of local equilibrium systems, and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it discusses the limitations of the G theory in representing the semantics of complex data.},

  abstract={Major Depressive Disorder is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent psychiatric condition (Compton et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2011). At present, its primary treatments are antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Curiously, although the pharmacological effects of antidepressants manifest within hours, remission of clinical symptoms takes a number of weeks—if at all. Independently, support has grown for an idea—proposed as early as Helmholtz (von Helmholtz, 1924)—that the brain is a prediction machine, holding generative models1 for the purpose of inferring causes of sensory information (Dayan et al., 1995; Rao and Ballard, 1999; Knill and Pouget, 2004; Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). If the brain does indeed represent a collection of beliefs about the causal structure of the world, then the depressed phenotype may emerge from a collection of depressive beliefs. These beliefs are modified gradually through successive combinations of expectations with observations. As a result, phenotypic remission ought to take some time as the brain's relevant statistical structures become less pessimistic.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15242v1},
  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that under suitable conditions of weak coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will behave so as to minimize an upper bound, formalized as a variational free energy, on surprisal (a.k.a., self-information). This upper bound can be read as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum contextuality. We show that in its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and - implicitly - as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future research, particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11203v3},
  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems -- weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP -- the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) -- are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.},

  abstract={This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes dynamically depending on the individual belief of action intention. In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively.},

  abstract={Dispersed multiphase systems are ubiquitous in biological systems, energy industries, and medical science. The distribution transition of the dispersed phase is critical to the properties and functions of the multiphase systems, among which the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes are of most significance due to their impact on the colloidal stability, interface modification, and particle synthesis. To reveal fundamental correlations between the macroscopic particle distributions and the microscopic interactions, general thermodynamic models of the dispersed multiphase systems are needed. Here, based on Meyer's model, which is restricted to binary isotropic mixtures, we propose a novel extended lattice model that can be applied to multicomponent anisotropic mixtures with interfaces considered. For agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes, the approximate free energy differences between the initial distribution and the final distribution are obtained. Based on the minimum free energy principle, the above free energy differences are used to derive three criteria for the prediction of the preferable distribution of the system with given interparticle interaction potentials. While the quasi-uniform number density assumption is still required for all the previous lattice models, the long-range interactions neglected by previous lattice models are incorporated. The validity of our model and criteria is verified by many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) simulations. By tuning the interaction coefficients between mDPD particles, the simulated distribution transitions for all the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction cases perfectly match the predictions from the three criteria. The good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the mDPD simulation results shows the great potential of our model for applications in various dispersed multiphase systems.},

  abstract={Bettinger, J. S., K. J. Friston. Conceptual Foundations of Physiological Regulation incorporating the Free Energy Principle & Self-Organized Criticality. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 23(x) 144-XXX, 2022. Since the late nineteen-nineties, the concept of homeostasis has been contextualized within a broader class of "allostatic" dynamics characterized by a wider-berth of causal factors including social, psychological and environmental entailments; the fundamental nature of integrated brain-body dynamics; plus the role of anticipatory, top-down constraints supplied by intrinsic regulatory models. Many of these evidentiary factors are integral in original descriptions of homeostasis; subsequently integrated; and/or cite more-general operating principles of self-organization. As a result, the concept of allostasis may be generalized to a larger category of variational systems in biology, engineering and physics in terms of advances in complex systems, statistical mechanics and dynamics involving heterogenous (hierarchical/heterarchical, modular) systems like brain-networks and the internal milieu. This paper offers a three-part treatment. 1) interpret "allostasis" to emphasize a variational and relational foundation of physiological stability; 2) adapt the role of allostasis as "stability through change" to include a "return to stability" and 3) reframe the model of homeostasis with a conceptual model of criticality that licenses the upgrade to variational dynamics.},

  abstract={Homeostasis is maintained by neural reflex controls, which attempt to maintain the body's internal organs within a predetermined range. However, when deviations are significant, homeostasis may not be restored by these standard controls. Therefore, a function called allostasis is necessary to maximize the energy efficiency of bodily functions, anticipate changing needs (e.g., a future increase in body temperature or oxygen demand), and regulate the body's state before dyshomeostasis occurs. In terms of the free energy principle (FEP), the expectation to survive (i.e., to stay within established confines and to maintain homeostatic integrity over time) is realized by a hierarchical prediction mechanism. Allostasis requires the integration of exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive signals. In this paper, the neural mechanism of allostasis is discussed in terms of the FEP.},

  author={R Goekoop and R de Kleijn},
  year={2023},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37741517},
  abstract={Living systems are hierarchical control systems that display a small world network structure. In such structures, many smaller clusters are nested within fewer larger ones, producing a fractal-like structure with a 'power-law' cluster size distribution (a mereology). Just like their structure, the dynamics of living systems shows fractal-like qualities: the timeseries of inner message passing and overt behavior contain high frequencies or 'states' (treble) that are nested within lower frequencies or 'traits' (bass), producing a power-law frequency spectrum that is known as a 'state-trait continuum' in the behavioral sciences. Here, we argue that the power-law dynamics of living systems results from their power-law network structure: organisms 'vertically encode' the deep spatiotemporal structure of their (anticipated) environments, to the effect that many small clusters near the base of the hierarchy produce high frequency signal changes and fewer larger clusters at its top produce ultra-low frequencies. Such ultra-low frequencies exert a tonic regulatory pressure that produces morphological as well as behavioral traits (i.e., body plans and personalities). Nested-modular structure causes higher frequencies to be embedded within lower frequencies, producing a power-law state-trait continuum. At the heart of such dynamics lies the need for efficient energy dissipation through networks of coupled oscillators, which also governs the dynamics of non-living systems (e.q., earthquakes, stock market fluctuations). Since hierarchical structure produces hierarchical dynamics, the development and collapse of hierarchical structure (e.g., during maturation and disease) should leave specific traces in system dynamics (shifts in lower frequencies, i.e. morphological and behavioral traits) that may serve as early warning signs to system failure. The applications of this idea range from (bio)physics and phylogenesis to ontogenesis and clinical medicine.},

The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics-of certain kinds of particles-as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency. In short-of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition-strange kinds may be apt for describing sentient behaviour.},

By making the robot curious, the robot would become interested in the unknown region and explore that region. In order to make the robot curious, we utilize the free energy principle, which has been attracting attention in the field of neuroscience and AI. We propose a curiosity algorithm that combines with Soft Actor-Critic and show that it is naturally derived from the free energy principle.

This paper reformulates this theory to design a brain-inspired state and input estimator for a linear time-invariant state space system with colored noise. This reformulation for linear systems bridges the gap between the neuroscientific theory and control theory, therefore opening up the possibility of evaluating it under the hood of standard control approaches. Through rigorous simulations under colored noises, the observer is shown to outperform Kalman Filter and Unknown Input Observer with minimal error in state and input estimation. It is tested against a wide range of scenarios and the proof of concept is demonstrated by applying it on a real system.},

By giving an example about the journey of a person, we believe to show some simple, obvious but mathematically encoded philosophical implications about how we could think, learn and memorize. In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.},

However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.},

  abstract={A statistical system is classically defined on a set of microstates $E$ by a global energy function $H : E \to \mathbb{R}$, yielding Gibbs probability measures (softmins) $ρ^β(H)$ for every inverse temperature $β= T^{-1}$. Gibbs states are simultaneously characterized by free energy principles and the max-entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse temperature $β$ and mean energy ${\cal U}(β) = \mathbb{E}_{ρ^β}[H]$ respectively. The Legendre transform relates these diverse variational principles which are unfortunately not tractable in high dimension.   The global energy is generally given as a sum $H(x) = \sum_{\rm a \subset Ω} h_{\rm a}(x_{|\rm a})$ of local short-range interactions $h_{\rm a} : E_{\rm a} \to \mathbb{R}$ indexed by bounded subregions ${\rm a} \subset Ω$, and this local structure can be used to design good approximation schemes on thermodynamic functionals. We show that the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm solves a collection of local variational principles, by converging to critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations of the free energy $F(β)$, the Shannon entropy $S(\cal U)$, and the variational free energy ${\cal F}(β) = {\cal U} - β^{-1} S(\cal U)$, extending an initial correspondence by Yedidia et al. This local form of Legendre duality yields a possible degenerate relationship between mean energy ${\cal U}$ and $β$.},

  abstract={Most theories of behavior posit that agents tend to maximize some form of reward or utility. However, animals very often move with curiosity and seem to be motivated in a reward-free manner. Here we abandon the idea of reward maximization, and propose that the goal of behavior is maximizing occupancy of future paths of actions and states. According to this maximum occupancy principle, rewards are the means to occupy path space, not the goal per se; goal-directedness simply emerges as rational ways of searching for resources so that movement, understood amply, never ends. We find that action-state path entropy is the only measure consistent with additivity and other intuitive properties of expected future action-state path occupancy. We provide analytical expressions that relate the optimal policy and state-value function, and prove convergence of our value iteration algorithm. Using discrete and continuous state tasks, including a high--dimensional controller, we show that complex behaviors such as `dancing', hide-and-seek and a basic form of altruistic behavior naturally result from the intrinsic motivation to occupy path space. All in all, we present a theory of behavior that generates both variability and goal-directedness in the absence of reward maximization.},

  abstract={This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.},

We argue that any dynamical system with constraints on its dynamics necessarily looks as though it is performing inference against these constraints, and that in a non-isolated system, such constraints imply external environmental variables embedding the system. Using aspects of classical dynamical systems theory in statistical mechanics, we show that this inference is equivalent to a gradient ascent on the Shannon entropy functional, recovering an approximate Bayesian inference under a locally ergodic probability measure on the state space. We also use some geometric notions from dynamical systems theory$\unicode{x2014}$namely, that the constraints constitute a gauge degree of freedom$\unicode{x2014}$to elaborate on how the desire to stay self-organised can be read as a gauge force acting on the system. In doing so, a number of results of independent interest are given.

  abstract={In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.},

  abstract={<p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a type of anxiety disorder which impacts every day functioning, particularly in terms of interpersonal relationships. The cognitive-behavioral model is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Though this model has long informed clinical practice, it has been criticized for its overreliance on cognitive processes and rational thinking, disregarding the role of emotions as well as other biological and social factors. This limitation is especially evident in the treatment of SAD, where cognitivebehavioral approaches often fail to produce long-term results. In this study, we will argue in favor of a new approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, emerging in the last decade from the field of computational psychiatry, focusing on the brain’s predictive mechanisms. We will show how SAD can arise from erroneous interoceptive inferences—incorrect predictions about internal bodily states— which lead to unreliable predictions about the social environment. These erroneous inferences reinforce the individual's perception that the social world is unpredictable and that their actions are insufficient to reduce this uncertainty, creating a state of learned uncertainty.</p>},

  abstract={The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neuro-computational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel “thoughtseed” framework, proposing that cognition arises from dynamic interactions of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called “thoughtseeds” within the Global Workspace of consciousness. By leveraging evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and the Free Energy Principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), thoughtseed networks, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent neural activity patterns that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experiences and guiding behavior. We present an illustrative mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. This biologically grounded model offers a novel approach to understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, with potential applications in consciousness, attention, and decision making.},

  abstract={<p>The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterativereduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perceptioneintervention cycles thathas been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Anytheory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms ofdecision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent,irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP(Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to theFEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost.We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior incertain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or “utility”, a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. Wesuggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informationalor independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability.To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that cansubsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions ofinformational versus reward constraints to behavior.</p>},

  abstract={Several authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems with Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of agency and sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of redefinition of variable and parameter sets and of the dynamical laws affecting a system, a situation that escapes the assumptions of FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development, and the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that this position is also in contradiction with the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is profoundly incompatible with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.},

  abstract={Human upright standing involves an integration of multiple sensory inputs such as vision, vestibular and somatosensory systems. It has been known that sensory deficits worsen the standing balance. However, how the modulation of sensory information contributes to postural stabilization still remains an open question for researchers. The purpose of this work was to formulate the human standing postural control system in the framework of the free-energy principle, and to investigate the efficacy of the skin stretch feedback in enhancing the human standing balance. Previously, we have shown that sensory augmentation by skin stretch feedback at the fingertip could modulate the standing balance of the people with simulated sensory deficits. In this study, subjects underwent ten 30-second trials of quiet standing balance with and without skin stretch feedback. Visual and vestibular sensory deficits were simulated by having each subject close their eyes and tilt their head back. We found that sensory augmentation by velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip reduced the entropy of the standing postural sway of the people with simulated sensory deficits. This result aligns with the framework of the free energy principle which states that a self-organizing biological system at its equilibrium state tries to minimize its free energy either by updating the internal state or by correcting body movement with appropriate actions. The velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip may increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory signals, which in turn enhances the accuracy of the internal states in the central nervous system. With more accurate internal states, the human postural control system can further adjust the standing posture to minimize the entropy, and thus the free energy.},

  abstract={We propose an embodied system based on the free energy principle (FEP) for sensorimotor visual perception. We evaluated it in a character-recognition task using the MNIST dataset. Although the FEP has successfully described a rule that living things obey mathematically and claims that a biological system continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the difference in predicting sensory input, it is not enough to model sensorimotor visual perception. An embodiment of the system is the key to achieving sensorimotor visual perception. The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified. By limiting body and memory abilities and operating according to the FEP, the embodied system repeatedly takes action to obtain the next sensory input based on various potentials of future sensory inputs. In the evaluation, the inference of the environment was represented as an approximate posterior distribution of characters (0 - 9). As the number of repetitions increased, the attention area moved continuously, gradually reducing the uncertainty of characters. Finally, the probability of the correct character became the highest among the characters. Changing the initial attention position provides a different final distribution, suggesting that the proposed system has a confirmation bias.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance - in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations - is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) in the neurosciences stipulates that all viable agents induce and minimize informational free energy in the brain to fit their environmental niche. In this study, we continue our effort to make the FEP a more physically principled formalism by implementing free energy minimization based on the principle of least action. We build a Bayesian mechanics (BM) by casting the formulation reported in the earlier publication (Kim 2018) to considering active inference beyond passive perception. The BM is a neural implementation of variational Bayes under the FEP in continuous time. The resulting BM is provided as an effective Hamilton's equation of motion and subject to the control signal arising from the brain's prediction errors at the proprioceptive level. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we adopt a simple agent-based model and present a concrete numerical illustration of the brain performing recognition dynamics by integrating BM in neural phase space. Furthermore, we recapitulate the major theoretical architectures in the FEP by comparing our approach with the common state-space formulations.},

  abstract={Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires a large amount of exploration especially in sparse-reward settings. Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) is a mathematical framework that describes how biological systems self-organize and survive in their environment. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal. This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model, suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving agent interacts with an environment.},

  abstract={The quest for a brain-inspired learning algorithm for robots has culminated in the free energy principle from neuroscience that models the brain's perception and action as an optimization over its free energy objectives. Based on this idea, we propose an estimation algorithm for accurate output prediction of a quadrotor flying under unmodelled wind conditions. The key idea behind this work is the handling of unmodelled wind dynamics and the model's non-linearity errors as coloured noise in the system, and leveraging it for accurate output predictions. This paper provides the first experimental validation for the usefulness of generalized coordinates for robot perception using Dynamic Expectation Maximization (DEM). Through real flight experiments, we show that the estimator outperforms classical estimators with the least error in output predictions. Based on the experimental results, we extend the DEM algorithm for model order selection for complete black box identification. With this paper, we provide the first experimental validation of DEM applied to robot learning.},

  abstract={Active inference may be defined as Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. An agent will choose an action that leads to its prior preference for a future observation. In this paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and find a theoretical connection between them. We extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value function. Motivated by the concept of prior preference and a theoretical connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior preference from experts. This illustrates that the problem with inverse RL can be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with EFE-based rewards and its application to an inverse RL problem.},

  abstract={Active inference, a corollary of the free energy principle, is a formal way of describing the behavior of certain kinds of random dynamical systems that have the appearance of sentience. In this chapter, we describe how active inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design, i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e., expected utility maximization. Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility, expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.},

  abstract={The present paper argues that a systems theory epistemology (and particularly the notion of hierarchical recursive organization) provides the critical theoretical context within which the significance of Friston's (2010a) Free Energy Principle (FEP) for both evolution and psychoanalysis is best understood. Within this perspective, the FEP occupies a particular level of the hierarchical organization of the organism, which is the level of biological self-organization. This form of biological self-organization is in turn understood as foundational and pervasive to the higher levels of organization of the human organism that are of interest to both neuroscience as well as psychoanalysis. Consequently, central psychoanalytic claims should be restated, in order to be located in their proper place within a hierarchical recursive organization of the (situated) organism. In light of the FEP the realization of the psychoanalytic mind by the brain should be seen in terms of the evolution of different levels of systematic organization where the concepts of psychoanalysis describe a level of hierarchical recursive organization superordinate to that of biological self-organization and the FEP. The implication of this formulation is that while “psychoanalytic” mental processes are fundamentally subject to the FEP, they nonetheless also add their own principles of process over and above that of the FEP. A model found in Grobbelaar (1989) offers a recursive bottom-up description of the self-organization of the psychoanalytic ego as dependent on the organization of language (and affect), which is itself founded upon the tendency toward autopoiesis (self-making) within the organism, which is in turn described as formally similar to the FEP. Meaningful consilience between Grobbelaar's model and the hierarchical recursive description available in Friston's (2010a) theory is described. The paper concludes that the valuable contribution of the FEP to psychoanalysis underscores the necessity of reengagement with the core concepts of psychoanalytic theory, and the usefulness that a systems theory epistemology—particularly hierarchical recursive description—can have for this goal.},

  abstract={The Free-Energy-Principle (FEP) is an influential and controversial theory which postulates a deep connection between the stochastic thermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference. Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an information-theoretic functional – the variational free energy – and thus performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience, and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the construction of novel algorithms by which action, perception, and learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often made productive discussion challenging. Here, we aim to provide a mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and central claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions necessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP is a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and revision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing current perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability, and the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP. ar X iv :2 10 8. 13 34 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 1 O ct 2 02 1 A PREPRINT 5TH OCTOBER, 2021},

  abstract={Abstract We formulate the computational processes of perception in the framework of the principle of least action by postulating the theoretical action as a time integral of the variational free energy in the neurosciences. The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased, on autopoetic grounds, as follows: all viable organisms attempt to minimize their sensory uncertainty about an unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By taking the variation of informational action, we derive neural recognition dynamics (RD), which by construction reduces to the Bayesian filtering of external states from noisy sensory inputs. Consequently, we effectively cast the gradient-descent scheme of minimizing the free energy into Hamiltonian mechanics by addressing only the positions and momenta of the organisms' representations of the causal environment. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show how the RD may be implemented in a neuronally based biophysical model at a single-cell level and subsequently in a coarse-grained, hierarchical architecture of the brain. We also present numerical solutions to the RD for a model brain and analyze the perceptual trajectories around attractors in neural state space.},

We reveal that, in contrast to standard cost and constraint-based solutions, ActInf gives rise to a minimization problem that includes both an information-theoretic surprise term and a model-predictive control cost term.

For a case with linear Gaussian dynamics and a quadratic cost, we illustrate the performance of ActInf under varying system parameters and compare to classical solutions for estimation and control.},

Renormalization techniques permit us to construct good estimators for the posterior signal mean within information field theory (IFT), but the approximations and assumptions made are not very obvious. Here we introduce the simple concept of minimal Gibbs free energy to IFT, and show that previous renormalization results emerge naturally. They can be understood as being the Gaussian approximation to the full posterior probability, which has maximal cross information with it. We derive optimized estimators for three applications, to illustrate the usage of the framework: (i) reconstruction of a log-normal signal from Poissonian data with background counts and point spread function, as it is needed for gamma ray astronomy and for cosmography using photometric galaxy redshifts, (ii) inference of a Gaussian signal with unknown spectrum and (iii) inference of a Poissonian log-normal signal with unknown spectrum, the combination of (i) and (ii). Finally we explain how Gaussian knowledge states constructed by the minimal Gibbs free energy principle at different temperatures can be combined into a more accurate surrogate of the non-Gaussian posterior.},

  abstract={This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.},

  abstract={Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.},

  abstract={How do organisms recognize their environment by acquiring knowledge about the world, and what actions do they take based on this knowledge? This article examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of organisms to the environment.},

  abstract={This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational inference in deep generative models, and evolution strategies to introduce the "deep active inference" agent. This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how goal directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on the latent states in the agent's model. Furthermore, we show that the deep active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and its interaction therewith.},

  year={2012},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3997v1},
  abstract={The free energy functional has recently been proposed as a variational principle for bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a natural trade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can be axiomatically derived. Here we apply the free energy principle to general decision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. We derive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalized optimality equations that account for both adversarial and stochastic environments.},

  abstract={We propose a formal foundation for cognition rooted in algebraic topology, built on a Homological Parity Principle. This posits that even-dimensional homology represents stable Structure/Context (e.g., generative models), while odd-dimensional homology represents dynamic Flow/Content (e.g., sensory/memory data). Cognition is governed by the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a dynamical cycle aligning these parities. This framework distinguishes two modes: Inference (waking), where the scaffold predicts the flow (a Context-before-Content process); and Learning (sleep), an inverted Structure-before-Specificity process where memory traces sculpt the scaffold. This parity interpretation unifies cognitive functions like semantic and episodic memory and provides a structural generalization of existing theories, recasting Friston's Free Energy Principle and Tonini's Integrated Information in topological terms.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0745v1},
  abstract={The Darwinian nature of Wojciech Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism is evaluated against the criteria of a Darwinian process as understood within Universal Darwinism. The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics, atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.},

  year={2011},

  abstract={Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented.   Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior.},

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that both features can be explained by the fact that each entity of such a system is limited in a certain way. We propose an information-theoretic approach based on a Free Energy principle, in order to computationally analyze systems of bounded rational agents that deal with such limitations optimally. We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units. Our results suggest that hierarchical architectures of specialized units at lower levels that are coordinated by units at higher levels are optimal, given that each unit's information-processing capability is limited and conforms to constraints on complexity costs.},

  abstract={Information-theoretic principles for learning and acting have been proposed to solve particular classes of Markov Decision Problems. Mathematically, such approaches are governed by a variational free energy principle and allow solving MDP planning problems with information-processing constraints expressed in terms of a Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a reference distribution. Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model, Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a grid world simulation.},

@article{boonstranodateinternal,
  title={Internal outset},
  author={Evert A. Boonstra},
  url={https://doi.org/10.5463/thesis.64},
  abstract={The present dissertation took the free-energy principle (FEP) as its starting point, from which we tried to draw both philosophical and empirical consequences. 

Both chapter 2 and 3 departed from the idea that conscious perception depends on global amplification of sensory input, and that the basal ganglia (BG) and its irrigation by dopamine play a crucial role in gating information, conscious access, and the selection of a relevant internal model given available sensory data. The BG are thought to play this role due to their modulatory influence on thalamocortical connectivity. Because much of the evidence implicating the BG in these processes in humans is correlational, we explored two ways of manipulating BG activity experimentally.

Chapter 4 investigates the philosophical heritage implicitly touched on by the FEP, which provides an alternative philosophical and historical background for present-day research in cognitive neuroscience. Friston’s FEP has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this paper, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aimed to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of the FEP from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. From a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intended to show how this contradiction – tension internalized – is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.

Chapter 5 is the report of a study attempting to contrast the FEP’s perspective with that of traditional cognitive neuroscience. While the FEP casts the brain as an organism’s predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future in which action is afforded a central place, research on the brain’s predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement (as we also did in Chapters 2 and 3). The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions (externally/cue-induced, internally/action-induced) on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants’ increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power.},

  author={Eray Özkural},
  url={https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints201908.0318.v1},
  abstract={The free energy principle states that self-organization occurs through minimization of free energy, which is a measure of potential thermodynamic work. By minimizing free energy, the organism happens to also minimize surprise over its boundary, promoting chances of survival. We discuss the ethical implications of the cognitive goal in detail from an empirical point of view, highlighting the principle of least action as a physical basis of Occam's razor, the universality of the free energy principle, and its explanation of natural selection. We explain that the free energy principle extends to groups of organisms and helps us understand group-scale adaptations and selection in biology. The free energy principle applies to all scales of organization in the organism from single cells to the entire nervous system. When this principle is taken to its logical extremes of modeling groups, populations and ecosystems, we uncover a new, evolutionarily sensible path at explaining puzzling aspects of human motivation and judgement, including ethical decisions. To minimize free energy, populations have to act to maximize gathering of information, while building effective models at mitigating changes to its dynamic structure. The free energy principle thus provides a naturalistic explanation of some of our deepest ethical intuitions, and valuable principles of social behavior. We interpret the cognitive goal that corresponds to the principle as seeking a dynamic, fruitful, yet peaceful activity that sustains the organism. This state of mind is interestingly similar to the Buddhist intuition of mental equanimity; the organism's final goal is to be at peace and harmony with the environment. Another immediately relevant aspect is that assemblies must form to promote symbiotic, synergistic, positive feedback loops, which coincides with the findings of ecologists. Therefore, ethics naturally emerges in self-organizing systems. Assemblies of organisms must ultimately unite in macro-minds to achieve the greatest reduction in free energy, as well as building technological extensions of themselves to improve their capacity to do such, therefore the principle also predicts a post-singularity world-mind composed mostly of artificial intelligence.},

It is only by rejecting the presumption of a machine-style separation between structure and processes that we can capture this uniquely precarious status of living systems, in virtue of which they may be described as autonomous agents, acting towards the goal of their own continued survival.},

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems. In this article, we give an overview of the emerging literature on how respiration modulates neural, cognitive and emotional processes. Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.},

  abstract={This paper applies the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to propose that the lack of action in response to climate change should be considered a maladaptive symptom of human activity that we refer to as biophilia deficiency syndrome. The paper is organised into four parts: the characterisation of the natural world under the Gaia Hypothesis, the employment of the FEP as a description of the behaviour of self-organising systems, the application of the FEP to Gaia to understand coupling dynamics between living systems and purportedly non-living planetary processes, and the offering of positive interventions for addressing the current state of ecological crisis under this framework. For the latter, we emphasise the importance of perturbing stuck states for healthy development, and the necessary appreciation of life existing as nested systems at multiple levels in a hierarchy. We propose the development of human biophilia virtue in accordance with the FEP as a practical intervention for treating biophilia deficiency syndrome and helping to safeguard the balance of planetary processes and the integrity of living systems that depend on them, offering some examples of what this might look like in practice. Overall, this paper provides novel insights into how to catalyse meaningful ecological change, proposing a deliberate and disruptive approach to addressing the dysfunctional relationship between humans and the rest of the natural world.},

  author={Adam Safron},

  abstract={Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.},

  abstract={Jungian archetypes have been of interest to psychoanalysts and have been a cornerstone of Jungian psychology through much of the 20th century. Whilst the notion of archetypes has been debated amongst psychoanalytic traditions as well as in contemporary mythology/anthropology, little work has been done on their utility in the cognitive and neurosciences. We propose a novel neural mechanism of archetypes, grounded in cross-cultural psychology, comparative mythology, as well as developmental psychology. The pragmatic function of archetypes may serve as a collective effort of free energy minimization under the free energy principle, emergent due to the sets of affordances offered by culture and ecology. In line with Carl Jung’s definitional scope, we argue that archetypes are rooted in deep ecological and social forces, generationally ingrained for the purpose of optimizing the accurate conceptual representation of agents’ ecological and social environments. We then speculate on theoretical mechanisms by which archetypes are transmitted across time. Finally, we discuss implications for the utility of Jungian archetypes and outline future research directions to expand this concept in the cognitive neurosciences.},

  abstract={The argument is developed that autism spectrum disorder can be interpreted economically in terms of a deficit in polymodal integration which limits awareness by babies and infants of the time-contingency for generating their motor responses to information gleaned from seeing the actions of care-givers or hearing them. This gives rise to difficulties with imitation and mental attribution. In order to grasp the root of the problem we consider “primary intersubjectivity” from the standpoint of the Free Energy Principle as developed by Karl Friston. In terms of this principle and    concomitant considerations of variational free energy it can be argued that reduction of predictive errors by both early infants and their care-givers is achievable normally by their reciprocal behavioural exchanges. It is impeded when a deficit in a baby’s polymodal integration leads to a delayed time-contingent response. This protracted sensory integration theory of autism can be subsumed under the acronym PSITA.},

  author={Mathias Houe Andersen and Silja Katharina Arenfeldt},
  url={https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hyp87},
  abstract={This study concerns an interdisciplinary theoretical analysis of the underlying ways the depressed individual is related to the world. Specific aspects of this relation, namely time, mood and perception of affordances will be characterized. By understanding these relations from both an existential phenomenological Heideggerian approach and through the modern neuroscientific paradigm of the Free Energy Principle, we formulate a complementary conceptualization of the depressed person’s relation to the world. Furthermore, we argue that this interdisciplinary approach bears a synergic coupling, despite obvious epistemic and disciplinary differences. In essence The Free Energy Principle conceptualizes any human world relation as a dynamic process in a self-organizing system that attempts to minimize entropy from the surroundings by predicting the states of the world. To Heidegger, the human world relation constitutes Dasein as a being-in-the-world, where the world gets its meaning from Dasein's care. Dasein does this by projecting possibilities of the future based on its facticity. We argue that this interdisciplinary compatible conceptualization constitutes an epistemically useful alternative based on dynamic assumptions, unlike the conceptualization offered by DSM-5, We argue that these underlying assumptions are important to challenge, as recent research in psychedelic treatment of “treatment resistant” depressed patients provides interesting findings challenging our current view of depression. Because experiences of connectedness are the strongest predictor for positive clinical outcomes in these trials, we argue that a dynamic characterization of depression is beneficial. We argue that this dynamic characterization is beneficial to pursue, as it offers an interdisciplinary approach to understand how the depressed individual fundamentally is connected to the world.},

  abstract={AbstractEmpirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.},

Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remains elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and allatom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have predicted the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and suggested the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.},

  abstract={Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an established field of research. Yet some have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency.},

  author={Kentaro Fujii and Shingo Murata},
  year={2025},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01924v1},
  abstract={Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.},

  abstract={Ensuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in large-scale architectures, such as Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), is challenging due to their heterogeneous nature and varying service requirements across different devices and applications. Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.},

  abstract={The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel "thoughtseed" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called "thoughtseeds" within the Global Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. The thoughtseed framework offers a promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, with potential applications in understanding consciousness, attention, and decision-making.},

  abstract={Autonomous selection of optimal options for data collection from multiple alternatives is challenging in uncertain environments. When secondary information about options is accessible, such problems can be framed as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active inference has gained interest for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation using the expected free energy objective function. Unlike previous studies that showed the effectiveness of active inference based strategy for CMABs using synthetic data, this study aims to apply active inference to realistic scenarios, using a simulated mineralogical survey site selection problem. Hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG at Cuprite, Nevada, serves as contextual information for predicting outcome probabilities, while geologists' mineral labels represent outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations assess the robustness of active inference against changing expert preferences. Results show that active inference requires fewer iterations than standard bandit approaches with real-world noisy and biased data, and performs better when outcome preferences vary online by adapting the selection strategy to align with expert shifts.},

  abstract={Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.},

This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.},

  abstract={What is the most crucial characteristic of a system with life activity? Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN. We also combined machine learning technology to prove that this framework can be applied in the case of unknown dynamics.},

  abstract={During virtual navigation, users exhibit varied interaction and navigation behaviors influenced by several factors. Existing theories and models have been developed to explain and predict these diverse patterns. While users often experience uncomfortable sensations, such as cybersickness, during virtual reality (VR) use, they do not always make optimal decisions to mitigate these effects. Although methods like reinforcement learning have been used to model decision-making processes, they typically rely on random selection to simulate actions, failing to capture the complexities of real navigation behavior. In this study, we propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making, suggesting that users continuously balance exploration and cybersickness according to the free energy principle during virtual navigation. Our findings show that VR users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating, with most participants displaying negative curiosity across trials. However, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. This study provides a quantitative approach to decoding curiosity-driven behavior during virtual navigation, offering insights into how users balance exploration and the avoidance of cybersickness. Future research will further refine this model by incorporating additional psychological and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of navigation pattern predictions.},

In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity 6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness.

  abstract={Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract={Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output.   In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.   This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python examples using PyTorch.},

  abstract={Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP), along with the associated constructs of Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the core components of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is, a mathematical theory of ``every'' ``thing''. Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.},

In our study, an algorithm is proposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of inferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse problem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and free-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference algorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating processes.},

It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.},

  abstract={Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.},

  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.},

  abstract={The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.},

  abstract={The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ Δ= K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $Δ$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $Δ> 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-Δ}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $Δ$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.},

  abstract={We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.},

We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches.

  abstract={High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.},

To investigate this claim, we present multiple examples that challenge the subsumption thesis. To formally compare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved, the subsumption thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between active inference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal assumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agency commensurable.},

PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods.

  abstract={Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution.

This entails that future networks may be better viewed as techno-social systems that resemble biological superorganisms with brain-like cognitive capabilities. Fast-forwarding, there is now growing awareness that we have to completely change our networks from being static into being a living entity that would act as an AI-powered network `brain', as recently stated by Bruno Zerbib, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of France's Orange, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025. Even though AI was front and center at both MWC and OFC 2025 and has been widely studied in the context of optical networks, there are currently no publications on active inference in optical (and less so mobile) networks available. Active inference is an ideal methodology for developing more advanced AI systems by biomimicking the way living intelligent systems work, while overcoming the limitations of today's AI related to training, learning, and explainability. Active inference is considered the key to true AI: Less artificial, more intelligent. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we aim at enabling optical network researchers to conceptualize new research lines for future optical networks with human-AI interaction capabilities by introducing them to the main mathematical concepts of the active inference framework. Second, we demonstrate how to move AI research beyond the human brain toward the 6G world brain by exploring the role of mycorrhizal networks, the largest living organism on planet Earth, in the AI vision and R&D roadmap for the next decade and beyond laid out by Karl Friston, the father of active inference.},

The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties.

  abstract={Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).},

  abstract={We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm. We utilize observable operators in the hidden Markov model (HMM) to compute the necessary gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in stochastic grid world environments.},

  abstract={Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.},

In our framework, ToM-equipped agents maintain distinct representations of their own and others' beliefs and goals. ToM agents then use an extended and adapted version of the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. We evaluate our approach through collision avoidance and foraging simulations. Results suggest that ToM agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour and considering them when planning their own actions.

  abstract={Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired, Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning (AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable, self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at https://github.com/decide-ugent/AIMAPP.},

  abstract={Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.},

This paper introduces a model of covert and overt visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy. The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.},

  abstract={How could primordial life, before the evolution of genetic systems, adapt to fluctuating environments and achieve homeostasis? This study proposes a minimal, chemically plausible model where homeostasis emerges from a simple chemical reaction network. It utilizes an internal Lotka-Volterra chemical oscillator as a "search engine" to periodically vary a protocell's pigmentation. The system then optimizes its internal state by evaluating the temporal correlation between these internal fluctuations and a single global metric,the cell's self-replication rate, through a mechanism termed "antagonistic memory molecules." Numerical simulations demonstrate that the model can autonomously converge to and maintain the optimal temperature for its self-replication, even amidst significant environmental fluctuations. These findings provide a constructive proof-of-concept for how a core process of active inference can emerge from a simple physicochemical system, offering a concrete scenario for the acquisition of adaptive capabilities at the origin of life.},

  abstract={This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.},

  abstract={The Computing Continuum (CC) is an emerging Internet-based computing paradigm that spans from local Internet of Things sensors and constrained edge devices to large-scale cloud data centers. Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of CC platforms demands distributed intelligence for adaptive and resilient service management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and deployed alongside distributed services to manage them autonomously. Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start. Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in CC platforms.},

  abstract={In multi-agent systems, explicit cognition of teammates' decision logic serves as a critical factor in facilitating coordination. Communication (i.e., ``\textit{Tell}'') can assist in the cognitive development process by information dissemination, yet it is inevitably subject to real-world constraints such as noise, latency, and attacks. Therefore, building the understanding of teammates' decisions without communication remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel non-communication MARL framework that realizes the construction of cognition through local observation-based modeling (i.e., \textit{``Think''}). Our framework enables agents to model teammates' \textbf{active inference} process. At first, the proposed method produces three teammate portraits: perception-belief-action. Specifically, we model the teammate's decision process as follows: 1) Perception: observing environments; 2) Belief: forming beliefs; 3) Action: making decisions. Then, we selectively integrate the belief portrait into the decision process based on the accuracy and relevance of the perception portrait. This enables the selection of cooperative teammates and facilitates effective collaboration. Extensive experiments on the SMAC, SMACv2, MPE, and GRF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.},

  abstract={With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception, learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or expensive planning.},

  abstract={Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19368v3},
  abstract={The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process effectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.},

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance.},

  abstract={The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.   We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative impact on science, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited in enabling genuine scientific discovery. This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component. Evaluations must assess the system's ability to identify novel phenomena, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and efficiently guide experimental programs toward genuine discoveries.},

Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities.

  abstract={Human infants acquire language and action gradually through development, achieving strong generalization from minimal experience, whereas large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study investigates this question through robot simulation experiments in which agents learn to perform actions associated with imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via curiosity-driven self-exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal several key findings: i) Generalization improves markedly as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity combined with motor noise yields substantially better learning than exploration without curiosity. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions develop earlier than more complex actions that depend on them. v) When exception-handling rules were introduced -- where certain imperative sentences required executing inconsistent actions -- the robots successfully acquired these exceptions through exploration and displayed a U-shaped performance curve characteristic of representational redescription in child language learning. Together, these results suggest that curiosity-driven exploration and active inference provide a powerful account of how intrinsic motivation and hierarchical sensorimotor learning can jointly support scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in both humans and artificial agents.},

However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices.   This paper presents an innovative agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real-time with a compact memory footprint of as little as 300 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device.

  abstract={Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.},

  abstract={Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.},

  abstract={We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics, NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.},

  abstract={Measurement of a physical quantity such as light intensity is an integral part of many reconstruction and decision scenarios but can be costly in terms of acquisition time, invasion of or damage to the environment and storage. Data minimisation and compliance with data protection laws is also an important consideration. Where there are a range of measurements that can be made, some may be more informative and compliant with the overall measurement objective than others. We develop an active sequential inference algorithm that uses the low dimensional representational latent space from a variational autoencoder (VAE) to choose which measurement to make next. Our aim is to recover high dimensional data by making as few measurements as possible. We adapt the VAE encoder to map partial data measurements on to the latent space of the complete data. The algorithm draws samples from this latent space and uses the VAE decoder to generate data conditional on the partial measurements. Estimated measurements are made on the generated data and fed back through the partial VAE encoder to the latent space where they can be evaluated prior to making a measurement. Starting from no measurements and a normal prior on the latent space, we consider alternative strategies for choosing the next measurement and updating the predictive posterior prior for the next step. The algorithm is illustrated using the Fashion MNIST dataset and a novel convolutional Hadamard pattern measurement basis. We see that useful patterns are chosen within 10 steps, leading to the convergence of the guiding generative images. Compared with using stochastic variational inference to infer the parameters of the posterior distribution for each generated data point individually, the partial VAE framework can efficiently process batches of generated data and obtains superior results with minimal measurements.},

Through simulations of the perceptual crossing paradigm, we explore the effect of various internal reward functions in reinforcement learning agents. The drive to understand is implemented as an active inference type artificial curiosity reward, whereas the drive to be understood is implemented through intrinsic rewards for imitation, influence/impressionability, and sub-reaction time anticipation of the other. Results indicate that while artificial curiosity alone does not lead to a preference for social interaction, rewards emphasizing reciprocal understanding successfully drive agents to prioritize interaction. We demonstrate that this intrinsic motivation can facilitate cooperation in tasks where only one agent receives extrinsic reward for the behaviour of the other.},

Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.

First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark (d=.96) and boosts cooperation and joint-reward on the Prisoner's Dilemma task (d=7+).

  abstract={Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.},

However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.},

  abstract={A Multi-robot system (MRS) provides significant advantages for intricate tasks such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, and space missions. However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk. Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.},

  abstract={Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.},

Recently, a number of structured adversarial collaborations have been devised to test the competing predictions of several candidate theories of consciousness. In this review, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such adversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory, Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core claims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they seek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the methodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent challenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some of these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that will be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting empirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each theory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments (and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative measure of the evidential support accrued under each theory. We suggest this approach to theory comparison may afford a useful metric for tracking the amount of scientific progress being made in consciousness research.},

Key findings suggest that AGI-driven strategies, such as adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions to sensing-layer data overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and application-layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance of cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced IoX is emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of interconnected systems and advanced AI.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16877v1},
  abstract={Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system performing Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a prominent interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative model (a POMDP) encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process (another POMDP) representing the environment while trying to explain what hidden properties of the world generated its sensory input. In this view, the brain is thought to become a copy of the environment. This claim has however been disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy, or isomorphism as it is at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of this process since the environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and what matters is not the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure of the world. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using ideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for dynamical systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative model and process, in the form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between them to describe a form of consistency that goes beyond mere structural similarity, giving the necessary mathematical background to describe how different processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally, equivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and thus minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about structural similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions of equivalence from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the context of predictive processing and identifying the one closest to claims made by proponents of this framework.},

Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes.

We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.},

However, teleoperation is difficult since the operator feels a disconnect with the robot caused by missing feedback from several senses, including touch, and the lack of depth in the video feedback presented to the operator. To overcome this problem, the proposed system actively infers the operator's intent and provides assistance based on the predicted intent. Furthermore, a novel method of calculating confidence in the inferred intent modifies the human-in-the-loop control. The operator's gaze is employed to intuitively indicate the target before the manipulation with the robot begins. A potential field method is used to provide a guiding force towards the intended target, and a safety boundary reduces risk of damage. Modifying these assistances based on the confidence level in the operator's intent makes the control more natural, and gives the robot an intuitive understanding of its human master. Initial validation results show the ability of the system to improve accuracy, execution time, and reduce operator error.},

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

  abstract={Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality.

We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars.

While a frequency analysis of HD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of planets around these three stars.   ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales (<1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M$_{\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) describes (biological) agents as minimising a variational Free Energy (FE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimising an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF, by message passing on free-form Forney-style Factor Graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I) introduces a Constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalised) FE objectives for AIF. The current paper (part II) derives message passing algorithms that minimise (generalised) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalised FE agents illustrates how the message passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behaviour on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to 1) learning goal statistics, and 2) a multi-agent bargaining setting, illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.},

  year={2023},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00007v1},
  abstract={Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel formulation of epistemic emotions such as curiosity and interest using two types of information gain generated by the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback-Leibler divergence(KLD) from Bayesian posterior to prior, which represents free energy reduction in recognition, and Bayesian surprise (BS), which represents the expected information gain by Bayesian prior update. By applying a Gaussian generative model with an additional uniform likelihood, we found that KLD and BS form an upward-convex function of surprise (minimized free energy and prediction error), similar to Berlyne's arousal potential functions, or the Wundt curve. We consider that the alternate maximization of BS and KLD generates an ideal inquiry cycle to approach the optimal arousal level with fluctuations in surprise, and that curiosity and interest drive to facilitate the cyclic process. We exhaustively analyzed the effects of prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) on the peaks of the information gain function as optimal surprises. The results show that greater prediction uncertainty, meaning an open-minded attitude, and less observational uncertainty, meaning precise observation with attention, are expected to provide greater information gains through a greater range of exploration. The proposed mathematical framework unifies the free energy principle of the brain and the arousal potential theory to explain the Wundt curve as an information gain function and suggests an ideal inquiry process driven by epistemic emotions.},

  abstract={The way the brain selects and controls actions is still widely debated. Mainstream approaches based on Optimal Control focus on stimulus-response mappings that optimize cost functions. Ideomotor theory and cybernetics propose a different perspective: they suggest that actions are selected and controlled by activating action effects and by continuously matching internal predictions with sensations. Active Inference offers a modern formulation of these ideas, in terms of inferential mechanisms and prediction-error-based control, which can be linked to neural mechanisms of living organisms. This article provides a technical illustration of Active Inference models in continuous time and a brief survey of Active Inference models that solve four kinds of control problems; namely, the control of goal-directed reaching movements, active sensing, the resolution of multisensory conflict during movement and the integration of decision-making and motor control. Crucially, in Active Inference, all these different facets of motor control emerge from the same optimization process - namely, the minimization of Free Energy - and do not require designing separate cost functions. Therefore, Active Inference provides a unitary perspective on various aspects of motor control that can inform both the study of biological control mechanisms and the design of artificial and robotic systems.},

  abstract={Despite being recognized as neurobiologically plausible, active inference faces difficulties when employed to simulate intelligent behaviour in complex environments due to its computational cost and the difficulty of specifying an appropriate target distribution for the agent. This paper introduces two solutions that work in concert to address these limitations. First, we present a novel planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons with drastically lower computational complexity. Second, inspired by Z-learning from control theory literature, we simplify the process of setting an appropriate target distribution for new and existing active inference planning schemes. Our first approach leverages the dynamic programming algorithm, known for its computational efficiency, to minimize the cost function used in planning through the Bellman-optimality principle. Accordingly, our algorithm recursively assesses the expected free energy of actions in the reverse temporal order. This improves computational efficiency by orders of magnitude and allows precise model learning and planning, even under uncertain conditions. Our method simplifies the planning process and shows meaningful behaviour even when specifying only the agent's final goal state. The proposed solutions make defining a target distribution from a goal state straightforward compared to the more complicated task of defining a temporally informed target distribution. The effectiveness of these methods is tested and demonstrated through simulations in standard grid-world tasks. These advances create new opportunities for various applications.},

  abstract={Humans perceive and interact with hundreds of objects every day. In doing so, they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries in the object's shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to understanding and modeling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper bound on their surprisal, i.e. their Free Energy. The Free Energy decomposes into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favor the least complex model, that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space. Second, we do a principal component analysis to demonstrate how the model encodes the principal axis of symmetry of the object in the latent space. Finally, we also demonstrate how more symmetrical representations can be exploited for better generalization in the context of manipulation.},

We combine an Active Inference planner (AIP) for adaptive high-level action selection and a novel Multi-Modal Model Predictive Path Integral controller (M3P2I) for low-level control. This results in a scheme that simultaneously adapts both high-level actions and low-level motions. The AIP generates alternative symbolic plans, each linked to a cost function for M3P2I. The latter employs a physics simulator for diverse trajectory rollouts, deriving optimal control by weighing the different samples according to their cost. This idea enables blending different robot skills for fluid and reactive plan execution, accommodating plan adjustments at both the high and low levels to cope, for instance, with dynamic obstacles or disturbances that invalidate the current plan. We have tested our approach in simulations and real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={Robust evidence suggests that humans explore their environment using a combination of topological landmarks and coarse-grained path integration. This approach relies on identifiable environmental features (topological landmarks) in tandem with estimations of distance and direction (coarse-grained path integration) to construct cognitive maps of the surroundings. This cognitive map is believed to exhibit a hierarchical structure, allowing efficient planning when solving complex navigation tasks. Inspired by human behaviour, this paper presents a scalable hierarchical active inference model for autonomous navigation, exploration, and goal-oriented behaviour. The model uses visual observation and motion perception to combine curiosity-driven exploration with goal-oriented behaviour. Motion is planned using different levels of reasoning, i.e., from context to place to motion. This allows for efficient navigation in new spaces and rapid progress toward a target. By incorporating these human navigational strategies and their hierarchical representation of the environment, this model proposes a new solution for autonomous navigation and exploration. The approach is validated through simulations in a mini-grid environment.},

Given the system's scale, the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) which are expressed as these requirements, must be broken down into smaller parts that can be decentralized. We present our framework for collaborative edge intelligence enabling individual edge devices to (1) develop a causal understanding of how to enforce their SLOs, and (2) transfer knowledge to speed up the onboarding of heterogeneous devices. Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming. Our results showed that edge devices required only ten training rounds to ensure four SLOs; furthermore, the underlying causal structures were also rationally explainable. The addition of new types of devices can be done a posteriori, the framework allowed them to reuse existing models, even though the device type had been unknown. Finally, rebalancing the load within a device cluster allowed individual edge devices to recover their SLO compliance after a network failure from 22% to 89%.},

  abstract={We introduce a new variant of contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome observations from an external information source, e.g. humans. In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions. Results for a simulated deep space search site selection problem show that, even if incorrect semantic observations are provided externally, e.g. by scientists, efficient decision-making and robust parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of conditions.},

  abstract={Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature; groups of animals, such as fish, birds, and ungulates appear to move as a whole, exhibiting a rich behavioral repertoire that ranges from directed movement to milling to disordered swarming. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local interactions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school). Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled particles, subject to self-generated motion and 'social forces' such as short-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However, organisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we introduce an approach to modelling collective behavior based on active inference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many empirically-observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling and directed motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference -- without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring the parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal non-trivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective decision-making accuracy. Finally, we show how agents can update their generative model over time, resulting in groups that are collectively more sensitive to external fluctuations and encode information more robustly.},

  abstract={In human spatial awareness, 3-D projective geometry structures information integration and action planning through perspective taking within an internal representation space. The way different perspectives are related and transform a world model defines a specific perception and imagination scheme. In mathematics, such collection of transformations corresponds to a 'group', whose 'actions' characterize the geometry of a space. Imbuing world models with a group structure may capture different agents' spatial awareness and affordance schemes. We used group action as a special class of policies for perspective-dependent control. We explored how such geometric structure impacts agents' behavior, comparing how the Euclidean versus projective groups act on epistemic value in active inference, drive curiosity, and exploration behaviors. We formally demonstrate and simulate how the groups induce distinct behaviors in a simple search task. The projective group's nonlinear magnification of information transformed epistemic value according to the choice of frame, generating behaviors of approach toward an object of interest. The projective group structure within the agent's world model contains the Projective Consciousness Model, which is know to capture key features of consciousness. On the other hand, the Euclidean group had no effect on epistemic value : no action was better than the initial idle state. In structuring a priori an agent's internal representation, we show how geometry can play a key role in information integration and action planning.},

We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain - and are constrained by - fast, phenotypic processes. The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness. Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively. In this view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a generative model, whose parameters are learned via natural (bayesian model selection). The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects. Perhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a population of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider populations - and nested meta-populations - of different natural kinds that influence each other. This paper is limited to a description of the mathematical apparatus and accompanying ideas. Subsequent work will use these methods for simulations and numerical analyses - and identify points of contact with related mathematical formulations of evolution.},

Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in behavioural neuroscience, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. The usefulness of active inference for RL is three-fold. \emph{a}) Active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma that usefully simulates biological agency. \emph{b}) It provides an explainable recipe to simulate behaviour, whence behaviour follows as an explainable mixture of exploration and exploitation under a generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model. \emph{c}) This framework is universal in the sense that it is theoretically possible to rewrite any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference as an active inference algorithm. Thus, active inference can be used as a tool to uncover and compare the commitments and assumptions of more specific models of agency.},

  abstract={We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.},

This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.},

  abstract={As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.},

In this paper we want to make the distinction between robot's internal and external worlds clear-cut. Can the robot learn about its environment, relying only on internally available information, including the sensor data? Are there mathematical conditions on the internal robot system which can be internally verified and make the robot's internal system mirror the structure of the environment? We prove that sufficiency is such a mathematical principle, and mathematically describe the emergence of the robot's internal structure isomorphic or bisimulation equivalent to that of the environment. A connection to the free-energy principle is established, when sufficiency is interpreted as a limit case of surprise minimization. As such, we show that surprise minimization leads to having an internal model isomorphic to the environment. This also parallels the Good Regulator Principle which states that controlling a system sufficiently well means having a model of it.

A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic. "How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns?" To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference, based on the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.},

Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.},

We demonstrate that a coupled agent of this kind is able to learn the dynamics of a double mass-spring-damper system, and drive it to a desired position through a balance of explorative and exploitative actions. It outperforms the uncoupled subagents in terms of surprise and goal alignment.},

  abstract={In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.},

It informs off-line design and supports real-time, online adaptation. It provides model-based explanations for behaviours observed in HCI, and new tools to measure important concepts such as agency and engagement. We discuss how Active Inference offers a new basis for a theory of interaction in HCI, tools for design of modern, complex sensor-based systems, and integration of artificial intelligence technologies, enabling it to cope with diversity in human users and contexts.

  abstract={We introduce structured active inference, a large generalization and formalization of active inference using the tools of categorical systems theory. We cast generative models formally as systems "on an interface", with the latter being a compositional abstraction of the usual notion of Markov blanket; agents are then 'controllers' for their generative models, formally dual to them. This opens the active inference landscape to new horizons, such as: agents with structured interfaces (e.g. with 'mode-dependence', or that interact with computer APIs); agents that can manage other agents; and 'meta-agents', that use active inference to change their (internal or external) structure. With structured interfaces, we also gain structured ('typed') policies, which are amenable to formal verification, an important step towards safe artificial agents. Moreover, we can make use of categorical logic to describe express agents' goals as formal predicates, whose satisfaction may be dependent on the interaction context. This points towards powerful compositional tools to constrain and control self-organizing ensembles of agents.},

  abstract={By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.},

  abstract={To handle unintended changes in the environment by agents, we propose an environment-centric active inference EC-AIF in which the Markov Blanket of active inference is defined starting from the environment. In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the "action" such as a robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent's "action," and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform "actions" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation of another robot arm.},

  abstract={Active inference helps us simulate adaptive behavior and decision-making in biological and artificial agents. Building on our previous work exploring the relationship between active inference, well-being, resilience, and sustainability, we present a computational model of an agent learning sustainable resource management strategies in both static and dynamic environments. The agent's behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics. In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume resources to satisfy its needs. In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent's actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability. This demonstrates how active inference can give rise to sustainable and resilient behaviors in the face of changing environmental conditions. We discuss the implications of our model, its limitations, and suggest future directions for integrating more complex agent-environment interactions.

  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) control through the application of active inference, a theory derived from neuroscience that conceptualizes the brain as a predictive machine. Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed "surprise") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.},

In this paper, we present a continual learning framework for agents operating in discrete time environments, using active inference as the foundation. We derive the mathematical formulations of variational and expected free energy and apply them to the design of a self-learning research agent.

In this work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's the resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE under a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory, we show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information value.

  abstract={Although research has produced promising results demonstrating the utility of active inference (AIF) in Markov decision processes (MDPs), there is relatively less work that builds AIF models in the context of environments and problems that take the form of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In POMDP scenarios, the agent must infer the unobserved environmental state from raw sensory observations, e.g., pixels in an image. Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate.

  abstract={Allostasis proposes that long-term viability of a living system is achieved through anticipatory adjustments of its physiology and behaviour: emphasising physiological and affective stress as an adaptive state of adaptation that minimizes long-term prediction errors. More recently, the active inference framework (AIF) has also sought to explain action and long-term adaptation through the minimization of future errors (free energy), through the learning of statistical contingencies of the world, offering a formalism for allostatic regulation. We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner. In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive, allostatic mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology. We evaluate this using a computational model in simulations using an active inference agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment. Our results find that allostatic functions of cortisol (stress), secreted as a function of prediction errors, provide adaptive advantages to the agent's long-term physiological regulation. We argue that the coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.},

This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning that ensures safe task execution, optimizes trade-offs between objectives, and adheres to user preferences. The framework has two main layers: a multi-objective task planner and a high-level selector. The planning layer generates a set of optimal trade-off plans that guarantee satisfaction of a temporal logic task. The selector uses active inference to decide which generated plan best complies with user preferences and aids learning. Operating iteratively, the framework updates a parameterized learning model based on collected data. Case studies and benchmarks on both manipulation and mobile robots show that our framework outperforms other methods and (i) learns multiple optimal trade-offs, (ii) adheres to a user preference, and (iii) allows the user to adjust the balance between (i) and (ii).},

  abstract={Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.},

  abstract={The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it. Moving the data handling towards the edge of the computing spectrum guarantees better distribution of load and, in principle, lower latency and better privacy. However, managing such a structure is complex, especially when requirements, also referred to Service Level Objectives (SLOs), specified by applications' owners and infrastructure managers need to be ensured. Despite the rich number of proposals of Machine Learning (ML) based management solutions, researchers and practitioners yet struggle to guarantee long-term prediction and control, and accurate troubleshooting. Therefore, we present a novel ML paradigm based on Active Inference (AIF) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, thanks to AIF and its causal structures, our method guarantees full transparency on the decision making, making the interpretation of the results and the troubleshooting effortless.},

The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on adaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98% fulfillment rate.},

  abstract={Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications, meeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of special purpose validated LLMs in medicine.},

It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data.

Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal movements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to the ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and leading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this issue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational agent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the fetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler signal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the steering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps. The fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the estimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately track the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability. Additionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize positional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation performance. In conclusion, this work showcases the power of closed-loop cognitive ultrasound in boosting the capabilities of traditional systems.},

  abstract={Active inference is a leading theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Active inference is based on the expected free energy, which is mostly justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations, e.g., the risk plus ambiguity and information gain / pragmatic value formulations. This paper seek to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition, i.e., the unification problem. Then, we study two settings, each one having its own root expected free energy definition. In the first setting, no justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it. However, in this setting, the agent cannot have arbitrary prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition is known, but this setting only accounts for two formulations, i.e., the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations.},

  abstract={To determine an optimal plan for complex tasks, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. Here, we present an active inference approach that exploits discrete and continuous processing, based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations in relation to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to easily interpret and flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.},

  abstract={The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called ''programmable'' networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.   To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.},

We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility.

  abstract={Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.},

  abstract={Neuroimaging data, particularly from techniques like MRI or PET, offer rich but complex information about brain structure and activity. To manage this complexity, latent representation models - such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) - are increasingly applied. These models are designed to reduce high-dimensional neuroimaging data to lower-dimensional latent spaces, where key patterns and variations related to brain function can be identified. By modeling these latent spaces, researchers hope to gain insights into the biology and function of the brain, including how its structure changes with age or disease, or how it encodes sensory information, predicts and adapts to new inputs. This review discusses how these models are used for clinical applications, like disease diagnosis and progression monitoring, but also for exploring fundamental brain mechanisms such as active inference and predictive coding. These approaches provide a powerful tool for both understanding and simulating the brain's complex computational tasks, potentially advancing our knowledge of cognition, perception, and neural disorders.},

  abstract={An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.},

  abstract={This study aims to place Lorenzo Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism within the broader context of current work on information, computation, and cognition. Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and active inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant entities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of conventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models prioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and potentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of organization. Gaining a better info-computational grasp of cognitive embodiment is crucial for the advancement of fields such as biology, evolutionary studies, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and more.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, their high computational costs and memory demands during inference pose significant challenges. Adaptive sparse activation inference, which activates only a small number of neurons for each token, offers a novel way to accelerate model inference without degrading performance, showing great potential for resource-constrained hardware devices. Nevertheless, existing methods predict activated neurons based on individual tokens with additional MLP, which involve frequent changes in activation maps and resource calls, limiting the acceleration benefits of sparse activation. In this paper, we introduce CoreInfer, an MLP-free adaptive sparse activation inference method based on sentence-level prediction. Specifically, we propose the concept of sentence-wise core neurons, which refers to the subset of neurons most critical for a given sentence, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness. To determine the core neurons, we explore the correlation between core neurons and the sentence's semantics. Remarkably, we discovered that core neurons exhibit both stability and similarity in relation to the sentence's semantics -- an insight overlooked by previous studies. Building on this finding, we further design two semantic-based methods for predicting core neurons to fit different input scenarios. In CoreInfer, the core neurons are determined during the pre-filling stage and fixed during the encoding stage, enabling zero-cost sparse inference. We evaluated the model generalization and task generalization of CoreInfer across various models and tasks. Notably, on an NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU, CoreInfer achieved a 10.33 times and 2.72 times speedup compared to the Huggingface implementation and PowerInfer, respectively.},

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.},

  abstract={Learning to infer labels in an open world, i.e., in an environment where the target "labels" are unknown, is an important characteristic for achieving autonomy. Foundation models pre-trained on enormous amounts of data have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space. In an open world, this target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large, which severely restricts the performance of such models. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision using two steps. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference.},

The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics - of certain kinds of particles - as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency.

  abstract={This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain. Specifically, we use the tools of contemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for approximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new notion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by compositional game theory, we define fibrations of statistical games and classify various problems of statistical inference as corresponding sections: the chain rule of the relative entropy is formalized as a strict section, while maximum likelihood estimation and the free energy give lax sections. In the process, we introduce a new notion of `copy-composition'.   On the `semantic' side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems (particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and continuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show collect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras for multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which control lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics. Accordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the bidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to compose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses and polynomial functors.},

Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and exposure of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.},

  abstract={Under what circumstances can a system be said to have beliefs and goals, and how do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work has proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of a system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an external world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it attributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent with Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its possible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of interpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions. To do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov processes (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a POMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about the hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according to its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation of this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible formulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a step towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to be an agent.},

  abstract={This white paper lays out a vision of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade (and beyond). Its denouement is a cyber-physical ecosystem of natural and synthetic sense-making, in which humans are integral participants -- what we call ''shared intelligence''. This vision is premised on active inference, a formulation of adaptive behavior that can be read as a physics of intelligence, and which inherits from the physics of self-organization. In this context, we understand intelligence as the capacity to accumulate evidence for a generative model of one's sensed world -- also known as self-evidencing. Formally, this corresponds to maximizing (Bayesian) model evidence, via belief updating over several scales: i.e., inference, learning, and model selection. Operationally, this self-evidencing can be realized via (variational) message passing or belief propagation on a factor graph. Crucially, active inference foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of each agent's generative world model provide a common ground or frame of reference. Active inference plays a foundational role in this ecology of belief sharing -- leading to a formal account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. We also consider the kinds of communication protocols that must be developed to enable such an ecosystem of intelligences and motivate the development of a shared hyper-spatial modeling language and transaction protocol, as a first -- and key -- step towards such an ecology.},

  abstract={Autonomous robots need to learn the categories of various places by exploring their environments and interacting with users. However, preparing training datasets with linguistic instructions from users is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, effective exploration is essential for appropriate concept formation and rapid environmental coverage. To address this issue, we propose an active inference method, referred to as spatial concept formation with information gain-based active exploration (SpCoAE) that combines sequential Bayesian inference using particle filters and information gain-based destination determination in a probabilistic generative model. This study interprets the robot's action as a selection of destinations to ask the user, `What kind of place is this?' in the context of active inference. This study provides insights into the technical aspects of the proposed method, including active perception and exploration by the robot, and how the method can enable mobile robots to learn spatial concepts through active exploration. Our experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the SpCoAE in efficiently determining a destination for learning appropriate spatial concepts in home environments.},

  abstract={Flexible, goal-directed behavior is a fundamental aspect of human life. Based on the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference formalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience perspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic, temporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free energy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with obstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well in procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of obstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations.},

Specifically, we explain how (i) leveraging the symplectic geometry of Hamiltonian systems enable us to construct (accelerated) sampling and optimisation methods, (ii) the theory of Hilbertian subspaces and Stein operators provides a general methodology to obtain robust estimators, (iii) preserving the information geometry of decision-making yields adaptive agents that perform active inference.

The resulting model enables specific predictions of correlations between synaptic activity, dendritic remodeling, and trophic reward.

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13113v2},
  abstract={We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the goal of the joint task (e.g., should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent's movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a ''leaderless'' joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other's movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a "leader-follower" joint action. It shows that when one agent ("leader") knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent ("follower") infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of "leaderless" and "leader-follower" joint actions observed in human-human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05776v1},
  abstract={This paper conjectures and validates a framework that allows for action during inference in supervised neural networks. Supervised neural networks are constructed with the objective to maximize their performance metric in any given task. This is done by reducing free energy and its associated surprisal during training. However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks is a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we provide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative and discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt, thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a plug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning.},

We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities.},

  abstract={Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that basal cognition and sentient behaviour are emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks, respectively. Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem), that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behaviour emerges under an inductive form of active inference.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework for describing how (intelligent) systems self-organise into coherent, stable structures by minimising a free energy functional. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that specifically details how systems that are able to plan for the future (agents) function by minimising particular free energy functionals that incorporate information seeking components. This paper is the first in a series of two where we derive a synthetic version of AIF on free form factor graphs. The present paper focuses on deriving a local version of the free energy functionals used for AIF. This enables us to construct a version of AIF which applies to arbitrary graphical models and interfaces with prior work on message passing algorithms. The resulting messages are derived in our companion paper. We also identify a gap in the graphical notation used for factor graphs. While factor graphs are great at expressing a generative model, they have so far been unable to specify the full optimisation problem including constraints. To solve this problem we develop Constrained Forney-style Factor Graph (CFFG) notation which permits a fully graphical description of variational inference objectives. We then proceed to show how CFFG's can be used to reconstruct prior algorithms for AIF as well as derive new ones. The latter is demonstrated by deriving an algorithm that permits direct policy inference for AIF agents, circumventing a long standing scaling issue that has so far hindered the application of AIF in industrial settings. We demonstrate our algorithm on the classic T-maze task and show that it reproduces the information seeking behaviour that is a hallmark feature of AIF.},

  abstract={Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physical principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems.},

Their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e., controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.},

Recently, reasearch has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte-Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature, then, we progresively build a deep active inference agent. For two agents, we have experimented with five definitions of the expected free energy and three different action selection strategies. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximise rewards. Finally, we compare the similarity of the representation learned by the layers of various agents using centered kernel alignment. Importantly, the agent maximising reward and the agent minimising expected free energy learn very similar representations except for the last layer of the critic network (reflecting the difference in learning objective), and the variance layers of the transition and encoder networks. We found that the reward maximising agent is a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is because the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down, and does not gather enough data for the other actions. In contrast, the agent maximising reward, keeps on selecting the actions left and right, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two agents is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the agent minimising expected free energy picks a single action (down), and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small.},

We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.},

As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete subchannels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time.

  abstract={This work studies how brain-inspired neural ensembles equipped with local Hebbian plasticity can perform active inference (AIF) in order to control dynamical agents. A generative model capturing the environment dynamics is learned by a network composed of two distinct Hebbian ensembles: a posterior network, which infers latent states given the observations, and a state transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems. These results motivate further investigations of Hebbian learning for the design of AIF networks that can learn environment dynamics without the need for revisiting past buffered experiences.},

  abstract={Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications.},

  abstract={Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-controlled insertion policies to situations where the peg is rigidly fixed to the end-effector. While vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile feedback that could potentially address these issues, utilizing them to learn effective tactile policies is both computationally intensive and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a robust tactile insertion policy that can align the tilted peg with the hole using active inference, without the need for extensive training on large datasets. Our approach employs a dual-policy architecture: one policy focuses on insertion, integrating force control and RL to guide the object into the hole, while the other policy performs active inference based on tactile feedback to align the tilted peg with the hole. In real-world experiments, our dual-policy architecture achieved 90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than 0.1 mm, significantly outperforming previous methods that lack tactile sensory feedback (5%). To assess the generalizability of our alignment policy, we conducted experiments with five different pegs, demonstrating its effective adaptation to multiple objects.},

  abstract={We present a novel computational model employing hierarchical active inference to simulate reading and eye movements. The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.},

  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) is a common tool to interpret and predict the behavior of distributed computing systems, e.g., to optimize the task distribution between devices. As more and more data is created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data processing and ML training are carried out by edge devices in close proximity. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and dynamically adapted with the help of ML. However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state. Moreover, as the prediction accuracy decreases, the reporting device should actively resolve uncertainties to improve the model's precision. Such a level of self-determination could be provided by Active Inference (ACI) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We encompassed these concepts in a single action-perception cycle, which we implemented for distributed agents in a smart manufacturing use case. As a result, we showed how our ACI agent was able to quickly and traceably solve an optimization problem while fulfilling QoS requirements.},

  abstract={Understanding adaptive human driving behavior, in particular how drivers manage uncertainty, is of key importance for developing simulated human driver models that can be used in the evaluation and development of autonomous vehicles. However, existing traffic psychology models of adaptive driving behavior either lack computational rigor or only address specific scenarios and/or behavioral phenomena. While models developed in the fields of machine learning and robotics can effectively learn adaptive driving behavior from data, due to their black box nature, they offer little or no explanation of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior. Thus, a generalizable, interpretable, computational model of adaptive human driving behavior is still lacking. This paper proposes such a model based on active inference, a behavioral modeling framework originating in computational neuroscience. The model offers a principled solution to how humans trade progress against caution through policy selection based on the single mandate to minimize expected free energy. This casts goal-seeking and information-seeking (uncertainty-resolving) behavior under a single objective function, allowing the model to seamlessly resolve uncertainty as a means to obtain its goals. We apply the model in two apparently disparate driving scenarios that require managing uncertainty, (1) driving past an occluding object and (2) visual time sharing between driving and a secondary task, and show how human-like adaptive driving behavior emerges from the single principle of expected free energy minimization.},

  abstract={Commonly used objective functions (losses) for a supervised optimization of discriminative neural network classifiers were either distribution-based or metric-based. The distribution-based losses could compromise the generalization or cause classification biases towards the dominant classes of an imbalanced class-sample distribution. The metric-based losses could make the network model independent of any distribution and thus improve its generalization. However, they could still be biased towards the dominant classes and could suffer from discrepancies when a class was absent in both the reference (ground truth) and the predicted labels. In this paper, we proposed a novel optimization process which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of the training samples but also provided a mechanism to tackle errors in the reference labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the network and a novel objective function for the optimizations. The algorithm was the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into a multiclass classification problem. The proposed objective function was the expected free energy of a prospective active inference and could incorporate the candidate labels, the original reference labels, and the priors of the training samples while still being distribution-based. The incorporation of the priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference labels but also allowed to reduce classification biases towards the dominant classes by focusing the attention of the neural network on important but minority foreground classes.},

  abstract={Resource allocation is of crucial importance in wireless communications. However, it is extremely challenging to design efficient resource allocation schemes for future wireless communication networks since the formulated resource allocation problems are generally non-convex and consist of various coupled variables. Moreover, the dynamic changes of practical wireless communication environment and user service requirements thirst for efficient real-time resource allocation. To tackle these issues, a novel partially observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed for realizing intelligent resource allocation. A belief based learning method is exploited for updating the policy by minimizing the variational free energy. A decentralized training with a decentralized execution multi-agent strategy is designed to overcome the limitations of the partially observable state information. Exploited the proposed framework, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is developed for a spectrum sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with dynamic transmission rate requirements as an example. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly improve the sum transmission rate of the secondary network compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the convergence speed of the proposed PODMAI is significantly improved compared with the conventional reinforcement learning framework. Overall, our proposed framework can enrich the intelligent resource allocation frameworks and pave the way for realizing real-time resource allocation.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11463v3},
  abstract={Cognitive problem-solving benefits from cognitive maps aiding navigation and planning. Previous studies revealed that cognitive maps for physical space navigation involve hippocampal (HC) allocentric codes, while cognitive maps for abstract task space engage medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) task-specific codes. Solving challenging cognitive tasks requires integrating these two types of maps. This is exemplified by spatial alternation tasks in multi-corridor settings, where animals like rodents are rewarded upon executing an alternation pattern in maze corridors. Existing studies demonstrated the HC - mPFC circuit's engagement in spatial alternation tasks and that its disruption impairs task performance. Yet, a comprehensive theory explaining how this circuit integrates task-related and spatial information is lacking. We advance a novel hierarchical active inference model clarifying how the HC - mPFC circuit enables the resolution of spatial alternation tasks, by merging physical and task-space cognitive maps. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the model's dual layers acquire effective cognitive maps for navigation within physical (HC map) and task (mPFC map) spaces, using a biologically-inspired approach: a clone-structured cognitive graph. The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. Importantly, disrupting inter-layer communication impairs difficult decisions, consistent with empirical findings. The same model showcases the ability to switch between multiple alternation rules. However, inhibiting message transmission between the two layers results in perseverative behavior, consistent with empirical findings. In summary, our model provides a mechanistic account of how the HC - mPFC circuit supports spatial alternation tasks and how its disruption impairs task performance.},

  abstract={This paper considers neural representation through the lens of active inference, a normative framework for understanding brain function. It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and observations (as scored with variational free energy). The ensuing analysis suggests that the brain learns generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action-perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from "explicit" models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people - to "action-oriented models" that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities - and the gradual transition from "pragmatic" to "detached" neural representations. The analysis on offer foregrounds the diverse roles that generative models play in cognitive processes and the evolution of neural representation.},

  abstract={Future wireless networks will need to improve adaptive resource allocation and decision-making to handle the increasing number of intelligent devices. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored for their potential in real-time decision-making. Moreover, cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) is envisioned as a remedy to address spectrum scarcity and enable massive connectivity. This paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive NOMA network. We aim to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannel and power allocation based on the UAV's mobility at each time step. This is often formulated as an optimization problem with random variables. However, conventional optimization algorithms normally introduce significant complexity, and machine learning methods often rely on large but partially representative datasets to build solution models, assuming stationary testing data. Consequently, inference strategies for non stationary events are often overlooked. In this study, we introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to solve this complex problem. The framework involves creating a training dataset using random or iterative methods to find suboptimal resource allocations. This dataset trains a mobile UAV offline, enabling it to learn a generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. The UAV then uses this model for online inference. The method incrementally derives new generative models from training data by identifying dynamic equilibrium conditions between required actions and variables, represented within a unique dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations, showing efficient performance compared to suboptimal baseline schemes.},

Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.   We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.   In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.   Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.},

  abstract={Lowering radiation dose per view and utilizing sparse views per scan are two common CT scan modes, albeit often leading to distorted images characterized by noise and streak artifacts. Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) strives to evaluate perceptual quality in alignment with what radiologists perceive, which plays an important role in advancing low-dose CT reconstruction techniques. An intriguing direction involves developing BIQA methods that mimic the operational characteristic of the human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) theory reveals that the HVS actively deduces primary content to enhance comprehension. In this study, we introduce an innovative BIQA metric that emulates the active inference process of IGM. Initially, an active inference module, implemented as a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is constructed to anticipate the primary content. Then, the dissimilarity map is derived by assessing the interrelation between the distorted image and its primary content. Subsequently, the distorted image and dissimilarity map are combined into a multi-channel image, which is inputted into a transformer-based image quality evaluator. Remarkably, by exclusively utilizing this transformer-based quality evaluator, we won the second place in the MICCAI 2023 low-dose computed tomography perceptual image quality assessment grand challenge. Leveraging the DDPM-derived primary content, our approach further improves the performance on the challenge dataset.},

  abstract={Although the latent spaces learned by distinct neural networks are not generally directly comparable, recent work in machine learning has shown that it is possible to use the similarities and differences among latent space vectors to derive "relative representations" with comparable representational power to their "absolute" counterparts, and which are nearly identical across models trained on similar data distributions. Apart from their intrinsic interest in revealing the underlying structure of learned latent spaces, relative representations are useful to compare representations across networks as a generic proxy for convergence, and for zero-shot model stitching.   In this work we examine an extension of relative representations to discrete state-space models, using Clone-Structured Cognitive Graphs (CSCGs) for 2D spatial localization and navigation as a test case. Our work shows that the probability vectors computed during message passing can be used to define relative representations on CSCGs, enabling effective communication across agents trained using different random initializations and training sequences, and on only partially similar spaces. We introduce a technique for zero-shot model stitching that can be applied post hoc, without the need for using relative representations during training. This exploratory work is intended as a proof-of-concept for the application of relative representations to the study of cognitive maps in neuroscience and AI.},

Active inference allows such systems to adapt and personalize themselves to nuanced individual preferences. To enable this ability for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), one may prompt them to ask users questions to infer their preferences, transforming the language models into more robust, interactive systems. However, out of the box, these models are not efficient at extracting preferences: the questions they generate are not informative, requiring a high number of user interactions and impeding the usability of the downstream system. In this work, we introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. Our algorithm uses a probabilistic model whose conditional distributions are defined by prompting an LLM, and returns questions that optimize expected entropy and expected model change. Results in a simplified interactive web shopping setting with real product items show that an LLM equipped with our entropy reduction algorithm outperforms baselines with the same underlying LLM on task performance while using fewer user interactions.},

Based on the simulation results, we designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of the designed gaze behavior of the avatar robot. The gaze behavior expressed more of the remote participant's attention and interest in local participants, but local participants expressed fewer opinions in the meeting tasks. The results suggest that gaze behavior increased the presence of the remote participant and discouraged the local participant from speaking in the context of the experimental task.

To identify the anomalies, the decision-making agent is allowed to observe a subset of the processes at each time instant. Also, probing each process has an associated cost. Our objective is to design a sequential selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time with the goal to minimize the delay in making the decision and the total sensing cost. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes. This formulation utilizes both a Bayesian log-likelihood ratio-based reward and an entropy-based reward. The problem is then solved using two approaches: 1) a deep reinforcement learning-based approach where we design both deep Q-learning and policy gradient actor-critic algorithms; and 2) a deep active inference-based approach. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and show that our algorithms adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.},

  abstract={In the era of big data, the ubiquity of location-aware portable devices provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand inhabitants' behavior and their interactions with the built environments. Among the widely used data resources, mobile phone data is the one passively collected and has the largest coverage in the population. However, mobile operators cannot pinpoint one user within meters, leading to the difficulties in activity inference. To that end, we propose a data analysis framework to identify user's activity via coupling the mobile phone data with location-based social networks (LBSN) data. The two datasets are integrated into a Bayesian inference module, considering people's circadian rhythms in both time and space. Specifically, the framework considers the pattern of arrival time to each type of facility and the spatial distribution of facilities. The former can be observed from the LBSN Data and the latter is provided by the points of interest (POIs) dataset. Taking Shanghai as an example, we reconstruct the activity chains of 1,000,000 active mobile phone users and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of each activity type. We assess the results with some official surveys and a real-world check-in dataset collected in Shanghai, indicating that the proposed method can capture and analyze human activities effectively. Next, we cluster users' inferred activity chains with a topic model to understand the behavior of different groups of users. This data analysis framework provides an example of reconstructing and understanding the activity of the population at an urban scale with big data fusion.},

  abstract={Learning to infer labels in an open world, i.e., in an environment where the target ``labels'' are unknown, is an important characteristic for achieving autonomy. Foundation models, pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label's search space, i.e., candidate labels provided in the prompt. This target search space can be unknown or exceptionally large in an open world, severely restricting their performance. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-step, neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - Action Learning with Grounded Object recognition that uses symbolic knowledge stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities in egocentric videos with limited supervision. First, we propose a neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses object-centric vision-language models as a noisy oracle to ground objects in the video through evidence-based reasoning. Second, driven by prior commonsense knowledge, we discover plausible activities through an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action (verb) concepts in the video. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (EPIC-Kitchens, GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze Plus, and Charades-Ego) demonstrate its performance on open-world activity inference. We also show that ALGO can be extended to zero-shot inference and demonstrate its competitive performance on the Charades-Ego dataset.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior. However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE) perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment. Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected reward in significantly more environmental scenarios. We conclude that CBFE optimization by message passing suggests a general mechanism for epistemic-aware AIF in free-form generative models.},

  abstract={This work presents a fault-tolerant control scheme for sensory faults in robotic manipulators based on active inference. In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.},

  abstract={Active inference has emerged as an alternative approach to control problems given its intuitive (probabilistic) formalism. However, despite its theoretical utility, computational implementations have largely been restricted to low-dimensional, deterministic settings. This paper highlights that this is a consequence of the inability to adequately model stochastic transition dynamics, particularly when an extensive policy (i.e., action trajectory) space must be evaluated during planning. Fortunately, recent advancements propose a modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control setting. For this, we simulate the classic windy grid-world task with additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of transition dynamics; and 3) partial observability. Our results demonstrate the advantage of using active inference, compared to reinforcement learning, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.},

  abstract={A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions. The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off, served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already established bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and animal behaviour.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01210v1},
  abstract={Working together on complex collaborative tasks requires agents to coordinate their actions. Doing this explicitly or completely prior to the actual interaction is not always possible nor sufficient. Agents also need to continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their own behavior appropriately. Here we investigate how efficient, automatic coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving. We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents (HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a perception-action system based on predictive processing and active inference. Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent influence another agent's predictive beliefs about its own goals and intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent's own task behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent state of the art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings were the agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent coordination, and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative cognitive agents.},

  abstract={Active Inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents, in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing e.g., for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Secondly, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other pre-derived message update rules, without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general, and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.},

  abstract={To date, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between highly autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.},

  abstract={In this paper we present AIDA, which is an active inference-based agent that iteratively designs a personalized audio processing algorithm through situated interactions with a human client. The target application of AIDA is to propose on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the "most interesting alternative" as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.) are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph.

The thermodynamic free-energy principle describes an organism's homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical free-energy cost. In contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism's homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational free energy. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents a free-energy minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by free-energy minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as Schr{ö}dinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.},

  abstract={In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.},

  abstract={Recently machine learning using neural networks (NN) has been developed, and many new methods have been suggested. These methods are optimized for the type of input data and work very effectively, but they cannot be used with any kind of input data universally. On the other hand, the human brain is universal for any kind of problem, and we will be able to construct artificial general intelligence if we can mimic the system of how the human brain works. We consider how the human brain learns things uniformly, and find that the essence of learning is the compression of information. We suggest a toy NN model which mimics the system of the human brain, and we show that the NN can compress the input information without ad hoc treatment, only by setting the loss function properly. The loss function is expressed as the sum of the self-information to remember and the loss of the information along with the compression, and its minimum corresponds to the self-information of the original data. To evaluate the self-information to remember, we provided the concept of memory. The memory expresses the compressed information, and the learning proceeds by referring to previous memories. There are many similarities between this NN and the human brain, and this NN is a realization of the free-energy principle which is considered to be a unified theory of the human brain.

In this paper, we derive the probabilistic interpretation of the successor representation in terms of Bayesian filtering and thus design a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations instead of model-based planning. We demonstrate that active inference successor representations have significant advantages over current active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate how the successor representation agent can generalize to changing reward functions such as variants of the expected free energy.},

  abstract={Robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades. One of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also informative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a hard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in order to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show that the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the agent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically. Finally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail.},

Recently, efforts have been made to learn state space representations automatically from observations using deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be used as a generative model for sequential data.

To remedy this, we introduce 'object-based active inference' (OBAI), marrying AIF with recent deep object-based neural networks. OBAI represents distinct objects with separate variational beliefs, and uses selective attention to route inputs to their corresponding object slots. Object representations are endowed with independent action-based dynamics. The dynamics and generative model are learned from experience with a simple environment (active multi-dSprites). We show that OBAI learns to correctly segment the action-perturbed objects from video input, and to manipulate these objects towards arbitrary goals.},

  abstract={Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. Recently, two versions of branching time active inference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the number of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper, we resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several observations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we allow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference algorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition mappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two optimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of the dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites images. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve 96.9\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was able to solve 98.6\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach ($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task completly (100\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been implemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a graphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs, planning process and behaviour.},

  abstract={When studying unconstrained behaviour and allowing mice to leave their cage to navigate a complex labyrinth, the mice exhibit foraging behaviour in the labyrinth searching for rewards, returning to their home cage now and then, e.g. to drink. Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do not follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have very little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model for navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states and poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes inferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the environment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to find trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's behaviour. In this paper, we explore ways of incorporating before-unvisited paths in the planning algorithm, by using the low level generative model to imagine potential, yet undiscovered paths. We demonstrate a proof of concept in a grid-world environment, showing how an agent can accurately predict a new, shorter path in the map leading to its starting point, using a generative model learnt from pixel-based observations.},

This paper underlines flaws associated with the conventional knowledge-based market, including but not limited to excessive financing concentration, ineffective information exchange, a lack of security, mapping of entities, etc. The authors present a decentralized framework for the knowledge marketplace incorporating technologies such as blockchain, active inference, zero-knowledge proof, etc. The proposed decentralized framework provides not only an efficient mapping mechanism to map entities in the marketplace but also a more secure and controlled way to share knowledge and services among various stakeholders.},

  abstract={The active inference framework (AIF) is a promising new computational framework grounded in contemporary neuroscience that can produce human-like behavior through reward-based learning. In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored -- that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed "neural" AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy. Together, these results demonstrate the use of AIF as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans.},

  abstract={The underlying processes that enable self-perception are crucial for understanding multisensory integration, body perception and action, and the development of the self. Previous computational models have overlooked an essential aspect: affective or emotional components cannot be uncoupled from the self-recognition process. Hence, here we propose a computational approach to study self-recognition that incorporates affect using state-of-the-art hierarchical active inference. We evaluated our model in a synthetic experiment inspired by the mirror self-recognition test, a benchmark for evaluating self-recognition in animals and humans alike. Results show that i) negative valence arises when the agent recognizes itself and learns something unexpected about its internal states. Furthermore, ii) the agent in the presence of strong prior expectations of a negative affective state will avoid the mirror altogether in anticipation of an undesired learning process. Both results are in line with current literature on human self-recognition.},

  abstract={Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs. However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled, non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of 3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet dataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category, while still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural network. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform best when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07946v3},
  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for developing decision-making agents that aim to maximize rewards, specified by an external supervisor, within fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPs by either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or by inferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However, aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces. Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to perform well, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty in the inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, as in RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due to the computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose a unified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL, enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming their aforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiate our findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives for utilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental results demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solving continuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnesses information-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-free problems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisor optional.},

Features and pose information are extracted from a scene and then dynamically routed through a hierarchy of vector-valued nodes called 'capsules' to create an implicit scene graph, with the ultimate aim of learning vision directly as inverse graphics.

In this paper, we derive an alternative capsule routing algorithm utilizing iterative inference under sparsity constraints. We then introduce an explicit probabilistic generative model for capsule networks based on the self-attention operation in transformer networks and show how it is related to a variant of predictive coding networks using Von-Mises-Fisher (VMF) circular Gaussian distributions.},

However, in robot control, moving an arm's end-effector to a target position or along a target trajectory requires accurate forward and inverse models. Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. We evaluated the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator, and conclude with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control.},

For example, our targeted attacks can poison <0.1% of the training dataset to boost the performance of inference attacks by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Further, an adversary who controls a significant fraction of the training data (e.g., 50%) can launch untargeted attacks that enable 8x more precise inference on all other users' otherwise-private data points.

  abstract={Embarrassingly parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploits parallel computing to scale Bayesian inference to large datasets by using a two-step approach. First, MCMC is run in parallel on (sub)posteriors defined on data partitions. Then, a server combines local results. While efficient, this framework is very sensitive to the quality of subposterior sampling. Common sampling problems such as missing modes or misrepresentation of low-density regions are amplified -- instead of being corrected -- in the combination phase, leading to catastrophic failures. In this work, we propose a novel combination strategy to mitigate this issue. Our strategy, Parallel Active Inference (PAI), leverages Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling and active learning. After fitting GPs to subposteriors, PAI (i) shares information between GP surrogates to cover missing modes; and (ii) uses active sampling to individually refine subposterior approximations. We validate PAI in challenging benchmarks, including heavy-tailed and multi-modal posteriors and a real-world application to computational neuroscience. Empirical results show that PAI succeeds where previous methods catastrophically fail, with a small communication overhead.},

These models account for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimisation and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimisation that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase advantages of precision-modulation for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning.},

Specifically, CASAS dataset is employed to train a Random Forest (RF) model for activity inference. Then, another RF model trained by the output data of activity inference is used for abnormal activity monitoring. Particularly, RF is chosen for these tasks because of its balanced trade offs between accuracy, time efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability. Moreover, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilised to forecast the disease related activity trend of a patient. Consequently, the accuracy of two RF classifiers designed for activity inference and abnormal activity detection is greater than 99 percent and 94 percent, respectively. Furthermore, using the duration of sleep as an example, the LSTM model achieves accurate and evident future trends prediction.},

  abstract={Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

  abstract={Active inference is a normative framework for explaining behaviour under the free energy principle -- a theory of self-organisation originating in neuroscience. It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point of optimal inference.},

  abstract={Active inference introduces a theory describing action-perception loops via the minimisation of variational (and expected) free energy or, under simplifying assumptions, (weighted) prediction error. Recently, active inference has been proposed as part of a new and unifying framework in the cognitive sciences: predictive processing. Predictive processing is often associated with traditional computational theories of the mind, strongly relying on internal representations presented in the form of generative models thought to explain different functions of living and cognitive systems. In this work, we introduce an active inference formulation of the Watt centrifugal governor, a system often portrayed as the canonical "anti-representational" metaphor for cognition. We identify a generative model of a steam engine for the governor, and derive a set of equations describing "perception" and "action" processes as a form of prediction error minimisation. In doing so, we firstly challenge the idea of generative models as explicit internal representations for cognitive systems, suggesting that such models serve only as implicit descriptions for an observer. Secondly, we consider current proposals of predictive processing as a theory of cognition, focusing on some of its potential shortcomings and in particular on the idea that virtually any system admits a description in terms of prediction error minimisation, suggesting that this theory may offer limited explanatory power for cognitive systems. Finally, as a silver lining we emphasise the instrumental role this framework can nonetheless play as a mathematical tool for modelling cognitive architectures interpreted in terms of Bayesian (active) inference.},

Although many existing robotics studies use a forward model framework, there are generalization issues with high degrees of freedom. The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor plans within the range of habituated trajectories.},

  abstract={When agents interact socially with different intentions, conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.},

Interaction theorists consider primary intersubjectivity a non-mentalist, pre-theoretical, non-conceptual sort of processes that ground a certain level of communication and understanding, and provide support to higher-level cognitive skills. We argue this sort of low level cognitive interaction, where control is shared in dyadic encounters, is susceptible of study with neural robots. Hence, in this work we pursue three main objectives. Firstly, from the concept of active inference we study primary intersubjectivity as a second person perspective experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition, and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction. Secondly, we propose an open-source methodology named \textit{neural robotics library} (NRL) for experimental human-robot interaction, and a demonstration program for interacting in real-time with a virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot). Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot (hybrid) intersubjectivity can contribute to human science research, such as to the fields of developmental psychology, educational technology, and cognitive rehabilitation.},

  abstract={The connections between optimal control and Bayesian inference have long been recognised, with the field of stochastic (optimal) control combining these frameworks for the solution of partially observable control problems. In particular, for the linear case with quadratic functions and Gaussian noise, stochastic control has shown remarkable results in different fields, including robotics, reinforcement learning and neuroscience, especially thanks to the established duality of estimation and control processes. Following this idea we recently introduced a formulation of PID control, one of the most popular methods from classical control, based on active inference, a theory with roots in variational Bayesian methods, and applications in the biological and neural sciences. In this work, we highlight the advantages of our previous formulation and introduce new and more general ways to tackle some existing problems in current controller design procedures. In particular, we consider 1) a gradient-based tuning rule for the parameters (or gains) of a PID controller, 2) an implementation of multiple degrees of freedom for independent responses to different types of signals (e.g., two-degree-of-freedom PID), and 3) a novel time-domain formalisation of the performance-robustness trade-off in terms of tunable constraints (i.e., priors in a Bayesian model) of a single cost functional, variational free energy.},

We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

  abstract={While game theory has been transformative for decision-making, the assumptions made can be overly restrictive in certain instances. In this work, we investigate some of the underlying assumptions of rationality, such as mutual consistency and best response, and consider ways to relax these assumptions using concepts from level-$k$ reasoning and quantal response equilibrium (QRE) respectively. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic two-parameter model called the Quantal Hierarchy model, which can relax both mutual consistency and best response while still approximating level-$k$, QRE, or typical Nash equilibrium behaviour in the limiting cases. The model is based on a recursive form of the variational free energy principle, representing higher-order reasoning as (pseudo) sequential decision-making in extensive-form game tree. This representation enables us to treat simultaneous games in a similar manner to sequential games, where reasoning resources deplete throughout the game-tree. Bounds in player processing abilities are captured as information costs, where future branches of reasoning are discounted, implying a hierarchy of players where lower-level players have fewer processing resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Quantal Hierarchy model in several canonical economic games, {both simultaneous and sequential}, using out-of-sample modelling.},

  abstract={Benford's Law (BL) or the Significant Digit Law defines the probability distribution of the first digit of numerical values in a data sample. This Law is observed in many naturally occurring datasets. It can be seen as a measure of naturalness of a given distribution and finds its application in areas like anomaly and fraud detection. In this work, we address the following question: Is the distribution of the Neural Network parameters related to the network's generalization capability? To that end, we first define a metric, MLH (Model Enthalpy), that measures the closeness of a set of numbers to Benford's Law and we show empirically that it is a strong predictor of Validation Accuracy. Second, we use MLH as an alternative to Validation Accuracy for Early Stopping, removing the need for a Validation set. We provide experimental evidence that even if the optimal size of the validation set is known before-hand, the peak test accuracy attained is lower than not using a validation set at all. Finally, we investigate the connection of BL to Free Energy Principle and First Law of Thermodynamics, showing that MLH is a component of the internal energy of the learning system and optimization as an analogy to minimizing the total energy to attain equilibrium.},

  abstract={The Kalman filter is an algorithm for the estimation of hidden variables in dynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread applications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control, active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis, have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering. In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.},

  abstract={Predictive processing has become an influential framework in cognitive sciences. This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down, claiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition, and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature, the predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as predictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, free-energy principle, tend to be used interchangeably.   In the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which schemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this paper, working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing framework as well as some related non-robotic models.   The analysis suggests that, first, both research in cognitive robotics implementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of how multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error minimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a generative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third, despite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics implementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions.   Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the tracking of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore more complex behaviors and tasks in cognitive robotics research under the predictive processing framework.},

  abstract={Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions, namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the computational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.

This paper addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework -- in discrete time and state spaces -- and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as describe by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since, variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this paper opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy -- that furnishes priors over policies -- so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimisation -- based upon structure learning and belief propagation.},

Additionally, Champion et al (2021a) proposed a tree search approach based on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a variational message passing approach to active inference, which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP algorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.},

Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.},

Up to now, the inference of the latent variables was carried out by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by Variational Message Passing (Winn and Bishop, 2005), an iterative process that can be understood as sending messages along the edges of a factor graph (Forney, 2001). In this paper, we harness the efficiency of an alternative method for inference called Bayesian Filtering (Fox et al., 2003), which does not require the iteration of the update equations until convergence of the Variational Free Energy. Instead, this scheme alternates between two phases: integration of evidence and prediction of future states. Both of those phases can be performed efficiently and this provides a seventy times speed up over the state-of-the-art.},

Reinforcement learning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize engineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward environments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform well, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a model-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while adhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an active inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected future. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high sample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed exploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very light and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable performance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by solving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration properties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves performance. We also introduce a novel method for approximating the prior model from the reward function, which simplifies the expression of complex objectives and improves performance over previous active inference approaches.},

The agent continues to probe the processes until it obtains a sufficient number of measurements to reliably identify the anomalous processes. In this context, we develop a sequential selection algorithm that decides which processes to be probed at every instant to detect the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding a desired value while minimizing the delay in making the decision and the total number of measurements taken. Our algorithm is based on active inference which is a general framework to make sequential decisions in order to maximize the notion of free energy. We define the free energy using the objectives of the selection policy and implement the active inference framework using a deep neural network approximation.

  abstract={To interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot's behavior and be confident about that inference. Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions with nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and competence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then introduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In this setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the trustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of active inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model suggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.},

In particular, how active inference, a mathematical formulation of how the brain resists a natural tendency to disorder, provides a unified recipe to potentially solve some of the major challenges in robotics, such as adaptation, robustness, flexibility, generalization and safe interaction. This paper summarizes some experiments and lessons learned from developing such a computational model on real embodied platforms, i.e., humanoid and industrial robots. Finally, we showcase the limitations and challenges that we are still facing to give robots human-like perception},

  abstract={Although modern object detection and classification models achieve high accuracy, these are typically constrained in advance on a fixed train set and are therefore not flexible to deal with novel, unseen object categories. Moreover, these models most often operate on a single frame, which may yield incorrect classifications in case of ambiguous viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an active inference agent that actively gathers evidence for object classifications, and can learn novel object categories over time. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we build object-centric generative models composed of two information streams, a what- and a where-stream. The what-stream predicts whether the observed object belongs to a specific category, while the where-stream is responsible for representing the object in its internal 3D reference frame. We show that our agent (i) is able to learn representations for many object categories in an unsupervised way, (ii) achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies, actively resolving ambiguity when required and (iii) identifies novel object categories. Furthermore, we validate our system in an end-to-end fashion where the agent is able to search for an object at a given pose from a pixel-based rendering. We believe that this is a first step towards building modular, intelligent systems that can be used for a wide range of tasks involving three dimensional objects.},

The insula cortex, organized in hierarchical modules, is the major cortical region receiving interoceptive afferents and contains visceral topographic maps. Yet, the biological significance of the insula's modular architecture in relation to deep brain regions remains unsolved. In this opinion, we propose the Insula Hierarchical Modular Adaptive Interoception Control (IMAC) model to suggest that insula modules (granular, dysgranular and agranular subregions), forming networks with prefrontal (supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and ventromedial cortices) and striatum (posterior, dorsomedial and ventromedial) subregions, are specialized for higher-order interoceptive representations, recruited in a context-dependent manner to support habitual, model-based and exploratory adaptive behavior.

  abstract={Knowing the position of the robot in the world is crucial for navigation. Nowadays, Bayesian filters, such as Kalman and particle-based, are standard approaches in mobile robotics. Recently, end-to-end learning has allowed for scaling-up to high-dimensional inputs and improved generalization. However, there are still limitations to providing reliable laser navigation. Here we show a proof-of-concept of the predictive processing-inspired approach to perception applied for localization and navigation using laser sensors, without the need for odometry. We learn the generative model of the laser through self-supervised learning and perform both online state-estimation and navigation through stochastic gradient descent on the variational free-energy bound. We evaluated the algorithm on a mobile robot (TIAGo Base) with a laser sensor (SICK) in Gazebo. Results showed improved state-estimation performance when comparing to a state-of-the-art particle filter in the absence of odometry. Furthermore, conversely to standard Bayesian estimation approaches our method also enables the robot to navigate when providing the desired goal by inferring the actions that minimize the prediction error.},

  abstract={Motor control is a fundamental process that underlies all voluntary behavioral responses. Several different theories based on different principles (task dynamics, equilibrium-point theory, passive-motion paradigm, active inference, optimal control) account for specific aspects of how actions are produced, but fail to provide a unified view on this problem. Here we propose a concise theory of motor control based on three principles: optimal feedback control, control with a receding time horizon, and task representation by a series of via-points updated at fixed frequency. By construction, the theory provides a suitable solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem, i.e. trajectory formation in the presence of redundancies and noise. We show through computer simulations that the theory also explains the production of discrete, continuous, rhythmic and temporally-constrained movements, and their parametric and statistical properties (scaling laws, power laws, speed/accuracy tradeoffs). The theory has no free parameters and only limited variations in its implementation details and in the nature of noise are necessary to guarantee its explanatory power.},

  abstract={This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.},

  abstract={Even if path planning can be solved using standard techniques from dynamic programming and control, the problem can also be approached using probabilistic inference. The algorithms that emerge using the latter framework bear some appealing characteristics that qualify the probabilistic approach as a powerful alternative to the more traditional control formulations. The idea of using estimation on stochastic models to solve control problems is not new and the inference approach considered here falls under the rubric of Active Inference (AI) and Control as Inference (CAI). In this work, we look at the specific recursions that arise from various cost functions that, although they may appear similar in scope, bear noticeable differences, at least when applied to typical path planning problems. We start by posing the path planning problem on a probabilistic factor graph, and show how the various algorithms translate into specific message composition rules. We then show how this unified approach, presented both in probability space and in log space, provides a very general framework that includes the Sum-product, the Max-product, Dynamic programming and mixed Reward/Entropy criteria-based algorithms. The framework also expands algorithmic design options for smoother or sharper policy distributions, including generalized Sum/Max-product algorithm, a Smooth Dynamic programming algorithm and modified versions of the Reward/Entropy recursions. We provide a comprehensive table of recursions and a comparison through simulations, first on a synthetic small grid with a single goal with obstacles, and then on a grid extrapolated from a real-world scene with multiple goals and a semantic map.},

Meanwhile, privacy issues arise as large amounts of sensitive device data flow out to IoT platforms. Most of the data flowing out to a platform actually do not trigger automation actions, while homeowners currently have no control once devices are bound to the platform. We present PFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance the privacy of IoT platform users. PFirewall automatically generates data-minimization policies, which only disclose minimum amount of data to fulfill automation. In addition, PFirewall provides interfaces for homeowners to customize individual privacy preferences by defining user-specified policies. To enforce these policies, PFirewall transparently intervenes and mediates the communication between IoT devices and the platform, without modifying the platform, IoT devices, or hub. Evaluation results on four real-world testbeds show that PFirewall reduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% without impairing home automation, and effectively mitigates user-activity inference/tracking attacks and other privacy risks.},

  abstract={Providing artificial agents with the same computational models of biological systems is a way to understand how intelligent behaviours may emerge. We present an active inference body perception and action model working for the first time in a humanoid robot. The model relies on the free energy principle proposed for the brain, where both perception and action goal is to minimise the prediction error through gradient descent on the variational free energy bound. The body state (latent variable) is inferred by minimising the difference between the observed (visual and proprioceptive) sensor values and the predicted ones. Simultaneously, the action makes sensory data sampling to better correspond to the prediction made by the inner model. We formalised and implemented the algorithm on the iCub robot and tested in 2D and 3D visual spaces for online adaptation to visual changes, sensory noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. We also compared our approach with classical inverse kinematics in a reaching task, analysing the suitability of such a neuroscience-inspired approach for real-world interaction. The algorithm gave the robot adaptive body perception and upper body reaching with head object tracking (toddler-like), and was able to incorporate visual features online (in a closed-loop manner) without increasing the computational complexity. Moreover, our model predicted involuntary actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts showing the path for a potential proof of active inference in humans.},

  abstract={Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning (RL), but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this paper, we provide: 1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in RL; 2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and RL on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of RL. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for uncertainty about their environment in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation, and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside RL agents.},

This paper presents a novel active inference controller (AIC) as an adaptive control scheme for industrial robots. This scheme is easily scalable to high degrees-of-freedom, and it maintains high performance even in the presence of large unmodeled dynamics. The proposed method is based on active inference, a promising neuroscientific theory of the brain, which describes a biologically plausible algorithm for perception and action. In this work, we formulate active inference from a control perspective, deriving a model-free control law which is less sensitive to unmodeled dynamics. The performance and the adaptive properties of the algorithm are compared to a state-of-the-art model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) in an experimental setup with a real 7-DOF robot arm. The results showed that the AIC outperformed the MRAC in terms of adaptability, providing a more general control law. This confirmed the relevance of active inference for robot control.},

  abstract={In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.},

  abstract={One of the limitations of deep learning models with sparse features today stems from the predefined nature of their input, which requires a dictionary be defined prior to the training. With this paper we propose both a theory and a working system design which remove this limitation, and show that the resulting models are able to perform better and efficiently run at a much larger scale. Specifically, we achieve this by decoupling a model's content from its form to tackle architecture evolution and memory growth separately. To efficiently handle model growth, we propose a new neuron model, called DynamicCell, drawing inspiration from from the free energy principle [15] to introduce the concept of reaction to discharge non-digestive energy, which also subsumes gradient descent based approaches as its special cases. We implement DynamicCell by introducing a new server into TensorFlow to take over most of the work involving model growth. Consequently, it enables any existing deep learning models to efficiently handle arbitrary number of distinct sparse features (e.g., search queries), and grow incessantly without redefining the model. Most notably, one of our models, which has been reliably running in production for over a year, is capable of suggesting high quality keywords for advertisers of Google Smart Campaigns and achieved significant accuracy gains based on a challenging metric -- evidence that data-driven, self-evolving systems can potentially exceed the performance of traditional rule-based approaches.},

In this paper, we clarify the connection between reward maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract={Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.},

According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others, perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception.

The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment.

  abstract={Self/other distinction and self-recognition are important skills for interacting with the world, as it allows humans to differentiate own actions from others and be self-aware. However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: am I generating these sensations? The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation.},

For reinforcement learning tasks, the distribution of preferences replaces the notion of reward. We explore a scenario in which the agent learns this distribution in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we highlight the distinction between observations induced by the environment and those pertaining more directly to the continuity of an agent in time. We evaluate our methodology in a dynamic environment with discrete time and actions. First with a surprisal minimizing model-free agent (in the RL sense) and then expanding to the model-based case to minimize the expected free energy.},

  abstract={Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behaviour, from which special and important cases can be derived, e.g., reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.},

  abstract={The Expected Free Energy (EFE) is a central quantity in the theory of active inference. It is the quantity that all active inference agents are mandated to minimize through action, and its decomposition into extrinsic and intrinsic value terms is key to the balance of exploration and exploitation that active inference agents evince. Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the Variational Free Energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply "the free energy in the future". We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE, but which actively discourages exploratory behaviour, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then develop a novel objective, the Free-Energy of the Expected Future (FEEF), which possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE as well as an intuitive mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.},

  abstract={Stemming on the idea that a key objective in reinforcement learning is to invert a target distribution of effects, end-effect drives are proposed as an effective way to implement goal-directed motor learning, in the absence of an explicit forward model. An end-effect model relies on a simple statistical recording of the effect of the current policy, here used as a substitute for the more resource-demanding forward models. When combined with a reward structure, it forms the core of a lightweight variational free energy minimization setup. The main difficulty lies in the maintenance of this simplified effect model together with the online update of the policy. When the prior target distribution is uniform, it provides a ways to learn an efficient exploration policy, consistently with the intrinsic curiosity principles. When combined with an extrinsic reward, our approach is finally shown to provide a faster training than traditional off-policy techniques.},

  abstract={Human learning and intelligence work differently from the supervised pattern recognition approach adopted in most deep learning architectures. Humans seem to learn rich representations by exploration and imitation, build causal models of the world, and use both to flexibly solve new tasks. We suggest a simple but effective unsupervised model which develops such characteristics. The agent learns to represent the dynamical physical properties of its environment by intrinsically motivated exploration, and performs inference on this representation to reach goals. For this, a set of self-organizing maps which represent state-action pairs is combined with a causal model for sequence prediction. The proposed system is evaluated in the cartpole environment. After an initial phase of playful exploration, the agent can execute kinematic simulations of the environment's future, and use those for action planning. We demonstrate its performance on a set of several related, but different one-shot imitation tasks, which the agent flexibly solves in an active inference style.},

  abstract={In model-based learning, an agent's model is commonly defined over transitions between consecutive states of an environment even though planning often requires reasoning over multi-step timescales, with intermediate states either unnecessary, or worse, accumulating prediction error. In contrast, intelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability to plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the recent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a transition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that define the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics and over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework of active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale model (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions while preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that STM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example new objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the environment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned roll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions. We validate significant improvement in our STM agent's performance in the Animal-AI environment against a baseline system, trained using the environment's objective-timescale dynamics.},

  abstract={Fighting wildfires is a precarious task, imperiling the lives of engaging firefighters and those who reside in the fire's path. Firefighters need online and dynamic observation of the firefront to anticipate a wildfire's unknown characteristics, such as size, scale, and propagation velocity, and to plan accordingly. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework to coordinate a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for a human-centered active sensing of wildfires. We develop a dual-criterion objective function based on Kalman uncertainty residual propagation and weighted multi-agent consensus protocol, which enables the UAVs to actively infer the wildfire dynamics and parameters, track and monitor the fire transition, and safely manage human firefighters on the ground using acquired information. We evaluate our approach relative to prior work, showing significant improvements by reducing the environment's cumulative uncertainty residual by more than $ 10^2 $ and $ 10^5 $ times in firefront coverage performance to support human-robot teaming for firefighting. We also demonstrate our method on physical robots in a mock firefighting exercise.},

  abstract={Due to its low computational cost, Lasso is an attractive regularization method for high-dimensional statistical settings. In this paper, we consider multivariate counting processes depending on an unknown function parameter to be estimated by linear combinations of a fixed dictionary. To select coefficients, we propose an adaptive $\ell_1$-penalization methodology, where data-driven weights of the penalty are derived from new Bernstein type inequalities for martingales. Oracle inequalities are established under assumptions on the Gram matrix of the dictionary. Nonasymptotic probabilistic results for multivariate Hawkes processes are proven, which allows us to check these assumptions by considering general dictionaries based on histograms, Fourier or wavelet bases. Motivated by problems of neuronal activity inference, we finally carry out a simulation study for multivariate Hawkes processes and compare our methodology with the adaptive Lasso procedure proposed by Zou in (J.

The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system. The model pi_per perceives and discriminates different categories of materials (haptic stimulus) integrating compliance and texture features extracted from haptic sensory data. The model pi_tar actively infers the next region of the workspace that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms.   The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model pi_per can be used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average recognition rate higher than 90% . The generalization capability of the proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts.},

  abstract={Nonlinear mean-field models of the solar dynamo show long-term variability, which may be relevant to different states of activity inferred from long-term radiocarbon data. This paper is aimed to probe the dynamo hysteresis predicted by the recent mean-field models of Kitchatinov \& Olemskoy (2010) with direct numerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional simulations of large-scale dynamos in a shearing box with helically forced turbulence. As initial condition, we either take a weak random magnetic field or we start from a snapshot of an earlier simulation. Two quasi-stable states are found to coexist in a certain range of parameters close to the onset of the large-scale dynamo. The simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial conditions. When either the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is increased between successive runs above the critical value for onset of the dynamo, the field strength jumps to a finite value. However, when the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreased again, the field strength stays at a similar value (strong field branch) even below the original onset. We also observe intermittent decaying phases away from the strong field branch close to the point where large-scale dynamo action is just possible. The dynamo hysteresis seen previously in mean-field models is thus reproduced by 3D simulations. Its possible relation to distinct modes of solar activity such as grand minima is discussed.},

These are combined with optical imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to assess the activity and properties of member galaxies. Prior X-ray studies have suggested A2111 is a head-on cluster merger, a dynamical state which might be connected to the high level of activity inferred from its blue fraction. We are able to directly assess this claim, using our spectroscopic data to identify 95 cluster members among 196 total galaxy spectra. These galaxy velocities do not themselves provide significant evidence for the merger interpretation, however they are consistent with it provided the system is viewed near the time of core passage and at a viewing angle >~30 degrees different from the merger axis. The SDSS data allow us to confirm the high blue fraction for A2111, f_b = 0.15 +/- 0.03 based on photometry alone and f_b = 0.23 +/- 0.03 using spectroscopic data to remove background galaxies. We are able to detect 175 optical sources from the SDSS in our VLA radio data, of which 35 have redshift information. We use the SDSS photometry to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining 140 radio-optical sources. In total we identify up to 26 cluster radio galaxies, 14 of which have spectroscopic redshifts. The optical spectroscopy and radio data reveal a substantial population of dusty starbursts within the cluster. The high blue fraction and prevalence of star formation is consistent with the hypothesis that dynamically-active clusters are associated with more active member galaxies than relaxed clusters.},

  abstract={The assumption that action and perception can be investigated independently is entrenched in theories, models and experimental approaches across the brain and mind sciences. In cognitive science, this has been a central point of contention between computationalist and 4Es (enactive, embodied, extended and embedded) theories of cognition, with the former embracing the "classical sandwich", modular, architecture of the mind and the latter actively denying this separation can be made. In this work we suggest that the modular independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment, often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a sufficient condition to avoid the "classical sandwich". Finally, we argue that an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference, extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.},

  abstract={We study active restoration of noise-corrupted images generated via the Gibbs probability of an Ising ferromagnet in external magnetic field. Ferromagnetism accounts for the prior expectation of data smoothness, i.e. a positive correlation between neighbouring pixels (Ising spins), while the magnetic field refers to the bias. The restoration is actively supervised by requesting the true values of certain pixels after a noisy observation. This additional information improves restoration of other pixels. The optimal strategy of active inference is not known for realistic (two-dimensional) images. We determine this strategy for the mean-field version of the model and show that it amounts to supervising the values of spins (pixels) that do not agree with the sign of the average magnetization. The strategy leads to a transparent analytical expression for the minimal Bayesian risk, and shows that there is a maximal number of pixels beyond of which the supervision is useless. We show numerically that this strategy applies for two-dimensional images away from the critical regime. Within this regime the strategy is outperformed by its local (adaptive) version, which supervises pixels that do not agree with their Bayesian estimate. We show on transparent examples how active supervising can be essential in recovering noise-corrupted images and advocate for a wider usage of active methods in image restoration.},

We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.   We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.},

Here I will propose that these perspectives are fully compatible, in that analogical reasoning can be described in terms of Bayesian inference and vice versa, and that both of these positions require a thorough cybernetic grounding in order to fulfill their promise as unifying frameworks for understanding minds. From the Bayesian perspective of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, thought is constituted by dynamics of cascading belief propagation through the nodes of probabilistic generative models specified by a cortical heterarchy "rooted" in action-perception cycles that ground the mind as an embodied control system for an autonomous agent. From the analogical structure mapping perspective, thought is constituted by the alignment and comparison of heterogeneous structural representations. Here I will propose that this core cognitive process for analogical reasoning is naturally implemented by predictive coding mechanisms. However, both Bayesian cognitive science and models of cognitive development via analogical reasoning require rich base domains and priors (or reliably learnable posteriors) from which they can commence the process of bootstrapping minds. Here in the spirit of the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, I propose that embodiment provides many of the inductive biases that are usually described in terms of innate core knowledge.

In order to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information functions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low degrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate mutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition corresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the cohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in the multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically distributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology represented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective paths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k>1 components define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation) of the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes, provides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The local minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a definition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local minima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology.

The algorithm is empirically demonstrated to efficiently construct effective pre-conditioners for stochastic gradient descent and its variants.

  abstract={Gaussian processes are the leading class of distributions on random functions, but they suffer from well known issues including difficulty scaling and inflexibility with respect to certain shape constraints (such as nonnegativity). Here we propose Deep Random Splines, a flexible class of random functions obtained by transforming Gaussian noise through a deep neural network whose output are the parameters of a spline. Unlike Gaussian processes, Deep Random Splines allow us to readily enforce shape constraints while inheriting the richness and tractability of deep generative models. We also present an observational model for point process data which uses Deep Random Splines to model the intensity function of each point process and apply it to neural population data to obtain a low-dimensional representation of spiking activity. Inference is performed via a variational autoencoder that uses a novel recurrent encoder architecture that can handle multiple point processes as input. We use a newly collected dataset where a primate completes a pedaling task, and observe better dimensionality reduction with our model than with competing alternatives.},

  abstract={Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalogra-phy (EEG) are non-invasive modalities that measure the weak electromagnetic fields generated by neural activity. Inferring the location of the current sources that generated these magnetic fields is an ill-posed inverse problem known as source imaging. When considering a group study, a baseline approach consists in carrying out the estimation of these sources independently for each subject. The ill-posedness of each problem is typically addressed using sparsity promoting regularizations. A straightforward way to define a common pattern for these sources is then to average them. A more advanced alternative relies on a joint localization of sources for all subjects taken together, by enforcing some similarity across all estimated sources. An important advantage of this approach is that it consists in a single estimation in which all measurements are pooled together, making the inverse problem better posed. Such a joint estimation poses however a few challenges, notably the selection of a valid regularizer that can quantify such spatial similarities. We propose in this work a new procedure that can do so while taking into account the geometrical structure of the cortex. We call this procedure Minimum Wasserstein Estimates (MWE). The benefits of this model are twofold. First, joint inference allows to pool together the data of different brain geometries, accumulating more spatial information. Second, MWE are defined through Optimal Transport (OT) metrics which provide a tool to model spatial proximity between cortical sources of different subjects, hence not enforcing identical source location in the group. These benefits allow MWE to be more accurate than standard MEG source localization techniques. To support these claims, we perform source localization on realistic MEG simulations based on forward operators derived from MRI scans. On a visual task dataset, we demonstrate how MWE infer neural patterns similar to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) maps.},

  author={Manuel Baltieri and Christopher L. Buckley},
  year={2017},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01806v1},
  abstract={Active inference is emerging as a possible unifying theory of perception and action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \emph{generative} (probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception. In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of active inference have typically examined a "perception-oriented" view of this theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an "action-oriented" solution showing how adaptive behaviour can emerge even when agents operate with a simple model which bears little resemblance to their environment. We examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present an example of a different, "pathological" behaviour.},

Our main contribution is a method that translates a check-in activity into an information need, which is in turn addressed with an appropriate information card. This task is challenging because of the large number of possible activities and related information needs, which need to be addressed in a mobile dashboard that is limited in size. Our approach considers each possible activity that might follow after the last (and already finished) activity, and selects the top information cards such that they maximize the likelihood of satisfying the user's information needs for all possible future scenarios. The proposed models also incorporate knowledge about the temporal dynamics of information needs. Using a combination of historical check-in data and manual assessments collected via crowdsourcing, we show experimentally the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract={With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants (users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge. Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing. Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.},

  abstract={What are the functions of curiosity? What are the mechanisms of curiosity-driven learning? We approach these questions about the living using concepts and tools from machine learning and developmental robotics. We argue that curiosity-driven learning enables organisms to make discoveries to solve complex problems with rare or deceptive rewards. By fostering exploration and discovery of a diversity of behavioural skills, and ignoring these rewards, curiosity can be efficient to bootstrap learning when there is no information, or deceptive information, about local improvement towards these problems. We also explain the key role of curiosity for efficient learning of world models. We review both normative and heuristic computational frameworks used to understand the mechanisms of curiosity in humans, conceptualizing the child as a sense-making organism. These frameworks enable us to discuss the bi-directional causal links between curiosity and learning, and to provide new hypotheses about the fundamental role of curiosity in self-organizing developmental structures through curriculum learning. We present various developmental robotics experiments that study these mechanisms in action, both supporting these hypotheses to understand better curiosity in humans and opening new research avenues in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Finally, we discuss challenges for the design of experimental paradigms for studying curiosity in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

  year={2018},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08083v1},
  abstract={Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle. It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g.\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the biological plausibility of active inference.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02647v1},
  abstract={We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine, human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment, body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.},

First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points -- for example, specific locations -- in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier. We evaluate our attacks on a variety of tasks, datasets, and learning configurations, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible defenses.},

The objective is an active inference strategy that minimizes the Bayesian risk taking into account of the sample complexity, switching cost, as well as detection errors. Based on the framework of sequential design of experiments, we propose a low-complexity, low-switching deterministic policy for two scenarios where the total switching cost is negligible and the total switching cost is comparable to the total observation cost. We show that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the former scenario and is order optimal in the latter scenario.

  abstract={The predictive processing (PP) hypothesizes that the predictive inference of our sensorimotor system is encoded implicitly in the regularities between perception and action. We propose a neural architecture in which such regularities of active inference are encoded hierarchically. We further suggest that this encoding emerges during the embodied learning process when the appropriate action is selected to minimize the prediction error in perception. Therefore, this predictive stream in the sensorimotor loop is generated in a top-down manner. Specifically, it is constantly modulated by the motor actions and is updated by the bottom-up prediction error signals. In this way, the top-down prediction originally comes from the prior experience from both perception and action representing the higher levels of this hierarchical cognition. In our proposed embodied model, we extend the PredNet Network, a hierarchical predictive coding network, with the motor action units implemented by a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to modulate the network top-down prediction. Two experiments, a minimalistic world experiment, and a mobile robot experiment are conducted to evaluate the proposed model in a qualitative way. In the neural representation, it can be observed that the causal inference of predictive percept from motor actions can be also observed while the agent is interacting with the environment.},

REPRISE infers the unobservable contextual event state and accompanying temporal predictive models that best explain the recently encountered sensorimotor experiences retrospectively. Meanwhile, it optimizes upcoming motor activities prospectively in a goal-directed manner. Here, REPRISE is implemented by a recurrent neural network (RNN), which learns temporal forward models of the sensorimotor contingencies generated by different simulated dynamic vehicles. The RNN is augmented with contextual neurons, which enable the encoding of distinct, but related, sensorimotor dynamics as compact event codes. We show that REPRISE concurrently learns to separate and approximate the encountered sensorimotor dynamics: it analyzes sensorimotor error signals adapting both internal contextual neural activities and connection weight values. Moreover, we show that REPRISE can exploit the learned model to induce goal-directed, model-predictive control, that is, approximate active inference: Given a goal state, the system imagines a motor command sequence optimizing it with the prospective objective to minimize the distance to the goal. The RNN activities thus continuously imagine the upcoming future and reflect on the recent past, optimizing the predictive model, the hidden neural state activities, and the upcoming motor activities. As a result, event-predictive neural encodings develop, which allow the invocation of highly effective and adaptive goal-directed sensorimotor control.},

  abstract={This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements - in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to control its environment with delayed signals.},

Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these approaches, our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. A minor modification can further improve the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the minimum spike size.

For the problem considered in this paper, a low-complexity deterministic test is shown to enjoy the same asymptotic optimality while offering significantly better performance in the finite regime and faster convergence to the optimal rate function, especially when the number of processes is large.

  abstract={Robots operate in environments with varying implicit structure. For instance, a helicopter flying over terrain encounters a very different arrangement of obstacles than a robotic arm manipulating objects on a cluttered table top. State-of-the-art motion planning systems do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable planning effort searching for implausible solutions. We are interested in planning algorithms that actively infer the underlying structure of the valid configuration space during planning in order to find solutions with minimal effort. Consider the problem of evaluating edges on a graph to quickly discover collision-free paths. Evaluating edges is expensive, both for robots with complex geometries like robot arms, and for robots with limited onboard computation like UAVs. Until now, this challenge has been addressed via laziness i.e. deferring edge evaluation until absolutely necessary, with the hope that edges turn out to be valid. However, all edges are not alike in value - some have a lot of potentially good paths flowing through them, and some others encode the likelihood of neighbouring edges being valid. This leads to our key insight - instead of passive laziness, we can actively choose edges that reduce the uncertainty about the validity of paths. We show that this is equivalent to the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region determination (DRD). However, the DRD problem is not only combinatorially hard, but also requires explicit enumeration of all possible worlds. We propose a novel framework that combines two DRD algorithms, DIRECT and BISECT, to overcome both issues. We show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile robots, manipulators and autonomous helicopters.},

A qualitative explanation for this finding is suggested. Nonlinear analysis of dynamo-waves reveals the hysteresis phenomenon found earlier in more advanced models. However, the simplified model allows a computation of a sufficiently large number of dynamo-cycles for constructing the distribution function of their amplitudes to reproduce qualitatively two modes of solar activity inferred recently from cosmogenic isotope content in natural archives.},

  abstract={Every day, billions of mobile network events (i.e. CDRs) are generated by cellular phone operator companies. Latent in this data are inspiring insights about human actions and behaviors, the discovery of which is important because context-aware applications and services hold the key to user-driven, intelligent services, which can enhance our everyday lives such as social and economic development, urban planning, and health prevention. The major challenge in this area is that interpreting such a big stream of data requires a deep understanding of mobile network events' context through available background knowledge. This article addresses the issues in context awareness given heterogeneous and uncertain data of mobile network events missing reliable information on the context of this activity. The contribution of this research is a model from a combination of logical and statistical reasoning standpoints for enabling human activity inference in qualitative terms from open geographical data that aimed at improving the quality of human behaviors recognition tasks from CDRs. We use open geographical data, Openstreetmap (OSM), as a proxy for predicting the content of human activity in the area. The user study performed in Trento shows that predicted human activities (top level) match the survey data with around 93% overall accuracy. The extensive validation for predicting a more specific economic type of human activity performed in Barcelona, by employing credit card transaction data. The analysis identifies that appropriately normalized data on points of interest (POI) is a good proxy for predicting human economical activities, with 84% accuracy on average. So the model is proven to be efficient for predicting the context of human activity, when its total level could be efficiently observed from cell phone data records, missing contextual information however.},

  abstract={Research on the so-called "free-energy principle'' (FEP) in cognitive neuroscience is becoming increasingly high-profile. To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known.   This paper attempts to provide an accessible introduction to active inference and informational free-energy, for readers from a range of scientific backgrounds. In this work introduce an agent-based model with an agent trying to make predictions about its position in a one-dimensional discretized world using methods from the FEP.},
