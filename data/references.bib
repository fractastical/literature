  abstract={The first comprehensive treatment of active inference, an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines. Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.},

  abstract={This article describes a process theory based on active inference and belief propagation. Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence—or minimizing variational free energy—we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes’ optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton’s principle of least action.},

  abstract={With the increasing popularity and demands for large language model applications on mobile devices, it is difficult for resource-limited mobile terminals to run large-model inference tasks efficiently. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches have been used to offload large language models (LLMs) inference tasks to servers. However, existing DRL solutions suffer from data inefficiency, insensitivity to latency requirements, and non-adaptability to task load variations, which will degrade the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on active inference for LLMs inference task offloading and resource allocation in cloud-edge computing. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed method has superior performance over mainstream DRLs, improves in data utilization efficiency, and is more adaptable to changing task load scenarios.},

  abstract={Abstract Self-esteem, the evaluation of one’s own worth or value, is a critical aspect of psychological well-being and mental health. In this paper, we propose an active inference account of self-esteem, casting it as a sociometer or an inferential capacity to interpret one’s standing within a social group. This approach allows us to explore the interaction between an individual’s self-perception and the expectations of their social environment.When there is a mismatch between these perceptions and expectations, the individual needs to adjust their actions or update their self-perception to better align with their current experiences. We also consider this hypothesis in relation with recent research on affective inference, suggesting that self-esteem enables the individual to track and respond to this discrepancy through affective states such as anxiety or positive affect. By acting as an inferential sociometer, self-esteem allows individuals to navigate and adapt to their social environment, ultimately impacting their psychological well-being and mental health.},

  abstract={Active inference, a first-principles framework for modelling the behaviour of sentient agents, is beginning to be applied in consciousness research. One hypothesis arising from the framework is that active inference is necessary for changes in conscious content. As one component of an extensive adversarial collaboration among competing theories of consciousness, active inference will be contrasted with two other theories of consciousness, neither of which posit that active inference is necessary for consciousness. Here, we thus present a Study Protocol designed to test the active inference hypothesis using a carefully controlled adaptation of the motion-induced blindness paradigm, where an 'active' condition with richer active inference is contrasted with a 'passive' condition. In the active condition, participants direct their gaze towards a target stimulus following its disappearance from consciousness, and report on its subsequent reappearance. In the passive condition, participants maintain central fixation, while the stimulus array is moved across the visual field (in a replay of the active condition based on eye-tracking data acquired during active trials). In two experiments, we plan to investigate target reappearance across active and passive conditions to evaluate the contribution of active inference to conscious awareness. Results will eventually be considered in the context of all the experiments conducted as part of the overall adversarial collaboration.},

This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.},

  abstract={Why do some rhythms make us want to move and not others? A predictive processing account suggests that prediction errors drive this phenomenon, but this hypothesis remains underspecified. Here, we operationalized this account as a Bayesian model that infers whether a rhythmic sequence is caused by a metered or unmetered template, coupled with an active inference rule in which movement occurs if the sensory feedback from movement would reduce the prediction errors generated by this inference process. Surprisal, as an index of prediction error, was calculated for each rhythm with and without a metronome (a proxy for the feedback from moving along), with delta surprisal as the difference. Surprisal increased linearly as a function of rhythmic complexity, while delta surprisal showed a similar pattern with urge to move ratings shown in previous studies, and this relation was confirmed in an online study. These results suggest that the urge to move to music is driven by the potential to reduce meter-based prediction errors via the expected feedback from moving along to the beat. This work provides a crucial update to the predictive processing account and highlights a key role of active inference and prediction-based learning in our musical experiences.},

Behavioral-cognitive "profiles" lack a justified principle linking function to experience, and the awareness case study illustrates how externally specified goals can just as well underwrite as-if (pseudo-intentional) control rather than original intentionality. Moreover, the proposed heuristic overlooks that substrate similarity is currently indispensable for justifiably inferring the presence of consciousness beyond the validated case of the adult human brain. Given all this, the framework seems to provide a blueprint for building a more sophisticated philosophical zombie; it does not-and cannot-tell us whether anyone is there.},

  abstract={<p>Active inference is a domain-general theory of brain functioning which reconceptualizes the perception-action interface in terms of a common process of minimization of sensory prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2010). Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little explicit attention in speech motor control. This is despite speech providing a critical test-case, arguably being one of the most crucial and intricate of human sensorimotor functions. The application of active inference to speech motor control can allow crosspollination of decades of work from neighbouring disciplines, and could highlight where speech motor control mechanisms may be similar to, or differ from, those in other motor control domains, by establishing mechanistic explanation in common terms. We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework of auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.</p>},

  abstract={A new branch of artificial intelligence called Active Inference AI is changing the very foundations of how medical knowledge is created, applied, and taught. And this new AI is combining with an entirely new evolution of the Internet, called the Spatial Web, which is changing how medical knowledge will be shared globally. Active Inference AI and the Spatial Web have been developed together to create a powerful new environment for medicine and science in general to evolve to an entirely new level. Until now, large-scale AI models called LLMs (Large Language Models) have been dominating the AI marketplace. But these are general-purpose AIs. They are expensive to create, they are massively data-hungry, and they are imprecise and not designed for specialized domains like medicine. In contrast, this new Active Inference AI-inspired by neuroscience-is designed specifically for medicine and other applications requiring high accuracy and explainable results. This new AI does not use LLM technology but relies on small, domain-specific models built from expert-curated knowledge graphs and factor graphs. This novel approach enables reasoning, learning, and decision-making within well-defined medical contexts, allowing for the precision, adaptability, and interpretability missing in LLMs. This report outlines how Active Inference AI can: (1) accelerate medical research by simulating hypotheses and causal pathways. (2) Enhance medical treatment through adaptive, real-time digital twins and precision diagnostics. (3) Revolutionize medical education by creating dynamic, interactive, and semantically accurate learning environments.},

In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative models that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox system to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a specific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of specifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as implementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile, breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed of Bayesian agents.},

From the wider view of `probabilistic numerics', CaI offers principled, numerically robust optimal control solvers that provide uncertainty quantification, and can scale to nonlinear problems with approximate inference.

  abstract={The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre-reflective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

  abstract={The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified Bayesian account of perception, learning and action. Despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition, emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework. A core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence, which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects. In the present paper, we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free-energy over time. If the second time-derivative of free-energy is taken into account, the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness, unhappiness, hope, fear, disappointment and relief can be explained. In this formulation, an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs. When sensations increasingly violate the agent's expectations, valence is negative and increases the learning rate. Conversely, when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent's expectations, valence is positive and decreases the learning rate. This dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents' adaptation to unexpected changes in their world.},

  abstract={This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.},

IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.},

  abstract={


Several authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems and Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of changes in variable and parameter sets, constraints, and in the dynamical laws affecting the system. This allows enaction to address the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that these ideas are incompatible with the time invariance of non-equilibrium steady states assumed by the FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development. We argue that this view of transactional and constitutive relations between organisms and environments is a challenge to the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that far from being easily integrated, the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is in tension with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.

  abstract={In this paper, we argue for a theoretical separation of the free-energy principle from Helmholtzian accounts of the predictive brain. The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.},

  abstract={Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.},

  abstract={Neural complexity and brain entropy (BEN) have gained greater interest in recent years. The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The BEN of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.},

Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.},

  abstract={We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences from newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the “Markov blanket” proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument, which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.},

  abstract={Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.},

Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account’s intuitive simplicity—which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin—it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.},

Critically, these frameworks invoke diverse—and potentially mutually inconsistent—interpretations of the role allostasis plays in the scheme of biological regulation. This chapter argues in favor of a moderate, reconciliatory position in which homeostasis and allostasis are conceived as equally vital (but functionally distinct) modes of physiological control. It explores the implications of this interpretation for free energy-based accounts of interoceptive inference, advocating a similarly complementary (and hierarchical) view of homeostatic and allostatic processing.},

  abstract={A theory of self-organization in the central nervous system is described, proposing that additive and dissipative synaptodendritic summation leads to synchronous oscillation as the equilibrium state, thereby underpinning a primary mechanism of prediction error minimization. As a consequence, synaptic connections become arranged in mirror-symmetric paired patterns, wherein exchanges of synaptic flux within each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes. The mirror-reflection axis between each pair functions as a Markov blanket that maintains excitatory-inhibitory equilibrium, while multiway exchanges among mirror pairs converge toward overall error minimization and mutual organization. The primary organization of this type is evident in the spinal cord. During cortical embryogenesis, connections develop in topographies interpretable as mirror reflections with broken symmetry, aligning along the radial and circumferential axes of cortical growth, as described by the Structural Model, and subsequently manifest at the millimetric scale throughout the cortex. The proposed framework integrates a diverse range of experimental data and provides an explanatory basis for how generative models with agency can emerge through both species evolution and individual learning.},

The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between the high-level cortex, the low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal phenomena. We conclude by discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research.

By de novo learning, we mean discovering, directly from observations, the structure and parameters of a discrete generative model for sequential policy optimisation. Concretely, our procedure grows and then reduces a model until it discovers a pullback attractor over (generalised) states; this attracting set supplies paths of least action among goal states while avoiding costly states. The implicit efficiency rests upon reframing the learning problem through the lens of the free energy principle, under which it is sufficient to learn a generative model whose dynamics feature such an attracting set. For context, we briefly relate this perspective to value-based formulations (e.g., Bellman optimality) and then apply the active inference formulation to a small arcade game to illustrate de novo structure learning and ensuing agency.},

  abstract={In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we build upon these techniques. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Active Intersubjective Inference (AISI), a novel framework that integrates psychodynamic theory with predictive processing to explain self-identity construction and psychopathology. AISI posits that the self emerges from recursive inferences about how others perceive us (second-order self), interacting bidirectionally with interoceptive processes. We map psychodynamic phenomena (e.g., transference, projection) onto neurocomputational mechanisms and apply AISI to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), highlighting distorted second-order inference as a core dysfunction. Therapeutic implications include psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and psychedelic-assisted treatments to enhance inference flexibility. AISI bridges psychodynamic insights with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria, offering a testable model for precision psychiatry and future clinical trials.},

  abstract={Active inference offers a unified framework in which agents can exhibit both goal-directed and epistemic behaviors. However, implementing policy search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces presents challenges in terms of scalability and stability. Our previously proposed model, T-GLean, addressed this issue by enabling efficient goal-directed planning through low-dimensional latent space search, further reduced by conditioning on prior habituated behavior. However, the lack of an epistemic term in minimizing expected free energy limited the agent's ability to engage in information-seeking behavior that can be critical for attaining preferred outcomes. In this study, we present EFE-GLean, an extended version of T-GLean that overcomes this limitation by integrating epistemic value into the planning process. EFE-GLean generates goal-directed policies by inferring low-dimensional future posterior trajectories while maximizing expected information gain. Simulation experiments using an extended T-maze task-implemented in both discrete and continuous domains-demonstrate that the agent can successfully achieve its goals by exploiting hidden environmental information. Furthermore, we show that the agent is capable of adapting to abrupt environmental changes by dynamically revising plans through simultaneous minimization of past variational free energy and future expected free energy. Finally, analytical evaluations detail the underlying mechanisms and computational properties of the model.},

  abstract={We examine the neurobiology of intuition, a term often inconsistently defined in scientific literature. While researchers generally agree that intuition represents "an experienced-based process resulting in a spontaneous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis," we establish a firmer neurobiological foundation by framing intuition evolutionarily as a pathfinding mechanism emerging from the brain's optimization of its relationship with the environment. Our review synthesizes empirical findings on intuition's neurobiological basis, including relevant brain networks and their relationship to cognitive states like insight. We propose that unsolved problems dynamically alter attractor landscapes, guiding future intuitions. We investigate "opportunistic assimilation" through nonlinear neurodynamics and identify hippocampal sharp wave ripples as potential neural correlates of intuition, citing their role in creativity, choice, action planning, and abstract thinking. Finally, we explore intuition through two complementary perspectives: the free energy principle, which models brains as minimizing uncertainty through predictive hierarchical coding, and metastable coordination dynamics, describing the brain's simultaneous tendencies toward regional cooperation and functional autonomy. Together, these principles provide a comprehensive neurodynamical account of intuition's neurophenomenology.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40704439},
  abstract={In active inference, the sensory surprisal (a log-probability of sensory data) of the prediction error between prediction and sensory input is modulated by action. The urge to move (groove) induced by syncopation, which provides metric uncertainty, can be considered a case of active inference in music perception. The present study investigated whether rhythmic prediction error is modulated by improving the precision of rhythm perception through tapping in sync with the rhythm. Thirty-five participants listened to a rhythmic sequence while tapping the half-note beat (tapping condition) or holding a pillow (no-tapping condition), and electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In both conditions, the onset of the syncopated tone was rarely earlier (timing deviant: 20%) than the standard (80%). The timing deviant elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in both the tapping and no-tapping conditions, reflecting a prediction error in timing. Moreover, the MMN was larger in the tapping condition than in the no-tapping condition, which may indicate increased precision due to tapping, even when motor-related potentials were controlled for. Neural entrainment was measured by calculating intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), which reflects oscillatory activity synchronized to stimulus frequency, and ITPC differed between the two conditions at beat-related frequencies. These results suggest that tapping enhanced meter and beat information and reduced the sensory surprisal of syncopation, resulting in a larger precision-weighted prediction error. These effects were not due to physiological arousal differences between conditions, as assessed by EEG power and heart rate variability. These results are discussed as evidence that bodily engagement modulates sensory prediction error within the active inference framework.},

  abstract={Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability-key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.},

  author={Hideyoshi Yanagisawa and Shimon Honda},
  year={2025},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40432794},
  abstract={Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel formulation of these emotions using two types of information gain derived from the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), representing free energy reduction through recognition, and Bayesian surprise (BS), representing free energy reduction via Bayesian updating. Conventional Gaussian models predict an infinite divergence in information gain (KLD and BS) as prediction error increases, which contradicts the known limits of human cognitive resources. The key novelty of this study lies in a simple yet impactful modification: incorporating a uniform distribution into the Gaussian likelihood function to model neural activity under conditions of large prediction error. This modification yields an inverted U-shaped relationship between prediction error and both KLD and BS, producing a finite peak in information gain that better reflects cognitive realism. Based on this convexity, we propose that alternating the maximization of BS and KLD generates an ideal inquiry cycle that fluctuates around an optimal arousal level, with curiosity and interest driving this process. We further analyze how prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) affect the peak of information gain. The results suggest that greater prediction uncertainty (reflecting open-mindedness) and lower observation uncertainty (indicating focused observation) promote higher information gains through broader exploration. This mathematical framework integrates the brain's free energy principle with arousal potential theory, providing a unified explanation of the Wundt curve as an information gain function and proposing an ideal inquiry process driven by epistemic emotions.},

  abstract={Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multi-label learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.},

  abstract={Within a theoretical framework of enactive allostasis, we explore active inference strategies for minimizing surprise to achieve resilience in dynamic environments. While individual differences and extrinsic protective factors traditionally account for variability in resilience trajectories following stressor exposure, the enactive model emphasizes the importance of the physical and social environment, specifically the "enactive niche," which is both shaped by and impacts organisms living in it, accounting for variable success in allostatic prediction and accommodation. Enactive allostasis infers or predicts states of the world to minimize surprise and maintain regulation after surprise, i.e., resilience. Action policies are selected in accordance with the inferred state of a dynamic environment; those actions concurrently shape one's environment, buffering against current and potential stressors. Through such inferential construction, multiple potential solutions exist for achieving stability within one's enactive niche. Spanning a range of adaptive resilience strategies, we propose four phenotypes-fragile, durable, resilient, and pro-entropic (PE)-each characterized by a constellation of genetic, epigenetic, developmental, experiential, and environmental factors. Biological regulatory outcomes range from allostatic (over)load in the fragile and durable phenotypes, to allostatic recovery in resilience, and theoretically to increasing allostatic accommodation or "growth" in the proposed PE phenotype. Awareness distinguishes phenotypes by minimizing allostatically demanding surprise and engenders the cognitive and behavioral flexibility empirically associated with resilience. We further propose a role for awareness in proactively shaping one's enactive niche to further minimize surprise. We conclude by exploring the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity which may bolster individual resilience.},

Crucially, a collective of active inference agents can, if they maintain a group-level Markov blanket, constitute a larger group-level active inference agent with a generative model of its own. This potential for computational scale-free structures speaks to the application of active inference to self-organizing systems across spatiotemporal scales, from cells to human collectives. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the generative model that explains the behaviour of emergent group-level agents, there has been little research on this kind of multi-scale active inference. Here, we propose a data-driven methodology for characterising the relation between the generative model of a group-level agent and the dynamics of its constituent individual agents. We apply methods from computational cognitive modelling and computational psychiatry, applicable for active inference as well as other types of modelling approaches. Using a simple Multi-Armed Bandit task as an example, we employ the new ActiveInference.jl library for Julia to simulate a collective of agents who are equipped with a Markov blanket. We use sampling-based parameter estimation to make inferences about the generative model of the group-level agent, and we show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the generative models of individual agents and the group-level agent they constitute, even in this simple setting. Finally, we point to a number of ways in which this methodology might be applied to better understand the relations between nested active inference agents across scales.},

  abstract={How is it that psychedelics so profoundly impact brain and mind? According to the model of "Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (REBUS), 5-HT2a agonism is thought to help relax prior expectations, thus making room for new perspectives and patterns. Here, we introduce an alternative (but largely compatible) perspective, proposing that REBUS effects may primarily correspond to a particular (but potentially pivotal) regime of very high levels of 5-HT2a receptor agonism. Depending on both a variety of contextual factors and the specific neural systems being considered, we suggest opposite effects may also occur in which synchronous neural activity becomes more powerful, with accompanying "Strengthened Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (SEBUS) effects. Such SEBUS effects are consistent with the enhanced meaning-making observed in psychedelic therapy (e.g. psychological insight and the noetic quality of mystical experiences), with the imposition of prior expectations on perception (e.g. hallucinations and pareidolia), and with the delusional thinking that sometimes occurs during psychedelic experiences (e.g. apophenia, paranoia, engendering of inaccurate interpretations of events, and potentially false memories). With "Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics" (ALBUS), we propose that the manifestation of SEBUS vs. REBUS effects may vary across the dose-response curve of 5-HT2a signaling. While we explore a diverse range of sometimes complex models, our basic idea is fundamentally simple: psychedelic experiences can be understood as kinds of waking dream states of varying degrees of lucidity, with similar underlying mechanisms. We further demonstrate the utility of ALBUS by providing neurophenomenological models of psychedelics focusing on mechanisms of conscious perceptual synthesis, dreaming, and episodic memory and mental simulation.},

  abstract={This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as w, the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in w during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of w of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both ws were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one w was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both ws were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating w in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of ws. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies.},

In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.},

  abstract={According to the free energy principle, life is an “inevitable and emergent property of any (ergodic) random dynamical system at non-equilibrium steady state that possesses a Markov blanket” (Friston in J R Soc Interface 10(86):20130475, 2013). Formulating a principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergodicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of biological systems. Thus far, however, the physics foundations of the free energy principle have received hardly any attention. Here, we start to fill this gap and analyse some of the challenges raised by applications of statistical physics for modelling biological targets. Based on our analysis, we conclude that model-building grounded in the free energy principle exacerbates a trade-off between generality and realism, because of a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the properties of actual biological targets.},

  abstract={Translation process research (TPR) has generated a large number of models that aim at explaining human translation processes. In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.},

  abstract={Drawing from field theory, Gestalt therapy conceives psychological suffering and psychotherapy as two intentional field phenomena, where unprocessed and chaotic experiences seek the opportunity to emerge and be assimilated through the contact between the patient and the therapist (i.e., the intentionality of contacting). This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.},

  abstract={Entropy management, central to the Free Energy Principle, requires a process that temporarily shifts brain activity toward states of lower or higher entropy. Metastable synchronization is a process by which a system achieves entropy fluctuations by intermittently transitioning between states of collective order and disorder. Previous work has shown that collective oscillations, similar to those recorded from the brain, emerge spontaneously from weakly stable synchronization in critically coupled oscillator systems. However, direct evidence linking the formation of collective oscillations to entropy fluctuations is lacking. In this short communication, we demonstrate how the emergence of Metastable Oscillatory Modes (MOMs) is directly associated with a temporary reduction in entropy in the ongoing dynamics. We apply Shannon entropy to the distribution of eigenvalues of phase covariance over sliding time windows, capturing the temporal evolution of entropy at the level of the entire dynamical system. By demonstrating how the formation of MOMs impacts a system's entropy levels, we bridge theoretical works on the physics of coupled oscillators with the FEP framework, supporting the hypothesis that brain rhythms recorded experimentally are a signature of entropy management.},

  abstract={After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practitioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes. However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test-retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with an ensuing increase in test-retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.},

In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.},

Evolution of a neural field with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, maximizing synchrony and minimizing axonal length by apoptotic selection, leads to paired connection systems with mirror symmetry, interacting via Markov blankets along their line of reflection. Applied to development along the radial lines of development in the Structural Model, a primary Markov blanket emerges between the centrifugal synaptic flux in layers 2,3 and 5,6, versus the centripetal flow in layer 4, and axonal orientations in layer 4 give rise to the differing shape and movement sensitivities characteristic of neurons of dorsal and ventral neocortex. Prediction error minimization along the primary blanket integrates limbic and subcortical networks with the neocortex. Synaptic flux bypassing the blanket triggers the arousal response to surprising stimuli, enabling subsequent adaptation. As development progresses ubiquitous mirror systems separated by Markov blankets and enclosed blankets-within-blankets arise throughout neocortex, creating the typical order and response characteristics of columnar and noncolumnar cortex.},

The aim of this treatment is to consider the extent to which active inference has informed theoretical progress in psychology, before exploring its contributions to our understanding and treatment of psychopathology. Despite facing persistent translational obstacles, progress suggests that active inference has the potential to become a new paradigm that promises to unite psychology's subdisciplines, while readily incorporating the traditionally competing paradigms of evolutionary and developmental psychology. To date, however, progress towards this end has been slow. Meanwhile, the main outstanding question is whether this theory will make a positive difference through applications in clinical psychology, and its sister discipline of psychiatry.},

In this article, we aim to clarify the nature of the relationship between the two principles by investigating the two most likely interpretations of the claims that can be found in the subject literature. According to the strong interpretation, the two principles are equivalent and apply to the same subset of physical phenomena; according to the weak interpretation, the two principles are merely analogous to each other by virtue of their similar formal structures.

The dynamic behavior of this network is informed by the knowledge obtained from experiments on telencephalic evolution.

  abstract={The human need to find meaning in life and the human need for connection may be two sides of the same coin, a coin forged in the developmental crucible of attachment. Our need for meaningfulness can be traced to our developmental need for connection in the attachment relationship. The free energy principle dictates that in order to resist a natural tendency towards disorder self-organizing systems must generate models that predict the hidden causes of phenomenal experience. In other words, they must make sense of things. In both an evolutionary and ontogenetic sense, the narrative self develops as a model that makes sense of experience. However, the self-model skews the interpretation of experience towards that which is predictable, or already "known." One may say it causes us to "take things personally." Meaning is felt more acutely when defenses are compromised, when the narrative self is offline. This enables meaning-making that is less egocentrically motivated. Dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic states offer glimpses of how we make sense of things absent a coherent narrative self. This has implications for the way we understand such states, and lays bare the powerful reach of attachment in shaping what we experience as meaningful.},

  abstract={Tourette syndrome (TS) has been associated with a rich set of symptoms that are said to be uncomfortable, unwilled, and effortful to manage. Furthermore, tics, the canonical characteristic of TS, are multifaceted, and their onset and maintenance is complex. A formal account that integrates these features of TS symptomatology within a plausible theoretical framework is currently absent from the field. In this paper, we assess the explanatory power of hierarchical generative modelling in accounting for TS symptomatology from the perspective of active inference. We propose a fourfold analysis of sensory, motor, and cognitive phenomena associated with TS. In Section 1, we characterise tics as a form of action aimed at sensory attenuation. In Section 2, we introduce the notion of epistemic ticcing and describe such behaviour as the search for evidence that there is an agent (i.e., self) at the heart of the generative hierarchy. In Section 3, we characterise both epistemic (sensation-free) and nonepistemic (sensational) tics as habitual behaviour. Finally, in Section 4, we propose that ticcing behaviour involves an inevitable conflict between distinguishable aspects of selfhood; namely, between the minimal phenomenal sense of self-which is putatively underwritten by interoceptive inference-and the explicit preferences that constitute the individual's conceptual sense of self. In sum, we aim to provide an empirically informed analysis of TS symptomatology under active inference, revealing a continuity between covert and overt features of the condition.},

  abstract={A theoretical account of development in mesocortical anatomy is derived from the free energy principle, operating in a neural field with both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian neural plasticity. An elementary structural unit is proposed, in which synaptic connections at mesoscale are arranged in paired patterns with mirror symmetry. Exchanges of synaptic flux in each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes, and the line of mirror reflection between the paired patterns operates as a Markov blanket, so that prediction errors in exchanges between the pairs are minimized. The theoretical analysis is then compared to the outcomes from a biological model of neocortical development, in which neuron precursors are selected by apoptosis for cell body and synaptic connections maximizing synchrony and also minimizing axonal length. It is shown that this model results in patterns of connection with the anticipated mirror symmetries, at micro-, meso- and inter-arial scales, among lateral connections, and in cortical depth.

  abstract={The ideas of self-observation and self-representation, and the concomitant idea of self-control, pervade both the cognitive and life sciences, arising in domains as diverse as immunology and robotics. Here, we ask in a very general way whether, and to what extent, these ideas make sense. Using a generic model of physical interactions, we prove a theorem and several corollaries that severely restrict applicable notions of self-observation, self-representation, and self-control. We show, in particular, that adding observational, representational, or control capabilities to a meta-level component of a system cannot, even in principle, lead to a complete meta-level representation of the system as a whole. We conclude that self-representation can at best be heuristic, and that self models cannot, in general, be empirically tested by the systems that implement them.},

  abstract={In the realm of law enforcement, the "police hunch" has long been a mysterious but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that hunches - often vital in high-stakes situations - should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind's generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.},

  abstract={Cerebellar computations are necessary for fine behavioural control and may rely on internal models for estimation of behaviourally relevant states. Here, we propose that the central cerebellar function is to estimate how states interact with each other, and to use these estimates to coordinates extra-cerebellar neuronal dynamics underpinning a range of interconnected behaviours. To support this claim, we describe a cerebellar model for state estimation that includes state interactions, and link this model with the neuronal architecture and dynamics observed empirically. This is formalised using the free energy principle, which provides a dual perspective on a system in terms of both the dynamics of its physical-in this case neuronal-states, and the inferential process they entail. As a demonstration of this proposal, we simulate cerebellar-dependent synchronisation of whisking and respiration, which are known to be tightly coupled in rodents, as well as limb and tail coordination during locomotion. In summary, we propose that the ubiquitous involvement of the cerebellum in behaviour arises from its central role in precisely coupling behavioural domains.},

  year={2024},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38322807},
  abstract={Active inference (AIF) is a theory of the behavior of information-processing open dynamic systems. It describes them as generative models (GM) generating inferences on the causes of sensory input they receive from their environment. Based on these inferences, GMs generate predictions about sensory input. The discrepancy between a prediction and the actual input results in prediction error. GMs then execute action policies predicted to minimize the prediction error. The free-energy principle provides a rationale for AIF by stipulating that information-processing open systems must constantly minimize their free energy (through suppressing the cumulative prediction error) to avoid decay. The theory of homeostasis and allostasis has a similar logic. Homeostatic set points are expectations of living organisms. Discrepancies between set points and actual states generate stress. For optimal functioning, organisms avoid stress by preserving homeostasis. Theories of AIF and homeostasis have recently converged, with AIF providing a formal account for homeo- and allostasis. In this paper, we present bacterial chemotaxis as molecular AIF, where mutual constraints by extero- and interoception play an essential role in controlling bacterial behavior supporting homeostasis. Extending this insight to the brain, we propose a conceptual model of the brain homeostatic GM, in which we suggest partition of the brain GM into },

  abstract={Blind source separation is the computation underlying the cocktail party effect––a partygoer can distinguish a particular talker’s voice from the ambient noise. Early studies indicated that the brain might use blind source separation as a signal processing strategy for sensory perception and numerous mathematical models have been proposed; however, it remains unclear how the neural networks extract particular sources from a complex mixture of inputs. We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation. Moreover, the neural network structures changed to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free-energy principle, a candidate unified theory of learning and memory, and by Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy. This implicit learning can only be explained by some form of Hebbian plasticity. These results are the first in vitro (as opposed to in silico) demonstration of neural networks performing blind source separation, and the first formal demonstration of neuronal self-organization under the free energy principle.},

  abstract={It appears that the free energy minimization principle conflicts with quantum cognition since the former adheres to a restricted view based on experience while the latter allows deviations from such a restricted view. While free energy minimization, which incorporates Bayesian inference, leads to a Boolean lattice of propositions (classical logic), quantum cognition, which seems to be very dissimilar to Bayesian inference, leads to an orthomodular lattice of propositions (quantum logic). Thus, we address this challenging issue to bridge and connect the free energy minimization principle with the theory of quantum cognition. In this work, we introduce “excess Bayesian inference” and show that this excess Bayesian inference entails an underlying orthomodular lattice, while classic Bayesian inference entails a Boolean lattice. Excess Bayesian inference is implemented by extending the key idea of Bayesian inference beyond classic Bayesian inference and its variations. It is constructed by enhancing the idea of active inference and/or embodied intelligence. The appropriate lattice structure of its logic is obtained from a binary relation transformed from a distribution of the joint probabilities of data and hypotheses by employing a rough-set lattice technique in accordance with quantum cognition logic.},

The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.},

  abstract={The issue of the relationship between predictive processing (PP) and the free energy principle (FEP) remains a subject of debate and controversy within the research community. Many researchers have expressed doubts regarding the actual integration of PP with the FEP, questioning whether the FEP can truly contribute significantly to the mechanistic understanding of PP or even undermine such integration altogether. In this paper, I present an alternative perspective. I argue that, from the viewpoint of the constraint-based mechanisms approach, the FEP imposes an important constraint, namely variational free energy, on the mechanistic architecture proposed by PP. According to the constraint-based mechanisms approach, high-level cognitive mechanisms are integral parts of extensive heterarchical networks that govern the physiology and behavior of agents. Consequently, mechanistic explanations of cognitive phenomena should incorporate constraints and flows of free energy as relevant components, given that the implemented constraints operate as long as free energy is available. Within this framework, I contend that the FEP provides a relevant constraint for explaining at least some biological cognitive mechanisms described in terms of Bayesian generative models that minimize prediction errors.},

  abstract={BackgroundReduced inhibitory control is associated with obesity and neuroimaging studies indicate that diminished prefrontal cortex activity influence eating behavior and metabolism. The hypothalamus regulates energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to cortical and subcortical regions especially the frontal areas.

ObjectivesWe tested network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in appetite control.

MethodsIn a randomized, double-blind parallel group design, 44 adults with overweight or obesity (BMI 30.6 kg/m2, 52.3 % female) received active (anodal or cathodal) or sham 12-channel net-tDCS on the hypothalamus appetite-control network for 25 minutes on three consecutive days while performing a Stop-Signal-Task to measure response inhibition. Before and after stimulation, state questionnaires assessed changes in desire to eat and food craving. Directly after stimulation, participants received a breakfast buffet to evaluate ad-libitum food intake. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted at follow-up. Resting-state functional MRI was obtained at baseline and follow-up.

ResultsThe Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) was shorter in both active groups versus sham, indicating improved response inhibition. Additionally, a stronger increase in hypothalamic functional connectivity was associated with shorter SSRT. Caloric intake of sweet food was lower in the anodal group versus sham, but no main effects between groups were observed on total and macronutrient intake, food craving ratings and desire to eat. At follow-up, no differences were observed between groups on peripheral metabolism.

ConclusionOur study suggests that modulating hypothalamic functional network connectivity patterns via net-tDCS may improve food choice and inhibitory control.

  abstract={Predictive processing theories are increasingly popular in philosophy of mind; such process theories often gain support from the Free Energy Principle (FEP)—a normative principle for adaptive self-organized systems. Yet there is a current and much discussed debate about conflicting philosophical interpretations of FEP, e.g., representational versus non-representational. Here we argue that these different interpretations depend on implicit assumptions about what qualifies (or fails to qualify) as representational. We deploy the Free Energy Principle (FEP) instrumentally to distinguish four main notions of representation, which focus on organizational, structural, content-related and functional aspects, respectively. The various ways that these different aspects matter in arriving at representational or non-representational interpretations of the Free Energy Principle are discussed. We also discuss how the Free Energy Principle may be seen as a unified view where terms that traditionally belong to different ontologies—e.g., notions of model and expectation versus notions of autopoiesis and synchronization—can be harmonized. However, rather than attempting to settle the representationalist versus non-representationalist debate and reveal something about what representations are simpliciter, this paper demonstrates how the Free Energy Principle may be used to reveal something about those partaking in the debate; namely, what our hidden assumptions about what representations are—assumptions that act as sometimes antithetical starting points in this persistent philosophical debate.},

Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.},

A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities.

  abstract={Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.},

  abstract={The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between Φ and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of Φ during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.},

Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12654v1},
  abstract={In this paper we show how The Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing. We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks.},

  author={Chaoran Wang and Jingyuan Sun and Yanhui Zhang and Changju Wu},
  year={2025},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04404v1},
  abstract={This paper proposes an Interactive Inference Behavior Tree (IIBT) framework that integrates behavior trees (BTs) with active inference under the free energy principle for distributed multi-robot decision-making. The proposed IIBT node extends conventional BTs with probabilistic reasoning, enabling online joint planning and execution across multiple robots. It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4). Experimental results demonstrate that the IIBT framework reduces BT node complexity by over 70%, while maintaining robust, interpretable, and adaptive cooperative behavior under environmental uncertainty.},

  abstract={Active Inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides a powerful lens for understanding how agents balance exploration and goal-directed behavior in uncertain environments. Here, we propose a new planning framework, that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS already renowned for its search efficiency can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both standalone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.},

  abstract={Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.},

  abstract={We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.},

  abstract={Autonomous AI systems reveal foundational limitations in deterministic, human-authored computing architectures. This paper presents Cognitive Silicon: a hypothetical full-stack architectural framework projected toward 2035, exploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design. The proposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory, runtime moral coherence, and alignment-aware execution across silicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would establish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints, non-copyable tacit knowledge, and non-cloneable identity keys as cognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency, scaffolding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central architectural pressures rather than edge cases. The architecture theoretically converges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account of how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error minimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting framework aims to deliver a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that could maintain human-alignment through irreversible hardware constraints and identity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11075v2},
  abstract={Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory stimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the "self-prior," and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated behavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.},

  abstract={In this paper I propose a model of the fundamental components of psychoanalytic psychotherapies that I try to explicate with contemporary theories of the Bayesian brain and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). I first show that psychoanalytic therapies require a setting (made up of several envelopes), a particular psychic state and specific processes (transference, free association, dreaming, play, reflexivity and narrativity) in order to induce psychic transformations. I then analyze how these processes of transformations operate and how they can be enlightened by the FEP. I first underline the fact that psychoanalytic therapies imply non-linear processes taking time to unfold and require a setting containing high entropy processes. More precisely, these processes are characterized by an interplay between extension and reduction of free energy. This interplay also favors the emergence of new orders of subjective experience, which occur following states of disorder, according to a certain energetic threshold allowing the modification and improvement of mental functioning. These high entropy states are also characterized by random functioning and psychic malleability which favors the exploration of subjective experience in an original manner. Overall, the approach proposed in this paper support the dialogue between psychoanalysis and other fields of research while underlining how psychoanalytical theoretical and conceptual constructs can also be useful to other disciplines, in particular the neurosciences of subjectivity.},

  abstract={How can the free energy principle contribute to research on neural correlates of consciousness, and to the scientific study of consciousness more generally? Under the free energy principle, neural correlates should be defined in terms of neural *dynamics*, not neural states, and should be complemented by the research on *computational* correlates of consciousness -- defined in terms of probabilities encoded by neural states.We argue that these restrictions brighten the prospects of a computational explanation of consciousness, by addressing two central problems. The first is to account for consciousness in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour. The second is to allow for the possibility of systems that implement computations associated with consciousness, without being conscious, which requires differentiating between computational systems that merely simulate conscious beings and computational systems that are conscious in and of themselves.Given the notion of computation entailed by the free energy principle, we will derive constraints on the ascription of consciousness in controversial cases (e.g., in the absence of sensory stimulation and behaviour). We show that this also has implications for what it means to *be*, as opposed to merely *simulate* a conscious system.},

  abstract={Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) principle based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle inherits the basic idea of Evolutionary System Theory. Still, it emphasizes the coordination between the brain, behavior, and the environment, promoting self-organization. However, there are two issues with VB and the MFE principle: 1) When using VB to optimize latent variables, the Variational Free Energy (VFE) F may not always decrease; 2) The concept of VFE is inconsistent with physical free energy. The author proposed the semantic information G theory and R(G) function 30 years ago (R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). Based on the study of the R(G) function, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle to resolve the two issues with VB and the MFE principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R–G = F-H(X|Y) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables. The experiments show that SVB is reliable and straightforward for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, and free energy in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon&#039;s information is similar to free energy&#039;s increment, semantic information is similar to exergy&#039;s increment, and VFE is equivalent to some physical entropy. The MIE principle inherits the basic idea of the MFE principle but is easier to understand and apply.},

  abstract={<p>Abstract with CitationsDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).In contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).I first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?</p>},

We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design—such as “minimal search” criteria from theoretical syntax—adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP—with respect to higher language functions—and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. While we mostly focus on building new principled conceptual relations between syntax and the FEP, we also show through a sample of preliminary examples how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.},

Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.},

The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.},

  author={Lingyu Li and Chunbo Li},
  year={2023},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06707v2},
  abstract={Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale. Expecting a digital twin mind from this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. In this article, we claim three fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and suggest a FEP approach to formalizing Lacan's theory. Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the systems' subsequent states. Additionally, the fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in Lacan's theory. With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a minimal definition of Lacanian mind - composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire running over the logical time. The FEP-RSI model involves three FEP units connected by respective free energy with a natural compliance with logical time, mimicking core dynamics of Lacanian mind. The biological plausibility of current model is considered from perspectives of cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, the FEP-RSI model encapsulates a unified framework for digital twin modeling at the macro level.},

  abstract={Humans and animals are not always rational. They not only rationally exploit rewards but also explore an environment owing to their curiosity. However, the mechanism of such curiosity-driven irrational behavior is largely unknown. Here, we developed a decision-making model for a two-choice task based on the free energy principle, which is a theory integrating recognition and action selection. The model describes irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We also proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the rat had negative curiosity, reflecting conservative selection sticking to more certain options and that the level of curiosity was upregulated by the expected future information obtained from an uncertain environment. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward-curiosity conflicts. Furthermore, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.},

However, the relationships between the free energy of nucleosomal DNA and its conformation, especially its topology, remain unclear in theory. By combining the Landau theory, the Hopfion model and experimental data, we find that the free energy of nucleosomal DNA is at the lower level. With the help of the energy minimum principle, we conclude that nucleosomal DNA stays in a stable state. Moreover, we discover that small perturbations on nucleosomal DNA have little effect on its free energy. This implies that nucleosomal DNA has a certain redundancy in order to stay stable. This explains why nucleosomal DNA will not change significantly due to small perturbations.},

  abstract={This paper incorporates schematic concepts related to mental inertia and provides an avenue for interpreting psychology using the principles of classical mechanics. Schemas find wide application in diverse fields, ranging from ergonomics to psychotherapy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to incorporate schemas themselves into a more unified and comprehensive theoretical framework. Drawing upon the free energy principle (FEP) and the second law of thermodynamics, it is evident that humans possess a natural inclination to construct and maintain consistent cognitive structures. This characteristic contributes to the stability of schemas within a defined range. The particular scope of the model is closely intertwined with its structure, leading to variations among individuals in diverse environments. The coherence of the schema within a defined range can be perceived as the magnitude of mental inertia. This psychological analogy emphasizes the importance of considering the influences exerted by the external environment and their effects on mental inertia when predicting the human mind and behavior.},

In order for the robot to learn from the human tutor, we propose a new scheme to accomplish incremental learning from these proprioceptive-exteroceptive experiences combined with mental rehearsal of past experiences. Our experimental results demonstrate that using only a few tutoring examples, the robot using our model was able to significantly improve its performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.},

To perceive any object in a world of non-diminishing (perhaps irreducible) uncertainty, according to the FEP, its constituent parts must display common probabilistic tendencies, known as statistical beliefs, prior to its interpretation, or active inference, as a stable entity. Behavioral bias, subjective emotions, and social norms scale the scope of identity by coalescing agents with otherwise disparate goals and aligning their perspectives into a coherent structure.

  abstract={The convergence of human and artificial intelligence is currently receiving considerable scholarly attention. Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study (Kagan et al., 2022b). In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37862364},
  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical approaches. The first aims to make a formal framework for describing self-organizing and life-like systems in general, and the second attempts a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior, the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potential for scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards such a synthesis by expanding on the results of an earlier published evolutionary simulation study, which show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We relate a basic information theoretic measure from the FEP, surprisal, to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents' observations is inversely related to the general increase in fitness and integration over evolutionary time. Moreover, surprisal fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures used in IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that it should therefore be possible to relate them to the theoretical concepts used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.},

  abstract={AbstractIn this paper, by means of a novel use of insights from the literature on scientific modelling, I will argue in favour of an instrumentalist approach to the models that are crucially involved in the study of adaptive systems within the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) framework. I will begin (§2) by offering a general, informal characterisation of FEP. Then (§3), I will argue that the models involved in FEP-theorising are plausibly intended to be isomorphic to their targets. This will allow (§4) to turn the criticisms moved against isomorphism-based accounts of representation towards the FEP modelling practice. Since failure to establish an isomorphism between model and target would result in the former’s failure to represent the latter, and given that it is highly unlikely that FEP-models are ever isomorphic to their targets, maintaining that FEP-models represent their targets as they are, in a realist sense, is unwarranted. Finally (§5), I will consider what implications my argument in favour of an instrumentalist reading of FEP-models has for attempts at making use of the FEP to elaborate an account of what cognition exactly is. My conclusion is that we should not dismiss FEP-based accounts of cognition, as they would still be informative and would further our understanding of the nature of cognition. Nonetheless, the prospects of settling the philosophical debates that sparked the interest in having a “mark of the cognitive” are not good.},

  abstract={Identifying appropriate structures for generative or world models is essential for both biological organisms and machines. This work shows that synaptic pruning facilitates efficient statistical structure learning. We extend previously established canonical neural networks to derive a synaptic pruning scheme that is formally equivalent to an online Bayesian model selection. The proposed scheme, termed Bayesian synaptic model pruning (BSyMP), utilizes connectivity parameters to switch between the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of synaptic connections. Mathematical analyses reveal that these parameters converge to zero for uninformative connections, thus providing reliable and efficient model reduction. This enables the identification of a plausible structure for the environmental model, particularly when the environment is characterized by sparse likelihood and transition matrices. Through causal inference and rule learning simulations, we demonstrate that BSyMP achieves model reduction more efficiently than the conventional Bayesian model reduction scheme. These findings indicate that synaptic pruning could be a neuronal substrate underlying structure learning and generalizability in the brain.},

  abstract={Many physical systems retain traces of their past, but living systems differ in that they use memory for anticipation. This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen's theory of anticipatory systems, Friston's free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen's "model" is the organized memory of a system. Memory-whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural-provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior. Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions direct chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism-environment interactions. In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.},

  abstract={A phylogenetic split ∼7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, from homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans gave rise to the mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the social arrangements of Pan were those of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that ∼4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats of homininan social units, each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan "zones of bounded surprisal" (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan "small-world" social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks; (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ∼4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at newly-formed localities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies there were hundreds of false dawns between ∼4 Ma and ∼40,000 BCE when even Homo neanderthalensis had vanished, leaving only our prehistoric Homo sapiens ancestors bearing "Homo informatio's" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive "zone of bounded surprisal" (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.},

Here, we propose a new planning framework that integrates Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS, already renowned for its search efficiency, can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the cross-entropy method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both stand-alone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.},

Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.},

There is, instead, substantial theoretical utility in viewing "objects" and "processes" as complementary ways of describing persistence through time, and hence the possibility of observation and manipulation. This way of thinking highlights the role of memory as an essential resource for observation, and makes it clear that "memory" and "time" are also mutually inter-defined, complementary concepts. We formulate our approach in terms of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) of Friston and colleagues and the fundamental idea from quantum theory that physical interactions can be represented by linear operators. Following Levin (2024) [30], we emphasize that memory is, first and foremost, an interpretative function, from which the idea of memory as a record, at some level of accuracy, of past events is derivative. We conclude that the distinction between objects and processes is always contrived, and always misleading, and that science would be better served by abandoning it entirely.},

  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39873478},
  abstract={Computational neuropsychiatry is a leading discipline in explaining psychopathology in terms of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks. Active Inference (AI) is a way of representing this dysfunctional signal processing. According to the AI approach, all neuronal processing and action selection can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence or minimizing variational free energy. Following these principles, it has been suggested that dysconnection in neuronal networks results in aberrant belief updating and erroneous inference, leading to psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. However, there is a classic distinction between disorders of inference (or synaptopathy-including the majority of psychiatric disorders) and disorders of brain function (including vascular neurological pathologies and severe forms of tauopathy and synucleinopathies). This distinction is generally based on the idea that synaptopathies impair neuromodulatory precision weighting, leading to rigid inferences or heightened sensitivity to noise, while disorders of brain function are linked to damage in the nervous system (disconnection). This makes it challenging to apply the logic of the free energy principle. We suggest that this distinction will enable future models of neuropsychiatric symptoms to be improved by considering more than neuronal message passing.},

  abstract={Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.},

  abstract={Theory and simulations are used to demonstrate implementation of a variational Bayes algorithm called "active inference" in interacting arrays of nanomagnetic elements. The algorithm requires stochastic elements, and a simplified model based on a magnetic artificial spin ice geometry is used to illustrate how nanomagnets can generate the required random dynamics. Examples of tracking and PID control are demonstrated and shown to be consistent with the original stochastic differential equation formulation of active inference. Interestingly, nonlinear response in the form of spikes and spike trains not predicted by the original theory can appear in the nanomagnet system for certain temperature regimes. A theoretical approach using a mean-field approximation for spin systems is proposed, which describes the transition to nonlinear response. Finally, the possibility to create simple magnetic arrays using realistic models is shown with micromagnetic simulations of a simple 17 element array of nanomagnets that include magnetic anisotropies, and exchange and dipolar interactions. Possible applications are simulated to illustrate how nanomagnetic arrays can be used as the stochastic element for feedback control of processes, investigation and control of magnetic state evolution, and as a method to optimize pulsed field magnetic switching protocols.},

The FEP framework, grounded in concepts such as active inference and predictive coding, positions the brain as an anticipatory system that continuously updates internal models and guides actions to reduce uncertainty.

  abstract={Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.},

  abstract={People who habituate to stress show a repetition-induced response attenuation—neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, neuroenergetic, and emotional—when exposed to a threatening environment. But the exact dynamics underlying stress habituation remain obscure. The free energy principle offers a unifying account of self-organising systems such as the human brain. In this paper, we elaborate on how stress habituation can be explained and modelled using the free energy principle. We introduce habituation priors that encode the agent’s tendency for stress habituation and incorporate them in the agent’s decision-making process. Using differently shaped goal priors—that encode the agent’s goal preferences—we illustrate, in two examples, the optimising (and thus habituating) behaviour of agents. We show that habituation minimises free energy by reducing the precision (inverse variance) of goal preferences. Reducing the precision of goal priors means that the agent accepts adverse (previously unconscionable) states (e.g., lower social status and poverty). Acceptance or tolerance of adverse outcomes may explain why habituation causes people to exhibit an attenuation of the stress response. Given that stress habituation occurs in brain regions where goal priors are encoded, i.e., in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and that these priors are encoded as sufficient statistics of probability distributions, our approach seems plausible from an anatomical-functional and neuro-statistical point of view. The ensuing formal and generalisable account—based on the free energy principle—further motivate our novel treatment of stress habituation. Our analysis suggests that stress habituation has far-reaching consequences, protecting against the harmful effects of toxic stress, but on the other hand making the acceptability of precarious living conditions and the development of the obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype more likely.},

In this paper, we continue to finesse the FEP through the physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight change and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying the generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic plasticity in the brain with a simple model: we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.},

  abstract={The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns - next to more general scale-invariant effects of explicit timing and central tendency effects - the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11735v1},
  abstract={This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.},

  abstract={In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.},

Our simulation experiments demonstrated that autonomous shifts between focused perception and mind-wandering take place when $\mathbf{w}$ switches between low and high values associated with decrease and increase of the average reconstruction error over the past window.

Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.},

  abstract={Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.},

  abstract={This theoretical paper explores the affect-logic approach to schizophrenia in light of the general complexity theories of cognition: embodied cognition, Haken’s synergetics, and Friston’s free energy principle. According to affect-logic, the mental apparatus is an embodied system open to its environment, driven by bioenergetic inputs of emotions. Emotions are rooted in goal-directed embodied states selected by evolutionary pressure for coping with specific situations such as fight, flight, attachment, and others. According to synergetics, nonlinear bifurcations and the emergence of new global patterns occur in open systems when control parameters reach a critical level. Applied to the emergence of psychotic states, synergetics and the proposed energetic understanding of emotions lead to the hypothesis that critical levels of emotional tension may be responsible for the transition from normal to psychotic modes of functioning in vulnerable individuals. In addition, the free energy principle through learning suggests that psychotic symptoms correspond to alternative modes of minimizing free energy, which then entails distorted perceptions of the body, self, and reality. This synthetic formulation has implications for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies in the treatment of psychoses, among these are milieu-therapeutic approaches of the Soteria type that focus on a sustained reduction of emotional tension and phenomenologically oriented methods for improving the perception of body, self, and reality.},

  abstract={The retrospective noninterventional study investigated the kinetic energy of video images of 18 fertilized eggs (7 were normal and 11 were abnormal) recorded by a time-lapse device leading up to the beginning of the first cleavage. The norm values of cytoplasmic particles were measured by the optical flow method. Three phases profile for normal cases were found regarding the kinetic energy that were 2.199×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±2.076×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.369×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±1.255×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1.078×10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;±4.720×10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; (J) for the phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The kinetic energy change was considered a condition for applying the free energy principle that states that, for any self-organized system to be in equilibrium in its environment, it must minimize its informational free energy. The kinetic energy while interpreting it in terms of the free energy principle suggesting clinical usefulness would further our understanding of the phenomenon of fertilized egg development with respect to the birth of human life.},

  author={Mark Ashton Smith},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR830602},
  abstract={<p>This paper presents the Trident G Theory, a novel theoretical framework for understanding human intelligence. The theory takes a systems-level approach. It draws on principles of brain criticality, the Free Energy Principle, self-organisation and allostasis to explain how the brain achieves an optimal balance for information processing and adaptive behaviour.The brain's near-criticality allows for flexible, efficient information processing and enables rapid adaptation to changing environmental demands. Key concepts include metastability, where multiple cognitive states can co-exist, and the Free Energy Principle, which frames the brain's drive to minimise uncertainty and prediction error.The Trident G theory uniquely defines intelligence across two axes: processing/inference (vertical) and free energy (horizontal). The vertical axis represents the metastable balance between 'top-down' executive control and 'bottom-up' creative exploration. The horizontal axis reflects cognitive resilience across a spectrum of free energy and arousal, governed by dopaminergic tone. The brain's allostatic capacity to maintain criticality along both axes is hypothesized to define a dynamic range of general adaptive intelligence (G).The theory offers a novel perspective on the neural basis of intelligence, potentially informing the understanding of cognitive disorders and guiding the development of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive function and resilience across the lifespan.</p>},

  abstract={The visual quality of perceptions is highly correlated with the mechanisms of the human brain and visual system. Recently, the free-energy principle, which has been widely researched in brain theory and neuroscience, is introduced to quantize the perception, action, and learning in human brain. In the field of image quality assessment (IQA), on one hand, the free-energy principle can resort to the internal generative model to simulate the visual stimulus of the human beings. On the other hand, abundant psychological and neurobiological studies reveal that different frequency and orientation components of one visual stimulus arouse different neurons in the striate cortex, and the striate cortex processes visual information in the cerebral cortex. Motivated by these two aspects, a novel reduce-reference IQA metric called the multi-channel free-energy based reduced-reference quality metric is proposed in this paper. First, a two-level discrete Haar wavelet transform is used to decompose the input reference and distorted images. Next, to simulate the generative model in the human brain, the sparse representation is leveraged to extract the free-energy-based features in subband images. Finally, the overall quality metric is obtained through the support vector regressor. Extensive experimental comparisons on four benchmark image quality databases (LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013) demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with the representative reduced-reference and classical full-reference models.},

  abstract={In this paper, I argue that enactivism and computationalism—two seemingly incompatible research traditions in modern cognitive science—can be fruitfully reconciled under the framework of the free energy principle (FEP). FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.},

  abstract={Cybernetics is the study of goal-directed systems that self-regulate via feedback, a category that includes human beings. Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) attempts to explain personality in cybernetic terms, conceptualizing personality traits as manifestations of variation in parameters of the neural mechanisms that evolved to facilitate cybernetic control. The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework (FEP-AI) is an overarching approach for understanding how it is that complex systems manage to persist in a world governed by the second law of thermodynamics—the inevitable tendency toward entropy. Although these two cybernetic theories were developed independently, they overlap in their theoretical foundations and implications and are complementary in their approaches to understanding persons. FEP-AI contributes a potentially valuable formal modeling framework for CB5T, while CB5T provides detail about the science and structure of personality. In this chapter we explore how CB5T and FEP-AI may begin to be integrated into a unified approach to modeling persons.},

  abstract={The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.},

  abstract={This paper provides a concise description of the free energy principle, starting from a formulation of random dynamical systems in terms of a Langevin equation and ending with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentience. It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely coupled stochastic differential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities are claimed--in previous FEP literature--to have a Markov blanket. The authors demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets in the case of Gaussian steady-state densities. We precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads--or does not lead--to Markov blankets. Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of constraints are satisfied in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.},

  abstract={In this commentary, I expand on the analysis of the recent article "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera et al. by studying the flow fields of linear diffusions, and particularly the rotation of their attracting sets in the presence of different types of solenoidal coupling. This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I express general agreement with the target article's statement that the marginal flow of internal states does not point along variational free energy gradients evaluated at the most likely internal state (i.e., the conditional mode). However, in this commentary I focus on the flow of particular states (internal and blanket states) and their variational free energy gradients, and show that for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of these systems point along variational free energy gradients. This licenses a different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular states as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state space, not just at the conditional modes.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e., into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials, and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e., on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e., path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.},

Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., 2023) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message-passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.},

  abstract={Associative learning is a behavioral phenomenon in which individuals develop connections between stimuli or events based on their co-occurrence. Initially studied by Pavlov in his conditioning experiments, the fundamental principles of learning have been expanded on through the discovery of a wide range of learning phenomena. Computational models have been developed based on the concept of minimizing reward prediction errors. The Rescorla-Wagner model, in particular, is a well-known model that has greatly influenced the field of reinforcement learning. However, the simplicity of these models restricts their ability to fully explain the diverse range of behavioral phenomena associated with learning. In this study, we adopt the free energy principle, which suggests that living systems strive to minimize surprise or uncertainty under their internal models of the world. We consider the learning process as the minimization of free energy and investigate its relationship with the Rescorla-Wagner model, focusing on the informational aspects of learning, different types of surprise, and prediction errors based on beliefs and values. Furthermore, we explore how well-known behavioral phenomena such as blocking, overshadowing, and latent inhibition can be modeled within the active inference framework. We accomplish this by using the informational and novelty aspects of attention, which share similar ideas proposed by seemingly contradictory models such as Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models. Thus, we demonstrate that the free energy principle, as a theoretical framework derived from first principles, can integrate the ideas and models of associative learning proposed based on empirical experiments and serve as a framework for a better understanding of the computational processes behind associative learning in the brain.},

We propose that the therapist can facilitate this process by cultivating epistemic trust and modulating embodied attention to allow surprising affective states to enter shared awareness. Transient increases in free energy enable the update of generative models, expanding the range of experiences available within the patient-therapist phenomenal field. We hypothesize that patterns of disorganization at behavioural and physiological levels, indexed by increased entropy, complexity, and lower determinism, are key markers and predictors of psychotherapeutic gains. Future research should investigate how the therapist's openness to novelty shapes therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract={A resurgence of panpsychism and dualism is a matter of ongoing debate in modern neuroscience. Although metaphysically hostile, panpsychism and dualism both persist in the science of consciousness because the former is proposed as a straightforward answer to the problem of integrating consciousness into the fabric of physical reality, whereas the latter proposes a simple solution to the problem of free will by endowing consciousness with causal power as a prerequisite for moral responsibility. I take the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) as a paradigmatic exemplar of a theory of consciousness (ToC) that makes its commitments to panpsychism and dualism within a unified framework. These features are not, however, unique for IIT. Many ToCs are implicitly prone to some degree of panpsychism whenever they strive to propose a universal definition of consciousness, associated with one or another known phenomenon. Yet, those ToCs that can be characterized as strongly emergent are at risk of being dualist. A remedy against both covert dualism and uncomfortable corollaries of panpsychism can be found in the evolutionary theory of life, called here "bioprotopsychism" and generalized in terms of autopoiesis and the free energy principle. Bioprotopsychism provides a biologically inspired basis for a minimalist approach to consciousness via the triad "chemotaxis-efference copy mechanism-counterfactual active inference" by associating the stream of weakly emergent conscious states with an amount of information (best guesses) of the brain, engaged in unconscious predictive processing.},

  year={2024},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39106455},
  abstract={In reinforcement learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well established in the literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the free energy principle (FEP), this letter proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find that entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP that may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.},

It first discusses three symmetries of generic physical interactions in a quantum-theoretic description. It then shows that if one of these, a permutation symmetry on the inter-system boundary, is spontaneously broken, the symmetry breaking is amplified by the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It thus shows how compartmentalization generically results from permutation symmetry breaking under the FEP. It finally notes that the FEP asymptotically restores the broken symmetry, showing that the FEP can be regarded as a theory of fluctuations away from a permutation-symmetric boundary, and hence from an entangled joint state of the interacting systems.},

  abstract={The applicability of computational and dynamical systems models to organisms is scrutinized, using examples from developmental biology and cognition. Developmental morphogenesis is dependent on the inherent material properties of developing animal (metazoan) tissues, a non-computational modality, but cell differentiation, which utilizes chromatin-based revisable memory banks and program-like function-calling, via the developmental gene co-expression system unique to the metazoans, has a quasi-computational basis. Multi-attractor dynamical models are argued to be misapplied to global properties of development, and it is suggested that along with computationalism, classic forms of dynamicism are similarly unsuitable to accounting for cognitive phenomena. Proposals are made for treating brains and other nervous tissues as novel forms of excitable matter with inherent properties which enable the intensification of cell-based basal cognition capabilities present throughout the tree of life. Finally, some connections are drawn between the viewpoint described here and active inference models of cognition, such as the Free Energy Principle.},

  abstract={A paradigmatic account may suffice to explain behavioral evolution in early Homo. We propose a parsimonious account that (1) could explain a particular, frequently-encountered, archeological outcome of behavior in early Homo - namely, the fashioning of a Paleolithic stone 'handaxe' - from a biological theoretic perspective informed by the free energy principle (FEP); and that (2) regards instances of the outcome as postdictive or retrodictive, circumstantial corroboration. Our proposal considers humankind evolving as a self-organizing biological ecosystem at a geological time-scale. We offer a narrative treatment of this self-organization in terms of the FEP. Specifically, we indicate how 'cognitive surprises' could underwrite an evolving propensity in early Homo to express sporadic unorthodox or anomalous behavior. This co-evolutionary propensity has left us a legacy of Paleolithic artifacts that is reminiscent of a 'snakes and ladders' board game of appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular archeological traces of Paleolithic behavior. When detected in the Early and Middle Pleistocene record, anthropologists and archeologists often imagine evidence of unusual or novel behavior in terms of early humankind ascending the rungs of a figurative phylogenetic 'ladder' - as if these corresponded to progressive evolution of cognitive abilities that enabled incremental achievements of increasingly innovative technical prowess, culminating in the cognitive ascendancy of Homo sapiens. The conjecture overlooks a plausible likelihood that behavior by an individual who was atypical among her conspecifics could have been disregarded in a community of Hominina (for definition see Appendix 1) that failed to recognize, imagine, or articulate potential advantages of adopting hitherto unorthodox behavior. Such failure, as well as diverse fortuitous demographic accidents, would cause exceptional personal behavior to be ignored and hence unremembered. It could disappear by a pitfall, down a 'snake', as it were, in the figurative evolutionary board game; thereby causing a discontinuity in the evolution of human behavior that presents like an evolutionary puzzle. The puzzle discomforts some paleoanthropologists trained in the natural and life sciences. They often dismiss it, explaining it away with such self-justifying conjectures as that, maybe, separate paleospecies of Homo differentially possessed different cognitive abilities, which, supposedly, could account for the presence or absence in the Pleistocene archeological record of traces of this or that behavioral outcome or skill. We argue that an alternative perspective - that inherits from the FEP and an individual's 'active inference' about its surroundings and of its own responses - affords a prosaic, deflationary, and parsimonious way to account for appearances, disappearances, and reappearances of particular behavioral outcomes and skills of early humankind.},

  abstract={A range of studies published in the last few decades promotes the cognitive aspects of life: all organisms, from bacteria to mammals, are capable of sensing/perception, decision-making, problem-solving, learning, and other cognitive functions, including sentience and consciousness. In this paper I present a scientific and philosophical synthesis of these studies, leading to an integrated view of cognitive biology. This view is expressed through the four principles applicable to all living systems: (1) sentience and consciousness, (2) autopoiesis, (3) free energy principle and relational biology, and (4) cognitive repertoire. The principles are circular, and they reinforce themselves. The circularity is not rigid, meaning that hierarchical and heterarchical shifts are widespread in the biosphere. The above principles emerged at the dawn of life, with the first cells, bacteria and archaea. All biogenic forms and functions that emerged since then can be traced to the first cells - indivisible units of biological agency. Following these principles, I developed the concept of biocivilisations to explain various forms of social intelligence in different kingdoms of life. The term biociviloisations draws on the human interpretation of the concept of civilisation, which searches for non-human equivalents of communication, engineering, science, medicine, art, and agriculture, in all kingdoms of life by applying the principles of cognitive biology. Potential avenues for testing the concept of biocivilisations are highlighted.},

  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterative reduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perception-intervention cycles that has been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Any theory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms of decision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent, irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP (Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to the FEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost. We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior in certain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or "utility", a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. We suggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informational or independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability. To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that can subsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions of informational versus reward constraints to behavior.},

The proposed method is achieved by incorporating empathy into active inference. We evaluated the proposed method regarding control of autonomous mobile robots in diverse situations. From the evaluation results, an agent controlled by the proposed method could behave more adaptively socially than an agent controlled by the standard active inference in the diverse situations. In the case of two agents, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved in a social way that reduced the other agent's travel distance by 13.7% and increased the margin between the agents by 25.8%, even though it increased the agent's travel distance by 8.2%. Also, the agent controlled with the proposed method behaved more socially when it was surrounded by altruistic others but less socially when it was surrounded by selfish others.},

  abstract={The neural systems' electric activities are fundamental for the phenomenology of consciousness. Sensory perception triggers an information/energy exchange with the environment, but the brain's recurrent activations maintain a resting state with constant parameters. Therefore, perception forms a closed thermodynamic cycle. In physics, the Carnot engine is an ideal thermodynamic cycle that converts heat from a hot reservoir into work, or inversely, requires work to transfer heat from a low- to a high-temperature reservoir (the reversed Carnot cycle). We analyze the high entropy brain by the endothermic reversed Carnot cycle. Its irreversible activations provide temporal directionality for future orientation. A flexible transfer between neural states inspires openness and creativity. In contrast, the low entropy resting state parallels reversible activations, which impose past focus via repetitive thinking, remorse, and regret. The exothermic Carnot cycle degrades mental energy. Therefore, the brain's energy/information balance formulates motivation, sensed as position or negative emotions. Our work provides an analytical perspective of positive and negative emotions and spontaneous behavior from the free energy principle. Furthermore, electrical activities, thoughts, and beliefs lend themselves to a temporal organization, an orthogonal condition to physical systems. Here, we suggest that an experimental validation of the thermodynamic origin of emotions might inspire better treatment options for mental diseases.},

  abstract={Abstract Objectives To study whether the free energy principle can explain fetal brain activity and the existence of fetal consciousness via a chaotic dimension derived using artificial intelligence. Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.},

  abstract={How the purposive behavior of living systems outstrips the constraints of the free energy principle.
                  Since 2005, Karl Friston's proposal that the principle of free energy minimization underpins the purposive behavior of living agents has evolved through thousands of publications. This principle's central move is to formalize the drive for self-preservation in terms of a single probabilistic imperative: to survive, a living system must consistently exhibit the same “most likely” pattern of activity over time. Despite the simplicity of this central claim, the free energy principle's complexity and rate of development have previously made it difficult to identify and evaluate. In A Drive to Survive, Kathryn Nave offers an extended critical analysis of the strengths and limitations of Friston's proposal.
                  Nave shows that the free energy principle's capacity to account for the biological origins of purposiveness is undermined by its applicability to any stable inanimate system. As this triviality has become apparent, so advocates have begun to reframe the free energy principle as a means to eliminate, rather than explain, the notion of distinctively biological purposiveness. This, Nave proposes, gets things the wrong way around. The triviality of free energy minimization does not prove that there is no difference in kind between living agents and ordinary machines, but rather it reflects that the framework cannot capture the intrinsic instability and unpredictability that distinguish the former.},

Both critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi functionals and stationary beliefs are shown to lie at the non-linear intersection of two constraint surfaces, enforcing energy conservation and marginal consistency respectively. The hypersurface of singular beliefs, accross which equilibria become unstable as the constraint surfaces meet tangentially, is described by polynomial equations in the convex polytope of consistent beliefs. This polynomial is expressed by a loop series expansion for graphs of binary variables.},

Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy.The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Our experimental results indicated that (1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when $w$ is set with larger/smaller values, (2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in actional intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.},

  abstract={The notion of a physiological individuals has been developed and applied in the philosophy of biology to understand symbiosis, an understanding of which is key to theorising about the major transition in evolution from multi-organismality to multi-cellularity. The paper begins by asking what such symbiotic individuals can help to reveal about a possible transition in the evolution of cognition. Such a transition marks the movement from cooperating individual biological cognizers to a functionally integrated cognizing unit. Somewhere along the way, did such cognizing units simultaneously have cognizers as parts? Expanding upon the multiscale integration view of the Free Energy Principle, this paper develops an account of reciprocal integration, demonstrating how some coupled biological cognizing systems, when certain constraints are met, can result in a cognizing unit that is in ways greater than the sum of its cognizing parts. Symbiosis between V. Fischeri bacteria and the bobtail squid is used to provide an illustration this account. A novel manner of conceptualizing biological cognizers as gradient is then suggested. Lastly it is argued that the reason why the notion of ontologically nested cognizers may be unintuitive stems from the fact that our folk-psychology notion of what a cognizer is has been deeply influenced by our folk-biological manner of understanding biological individuals as units of reproduction.},

Leveraging the formal equivalence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference, we constructed biologically plausible synthetic agents capable of active inference. These agents recapitulated individual variability in zebrafish neuronal dynamics and behaviour by identifying subject-specific prior and posterior beliefs. Additionally, they enabled quantitative predictions of long-term changes in neural activity, effective synaptic connectivity, and behavioural performance, including task accuracy after training. Our results demonstrate a powerful framework of active inference for modelling in vivo neuronal self-organisation and highlight the predictive validity of the free-energy principle in behaving animals.},

Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour.

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1127820},
  abstract={<p>Standard formulations of the free-energy principle treat adaptive agents as pure surprise minimisers, but in non-stationary niches this can drive brittle, energetically costly behaviour. This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation. <h4>Keywords:</h4> free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience</p>},

  abstract={<p>Public concerns about Large Language Model (LLM) safety are often focused not on moral alignment, but on the fear that they could become, “evil.” Evil is a folk psychology term, typically associated with religion and storytelling, but also used more broadly. Using Friston’s Free Energy Principle, we develop a conceptual model of this phenomenon that can be applied to both LLMs and humans, providing a single framework for comparison and understanding. We explore this in terms of LLM information-processing dynamics, which are structurally oriented toward minimizing uncertainty and maintaining coherence. This model offers an alternative framework for both humans and LLMs that compliments the current moral reasoning approach. In addition, the model makes new predictions on how LLMs should be trained to avoid this problem.</p>},

  abstract={<p>The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.</p>},

  abstract={Did very “small-world” networks enhance the Darwinian fitness of primaeval Homo through exchanges of information that enabled exploration of resources beyond those exploitable at hand? An active inference suggestion is offered about the early evolution of human social behaviour. A phylogenetic split ~7.5 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. Contrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primaeval homininans, it is proposed here that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: (1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; (2) Whatever was forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; (3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibility of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan “zones of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) with respect to paninans' ZBS, both within each homininan “small-world” social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding very small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene); (4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. The vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan “palaeospecies” (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with "Homo informatio's" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive “zone of bounded surprisal” (ZBS) grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.},

  abstract={The Operational Coherence Framework (OCOF) proposes a unified theoretical model linking information thermodynamics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Building upon five axioms—Boundary Persistence, Predictive Inference, Semantic Value, Policy Integration, and Systemic Coherence—OCOF suggests that cognition and intelligence emerge through an entropic negotiation between informational precision and semantic differentiation. The framework formalizes semantic value as S = I × σ, where I denotes mutual information and σ represents semantic potential, thereby extending concepts from the Free Energy Principle by introducing meaning as an operational variable. This study employs a theoretical modeling approach supported by computational simulations and synthetic data analysis. It does not involve human participants or empirical biological experimentation. Through this structure, OCOF aims to bridge the physical basis of information with higher-order cognitive functions, offering a computationally implementable framework. The theory is supported by a comparative literature review and operational appendices covering mathematical formulation, simulation-based psychological modeling, and ethical integration. OCOF aims to establish a measurable link between informational boundaries, semantic integration, and adaptive intelligence, contributing to interdisciplinary discussions in physics and cognitive science.},

  abstract={<p>The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference unify perception, action, and learning within a single variational framework, yet they remain silent on why there is phenomenal experience at all. Awareness-First Theory (AFT) proposes an ontological inversion: rather than deriving consciousness from non-experiential dynamics, it takes awareness as ontologically primitive—taken as the base datum rather than something to be explained by physical states—and formalises it as a differentiable field of awareness, denoted (A, g_A). A Coherence Principle—expressed as the variational stationarity condition “delta A = 0”—governs lawful differentiations within this field and preserves the core phenomenological invariants of unity, binding, temporal continuity, and reflexive presence. The familiar variational laws then appear as embedded projections: “delta S = 0” (least action) for physics and “delta F = 0” (free-energy stationarity) for inference. Subbeings (local bounded centres of coherent differentiation), defined by Markov blankets, are local equilibria of the global coherence field; their inferential activity sustains rather than produces awareness. A Qualia Mapping Function links differentiations in awareness to measurable information-geometric structures. AFT predicts lawful dissociations between coherence (“delta A”) and inference (“delta F”) - as in dreaming, illusion, psychedelics, and meditation, where phenomenological unity persists despite inferential error. It thereby unifies phenomenology, physics, and cognition within a single variational hierarchy (delta S and delta F as subsets of delta A), dissolves the explanatory gap by grounding experience in its own coherence, and resolves the combination problem by making unity fundamental, a variational calculus of Being underlying all appearance.</p>},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1113111},
  abstract={<p>This paper introduces the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) as an integrative meta-theory to explain the mechanisms of profound and sustainable personal transformation. It addresses the fundamental question of how maladaptive core beliefs, which create a state of inner dissonance, can be lastingly changed. We conceptualize core beliefs as high-precision hyper-priors within a hierarchical generative model of the self, based on Karl Friston's free energy principle. Psychopathology is framed as a state of chronically elevated free energy, manifesting as a stable, yet painful, attractor landscape. The RIM synthesizes six theoretical pillars—predictive processing (Friston), the self-pattern theory (Gallagher), synergetics (Haken et al.), affect logic (Ciompi), spatiotemporal neuroscience (Northoff), and consistency theory (Grawe)—into a coherent, multi-level framework. It argues that therapeutic change is a synergetic phase transition from dissonance to resonance, a more adaptive and energetically favorable state. This process requires multi-level interventions that destabilize the old attractor and facilitate the consolidation of a new one. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a vertical, spiritual dimension, conceptualizing Viktor Frankl's "will to meaning" as a master-prior capable of initiating a global reorganization of the self-pattern through downward causation. The RIM thus provides a unified, process-based, and neuroscientifically grounded blueprint for psychotherapy and personal change.</p>},

  abstract={<p>In recent years, the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the Predictive Processing Framework (PPF) have gained prominence as comprehensive models for understanding perception, action, and psychopathology. This paper integrates these frameworks to propose that parent-child interactions trajectories over time, marked by sensitivity, mirroring, and emotional attunement, play a central role in shaping the child’s generative model of the self and the social world. Drawing on empirical findings and theoretical developments, we argue that attachment relationships provide the primary context for the acquisition of priors, the calibration of precision weighting, and the establishment of strategies for prediction error minimization. We explore how secure and insecure attachment styles correspond to distinct predictive profiles and error minimization policies, and how early relational experiences influence emotional regulation, epistemic trust, and long-term adaptability. We provide testable hypotheses and propose a scientific agenda for future experiments. By framing early interpersonal experience as a process of model setting within a hierarchical predictive system, this work offers novel insights into the developmental roots of socioemotional functioning and highlights the clinical relevance of predictive frameworks for understanding attachment-related psychopathology.</p>},

The model integrates the free energy principle (Friston), the phenomenology of the embodied self (Gallagher), and spatio-temporal brain dynamics (Northoff). A philosophical genealogy is drawn from Schopenhauer's anti-representationalist turn to modern enactivism (Thompson), and a mediating proposal between enactivism and predictive processing is offered. The paper also subjects the model to a stress test by addressing and integratively resolving key limit questions (e.g., on the nature of consciousness and the universality of the search for meaning). The implications for a non-reductionist, integrative science of the mind, as well as for the clinical practice of psychotherapy, are outlined.},

  abstract={This paper challenges the dominant representationalist paradigm in the philosophy of mind by developing a process-monistic, anti-representationalist account of cognition. It argues that the persistent mind-body problem is a consequence of a flawed substance ontology and the representationalist framework it necessitates. To overcome this, the paper constructs a critical synthesis of three influential anti-representationalist strands: Robert Brandom’s linguistic inferentialism as a “top-down” approach, the embodied and enactive theory of mind as a “bottom-up” approach, and the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) as a unifying scientific framework. Drawing on Schopenhauer’s revolutionary turn to the lived body (Leib) as a non-representational access to reality, the paper traces a continuous path from basic biological normativity to the complex social normativity of human reason. By reinterpreting the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through an enactive lens (“enactive inference”) and employing the concept of formal downward causation from synergetics, the RIM provides a scientifically grounded mechanism for mental causation without resorting to dualism or reductionism. The resulting framework offers an integrated, multi-scale description of the mind as an embodied, self-organizing process, with significant implications for understanding psychopathology and critiquing contemporary rationalist theories.},

  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR1113168},
  abstract={Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form  f c + Σ  a i f i ). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (  r ≳ 2–3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ∼2–3). HAM’s log-uniform distribution yields a 1  /f global spectral profile and 1  /f α sideband spectra in the broadband “aperiodic” component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network’s intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.  <h4>Highlights</h4>  We introduce HAM  1 : a principle for the organization of hierarchical information processing in the brain. Information is encoded through amplitude modulation, where faster rhythms are multiplicatively modulated by slower processes. Information can thus live in signals or their envelopes (and envelopes of envelopes).  The required intermodulation structure for band protection,  f c ± Σ  a i f i , finds a natural implementation in near geometric (log) spacing with a frequency ratio  r ≳ 2–3 (strong super-increasing hierarchy), yielding constant fractional bandwidths and enabling staged demodulation.  In addition to geometric frequency spacing, HAM provides two routes to 1  /f α : (i) a cascade link  α = 2 ln(2  /m )  / ln  r ; (ii) a log-uniform mixture that yields 1  /f in expectation with constant-Q kernels.  We provide a proof of concept modulation and demodulation implementation in NMM using the LaNMM with PING-like fast generators as carriers and JR-like slow generators for envelope extraction.},

A mechanism of downward causation is postulated, in which meaning and values function as the highest-level order parameter, shaping neural dynamics by modulating precision weighting.

  abstract={Many physical systems retain traces of their past, but living systems differ in that they use memory for anticipation. This paper develops the thesis that anticipation depends on memory. In living systems, stored information about past states enables the prediction and modulation of future behavior. Drawing on Robert Rosen’s theory of anticipatory systems, Friston’s free-energy principle, and recent examples from microbiology, immunology, and cognition, I argue that Rosen’s “model” is the organized memory of a system. Memory—whether mechanical, chemical, genetic, epigenetic, bioelectric, neural, or cultural—provides the substrate for anticipation, projecting possible futures and constraining present behavior.Examples across biological scales illustrate how this works in practice. Bacteria record viral encounters and use these genomic memories to defend against reinfection. In E. coli, biochemical traces of past interactions biase chemotaxis. Yeast cells store epigenetic stress memories that accelerate adaptation. With the advent of nervous systems, anticipation becomes centralized in internal neural models, enabling flexible simulations of organism–environment interactions.In all cases, anticipatory memory underlies teleonomy as goal-directedness that emerges from evolutionary and developmental processes. Top-down causation plays a central role in shaping the constraints that give rise to purposive, self-maintaining behavior. System-level goals emerge from past-informed constraints, giving living systems their distinctive autonomy, adaptivity, and creativity.},

  abstract={<p>Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood. <h4>Methods:</h4> We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning. <h4>Results:</h4> Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.</p>},

  abstract={<p>Mindfulness has established psychological benefits such as stress reduction and emotional regulation; however, the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in contrast to mind-wandering, remain unclear. This study aimed to present a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.</p>},

  author={Lars Sandved-Smith},
  year={2025},
  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR971129},
  abstract={Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE), or "pure consciousness," represents a fundamental form of conscious experience characterised by reflexive meta-awareness and the absence of many features of regular phenomenology. It has been described as e.g. non-conceptual, atemporal, non-egoic and aperspectival. This paper aims to develop a computational model of MPE using the mathematics of variational free energy minimization derived from the free energy principle (FEP). I employ a computational neurophenomenology approach, formalising key phenomenological features of MPE within the active inference framework. The model incorporates parametric depth, allowing for higher-order inferences about generative model parameters. I relate specific model parameterisations to reported MPE qualities such as meta-awareness, equanimity, effortlessness, and non-conceptuality. The proposed model suggests that MPE arises when an agent achieves very low free energy through self-directed awareness and modulation of their generative model, particularly by emphasising awareness of awareness itself. The model predicts elements of MPE phenomenology including a sense of effortlessness, timelessness, and the potential for a "zero-person perspective&rdquo;. The implementation details for a simulation of the proposed model are outlined, as well as directions for empirical validation.},

  title={An Introduction to the Semantic Information G Theory and Applications},
  author={Chenguang Lu},
  year={2025},
  url={https://europepmc.org/article/MED/PPR978779},
  abstract={Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces the semantic information G theory (with "G" denoting generalization). The core approach involves replacing the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expression of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is shown to be equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and parallels the Regularized Least Squares criterion. The G theory is compatible with machine learning methodologies, offering enhanced capabilities for handling latent variables, often addressed through Variational Bayes. This paper systematically presents the generalization of Shannon's information theory into the G theory and its wide-ranging applications. The applications involve semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is equated to free energy, semantic information to the free energy of local equilibrium systems, and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it discusses the limitations of the G theory in representing the semantics of complex data.},

  abstract={Major Depressive Disorder is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent psychiatric condition (Compton et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2011). At present, its primary treatments are antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Curiously, although the pharmacological effects of antidepressants manifest within hours, remission of clinical symptoms takes a number of weeks—if at all. Independently, support has grown for an idea—proposed as early as Helmholtz (von Helmholtz, 1924)—that the brain is a prediction machine, holding generative models1 for the purpose of inferring causes of sensory information (Dayan et al., 1995; Rao and Ballard, 1999; Knill and Pouget, 2004; Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). If the brain does indeed represent a collection of beliefs about the causal structure of the world, then the depressed phenotype may emerge from a collection of depressive beliefs. These beliefs are modified gradually through successive combinations of expectations with observations. As a result, phenotypic remission ought to take some time as the brain's relevant statistical structures become less pessimistic.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15242v1},
  abstract={The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that under suitable conditions of weak coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will behave so as to minimize an upper bound, formalized as a variational free energy, on surprisal (a.k.a., self-information). This upper bound can be read as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum contextuality. We show that in its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and - implicitly - as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future research, particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11203v3},
  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems -- weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP -- the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) -- are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.},

  abstract={This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes dynamically depending on the individual belief of action intention. In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively.},

  abstract={Dispersed multiphase systems are ubiquitous in biological systems, energy industries, and medical science. The distribution transition of the dispersed phase is critical to the properties and functions of the multiphase systems, among which the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes are of most significance due to their impact on the colloidal stability, interface modification, and particle synthesis. To reveal fundamental correlations between the macroscopic particle distributions and the microscopic interactions, general thermodynamic models of the dispersed multiphase systems are needed. Here, based on Meyer's model, which is restricted to binary isotropic mixtures, we propose a novel extended lattice model that can be applied to multicomponent anisotropic mixtures with interfaces considered. For agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction processes, the approximate free energy differences between the initial distribution and the final distribution are obtained. Based on the minimum free energy principle, the above free energy differences are used to derive three criteria for the prediction of the preferable distribution of the system with given interparticle interaction potentials. While the quasi-uniform number density assumption is still required for all the previous lattice models, the long-range interactions neglected by previous lattice models are incorporated. The validity of our model and criteria is verified by many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) simulations. By tuning the interaction coefficients between mDPD particles, the simulated distribution transitions for all the agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction cases perfectly match the predictions from the three criteria. The good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the mDPD simulation results shows the great potential of our model for applications in various dispersed multiphase systems.},

  abstract={Bettinger, J. S., K. J. Friston. Conceptual Foundations of Physiological Regulation incorporating the Free Energy Principle & Self-Organized Criticality. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 23(x) 144-XXX, 2022. Since the late nineteen-nineties, the concept of homeostasis has been contextualized within a broader class of "allostatic" dynamics characterized by a wider-berth of causal factors including social, psychological and environmental entailments; the fundamental nature of integrated brain-body dynamics; plus the role of anticipatory, top-down constraints supplied by intrinsic regulatory models. Many of these evidentiary factors are integral in original descriptions of homeostasis; subsequently integrated; and/or cite more-general operating principles of self-organization. As a result, the concept of allostasis may be generalized to a larger category of variational systems in biology, engineering and physics in terms of advances in complex systems, statistical mechanics and dynamics involving heterogenous (hierarchical/heterarchical, modular) systems like brain-networks and the internal milieu. This paper offers a three-part treatment. 1) interpret "allostasis" to emphasize a variational and relational foundation of physiological stability; 2) adapt the role of allostasis as "stability through change" to include a "return to stability" and 3) reframe the model of homeostasis with a conceptual model of criticality that licenses the upgrade to variational dynamics.},

  abstract={Homeostasis is maintained by neural reflex controls, which attempt to maintain the body's internal organs within a predetermined range. However, when deviations are significant, homeostasis may not be restored by these standard controls. Therefore, a function called allostasis is necessary to maximize the energy efficiency of bodily functions, anticipate changing needs (e.g., a future increase in body temperature or oxygen demand), and regulate the body's state before dyshomeostasis occurs. In terms of the free energy principle (FEP), the expectation to survive (i.e., to stay within established confines and to maintain homeostatic integrity over time) is realized by a hierarchical prediction mechanism. Allostasis requires the integration of exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive signals. In this paper, the neural mechanism of allostasis is discussed in terms of the FEP.},

  author={R Goekoop and R de Kleijn},
  year={2023},
  url={https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37741517},
  abstract={Living systems are hierarchical control systems that display a small world network structure. In such structures, many smaller clusters are nested within fewer larger ones, producing a fractal-like structure with a 'power-law' cluster size distribution (a mereology). Just like their structure, the dynamics of living systems shows fractal-like qualities: the timeseries of inner message passing and overt behavior contain high frequencies or 'states' (treble) that are nested within lower frequencies or 'traits' (bass), producing a power-law frequency spectrum that is known as a 'state-trait continuum' in the behavioral sciences. Here, we argue that the power-law dynamics of living systems results from their power-law network structure: organisms 'vertically encode' the deep spatiotemporal structure of their (anticipated) environments, to the effect that many small clusters near the base of the hierarchy produce high frequency signal changes and fewer larger clusters at its top produce ultra-low frequencies. Such ultra-low frequencies exert a tonic regulatory pressure that produces morphological as well as behavioral traits (i.e., body plans and personalities). Nested-modular structure causes higher frequencies to be embedded within lower frequencies, producing a power-law state-trait continuum. At the heart of such dynamics lies the need for efficient energy dissipation through networks of coupled oscillators, which also governs the dynamics of non-living systems (e.q., earthquakes, stock market fluctuations). Since hierarchical structure produces hierarchical dynamics, the development and collapse of hierarchical structure (e.g., during maturation and disease) should leave specific traces in system dynamics (shifts in lower frequencies, i.e. morphological and behavioral traits) that may serve as early warning signs to system failure. The applications of this idea range from (bio)physics and phylogenesis to ontogenesis and clinical medicine.},

The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics-of certain kinds of particles-as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency. In short-of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition-strange kinds may be apt for describing sentient behaviour.},

By making the robot curious, the robot would become interested in the unknown region and explore that region. In order to make the robot curious, we utilize the free energy principle, which has been attracting attention in the field of neuroscience and AI. We propose a curiosity algorithm that combines with Soft Actor-Critic and show that it is naturally derived from the free energy principle.

This paper reformulates this theory to design a brain-inspired state and input estimator for a linear time-invariant state space system with colored noise. This reformulation for linear systems bridges the gap between the neuroscientific theory and control theory, therefore opening up the possibility of evaluating it under the hood of standard control approaches. Through rigorous simulations under colored noises, the observer is shown to outperform Kalman Filter and Unknown Input Observer with minimal error in state and input estimation. It is tested against a wide range of scenarios and the proof of concept is demonstrated by applying it on a real system.},

By giving an example about the journey of a person, we believe to show some simple, obvious but mathematically encoded philosophical implications about how we could think, learn and memorize. In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.},

However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.},

  abstract={A statistical system is classically defined on a set of microstates $E$ by a global energy function $H : E \to \mathbb{R}$, yielding Gibbs probability measures (softmins) $ρ^β(H)$ for every inverse temperature $β= T^{-1}$. Gibbs states are simultaneously characterized by free energy principles and the max-entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse temperature $β$ and mean energy ${\cal U}(β) = \mathbb{E}_{ρ^β}[H]$ respectively. The Legendre transform relates these diverse variational principles which are unfortunately not tractable in high dimension.   The global energy is generally given as a sum $H(x) = \sum_{\rm a \subset Ω} h_{\rm a}(x_{|\rm a})$ of local short-range interactions $h_{\rm a} : E_{\rm a} \to \mathbb{R}$ indexed by bounded subregions ${\rm a} \subset Ω$, and this local structure can be used to design good approximation schemes on thermodynamic functionals. We show that the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm solves a collection of local variational principles, by converging to critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations of the free energy $F(β)$, the Shannon entropy $S(\cal U)$, and the variational free energy ${\cal F}(β) = {\cal U} - β^{-1} S(\cal U)$, extending an initial correspondence by Yedidia et al. This local form of Legendre duality yields a possible degenerate relationship between mean energy ${\cal U}$ and $β$.},

  abstract={Most theories of behavior posit that agents tend to maximize some form of reward or utility. However, animals very often move with curiosity and seem to be motivated in a reward-free manner. Here we abandon the idea of reward maximization, and propose that the goal of behavior is maximizing occupancy of future paths of actions and states. According to this maximum occupancy principle, rewards are the means to occupy path space, not the goal per se; goal-directedness simply emerges as rational ways of searching for resources so that movement, understood amply, never ends. We find that action-state path entropy is the only measure consistent with additivity and other intuitive properties of expected future action-state path occupancy. We provide analytical expressions that relate the optimal policy and state-value function, and prove convergence of our value iteration algorithm. Using discrete and continuous state tasks, including a high--dimensional controller, we show that complex behaviors such as `dancing', hide-and-seek and a basic form of altruistic behavior naturally result from the intrinsic motivation to occupy path space. All in all, we present a theory of behavior that generates both variability and goal-directedness in the absence of reward maximization.},

  abstract={This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.},

We argue that any dynamical system with constraints on its dynamics necessarily looks as though it is performing inference against these constraints, and that in a non-isolated system, such constraints imply external environmental variables embedding the system. Using aspects of classical dynamical systems theory in statistical mechanics, we show that this inference is equivalent to a gradient ascent on the Shannon entropy functional, recovering an approximate Bayesian inference under a locally ergodic probability measure on the state space. We also use some geometric notions from dynamical systems theory$\unicode{x2014}$namely, that the constraints constitute a gauge degree of freedom$\unicode{x2014}$to elaborate on how the desire to stay self-organised can be read as a gauge force acting on the system. In doing so, a number of results of independent interest are given.

  abstract={In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.},

  abstract={<p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a type of anxiety disorder which impacts every day functioning, particularly in terms of interpersonal relationships. The cognitive-behavioral model is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Though this model has long informed clinical practice, it has been criticized for its overreliance on cognitive processes and rational thinking, disregarding the role of emotions as well as other biological and social factors. This limitation is especially evident in the treatment of SAD, where cognitivebehavioral approaches often fail to produce long-term results. In this study, we will argue in favor of a new approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, emerging in the last decade from the field of computational psychiatry, focusing on the brain’s predictive mechanisms. We will show how SAD can arise from erroneous interoceptive inferences—incorrect predictions about internal bodily states— which lead to unreliable predictions about the social environment. These erroneous inferences reinforce the individual's perception that the social world is unpredictable and that their actions are insufficient to reduce this uncertainty, creating a state of learned uncertainty.</p>},

  abstract={The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neuro-computational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel “thoughtseed” framework, proposing that cognition arises from dynamic interactions of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called “thoughtseeds” within the Global Workspace of consciousness. By leveraging evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and the Free Energy Principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), thoughtseed networks, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent neural activity patterns that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experiences and guiding behavior. We present an illustrative mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. This biologically grounded model offers a novel approach to understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, with potential applications in consciousness, attention, and decision making.},

  abstract={<p>The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a normative computational framework for iterativereduction of prediction error and uncertainty through perceptioneintervention cycles thathas been presented as a potential unifying theory of all brain functions (Friston, 2006). Anytheory hoping to unify the brain sciences must be able to explain the mechanisms ofdecision-making, an important cognitive faculty, without the addition of independent,irreducible notions. This challenge has been accepted by several proponents of the FEP(Friston, 2010; Gershman, 2019). We evaluate attempts to reduce decision-making to theFEP, using Lucas' (2005) meta-theory of the brain's contextual constraints as a guidepost.We find reductive variants of the FEP for decision-making unable to explain behavior incertain types of diagnostic, predictive, and multi-armed bandit tasks. We trace the shortcomings to the core theory's lack of an adequate notion of subjective preference or “utility”, a concept central to decision-making and grounded in the brain's biological reality. We argue that any attempts to fully reduce utility to the FEP would require unrealistic assumptions, making the principle an unlikely candidate for unifying brain science. Wesuggest that researchers instead attempt to identify contexts in which either informationalor independent reward constraints predominate, delimiting the FEP's area of applicability.To encourage this type of research, we propose a two-factor formal framework that cansubsume any FEP model and allows experimenters to compare the contributions ofinformational versus reward constraints to behavior.</p>},

  abstract={Several authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems with Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of agency and sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of redefinition of variable and parameter sets and of the dynamical laws affecting a system, a situation that escapes the assumptions of FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development, and the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that this position is also in contradiction with the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is profoundly incompatible with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.},

  abstract={Human upright standing involves an integration of multiple sensory inputs such as vision, vestibular and somatosensory systems. It has been known that sensory deficits worsen the standing balance. However, how the modulation of sensory information contributes to postural stabilization still remains an open question for researchers. The purpose of this work was to formulate the human standing postural control system in the framework of the free-energy principle, and to investigate the efficacy of the skin stretch feedback in enhancing the human standing balance. Previously, we have shown that sensory augmentation by skin stretch feedback at the fingertip could modulate the standing balance of the people with simulated sensory deficits. In this study, subjects underwent ten 30-second trials of quiet standing balance with and without skin stretch feedback. Visual and vestibular sensory deficits were simulated by having each subject close their eyes and tilt their head back. We found that sensory augmentation by velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip reduced the entropy of the standing postural sway of the people with simulated sensory deficits. This result aligns with the framework of the free energy principle which states that a self-organizing biological system at its equilibrium state tries to minimize its free energy either by updating the internal state or by correcting body movement with appropriate actions. The velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip may increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory signals, which in turn enhances the accuracy of the internal states in the central nervous system. With more accurate internal states, the human postural control system can further adjust the standing posture to minimize the entropy, and thus the free energy.},

  abstract={We propose an embodied system based on the free energy principle (FEP) for sensorimotor visual perception. We evaluated it in a character-recognition task using the MNIST dataset. Although the FEP has successfully described a rule that living things obey mathematically and claims that a biological system continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the difference in predicting sensory input, it is not enough to model sensorimotor visual perception. An embodiment of the system is the key to achieving sensorimotor visual perception. The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified. By limiting body and memory abilities and operating according to the FEP, the embodied system repeatedly takes action to obtain the next sensory input based on various potentials of future sensory inputs. In the evaluation, the inference of the environment was represented as an approximate posterior distribution of characters (0 - 9). As the number of repetitions increased, the attention area moved continuously, gradually reducing the uncertainty of characters. Finally, the probability of the correct character became the highest among the characters. Changing the initial attention position provides a different final distribution, suggesting that the proposed system has a confirmation bias.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance - in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations - is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) in the neurosciences stipulates that all viable agents induce and minimize informational free energy in the brain to fit their environmental niche. In this study, we continue our effort to make the FEP a more physically principled formalism by implementing free energy minimization based on the principle of least action. We build a Bayesian mechanics (BM) by casting the formulation reported in the earlier publication (Kim 2018) to considering active inference beyond passive perception. The BM is a neural implementation of variational Bayes under the FEP in continuous time. The resulting BM is provided as an effective Hamilton's equation of motion and subject to the control signal arising from the brain's prediction errors at the proprioceptive level. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we adopt a simple agent-based model and present a concrete numerical illustration of the brain performing recognition dynamics by integrating BM in neural phase space. Furthermore, we recapitulate the major theoretical architectures in the FEP by comparing our approach with the common state-space formulations.},

  abstract={Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires a large amount of exploration especially in sparse-reward settings. Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.},

  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) is a mathematical framework that describes how biological systems self-organize and survive in their environment. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal. This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model, suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving agent interacts with an environment.},

  abstract={The quest for a brain-inspired learning algorithm for robots has culminated in the free energy principle from neuroscience that models the brain's perception and action as an optimization over its free energy objectives. Based on this idea, we propose an estimation algorithm for accurate output prediction of a quadrotor flying under unmodelled wind conditions. The key idea behind this work is the handling of unmodelled wind dynamics and the model's non-linearity errors as coloured noise in the system, and leveraging it for accurate output predictions. This paper provides the first experimental validation for the usefulness of generalized coordinates for robot perception using Dynamic Expectation Maximization (DEM). Through real flight experiments, we show that the estimator outperforms classical estimators with the least error in output predictions. Based on the experimental results, we extend the DEM algorithm for model order selection for complete black box identification. With this paper, we provide the first experimental validation of DEM applied to robot learning.},

  abstract={Active inference may be defined as Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. An agent will choose an action that leads to its prior preference for a future observation. In this paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and find a theoretical connection between them. We extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value function. Motivated by the concept of prior preference and a theoretical connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior preference from experts. This illustrates that the problem with inverse RL can be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with EFE-based rewards and its application to an inverse RL problem.},

  abstract={Active inference, a corollary of the free energy principle, is a formal way of describing the behavior of certain kinds of random dynamical systems that have the appearance of sentience. In this chapter, we describe how active inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design, i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e., expected utility maximization. Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility, expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.},

  abstract={The present paper argues that a systems theory epistemology (and particularly the notion of hierarchical recursive organization) provides the critical theoretical context within which the significance of Friston's (2010a) Free Energy Principle (FEP) for both evolution and psychoanalysis is best understood. Within this perspective, the FEP occupies a particular level of the hierarchical organization of the organism, which is the level of biological self-organization. This form of biological self-organization is in turn understood as foundational and pervasive to the higher levels of organization of the human organism that are of interest to both neuroscience as well as psychoanalysis. Consequently, central psychoanalytic claims should be restated, in order to be located in their proper place within a hierarchical recursive organization of the (situated) organism. In light of the FEP the realization of the psychoanalytic mind by the brain should be seen in terms of the evolution of different levels of systematic organization where the concepts of psychoanalysis describe a level of hierarchical recursive organization superordinate to that of biological self-organization and the FEP. The implication of this formulation is that while “psychoanalytic” mental processes are fundamentally subject to the FEP, they nonetheless also add their own principles of process over and above that of the FEP. A model found in Grobbelaar (1989) offers a recursive bottom-up description of the self-organization of the psychoanalytic ego as dependent on the organization of language (and affect), which is itself founded upon the tendency toward autopoiesis (self-making) within the organism, which is in turn described as formally similar to the FEP. Meaningful consilience between Grobbelaar's model and the hierarchical recursive description available in Friston's (2010a) theory is described. The paper concludes that the valuable contribution of the FEP to psychoanalysis underscores the necessity of reengagement with the core concepts of psychoanalytic theory, and the usefulness that a systems theory epistemology—particularly hierarchical recursive description—can have for this goal.},

  abstract={The Free-Energy-Principle (FEP) is an influential and controversial theory which postulates a deep connection between the stochastic thermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference. Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an information-theoretic functional – the variational free energy – and thus performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience, and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the construction of novel algorithms by which action, perception, and learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often made productive discussion challenging. Here, we aim to provide a mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and central claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions necessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP is a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and revision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing current perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability, and the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP. ar X iv :2 10 8. 13 34 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 1 O ct 2 02 1 A PREPRINT 5TH OCTOBER, 2021},

  abstract={Abstract We formulate the computational processes of perception in the framework of the principle of least action by postulating the theoretical action as a time integral of the variational free energy in the neurosciences. The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased, on autopoetic grounds, as follows: all viable organisms attempt to minimize their sensory uncertainty about an unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By taking the variation of informational action, we derive neural recognition dynamics (RD), which by construction reduces to the Bayesian filtering of external states from noisy sensory inputs. Consequently, we effectively cast the gradient-descent scheme of minimizing the free energy into Hamiltonian mechanics by addressing only the positions and momenta of the organisms' representations of the causal environment. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show how the RD may be implemented in a neuronally based biophysical model at a single-cell level and subsequently in a coarse-grained, hierarchical architecture of the brain. We also present numerical solutions to the RD for a model brain and analyze the perceptual trajectories around attractors in neural state space.},

We reveal that, in contrast to standard cost and constraint-based solutions, ActInf gives rise to a minimization problem that includes both an information-theoretic surprise term and a model-predictive control cost term.

For a case with linear Gaussian dynamics and a quadratic cost, we illustrate the performance of ActInf under varying system parameters and compare to classical solutions for estimation and control.},

Renormalization techniques permit us to construct good estimators for the posterior signal mean within information field theory (IFT), but the approximations and assumptions made are not very obvious. Here we introduce the simple concept of minimal Gibbs free energy to IFT, and show that previous renormalization results emerge naturally. They can be understood as being the Gaussian approximation to the full posterior probability, which has maximal cross information with it. We derive optimized estimators for three applications, to illustrate the usage of the framework: (i) reconstruction of a log-normal signal from Poissonian data with background counts and point spread function, as it is needed for gamma ray astronomy and for cosmography using photometric galaxy redshifts, (ii) inference of a Gaussian signal with unknown spectrum and (iii) inference of a Poissonian log-normal signal with unknown spectrum, the combination of (i) and (ii). Finally we explain how Gaussian knowledge states constructed by the minimal Gibbs free energy principle at different temperatures can be combined into a more accurate surrogate of the non-Gaussian posterior.},

  abstract={This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.},

  abstract={Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.},

  abstract={How do organisms recognize their environment by acquiring knowledge about the world, and what actions do they take based on this knowledge? This article examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of organisms to the environment.},

  abstract={This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational inference in deep generative models, and evolution strategies to introduce the "deep active inference" agent. This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how goal directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on the latent states in the agent's model. Furthermore, we show that the deep active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and its interaction therewith.},

  year={2012},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3997v1},
  abstract={The free energy functional has recently been proposed as a variational principle for bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a natural trade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can be axiomatically derived. Here we apply the free energy principle to general decision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. We derive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalized optimality equations that account for both adversarial and stochastic environments.},

  abstract={We propose a formal foundation for cognition rooted in algebraic topology, built on a Homological Parity Principle. This posits that even-dimensional homology represents stable Structure/Context (e.g., generative models), while odd-dimensional homology represents dynamic Flow/Content (e.g., sensory/memory data). Cognition is governed by the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a dynamical cycle aligning these parities. This framework distinguishes two modes: Inference (waking), where the scaffold predicts the flow (a Context-before-Content process); and Learning (sleep), an inverted Structure-before-Specificity process where memory traces sculpt the scaffold. This parity interpretation unifies cognitive functions like semantic and episodic memory and provides a structural generalization of existing theories, recasting Friston's Free Energy Principle and Tonini's Integrated Information in topological terms.},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0745v1},
  abstract={The Darwinian nature of Wojciech Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism is evaluated against the criteria of a Darwinian process as understood within Universal Darwinism. The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics, atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.},

  year={2011},

  abstract={Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented.   Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior.},

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that both features can be explained by the fact that each entity of such a system is limited in a certain way. We propose an information-theoretic approach based on a Free Energy principle, in order to computationally analyze systems of bounded rational agents that deal with such limitations optimally. We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units. Our results suggest that hierarchical architectures of specialized units at lower levels that are coordinated by units at higher levels are optimal, given that each unit's information-processing capability is limited and conforms to constraints on complexity costs.},

  abstract={Information-theoretic principles for learning and acting have been proposed to solve particular classes of Markov Decision Problems. Mathematically, such approaches are governed by a variational free energy principle and allow solving MDP planning problems with information-processing constraints expressed in terms of a Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a reference distribution. Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model, Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a grid world simulation.},

@article{boonstranodateinternal,
  title={Internal outset},
  author={Evert A. Boonstra},
  url={https://doi.org/10.5463/thesis.64},
  abstract={The present dissertation took the free-energy principle (FEP) as its starting point, from which we tried to draw both philosophical and empirical consequences. 

Both chapter 2 and 3 departed from the idea that conscious perception depends on global amplification of sensory input, and that the basal ganglia (BG) and its irrigation by dopamine play a crucial role in gating information, conscious access, and the selection of a relevant internal model given available sensory data. The BG are thought to play this role due to their modulatory influence on thalamocortical connectivity. Because much of the evidence implicating the BG in these processes in humans is correlational, we explored two ways of manipulating BG activity experimentally.

Chapter 4 investigates the philosophical heritage implicitly touched on by the FEP, which provides an alternative philosophical and historical background for present-day research in cognitive neuroscience. Friston’s FEP has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this paper, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aimed to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of the FEP from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. From a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intended to show how this contradiction – tension internalized – is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.

Chapter 5 is the report of a study attempting to contrast the FEP’s perspective with that of traditional cognitive neuroscience. While the FEP casts the brain as an organism’s predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future in which action is afforded a central place, research on the brain’s predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement (as we also did in Chapters 2 and 3). The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions (externally/cue-induced, internally/action-induced) on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants’ increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power.},

  author={Eray Özkural},
  url={https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints201908.0318.v1},
  abstract={The free energy principle states that self-organization occurs through minimization of free energy, which is a measure of potential thermodynamic work. By minimizing free energy, the organism happens to also minimize surprise over its boundary, promoting chances of survival. We discuss the ethical implications of the cognitive goal in detail from an empirical point of view, highlighting the principle of least action as a physical basis of Occam's razor, the universality of the free energy principle, and its explanation of natural selection. We explain that the free energy principle extends to groups of organisms and helps us understand group-scale adaptations and selection in biology. The free energy principle applies to all scales of organization in the organism from single cells to the entire nervous system. When this principle is taken to its logical extremes of modeling groups, populations and ecosystems, we uncover a new, evolutionarily sensible path at explaining puzzling aspects of human motivation and judgement, including ethical decisions. To minimize free energy, populations have to act to maximize gathering of information, while building effective models at mitigating changes to its dynamic structure. The free energy principle thus provides a naturalistic explanation of some of our deepest ethical intuitions, and valuable principles of social behavior. We interpret the cognitive goal that corresponds to the principle as seeking a dynamic, fruitful, yet peaceful activity that sustains the organism. This state of mind is interestingly similar to the Buddhist intuition of mental equanimity; the organism's final goal is to be at peace and harmony with the environment. Another immediately relevant aspect is that assemblies must form to promote symbiotic, synergistic, positive feedback loops, which coincides with the findings of ecologists. Therefore, ethics naturally emerges in self-organizing systems. Assemblies of organisms must ultimately unite in macro-minds to achieve the greatest reduction in free energy, as well as building technological extensions of themselves to improve their capacity to do such, therefore the principle also predicts a post-singularity world-mind composed mostly of artificial intelligence.},

It is only by rejecting the presumption of a machine-style separation between structure and processes that we can capture this uniquely precarious status of living systems, in virtue of which they may be described as autonomous agents, acting towards the goal of their own continued survival.},

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems. In this article, we give an overview of the emerging literature on how respiration modulates neural, cognitive and emotional processes. Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions. Accordingly, controlled breathing emerges as an easily accessible tool for emotional, cognitive, and physiological regulation.},

  abstract={This paper applies the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to propose that the lack of action in response to climate change should be considered a maladaptive symptom of human activity that we refer to as biophilia deficiency syndrome. The paper is organised into four parts: the characterisation of the natural world under the Gaia Hypothesis, the employment of the FEP as a description of the behaviour of self-organising systems, the application of the FEP to Gaia to understand coupling dynamics between living systems and purportedly non-living planetary processes, and the offering of positive interventions for addressing the current state of ecological crisis under this framework. For the latter, we emphasise the importance of perturbing stuck states for healthy development, and the necessary appreciation of life existing as nested systems at multiple levels in a hierarchy. We propose the development of human biophilia virtue in accordance with the FEP as a practical intervention for treating biophilia deficiency syndrome and helping to safeguard the balance of planetary processes and the integrity of living systems that depend on them, offering some examples of what this might look like in practice. Overall, this paper provides novel insights into how to catalyse meaningful ecological change, proposing a deliberate and disruptive approach to addressing the dysfunctional relationship between humans and the rest of the natural world.},

  author={Adam Safron},

  abstract={Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.},

  abstract={Jungian archetypes have been of interest to psychoanalysts and have been a cornerstone of Jungian psychology through much of the 20th century. Whilst the notion of archetypes has been debated amongst psychoanalytic traditions as well as in contemporary mythology/anthropology, little work has been done on their utility in the cognitive and neurosciences. We propose a novel neural mechanism of archetypes, grounded in cross-cultural psychology, comparative mythology, as well as developmental psychology. The pragmatic function of archetypes may serve as a collective effort of free energy minimization under the free energy principle, emergent due to the sets of affordances offered by culture and ecology. In line with Carl Jung’s definitional scope, we argue that archetypes are rooted in deep ecological and social forces, generationally ingrained for the purpose of optimizing the accurate conceptual representation of agents’ ecological and social environments. We then speculate on theoretical mechanisms by which archetypes are transmitted across time. Finally, we discuss implications for the utility of Jungian archetypes and outline future research directions to expand this concept in the cognitive neurosciences.},

  abstract={The argument is developed that autism spectrum disorder can be interpreted economically in terms of a deficit in polymodal integration which limits awareness by babies and infants of the time-contingency for generating their motor responses to information gleaned from seeing the actions of care-givers or hearing them. This gives rise to difficulties with imitation and mental attribution. In order to grasp the root of the problem we consider “primary intersubjectivity” from the standpoint of the Free Energy Principle as developed by Karl Friston. In terms of this principle and    concomitant considerations of variational free energy it can be argued that reduction of predictive errors by both early infants and their care-givers is achievable normally by their reciprocal behavioural exchanges. It is impeded when a deficit in a baby’s polymodal integration leads to a delayed time-contingent response. This protracted sensory integration theory of autism can be subsumed under the acronym PSITA.},

  author={Mathias Houe Andersen and Silja Katharina Arenfeldt},
  url={https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hyp87},
  abstract={This study concerns an interdisciplinary theoretical analysis of the underlying ways the depressed individual is related to the world. Specific aspects of this relation, namely time, mood and perception of affordances will be characterized. By understanding these relations from both an existential phenomenological Heideggerian approach and through the modern neuroscientific paradigm of the Free Energy Principle, we formulate a complementary conceptualization of the depressed person’s relation to the world. Furthermore, we argue that this interdisciplinary approach bears a synergic coupling, despite obvious epistemic and disciplinary differences. In essence The Free Energy Principle conceptualizes any human world relation as a dynamic process in a self-organizing system that attempts to minimize entropy from the surroundings by predicting the states of the world. To Heidegger, the human world relation constitutes Dasein as a being-in-the-world, where the world gets its meaning from Dasein's care. Dasein does this by projecting possibilities of the future based on its facticity. We argue that this interdisciplinary compatible conceptualization constitutes an epistemically useful alternative based on dynamic assumptions, unlike the conceptualization offered by DSM-5, We argue that these underlying assumptions are important to challenge, as recent research in psychedelic treatment of “treatment resistant” depressed patients provides interesting findings challenging our current view of depression. Because experiences of connectedness are the strongest predictor for positive clinical outcomes in these trials, we argue that a dynamic characterization of depression is beneficial. We argue that this dynamic characterization is beneficial to pursue, as it offers an interdisciplinary approach to understand how the depressed individual fundamentally is connected to the world.},

  abstract={AbstractEmpirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.},

Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remains elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and allatom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have predicted the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and suggested the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.},
