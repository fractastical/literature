  abstract={This paper provides a concise description of the free energy principle, starting from a formulation of random dynamical systems in terms of a Langevin equation and ending with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentience. It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

  title={The Free Energy Principle drives neuromorphic development},
  author={Chris Fields and Karl Friston and James F. Glazebrook and Michael Levin and Antonino Marcianò},
  year={2022},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09734v1},
  abstract={We show how any system with morphological degrees of freedom and locally limited free energy will, under the constraints of the free energy principle, evolve toward a neuromorphic morphology that supports hierarchical computations in which each level of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs. Such hierarchies occur throughout biology, from the architectures of intracellular signal transduction pathways to the large-scale organization of perception and action cycles in the mammalian brain. Formally, the close formal connections between cone-cocone diagrams (CCCD) as models of quantum reference frames on the one hand, and between CCCDs and topological quantum field theories on the other, allow the representation of such computations in the fully-general quantum-computational framework of topological quantum neural networks.},

  title={The Free Energy Principle for Perception and Action: A Deep Learning Perspective},
  author={Pietro Mazzaglia and Tim Verbelen and Ozan Çatal and Bart Dhoedt},
  year={2022},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06415v1},
  abstract={The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.},

  author={Olivier Peltre},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02946v1},
  abstract={A comprehensive picture of three Bethe-Kikuchi variational principles including their relationship to belief propagation (BP) algorithms on hypergraphs is given. The structure of BP equations is generalized to define continuous-time diffusions, solving localized versions of the max-entropy principle (A), the variational free energy principle (B), and a less usual equilibrium free energy principle (C), Legendre dual to A. Both critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi functionals and stationary beliefs are shown to lie at the non-linear intersection of two constraint surfaces, enforcing energy conservation and marginal consistency respectively. The hypersurface of singular beliefs, accross which equilibria become unstable as the constraint surfaces meet tangentially, is described by polynomial equations in the convex polytope of consistent beliefs. This polynomial is expressed by a loop series expansion for graphs of binary variables.},

  title={Knowledge as Fruits of Ignorance: A global Free Energy Principle of our way of thinking},
  author={Cailleteau Thomas},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05684v1},
  abstract={In this second article, we show a simple use of the Ignorance as defined in "Jaynes & Shannon's Constrained Ignorance and Surprise". By giving an example about the journey of a person, we believe to show some simple, obvious but mathematically encoded philosophical implications about how we could think, learn and memorize. In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.},

  author={Ajith Anil Meera and Martijn Wisse},

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01796v1},
  abstract={The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.},

  title={Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience},
  author={Beren Millidge},
  year={2021},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00140v1},
  abstract={In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.},

  author={Martin Biehl and Felix A. Pollock and Ryota Kanai},
  year={2020},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408v3},
  abstract={We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle, and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the "Markov blanket" proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.},
