Abstract 
A significant number of persons engage in paradoxical behaviors, such as extreme food restriction (up to starvation) and non-suicidal 
self-injuries, especially during periods of rapid changes, such as adolescence. Here, we contextualize these and related paradoxical 
behavior within an active inference view of brain functions, which assumes that the brain forms predictive models of bodily variables, 
emotional experiences, and the embodied self and continuously strives to reduce the uncertainty of such models. We propose that not 
only in conditions of excessive or prolonged uncertainty, such as in clinical conditions, but also during pivotal periods of developmental 
transition, paradoxical behaviors might emerge as maladaptive strategies to reduce uncertainty—by “acting on the body”— soliciting 
salient perceptual and interoceptive sensations, such as pain or excessive levels of hunger. Although such strategies are maladaptive 
and run against our basic homeostatic imperatives, they might be functional not only to provide some short-term reward (e.g. relief 
from emotional distress)—as previously proposed—but also to reduce uncertainty and possibly to restore a coherent model of one’s 
bodily experience and the self, affording greater confidence in who we are and what course of actions we should pursue.

Introduction
Why do some persons engage in paradoxical behaviors, such 
as extreme food restriction (up to starvation) and non-suicidal 
self-injuries (NSSIs)? These and other pathological behaviors 
are transversal to various psychopathological conditions. Self-
destructive actions including self-harm have been associated 
with post-traumatic stress disorder (Moeller et al. 2001, Yehuda 
2002, Weiss et  al. 2015 , Zelkowitz et  al. 2023 ), eating disor-
ders (Sagiv and Gvion 2020 ), and borderline personality disorder 
(
Reichl and Kaesset, 2021). Whether paradoxical behaviors as NSSI 
have a common origin across such and other conditions remains 
to be systematically tested, which is particularly challenging 
as—in most cases—they can only be assessed using retrospec-
tive measures, rather than measured during their occurrence or 
induced experimentally. Although they are typically associated 
with some form of psychopathology, they are not exclusive to
clinical conditions but might also be transiently acted by non-
clinical individuals. For example, self-injury behaviors are not 
uncommon during adolescence and progressively decrease in 
adulthood (
Laugesen et al. 2003, Nock et al. 2009, Thielsch et al. 
2015, Osmanagaoglu et al. 2018).
Scholars from a variety of disciplines have questioned why peo-
ple intentionally harm themselves (either by starving or cutting), 
proposing various theoretical models empirically tested over time 
(Chapman et al. 2006, Nock and Mendes 2008a, Nock et
 al. 2009, 
Wolff et al. 2019), but we still lack a mechanistic understanding 
of such behaviors. Here, we propose that despite starvation and 
NSSI being undoubtedly distinct behaviors with different affective, 
cognitive, and neurobiological underpinnings, they could share a 
common “rationale.” Namely, they could be attempts to modify 
one’s state—in a broad sense, which includes not just the bodily 
state but also affective, cognitive, and social experiences—by “act-
ing on the body.” In other words, these behaviors can be considered

Highlights
• Predictive processing theories assume that the brain 
forms internal body and self-models at multiple levels 
of detail and strives to reduce their uncertainty.
• High levels of uncertainty in internal models of the body 
and the self are common across several clinical condi-
tions.
• Excessive levels of uncertainty might also be experienced 
in the typical population during development transitions.
• This excessive uncertainty might hinder the mainte-
nance of a coherent model of the   embodied self and 
confidently engage in adaptive courses of actions.
• Maladaptive behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury, 
might emerge as paradoxical but effective strategies to 
“act on the body” to reduce uncertainty
similar because they explicitly target the body, with self-induced 
hunger or painful sensations, to modify bodily and interocep-
tive experiences. This perspective helps contextualize harmful 
behaviors within an “interoceptive inference” framework, which 
assumes that (interoceptive) bodily sensations and their regula-
tion are key for affectivity, mental health, conscious processes, 
and the self (Craig 2002, Seth et al. 2012 , Barrett and Simmons 
2015, P
ezzulo et al. 2015, Paulus et al. 2019, Quigley et al. 2021), 
which could provide novel insights on why people do things to 
harm themselves intentionally.
A central theme of inferential models of cognition, like active 
inference, is that actions are motivated by both “utilitarian” imper-
atives, such as reward achievement, and the “epistemic” impera-
tive to reduce uncertainty about one’s state (intended in a broad 
sense, from bodily state to one’s identity and self-models). Var-
ious researchers proposed that paradoxical behaviors could be 
motivated by reward achievement since they have (paradoxically) 
positive effects, such as relief from emotional distress and nega-
tive affect (Nock and Prinstein 2004 , Chapman et al. 2006, Bresin 
and Gordon 2013 , Selby et al. 2019). Here, we advance a com-
plementary perspective by suggesting that these behaviors might 
appear less paradoxical when considering that they could serve 
uncertainty minimization imperatives. For example, we recently 
suggested that the starvation observed in restrictive anorexia 
nervosa could serve the imperative of minimizing “interoceptive 
uncertainty” or the uncertainty about one’s interoceptive state—
stretched up to the uncertainty of the self—which might be partic-
ularly severe when people receive ambiguous interoceptive signals 
from the body, when they have poor models of their bodily or emo-
tional state, or when they are particularly intolerant to high levels 
of uncertainty (Barca and Pezzulo 2020).
What are the possible causes of interoceptive uncertainty? 
Consider, e.g. a person with physiological deficits in interocep-
tive pathways that do not allow her to clearly sense interoceptive 
streams and identify her emotional states and embodied self. 
These deficits might prevent the person from developing an appro-
priate model of her emotions (e.g. a model that clearly specifies 
what emotion she feels and in which conditions) and a good 
understanding of the emotions and the affective states of others 
and hence be constantly uncertain about them (see also Smith 
and Lane 2015, Smith et al. 2018, 2019). Such detachment from 
one’
s body and bodily information might result from adverse 
experiences during infancy and childhood, such as emotional 
and physical neglect (Schmitz et al. 2023 ), or—in less dramatic 
situations—from reduced affective reciprocity during parental 
interactions (Conradt and Ablow 2010 ). Development theories 
underscore the role of parental care in shaping the experience of 
self and others and integrative processes of consciousness (Bowlby 
1997, Liotti 2004
 , 2006, F onagy et al. 2023).
During infancy, a child starts making sense of her internal 
experiences through the information she gets from the external 
world, most notably from caregivers whose behavior has a fun-
damental regulatory function shaping emotional development, 
stress physiology, and refinement of limbic circuitry (Gee 2016). 
In addition to the quality of caregivers’ response to the infant’s 
need for proximity, its “predictability” supports the development 
of emotions’ regulatory capacity (Gee and Cohodes 2021; Wu and 
Feng 2020) and a cohesive sense of self (Arciero and Bondolfi 
2009), increases prosociality (Deneault 
 et al. 2023), and influ-
ences the development of social brain structure (see Ilyka et al. 
2021 for a review). Self-report assessment of exposure to unpre-
dictability 
during early life appears to predict symptoms of anx-
iety, depression, and anhedonia in adulthood (Glynn et al. 2019). 
Evidence from cross-species studies indicates that the predictabil-
ity of caregivers’ behavior in rodents may specifically influence 
the offspring’s development of corticolimbic circuitry involved in 
emotion-related functioning (Glynn and Baram 2019). Rodents 
exposed to unpredictable maternal care exhibit atypical amygdala 
functioning (Malter Cohen et  al. 2013) and weaker connectivity 
with the medial prefrontal cortex (Guadagno et al. 2018).
Abraham et al. (2019) evaluated a number of features of the 
neurobiological interoceptive circuit (e.g. the functionality of the 
amygdala, insula, and oxytocinergic system) in parents and chil-
dren over the first 6 years of parenthood. Results revealed a critical 
association between parental interoceptive sensitivity—indexed, 
e.g. by increased bilateral activation of the anterior insula in 
response to a video of his/her interacting with his/her infant—
the consolidation of the child’s interoceptive circuit and mental 
health. Taken together, thus, consistent evidence indicates that 
parental ability to respond appropriately to the children’s needs 
and bodily signals supports the child’s ability to adequately repre-
sent his/her internal bodily states, concurring in the development 
of self-processes ( Fotopoulou and Tsakiris 2017 , Ciaunica et al. 
2021a, 2021b). The degree of predictability of caregivers’ response 
appears to be critical for the development of affect regulation 
and a cohesive sense of the self (Ilyka et  al. 2021). When care-
givers’ behavior is less reliable, children have more difficulties in 
distinguishing their own internal states, making self-other dis-
tinctions (Ogawa et al. 1997, Dutra et al. 2009), and—in the most 
severe cases—developing an integrated sense of the self (Liotti 
2004, 2006).
As 
a consequence of these or other deficits in developing 
appropriate models of emotional and self-models, a person might 
experience significant interoceptive uncertainty and perceive her 
own internal states in confused and uncomfortable ways later 
in life. Suppose that the interoceptive channels are unreliable 
and the internal models rooted in bodily experiences are poor. 
In that case, a person might construe a sense of personal stabil-
ity through external, non-interoceptive signals, such as feedback 
from others and from the world, rather than via interoceptive 
signals. Engaging in social interactions, in which we experience 
affective states relevant to our self-confirmation (e.g. a sense 
of acceptance and kindness), might be particularly challenging 
for this person ( Guidano 1987, Arciero and Bondolfi 2009 ). While 
interacting with others, she might experience ambiguous bodily 
and emotional states. She might be unable to reduce this uncer-
tainty using the other as an external point of reference since 
Modeling and controlling the body in maladaptive ways  3
the affectivity attributed to the others might also be perceived 
as vague and misinterpreted (e.g. “Is he/she interested in me or 
not?” “Am I a person worthy of attention and love from oth-
ers?”). Bodily illusions, such as the “rubber hand illusion” (Suzuki 
et al. 2013, Crucianelli et al. 2018) and the “enfacement illu-
sion” (Sforza et al. 2010, Tajadura-Jiménez et al. 2012), provide 
compelling evidence for the malleability of self-other bound-
aries as a function of bodily information and of interoceptive
sensibility.
Dealing with these ambiguous situations could be particu-
larly challenging and distressing for a person with no adaptive 
strategies to reduce uncertainty. Therefore, in these (admittedly 
extreme) conditions, even maladaptive strategies such as star-
vation that reduce uncertainty and render bodily and interocep-
tive stimuli more salient might become more appealing (see also
Linson et al. 2020). In other words, while starvation would still be 
considered paradoxical—in the sense that it runs against the “util-
itarian” imperative of ensuring well-being and survival—it might 
play a functional role for an organism that simultaneously tries 
to “maximize utility and minimize uncertainty,” as assumed by 
active inference.
In this article, we propose that NSSI and other kinds of paradox-
ical behaviors might also be conceptualized in similar ways, i.e. as 
other cases in which a person intentionally changes her bodily 
and interoceptive sensations, in order to reduce excessive bodily 
and interoceptive uncertainty (but also more broadly to modulate 
affective and physiological states that are otherwise dysregulated, 
e.g. to decrease the excessive intensity of bodily sensations in 
hyperarousal).
In the next sections, we first discuss NSSI behaviors by focusing 
on the fact that they might occur in non-clinical individuals. We 
will highlight that this could be not only especially the case dur-
ing adolescence—a period of life during which people experience 
various kinds of uncertainties (e.g. their bodies, the self, their 
social status, and interpersonal relationships), but also more spec-
ulatively during other periods of life associated with substantial 
changes and uncertainty, such as the perimenopause–menopause 
transition period in women. Then, in the subsequent section, 
we introduce the main tenets of active inference by focusing on 
its proposed mechanisms for interoceptive processing and uncer-
tainty reduction. Finally, we discuss how the active inference 
framework might help conceptualize NSSI as a possible strategy 
to reduce uncertainty; for example, the uncertainty that some 
(non-clinical populations of) adolescents might strive to cope with 
during their transition to adulthood.
Paradoxical behaviors: the case of NSSI
“Self-injury behaviors” is an umbrella term that includes a wide 
range of behaviors (and intentions), including suicide attempts, 
superficial cuts, and medication withdrawals (Skegg 2005 , Nock 
2010). We focus on NSSI behaviors as the direct, deliberate 
destruction 
of body tissue without lethal intent (e.g. cutting one-
self). A distinction is also made between NSSI performed stereo-
typically in the context of developmental disabilities (e.g. head 
banging) and major injuries often observed in psychotic disorders. 
The most frequent examples of NSSI include cutting the skin with 
a sharp object (e.g. a knife, razor blade, or needle) and skin burn, 
usually with a cigarette ( Khanipour et  al. 2016). Patients often 
injure themselves, in a single act, by inflicting multiple injuries 
at the same body site, usually in areas that are easily hidden 
but accessible (e.g. forearms and anterior thighs). The behavior 
is often repeated, resulting in extensive scarring patterns. The age 
of onset of NSSI tends to be early adolescence, between 12 and 
14 years of age, and the behavior appears to decline after young 
adulthood (Nock et al. 2009).
The phenomenology of NSSI is still elusive. It has been hypoth-
esized that self-injury behaviors might be engaged to regulate 
emotions by avoiding or distracting from unwanted emotional 
experiences (e.g. shame) or negative beliefs about the self (Chap-
man et  al. 2006). This “affect regulation hypothesis” is sup-
ported by the findings that emotional dysregulation—such as 
reduced emotional clarity, problems in goal-directed behaviors, 
and impulse control—is common in non-clinical samples of ado-
lescents who engage in NSSI. The probability of engaging in 
self-injuries appears to be positively associated with emotional 
dysregulation, particularly when individuals lack more adaptive 
strategies (e.g. reappraisal) to cope with their affectivity (Wolff 
et al. 2019). Likewise, self-injurers typically describe their behav-
iors as attempts to avoid negative cognitive (i.e. bad thoughts or 
memories) and affective (i.e. anxiety, sadness, and anger) states, 
whose elevated arousal is suggested to increase the likelihood 
of engaging in self-injuries (Nock and Mendes 2008b, Nock et al. 
2009). The interplay between physiological hyperarousal, poor dis-
tr
ess tolerance, and reduced problem-solving skills is thought to 
concur in self-injury behaviors (Nock and Prinstein 2004 , Nock 
et al. 2006), with adolescents with a history of NSSI displaying 
greater changes in skin conductance and reduced tolerance to 
increasingly stressing conditions (Nock and Mendes 2008b).
A factor that might contribute to the genesis of maladaptive 
behaviors—including NSSI—is the extent to which one is able to 
sustain the rise in the levels of uncertainty, which, broadly speak-
ing, might occur in different domains of subjective experience 
(from bodily states to the possible outcomes of social interac-
tions, to the self, and to one’s personal identity). Every day, we 
face some kind of uncertainty, but the degree to which it might be 
distressing largely varies across individuals. High levels of intoler-
ance of uncertainty, or the attitude to react negatively to uncertain 
situations and events (Ladouceur et  al. 2000), are considered a 
transdiagnostic vulnerability factor across several clinical condi-
tions such as anxiety, depression ( McEvoy and Mahoney 2012 ), 
and eating disorders (Kesby et al. 2017). Recently, such “fear for 
uncertainty” has also been reported in neurotypical young adults 
and adolescents in relation to excessive worry (Laugesen et al. 
2003, T
hielsch et al. 2015) and anxiety (Osmana ̆gao ̆glu et al. 2018). 
There is also evidence of a positive reciprocal association between 
intolerance of uncertainty and difficulties in emotion processing 
in adolescents and that both tend to decrease with the transition 
to adulthood (Lauriola et  al. 2023). Crucially, NSSI is particularly 
prominent in adolescence; its rate in non-clinical samples of ado-
lescence has increased alarmingly in this century, representing a 
serious ongoing societal health concern (Xiao et al. 2022).
NSSI in adolescence
Adolescence is the period of developmental transition from child-
hood to adulthood, which might be stretched up to the early 
20s due to current sociocultural changes (e.g. delays in complet-
ing education, occupational attainment, and parenthood) (Patton 
et al. 2018). Among the challenges that adolescents have to face 
are the structuring of a “narrative identity” or self-story, featuring 
the development of a sense of personal identity that integrates 
past experiences with current, and future goals and meanings in 
a coherent whole over time (McAdams and McLean 2013, McLean 
and Lilgendahl 2019). The definition of the new boundaries of 
adolescents’ personal identity involves significant changes in the 
4 Barca et al.
reciprocity with caregivers and peers. Thus, in parallel to the 
negotiation of identity with caregivers (through a relative detach-
ment from them, a renegotiation of intimacy, and the questioning 
of their confirmatory authority), the modifications of friendship 
structures—from childhood to adolescence—lay the ground for 
the progressive recognition of social contexts and peer relation-
ships as the elite territories for the modulation and exploration 
of personal identity. The redefinition that the adolescent has to 
face in these territories of exploration (of the self as an individ-
ual separated from the other and of the self with the other) might 
pass through a phase of reduced coherence in the narration of 
the self and hence an increased level of uncertainty. Coherence 
in the self’s narrative is considered a measure of well-being and 
has been associated with psychopathology in adulthood (Klim-
stra and Denissen 2017) and adolescence (Lind et al. 2020, Shiner 
et al. 2021). For example, narrative incoherence has been found 
to be associated with personality disorders in adolescents (Lind 
et al. 2019), where “identity diffusion” (e.g. feelings of emptiness 
and being fragmented and lack of a sense of continuity over time) 
might be considered an expression of high levels of uncertainty of 
the self.
Emotion-wise, a developmental trend toward an increased
specificity of emotion-related maps of bodily sensations (Barca 
et al. 2023)—a proxy of interoceptive representations of
emotions—has been reported from children aged 6 years to adult-
hood (Hietanen et al. 2016). Pubertal changes encompass dramatic 
bodily and neuroendocrine system changes, comprising—but not 
reduced to—changes in the reproductive, adrenal, and growth 
axes (Cameron 2004). Thus, adolescents might face at least four 
sources of uncertainty: (i) the uncertainty due to physiological 
alterations related to bodily changes and to modification in hor-
monal levels leading to sexual maturity; (ii) the uncertainty in self-
identity (i.e. the structure of self-awareness) and personal identity 
(i.e, the narrative diachronic self) (Drummond 2021), which might 
be coupled with changes in body image and the development of 
gender identity; (iii) the uncertainty in affect regulation, with the 
emergence of new forms of affectivity as feelings of love and sex-
ual attraction toward a partner; and (iv) uncertainty in the social 
context, with respect to their social status and role expectations 
in the adult society. Such high levels of uncertainty might lead 
to a poorly defined sense of self, with unclear boundaries and a 
sense of emptiness. In this context, pain becomes a possible way 
to recover a bodily sense of self, and self-injurious behavior might 
be instantiated as an attempt to reduce the rise in the levels of 
uncertainty in these (and potentially other) domains, toward the 
transition to adulthood (see Miller et al. 2020 for a closely related 
approach on addiction).
Active inference, interoceptive processing, 
and uncertainty reduction
Active inference is based on the idea that in order to engage in 
adaptive allostatic regulation and goal-directed behavior, living 
organisms continuously strive to minimize the surprise of their 
sensations or, more formally, an upper bound to surprise: varia-
tional free energy (Parr et  al. 2022). Notably, the (expected) free 
energy minimization processes that drive active inference jointly 
consider two complementary objectives. The former (utilitarian) 
objective is to realize one’s preferences, such as being satiated 
or safe, by minimizing the discrepancy between preferred sensa-
tions (encoded as “priors over observations” in active inference) 
and current sensations in different modalities (e.g. interoceptive 
or exteroceptive). The latter (epistemic) objective is to reduce 
uncertainty about one’s estimated state. This means that active 
inference agents tend to avoid ambiguous states, encompass-
ing the avoidance of ambiguous places where self-localization is 
challenging, ambiguous social situations where safety is uncer-
tain, and ambiguous bodily states, such as unsure feelings of 
fatigue. However, one apparent exception to this aversion to ambi-
guity arises when exploring novel states implies the opportunity 
to learn new things and enhance one’s model; see Friston et al. 
(2017) for a discussion. Furthermore, and importantly, active infer-
ence agents will actively operate in the environment to reduce 
their ambiguity; for example, by actively seeking informative sen-
sations that disambiguate in which location they are (e.g. by 
looking for traffic signs), whether their social context is safe 
or unsafe (e.g. by trying to understand other’s intentions from 
their facial expressions and actions), or whether they are cur-
rently fatigued (e.g. by putting attention to one’s heart), happy,
or sad.
The last examples—disambiguating one’s fatigue and emo-
tional states—may seem strange if one assumes that we do have 
direct access to the body- and allostasis-related states (e.g. states 
of satiation, thirst, and fatigue) and to our emotions (e.g. we 
automatically know whether we are happy or sad). However, one 
assumption of active inference is that one’s bodily and emotional 
states are not necessarily observable but, instead, “hidden states” 
that need to be inferred on the basis of sensations (especially, 
but not exclusively, of interoceptive sensations from the inside 
of the body) and of an implicit, unconscious model of how the 
body functions (Barrett and Simmons 2015, Pezzulo et al. 2015, 
Seth and Friston 2016). In other words, the same inferential pro-
cess that allows active inference agents to estimate the hidden 
state of the external environment (e.g. the presence or absence of 
an object in the environment) is also used to estimate other hid-
den states, such as fatigue, happiness, or sadness. This implies 
that one can also be wrong, or be fooled, about these states; for 
example, we could experience the “interoceptive illusion” of feel-
ing more fatigued than our physiological parameters would afford 
(Iodice et al. 2019).
Extending this idea even further, one can assume that cer-
tain emotional states, as well as self-awareness and the (embod-
ied) sense of self—and the feeling of continually being the same 
person—could be constructed similarly: it would be the result of 
an inferential process that integrates bodily sensations and other 
experiences over time (Gu et al. 2013, Seth 2013, Stephan et al. 
2016, Barr
ett 2017). Figure 1 illustrates graphically this perspective 
by showing a (schematic) hierarchical generative model that links 
(exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive) sensations at 
lower levels with multimodal models of hidden bodily states, such 
as fatigue and hunger at intermediate layers, and, finally, with 
temporally extended, integrative models of the emotional and 
embodied self at the higher hierarchical level. The hierarchical 
generative model recapitulates a simple predictive coding archi-
tecture, which includes various putative brain areas or networks 
(gray ovals) arranged hierarchically. In the schematic, networks for 
unimodal (exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive) pro-
cessing are situated at the lowest hierarchical level, multimodal 
networks are at an intermediate level, and networks for process-
ing a persistent model of the self are at the highest level. Note 
that this simple schematic is not supposed to recapitulate brain 
anatomy but to illustrate the basic principles of hierarchical gen-
erative models and predictive coding; (for a discussion of the 
mapping between predictive coding networks and brain anatomy, 
see Parr et al. 2022). Each network includes cells encoding predic-
tions (black nodes) and prediction errors (red nodes). These units

Figure 1. A schematic illustration of a hierarchical active inference model. This model links (exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive) 
sensations at lower levels with multimodal models of hidden bodily states, such as fatigue and hunger, at intermediate levels, and finally with 
temporally extended, integrative models of the embodied self at the higher hierarchical level. In this schematic, following predictive coding (Rao and 
Ballard 1999, Friston 2005), black and red circles represent neural units that encode predictions and prediction errors, respectively. The levels are 
reciprocally connected, so predictions are propagated from the top-down (black edges) and prediction errors from the bottom-up (red edges). Finally, 
the pink triangles indicate a mechanism of precision gating (or gain control) of prediction error units, which determines their relative influence on 
units encoding predictions. At a neurobiological level, prediction and prediction error units could be mapped to deep and superficial pyramidal cells in 
cortical hierarchies, whereas expected precision could be linked to neuromodulatory input. The elements of the generative model shown do not need 
to map one-to-one to specific brain areas or networks but are plausibly distributed across many of them. However, as a first approximation, the lower 
and intermediate layers of the generative model could be linked to brain networks that process unimodal information (e.g. sensory cortices for 
exteroceptive information) and multimodal association areas, respectively. The highest level of the generative model could be linked to brain networks 
that process information about the self, such as the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the medial prefrontal cortex. See Parr et al. 
(2022) for details about hierarchical generative models supporting adaptive regulation and allostasis and Barrett and Simmons (2015) for their 
putative neuronal underpinnings. See online article for colored version of this figure.
are reciprocally linked through top-down connections that convey 
predictions (black edges) and bottom-up connections that convey 
prediction errors (red edges), within and across levels. This predic-
tive coding architecture permits inferring (in the Bayesian sense) 
the most likely causes of sensations, across multiple modalities 
and multiple hierarchical levels, by minimizing prediction errors 
at all levels. The rationale is that predictions at all levels are con-
tinuously adjusted (and synaptic weights adjusted at a slower time 
scale) until they match with incoming multimodal stimuli suf-
ficiently well, and, consequently, the prediction errors across all 
levels are minimized. This process entails that even if a predictive 
coding agent starts with an incorrect prediction (e.g. about what 
object it is looking at) the prediction errors that measure a discrep-
ancy between the predicted sensations and the actual sensations 
can help revise the initial predictions. See Parr et al. (2022) for a 
more detailed explanation of how to interpret these schematics.
Another critical aspect of  Fig. 1 is that it illustrates two path-
ways in which prediction errors at the proprioceptive and inte-
roceptive levels are used to steer physical actions (reflex arcs) 
and autonomic actions (autonomic reflexes). Endowing predictive 
coding with these reflexes—hence realizing an “active inference” 
architecture—permits minimizing prediction errors by changing 
the state of the world (by physically acting) or the internal milieu 
(by engaging in autonomic actions) rather than only by changing 
predictions, as described later.
Equipped with a generative model like the one shown in Fig. 1, 
an active inference agent can continuously infer (and act upon) 
the state of the world and of the body, including the internal 
milieu, at multiple time scales. Of particular interest, here are 
multimodal inferences that unite exteroceptive and interocep-
tive sources of evidence. One example of this is the percep-
tion of faces expressing emotions. T wo studies reported that 
6 Barca et al.
participants processed faces expressing fear (but not neutral 
faces or faces expressing other emotions) when their heart rate 
was high—hence congruent with the fearful expression (Pez-
zulo et al. 2018, Yu et al. 2021). The generative model shown 
in Fig. 1 could support this kind of inference by using interocep-
tive information from the heart (i.e.  high heart rate) as evidence 
that “there might be something fearful out there” (Pezzulo 2013). 
Another more complex example regards emotional awareness 
and self-awareness—which significantly engage the brain regions 
involved in interoception and the representation of physiologi-
cal processes (Garfinkel et al. 2013). The generative model shown 
in Fig. 1 might support processes of emotional awareness in a 
way that is neither purely bottom-up (i.e. as if interoceptive sig-
nals cause emotional awareness) nor top-down (i.e. as if emotional 
awareness causes interoceptive signals), but rather through a 
circular causality between central predictions about bodily state—
that engage autonomic reflexes—and interoceptive streams—that 
update the predictions (Seth and Friston 2016). In this perspec-
tive, any representation that induces interoceptive predictions 
could be associated with emotional or affective content; cru-
cially, this is also the case with some aspects of self-awareness 
(e.g. recognizing one’s own face) that require integrating intero-
ceptive streams with concurrent exteroceptive (e.g. visual) and 
proprioceptive cues. These examples illustrate that the genera-
tive model of  Fig. 1 natively implements both the multisensory 
integration required to unite (for example) interoceptive and exte-
roceptive streams and the active aspects that are supposed to 
support emotional and self-processing—and the construction of 
an “embodied self” (i.e.  the circular causality between engag-
ing autonomic reflexes and capturing the ensuing interoceptive
signals).
In general, the accuracy of the inference of hidden bodily 
states, the “embodied self,” or other aspects of the model depends 
on the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensations and on the quality of 
the model. For example, it is difficult to self-localize in a city if it 
is dark (low signal-to-noise ratio) or if one does not know the city 
well (poor model). The inference of hidden bodily and emotional 
states might function in an analogous manner. If the quality of 
the afferent interoceptive (e.g. cardiac) signals is low, or if one has 
a poor model of how one’s body functions, then it would estimate 
one’s bodily states such as fatigue incorrectly (which in turn would 
also impair its adaptive regulation of the same bodily states). Inte-
roceptive signals could be “too noisy” for various reasons, which 
might be related to physiology, inflammation, or stress. The body 
model can be poor in various ways, too. For example, it could 
poorly characterize the statistical relations between interoceptive 
sensations and hidden bodily states (e.g. systematically mischar-
acterize high heart rate as caused by hunger but not fatigue
or joy).
Finally, there is a third essential element that determines the 
accuracy of the inference: precision control. In predictive cod-
ing, the influence of prediction errors on inference is weighted 
by their precision, i.e. inverse variance (pink triangles in  Fig. 1). 
This weighting would ensure that very reliable sensations have 
more impact on inference than unreliable sensations. However, 
precision (like all other variables) needs to be estimated, but this 
might be incorrect. An incorrect setting of precisions has been 
associated with various psychopathological conditions, such as 
psychosis (Adams et al. 2013), eating disorders (Barca and Pezzulo 
2020), panic disorders ( Maisto 
 et al. 2021), symptom perception 
(Pezzulo et al. 2019), depression (Barrett et  al. 2016), and many 
others (Khalsa et al. 2018, Paulus et al. 2019). Intuitively, assign-
ing excessively high weight to noisy sensations yields an incorrect 
inference that tracks the noise rather than the correct state of 
the estimated variable system (i.e. overfitting), whereas assigning 
excessively low weight to sensations (or excessively high weight to 
prior knowledge) makes the system poorly responsive to incom-
ing observations that might signal a change in the state of the 
system—and both are examples of aberrant inference (Friston 
et al. 2014).
Figure 2 provides a formal illustration of the above by plot-
ting some examples of Bayesian inference using generative models 
under various levels of precision of the model components. For 
simplicity, we focus on a simplified example of inference of an 
interoceptive variable: one’s heart rate. Heart rate is a “hidden 
variable” in Bayesian parlance since it is not directly observable 
but needs to be inferred through two sources of information: 
prior knowledge about the most likely heart rate and sensory 
(heartbeat) observations. The top panel of Fig. 2 shows a series 
of (noisy) heartbeat observations. In the beginning, they are 
in the normal range for an adult (time steps 1–10), then they 
increase significantly, simulating tachycardia (time steps 11–20), 
then they go back to the normal range (time steps 21–30), then 
they decrease significantly, simulating bradycardia (time steps 
31–40), and finally, they go back to the normal range (time steps 
41–50).
The second panel of Fig. 2 shows the Shannon surprise of 
an inference model that estimates the current heart rate using 
the two standard components of a generative model. The for-
mer component is the prior, which encodes the person’s a priori 
probabilistic belief (i.e. probability distribution) about her “nor-
mal” heart rate range; here, the prior is a Gaussian centered on 
67 and has a precision of 0.11. The latter component is the likeli-
hood, which encodes the probabilistic mapping between sensory 
(heartbeat) observations and the hidden state (heart rate); here, 
the likelihood is a Gaussian centered on the current heart rate 
with an additional bias of 15 pulses, and the panel shows the 
results for 10 values for precision obtained by subdividing the 
range [0.1,10] into equal intervals. The results shown in the second 
panel of Fig. 2 show that Shannon surprise increases dramatically 
during episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia, which are far 
from the normal range. The pattern of results is the same across 
all levels of likelihood precision. However, the inference with a 
very high precision (a precision of 10) tracks more closely the noise 
sensory signals and can therefore lead to more extreme results.
The third panel shows the Bayesian surprise (or the Kullback-
Leibler divergence between posterior and prior probability distri-
butions) over time. This is a measure of how much dissimilar the 
posterior and the prior are, and it always decreases as a result of 
inference, but note that it decreases much more rapidly when the 
precision of the likelihood is 10, which is another indication that 
the posterior is “overfitting,” meaning that the inference result is 
excessively biased by the likelihood distribution.
Finally, the two bottom series of panels are organized in two 
(left and right) columns, which show the first five time steps of 
inference for the two cases with high precision (of 10) and low pre-
cision (of 0.1) of the likelihood, respectively. In these plots, the prior 
distributions are in blue, the posterior distributions are in green, 
and the likelihoods are in red. It is possible to note that in the left 
(high precision) panels, the posterior inference closely follows the 
likelihood (it “overfits”) after five time steps and the inferred heart 
rate is slightly biased (i.e. it is 79). Differently, in the right (low 
precision) panels, the inference converges much slower to a high 
precision posterior, but without overfitting.
These simple examples of Bayesian inference illustrate two 
things. First, sensory observations that are unpredictable given

Shannon surprise of a generative model composed of a fixed prior about heart rate (a Gaussian with a mean of 67 and a precision of 0.11) and a

see the legend). Third panel: Bayesian surprise, which measures the discrepancy between posterior and prior probabilities over time. Bottom panels:

this figure.
the current model generate significant surprise, and sometimes, 
the surprise can remain relatively high for long periods before the 
model adapts (or the world changes), especially with some param-
eterizations of the generative model. This is particularly relevant 
in this context since active inference agents strive to minimize 
their surprise (and the long-term average of surprise, entropy, 
which is a measure of uncertainty) by changing their model, or 
changing the world, or both.
Second, these examples illustrate the importance of precision 
control and the appropriate setting of precision parameters in 
guiding inference. Remarkably, the inference can be more or less 
accurate or fast using the same data, depending on the precision 
parameters. Note that in Fig. 2, we manipulated only the precision 
of the likelihood. However, it would also be possible to manipulate 
the precision of the prior, together or in alternative to the precision 
of the likelihood. Generally speaking, when the precision of the 
8 Barca et al.
prior is very high, the posterior will closely reflect the prior, ren-
dering the inference rigid and incapable of adapting to changing 
environmental conditions—which might be especially problem-
atic in periods of significant changes, such as adolescence or more 
simply when one changes city, working environment, and friends. 
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, hierarchical predictive coding 
architectures have precision values associated with every hierar-
chical level (whereas, for simplicity, the inference shown in Fig. 2 
is not hierarchical). The correct balance of precision parameters 
within and across layers is crucial for accurate inference, as it 
ensures that the correct levels of confidence are assigned to data 
and prior information.
Finally, and importantly, aberrant precision control (as well 
as various combinations of other factors discussed earlier, such 
as noisy bodily sensations and poor bodily mode) can render 
inference not just incorrect but also highly ambiguous, leaving a 
person in a permanent condition of uncertainty about whether 
one is fatigued (when considering the bodily state), happy, or sad 
(when considering the emotional state), what kind of person one 
is or what are one’s desires (when considering self-models), etc. 
Importantly, this condition of uncertainty is not limited to percep-
tual inference but has a cascade effect on decision-making and 
action selection. Indeed, an uncertain estimate of one’s state auto-
matically implies that one has low confidence in the effects of 
one’s plans; for example, it renders more difficult the prediction 
of whether a run would be too fatiguing or a party too stressful. 
It is exactly this kind of uncertainty (about the present and the 
future, the body state or the outcomes of social interactions, etc.) 
that active inference agents strive to avoid.
Avoiding excessive uncertainty in maladaptive 
ways
Our previous discussion clarified that active inference agents have 
sophisticated (hierarchically deep, temporally extended) models 
of themselves that permit making inferences at multiple levels 
about hidden bodily states (which comprise both the classical 
“body schema” and other states that are relevant for allostasis, 
such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue) and other states related to 
the emotional and embodied self. These models are essential for 
ensuring effective regulation and control at multiple levels, from 
simple reflexes to sophisticated goal-directed behaviors (Tschantz 
et al. 2022). However, in some cases, the aforementioned inferen-
tial process might not work properly (e.g. if the sensory channels 
are too noisy or are assigned excessively high or low precision). 
As a consequence, a person could experience an excessive or 
irreducible uncertainty about her bodily and emotional states or 
about the self, which in turn translates into a loss of confidence 
about which future courses of action could produce desired out-
comes. Crucially, active inference agents follow the imperative 
to avoid such an uncertainty about the present or the future. 
Normally, uncertainty minimization strategies are adaptive (e.g. 
seeking advice if one is uncertain about the direction of the pre-
ferred restaurant). However, in some conditions, such as when 
a person experiences excessive and irreducible uncertainty and 
when the uncertainty is particularly distressing or related to fun-
damental life concerns, she might potentially seek “maladaptive” 
ways to reduce it—or methods that reduce uncertainty at the cost 
of hindering fundamental imperatives of well-being and survival 
(see also Linson et al. 2020).
In this perspective, apparently paradoxical actions, such as 
food restriction and self-injurious behaviors, might be pursued 
because they could contribute to reducing the (otherwise unman-
ageable) uncertainty about bodily and emotional states or the self. 
In other words, in some conditions, the self-injuring pain could be 
more than compensated by the information gain—and the pos-
sibility to generate precise sensations about one’s bodily state. 
By harming the body, we turn it into a very precise source of 
sensations that relieves us from excessive uncertainty about the 
present state and the future course of action. Our (simple) exam-
ple, therefore, illustrates a possible way paradoxical actions could 
be pursued by active inference agents who endure to minimize 
their uncertainty. While self-injuries and other similar behav-
iors are maladaptive in the sense of reducing the fitness of an 
organism, they can still emerge as a result of a correct inference 
that tries to minimize the uncertainty of one’s model of the body 
and the self. This case could particularly fit when some of the 
(precision) parameters of one’s model of the body and the self 
are not appropriately tuned (Fig. 2), producing excessive levels of 
uncertainty.
Having said this, the idea that NSSI behaviors could reflect the 
imperative to minimize uncertainty is not at odds but comple-
mentary to the idea that these behaviors might also be motivated 
by reward achievement (remember that in active inference, both 
uncertainty minimization and utility maximization can be in play 
simultaneously). While NSSI behaviors are associated with a vari-
ety of adverse outcomes, such as negative emotions and distress 
(Klonsky et al. 2003 ), they can also have paradoxically positive 
effects by providing a way to relieve or distract from other sources 
of emotional distress and negative affect (Nock and Prinstein 2004, 
Chapman et al. 2006, Bresin and Gordon 2013, Selby et al. 2019). 
The hedonic effect of NSSI behaviors might be further magnified 
by poor models of one’s body and the self, as suggested by evidence 
that children who engage in NSSI show aberrant responsiveness 
to rewards (Tsypes et al. 2018). Finally, NSSI behaviors have habit-
ual components, which might contribute to their selection, over 
and above consideration of utility maximization or uncertainty 
reduction ( Magerl et al. 2012 ). This body of evidence suggests 
that if uncertainty minimization is a driver of NSSI behaviors, 
as suggested here, it could work in concert with other drivers 
(reward achievement and habit), in ways that are still poorly
understood.
Focusing on uncertainty minimization as a possible factor con-
tributing to NSSI behaviors might also help understand the preva-
lence of NSSI during adolescence. As discussed earlier, people 
in adolescence experience significant changes at many levels—
from bodily states such as body size to interoceptive and hor-
monal processes to affective states and the self. As illustrated 
in Fig. 2, rapid changes (as in the cases of simulated tachycardia 
and bradycardia) determine high levels of surprise and uncer-
tainty that, in some cases, remain elevated, either because some 
of the precision parameters that afford model updates are set 
incorrectly or simply because readapting internal models of the 
body and the self takes time. In periods of rapid changes, such 
as adolescence or after very surprising events, there might be a 
(temporary) misalignment between the predictions of the (out-
dated) internal model and the incoming sensations. For exam-
ple, during adolescence, one might use an outdated model that 
predicts the usual affective states during a party and fail to 
contextualize novel sensations (e.g. unexpected feelings or inte-
roceptive signals when meeting somebody), hence experiencing 
high levels of uncertainty. Thus, failing to reduce this uncertainty 
and achieve a coherent model of oneself could be particularly
distressing.
Modeling and controlling the body in maladaptive ways  9
Discussion
Current theories of predictive processing and active inference 
assume that, to steer adaptive perception and action, the brain 
forms internal generative models of the environment and of the 
body within it. Various studies reveal that the brain has rich 
models of the body; for example, it integrates somatosensory 
and proprioceptive information into a coherent representation 
of things like body size and limb position—i.e. a “body schema.” 
More recently, this model-based perspective has been extended to 
interoception—and the rich sensations we constantly receive from 
the internal body. Theories of interoceptive processing propose 
that the brain continuously estimates key bodily and homeo-
static variables, such as thirst or fatigue levels, perhaps forming 
something like an “interoceptive schema.”
A key reason for forming bodily or interoceptive models is 
that they permit us to exert accurate control over the variety of 
signals (e.g. somatosensory and interoceptive) that the body pro-
duces. Forming an accurate body schema is prominent for motor 
control, whereas modeling interoceptive variables (e.g. thirst) 
is key to keeping them under control by engaging autonomic 
reflexes (e.g. vasodilation) and allostatic or goal-directed actions 
(e.g. drinking) when they have incorrect values. The generative 
modeling perspective can also be extended hierarchically to con-
sider richer models of multimodal experiences and “embodied 
self” that persists in time and anchors our experiences, permit-
ting us to select adaptive courses of action to achieve our favorite
goals.
While it seems obvious that controlling bodily variables and 
achieving goals are crucial for survival, this perspective poses a 
fundamental challenge. In control theory and active inference, 
“controlling” the body ensures that the body generates the pre-
ferred outcomes with high (hedonic or pragmatic) value, e.g. safe 
levels for thirst and fatigue. This idea applies naturally to many 
of our activities that pursue some form of biologically adaptive 
function or well-being, such as ensuring that we keep our bodies 
healthy and consume good food (Sterling and Eyer 1988 , Sterling 
2012). However, it fails to explain why we engage in some activi-
ties 
that are apparently maladaptive and contradict our primary 
biological imperative to ensure body health. Perhaps the most 
puzzling examples are pathological behaviors (e.g. non-suicidal 
self-harm or starvation), which are common across psychopatho-
logical conditions. In these cases, the control exerted over the 
body and its sensations might serve the purpose of generating out-
comes with high (hedonic or pragmatic) values that nevertheless 
run against our homeostatic and survival imperatives (e.g. pain 
and excessive levels of hunger).
In this article, we started with formal accounts of brain pro-
cessing based on active inference to discuss the mechanisms and 
functional purpose of the (apparently) maladaptive ways to “con-
trol the body” that arise in these and other psychopathological 
behaviors. We first discussed how we build models of the world, 
of our bodily and interoceptive processes, of our emotions, and 
of the embodied self, which provides a sense of understanding of 
reality and affords adaptive control at many levels, from the allo-
static regulation of our physiological states to the achievement of 
our individual and social goals. Then, we discussed under which 
conditions we can become highly uncertain about our current 
state and the future course of action. These conditions include 
both contextual factors (e.g. periods of noteworthy changes or 
stress) and factors related to the person’s internal models (e.g. 
poor models in which precision parameters are incorrectly set). 
We next turned to active inference and discussed how reduc-
ing uncertainty (not just maximizing utility) is a key imperative 
in this framework. This implies that an active inference agent 
can sometimes privilege uncertainty minimization over utility 
maximization. In extreme conditions, such as when interocep-
tive uncertainty is excessive or difficult to reduce, a person could 
develop maladaptive strategies to deal with it, such as acting on 
the body to produce interoceptive sensations of pain or starvation 
that reduce interoceptive uncertainty.
The centrality of physiological processes and bodily informa-
tion for the sense of self has been widely discussed by intero-
ceptive research (Seth et  al. 2012, Quigley et al. 2021 ). Here, in 
continuity with previous works (Barca and Pezzulo 2020), we sug-
gest that (i) some pathological behaviors—that “act on the body” 
in maladaptive ways—might be considered as strategies for mod-
ifying internal models and the sense of self when it is deficient, 
through bodily sensations and (ii) the sense of self can be defi-
cient when bodily information is uncertain, and this can happen 
not only in clinical conditions but also during pivotal periods of 
developmental transition, e.g. in adolescence.
The theoretical perspective offered here leaves several impor-
tant questions unaddressed. First, even if uncertainty reduction 
might be a central drive in self-injury behaviors, it is unclear what 
kinds of uncertainty (if any) specifically trigger the paradoxical 
behaviors. It may be only the uncertainty at deep hierarchical 
levels (e.g. at the level of self-models) that promotes paradoxi-
cal behaviors. Alternatively, it could be possible that it is not so 
much the kind of uncertainty that matters but somewhat its asso-
ciated distress, which in turn could be amplified by conditions 
like the intolerance of uncertainty. While these and alternative 
hypotheses remain to be tested in future research, they might in 
the future lead to novel tailored interventions. Current reviews of 
NSSI interventions (see, e.g. Turner et al. 2014, Witt et al. 2021) out-
line the various treatments currently available (e.g. psychological 
and psychosocial interventions, pharmacological treatments, and 
a combination of both), but underline the need for further data 
on their effectiveness. The use of formal models of brain function 
to characterize the mechanisms of psychopathology (Friston et al. 
2014, Ste
phan and Mathys 2014) might help conceptualize dys-
functional behaviors in operationalizable terms. In this vein, one 
might delineate interventions aimed at reducing the uncertainty 
of self-models by starting from the bodily self and the definition 
of self-other boundaries (if these turn out to be the critical aspects 
for the patient). In this endeavor, techniques such as virtual reality 
and robotics might help elucidate which levels of the multisen-
sory integration process of the bodily self might be compromised 
(Dieguez and Lopez 2017, Tsakiris 2017, Serino et al. 2018). Virtual 
reality along with role-playing sessions and the use of avatars are 
increasingly considered effective tools for the training of clinicians 
who deal with individuals engaging in NSSI (Taliaferro et al. 2023). 
It remains to be tested whether the use of virtual reality or similar 
interventions—and the definition of contexts and tasks aimed at 
reducing the uncertainty of the bodily self—might also be viable 
for individuals engaging in NSSI.
Second, in this paper, we have mainly focused on uncertainty 
reduction, but as we reviewed earlier, there are other alterna-
tive (or complementary) perspectives on the genesis of NSSI that 
considers elements such as affective regulation. In addition to 
the studies discussed earlier, other insights into the pathologi-
cal mechanisms that might underlie NSSI come from the anal-
ysis of clinical populations. For example, dysregulations of the 
10 Barca et al.
“endogenous opioid system”—involved in reward and the regu-
lation of pain and affect—have been documented (Bresin and 
Gordon 2013), as low basal plasma levels of β-endorphins (which 
are peripherally released following tissue damage) in psychiatric 
patients (van der Venne et al. 2021, Cakin Memik et  al. 2023). 
Lower salivary levels of β-endorphins have also been registered 
immediately before NSSI, compared to post-NSSI (Störkel et al. 
2021). Thus, an imbalance in the opioid system might be a rel-
e
vant component in NSSI, where self-injures might be acted 
to initiate the release of β-endorphins to restore homeostasis
(Stanley et  al. 2010 , Bresin and Gordon 2013). Another line 
of research examined “nociceptive dysregulation,” with possible 
hypoalgesia (Kirtley et al. 2016), showing higher pain thresh-
olds and lower pain intensity in adolescents with NSSI (Nock 
et al. 2006, 2009, v
an der Venne et al. 2021). Recent works failed 
to replicate these findings but reported specific alterations in 
descending inhibitory pain control (Leone et al. 2021, Lalouni 
et al. 2022). Despite some inconsistencies, this is an area that 
is worth further investigation. It remains to investigate to what 
extent the perspective on NSSI offered here could be extended to 
cover the aforementioned body of evidence and whether active 
inference could help integrate the different perspectives we have
discussed.
We focused on adolescence as a potentially critical period for 
NSSI, given that it is associated with high levels of uncertainty 
about several central domains in human life. However, there 
are other (gender-related) developmental periods in which bod-
ily changes might be coupled with increased levels of uncertainty 
(e.g. in physiology, in the sense of self, in the social role) and vulner-
ability. Pregnancy and transition to menopause, e.g. are periods of 
endocrine and hormonal upheavals that might impact a woman’s 
affective life and well-being. These physiological changes are cou-
pled with a fundamental developmental transition that requires a 
redefinition of personal identity and narrative integration (McLean 
and Lilgendahl 2019 ), with increased uncertainty of one’s inter-
nal states and role in the social context. Taking into account 
the perimenopausal and menopausal transition, the physiologi-
cal, psychological, and affective experiences associated with it are 
very heterogeneous. Some women might experience it as a new 
beginning, whereas for others, it may be more critical (Deeks 2003). 
In some cases, e.g. the menopause transition might perturb the 
continuity of one’s sense of self, inducing discrepancies in inter-
nal self-coherence (e.g. the end of childbearing years, the aging 
process), which might increase the level of distress (Barca and De 
Marchis 2018).
The dramatic changes that a women’s physiology undergoes 
during life have been suggested to concur with the atypical 
interoception often reported (e.g. heightened interoceptive atten-
tion but poor interoceptive accuracy), which might contribute 
to their greater vulnerability to mental illness (Murphy et al. 
2019). Although this is still a speculative hypothesis that needs 
to 
be tested empirically, the effect of these transition periods on 
women’s well-being is currently overlooked and deserves more 
attention.
Finally, although we only focused on “maladaptive” strate-
gies to modify the sense of self through bodily sensations, there 
are also “adaptive” strategies that use the body to improve the 
sense of self and feelings of well-being. Among these, e.g. is 
engaging in physical activities to reduce emotional distress. Per-
forming physical activity concurs in the reduction in symptoms 
of depression and anxiety, acting on both psychological (e.g. 
diverting from unpleasant stimuli or increasing the sense of self-
efficacy) and physiological mechanisms (e.g. through the release 
of monoamines and endorphins), which seem to alleviate distress-
ing emotions (see for a review Paluska and Schwenk 2000 ). The 
relationship between well-being, physical activity, and interocep-
tion is increasingly receiving attention (Wallman-Jones et al. 2021) 
and deserves further investigation for its potential role as a pro-
tective factor against emotional distress and the development of 
clinical conditions.
It is worth reminding that the theoretical proposal advanced 
in this study—that NSSI might emerge when some of the (preci-
sion) parameters of one’s model of the body and the self are not 
appropriately tuned—is still speculative. However, previous stud-
ies reported the importance of aberrant precision tuning in inte-
roceptive streams across various psychopathological conditions, 
such as depression, anxiety, eating, and substance use disorders 
(Smith et al. 2020, 2021). These studies, along with other proposals 
(
Khalsa et al. 2018), raise the possibility that interoceptive dys-
functions and the incorrect tuning of (precision) parameters of 
generative models might have a pervasive effect on psychopathol-
ogy. This hypothesis remains to be investigated in the case of 
NSSI.
