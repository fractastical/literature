ABSTRACT
Understanding the emergence of symbol systems, especially language, requires the
construction of a computational model that reproduces both the developmental learning process
in everyday life and the evolutionary dynamics of symbol emergence throughout history. This
study introduces the collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, which emphasizes and models
the interdependence between forming internal representations through physical interactions with
the environment and sharing and utilizing meanings through social semiotic interactions within
a symbol emergence system. The total system dynamics is theorized from the perspective
of predictive coding. The hypothesis draws inspiration from computational studies grounded in
probabilistic generative models and language games, including the Metropolis–Hastings naming
game. Thus, playing such games among agents in a distributed manner can be interpreted
as a decentralized Bayesian inference of representations shared by a multi-agent system.
Moreover, this study explores the potential link between the CPC hypothesis and the free-energy
principle, positing that symbol emergence adheres to the society-wide free-energy principle.
Furthermore, this paper provides a new explanation for why large language models appear
to possess knowledge about the world based on experience, even though they have neither
sensory organs nor bodies. This paper reviews past approaches to symbol emergence systems,
offers a comprehensive survey of related prior studies, and presents a discussion on CPC-
based generalizations. Future challenges and potential cross-disciplinary research avenues are
highlighted.

1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding the emergence of symbolic communication is essential not only to unveil the evolutionary
origins of language but also to grasp high-level human cognitive capabilities that enable us to
communicate and collaborate with others. Humans understand their subjectively experienced world,
i.e., Umwelt V on Uexk¨ull (1992), through interactions with the environment based on their sensory-motor
system to, subsequently or simultaneously, acquire and use language (Taniguchi et al., 2023a; Cangelosi
and Schlesinger, 2015). Thus, while perceiving the world, they form societies through symbolic, especially
linguistic, communication 1. Language is a type of symbol system from the perspective of semiotics,
1 In this paper, we consider both “symbolic communication” and “semiotic communication” depending on the context and their relationship with relevant
discussions and research. However, both can be considered to have the same meaning.

Figure 1. Overview of Collective Predictive Coding. Each agent (human) predicts and encodes
environmental information through interactions using sensory-motor systems. Simultaneously, the
information obtained in a distributed manner is collectively encoded as a symbolic system (language).
When viewing language from the perspective of an agent, each agent plays a role similar to a sensory-motor
modality that acts on the environment (world).
although languages are diverse and complex in terms of syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and
morphology when compared to other types of symbol systems (Chandler, 2002). Through language,
humans understand what others perceive and can behave cooperatively as a group. This paper centrally
questions why and how humans create languages that dynamically change over time, but function stably in
society, realizing communication and collaboration. This study aims to provide a new hypothesis to explain
human cognitive and social dynamics pertaining to the creation and upgrade of their shared symbol systems
including language. Despite the existence of numerous philosophical, psychological, and computational
theories, no general computational theory has explained the dynamics of symbol emergence systems. From
the evolutionary perspective, explanations must include how the emergence of symbolic communication
contributes to the environmental adaptation of humans. Furthermore, the explanation should be consistent
with other theories that explain the dynamics of the human cognitive system as a whole. Therefore, this
study focuses on those aspects of languages that somehow connect human cognition and promote adaptation
to the environment as a multi-agent system. Moreover, by focusing on the emergent characteristics of
language, namely symbol emergence, we introduce a new concept of collective predictive coding (CPC),
through which language development for humans to predict and encode the world in terms of collective
intelligence can be studied. Conversely, language itself can be termed as a subject that is coordinated in a
distributed manner utilizing human cognitive systems. The situation in which language (symbol system)
can be created using CPC is shown in Figure 1. As CPC extends the idea ofpredictive coding (PC) (Hohwy,
2013; Ciria et al., 2021) from individual to society-wide adaptation as a group, we propose the CPC
hypothesis. PC posits that the brain predicts sensory information and updates its mental models to enhance
Frontiers 2
predictability. Notably, CPC is shown to be closely related to thefree-energy principle (FEP), which has
gradually gained recognition as a general principle of the human brain and cognition (Friston, 2019, 2010;
Clark, 2013), theoretically. The FEP, a broader concept, posits that the brain learns to predict sensory inputs
and makes behavioral decisions based on these predictions, aligning with the Bayesian brain idea (Parr
et al., 2022). Additionally, the CPC provides a new explanation for whylarge language models (LLMs)
appear to possess knowledge about the world based on experience, even though they have neither sensory
organs nor bodies.
When considering the emergence of symbol systems that contribute to human environmental adaptation,
it is crucial to simultaneously take into account people’s sensory-motor interactions with the environment
and their communication through speech and text. The challenge lies in modeling the evolutionary and
developmental dynamics of the cognitive and social systems that form the basis for the emergence
of symbolic (and linguistic) systems and communications. From both developmental and evolutionary
perspectives, knowledge of symbolic (and linguistic) communication does not exist a priori. Human infants
learn symbolic communication, including language, through interaction with their environment during their
developmental stages. Humans, as societies, gradually form symbolic communication systems through
evolutionary processes and continuously adjust them in their daily lives. Hence, the quest for symbol
emergence or emergent communication should not be limited to the development of a natural language
processing (NLP) system (Brown et al., 2020; Min et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022),
whose purpose is to create an artificial system capable of processing natural languages appropriately to
satisfy certain engineering objectives. Instead, it should be extended to grasp the dynamics of language
systems themselves. Highlighting the dynamics and emergence of the semantic aspects of symbol systems,
Taniguchi et al. (2016a) proposed the concept ofsymbol emergence systems (SESs) (see Section 2). An SES
is a multi-agent system where each agent forms concepts, learns a symbol system such as language, and
communicates with other agents. Additionally, a symbol system emerges in a bottom-up manner through
communication among agents.
As mentioned above, the phenomenon of symbol emergence involves human linguistic and other high
and low-level cognitive capabilities. Thus, the mechanism, i.e., computational explanation, of symbol
emergence should be consistent with other principles of cognition, such as PC and FEP, which have
gradually gained recognition as general principles of the human brain and cognition (Friston, 2019;
Hohwy, 2013; Friston, 2010; Clark, 2013; Ciria et al., 2021). PC is a broadly accepted theory, especially
in neuroscience, which has been generalized and is almost synonymous with FEP (Friston, 2019; Friston
et al., 2021). Thus, animal brains including that of humans constantly predict sensory information and
update their internal representations such as world models, perceptual categories, language models, and
motor commands. Clarifying the connection between symbol emergence (or emergent communication) and
PC or FEP is crucial, given that symbol emergence is rooted in human cognitive capabilities.
Humans communicate using complex languages that involve numerous characteristics such as syntax,
semantics, and pragmatics. Notably, the meaning of a sign can change through long-term interactions with
the environment and other agents, depending on the context. The adaptability and emergent properties of
symbol systems are crucial in human symbolic communication in relation to the principles of semiotics
as outlined by Peirce (Chandler, 2002). Peirce emphasizes the evolutionary nature of symbols in relation
to human development. In this view, the association between a sign and its object is not predetermined
but emerges through collective human experience. This perspective also asserts that the categorization of
events and objects as members of particular categories is not determined a priori. Our human symbolic
system is thus characterized by the evolving nature of the relationship between ”label” and ”category. Using
Frontiers 3
the terminology of Peircean semiotics, the relationship between signs and objects is fluid and changes
according to the interpretant. The exploration of how people form categories and share signs within a
community leads us to the framework of SES.
A variety of computational models have been proposed, and numerous studies have been conducted, as
described in Section 5, to model the cultural evolution of language and language acquisition in individuals.
Such studies follow several types of frameworks, including emergent communication (Lazaridou and
Baroni, 2020), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) (Lowe et al., 2017), iterated learning models
(Kirby and Hurford, 2002), and symbol emergence in robotics (Taniguchi et al., 2016b). However, a
computational model framework that captures the overall dynamics of SES is still necessary. The CPC aims
to offer a more integrative perspective, potentially incorporating the pre-existing approaches to symbol
emergence and emergent communication.
Another challenge is to understand the potential capabilities of LLMs. Recently, large language models,
which are attracting considerable attention in a variety of fields, have not received a satisfactory explanation
as to why they are so knowledgeable about our world and can behave appropriately Mahowald et al.
(2023). Gurnee and Tegmark (2023) demonstrated that LLMs learn representations of space and time
across multiple scales. Kawakita et al. (2023); Loyola et al. (2023) showed that there is considerable
correspondence between the human perceptual color space and the feature space found by language models.
The capabilities of LLMs have often been discussed from a computational perspective, focusing on the
network structure of transformers (Vaswani and Uszkoreit, 2017). However, while the architecture of neural
networks can explain the nature of computation, it cannot explain why they possess extensive knowledge
about the world as experienced by humans, given their foundation in distributional semantics (Harris, 1954).
The knowledge embedded in LLMs arises from distributional semantics, which is an intrinsic part of the
language formed by human society. So far, there has been no demonstration or theoretical explanation of
how human language has evolved to embed representations of the world within distributional semantics,
to the extent that predictive learning in LLMs can effectively decode this knowledge. In other words,
how language is formed in the context of human cognition of the world through our bodies, namely the
Umwelt V on Uexk¨ull (1992), and how language systems reflect the structure of the world has not been
explained with a viable mathematical model.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the CPC hypothesis, which radically extends the concept
of PC (Hohwy, 2013; Ciria et al., 2021). This hypothesis expands PC from a single brain to a group of
brains, suggesting a multi-agent system. It posits that the symbol system emerges as a result of CPC
conducted collaboratively by agents in a decentralized manner. In this framework, the emergent symbol
system, namely language, is viewed as a kind of subject, akin to a brain in PC. Within the CPC hypothesis,
language is considered a form of collective intelligence, implying that LLMs are directly modeling this
collective intelligence. Specifically, the CPC hypothesis argues that symbol systems, especially language,
emerge to maximize the predictability of multi-modal sensory-motor information (perceptual experiences)
obtained by members of an SES, such as human society. Additionally, the CPC hypothesis regards symbol
emergence as a decentralized Bayesian inference, which can be considered as an extension of the Bayesian
brain concept to a Bayesian society developed by Doya et al. (2007).
The CPC hypothesis is inspired from the findings of computational studies based on probabilistic
generative models and the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) naming game, which is a constructive approach to
SESs (Hagiwara et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2023b). The approach provided a Bayesian view of symbol
emergence including a theoretical guarantee of convergence. The theory proposed MH naming game as
a decentralized Bayesian inference of external representations shared among a multi-agent system. This
Frontiers 4
approach is seen as a distinct style of formalizing emergent communication, differing from conventional
models that use Lewis-style signaling games, including referential games (see Section 5.1). The former
approach is grounded in generative models, while the latter relies on discriminative models2. However,
the broad implications of their approach as a general hypothesis explaining the emergence of symbols in
human society were not fully discussed. Therefore, this study establishes a connection between symbol
emergence and PC and proposes the CPC hypothesis. The CPC hypothesis posits that self-organization
of external representations, i.e., symbol systems, can be conducted in a decentralized manner based on
representation learning and semiotic communication ability of individual agents. Additionally, the possible
connection between the CPC hypothesis and FEP, stating that symbol emergence follows society-wide FEP,
is discussed.
The main contribution of this study is the proposal of the CPC hypothesis, which offers the following
features:
1.CPC is a general framework of computational models for SESs based on pre-existing constructive models
and their variants. It provides an approach for developing a computational model and introduces a learning
algorithm for artificial agents that realize symbol emergence through decentralized communication;
2.CPC hypothesis provides a new computational understanding of symbol emergence in our human society,
such as the decentralized Bayesian inference of latent variables shared among agents integrating sensory
information of distributed agents and maximizing their predictability;
3.The hypothesis establishes a theoretical connection between PC, FEP, and symbol emergence.
4.CPC provides a new explanation for why LLMs appear to possess knowledge about the world based on
experience, even though they have neither sensory organs nor bodies.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews SESs to provide an integrated
view of symbol emergence communication and the representation learning processes of individuals;
Section 3 describes the existing probabilistic generative models for symbol emergence; Section 4 describes
the CPC hypothesis and its relationship with existing theories; Section 5 briefly discusses other studies that
can be considered constructive approaches to SESs; and Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 SYMBOL EMERGENCE SYSTEMS
2.1 Overview
Symbol emergence depends not only on social interactions between agents but also on physical
(sensorimotor) interactions of individual agents with the environment. For instance, to interpret the
meaning of the sign “apple,” an agent must share this sign within its society through social interactions, like
semiotic communication, which includes naming the object with others. Concurrently, the agent develops a
perceptual category through multi-modal interactions with the object itself. In Peircean semiotics, a symbol
is a kind of sign emerging from a triadic relationship between the sign, object, and interpretant (Chandler,
2002). An SES provides a descriptive model for the complete dynamics of symbol emergence (Taniguchi
et al., 2016a, 2018b) and a systematic of the fundamental dynamics of symbolic communication, regardless
of artificial or natural agents.
Figure 2 presents an overview of an SES involving multiple agents that initially consists of a group of
humans interacting with their environment through physical interactions using their sensorimotor system.

Figure 2. Overview of an SES. Each agent physically interacts with its environment using its sensorimotor
system (vertical arrows). Furthermore, every agent has semiotic communication with other agents using
signs or symbols (horizontal arrows). Through these interactions, each agent forms internal representations
(representation learning). Additionally, an emergent symbol system is organized and shared throughout the
system (upward round arrow). To achieve a proper semiotic communication, each agent must follow the
rules embedded in the symbol system; communication and perception are constrained by the emergent
symbol system (downward round arrow). The total system involves top-down and bottom-up dynamics,
often referred to as a micro-macro loop (or effect) in complex systems theory (Kalantari et al., 2020).
Further details are discussed in (Taniguchi et al., 2016a).
They also interact with other agents through semiotic communication using signs. In SESs, interactions
based on the exchange of signs between agents are referred to as semiotic communication. In this study,
symbolic and semiotic communication are considered to be the same. Taniguchi et al. (2016a) proposed
the concept of SES to overcome the issues of symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990).
The two types of interactions coincide and affect each other. However, from the perspective of semiotics,
physical interactions and semiotic communication are distinguishable. Generally, the meaning of a sign
in semiotic communication depends on its interpretation (i.e., interpretant), and the interpretation heavily
depends on a symbol system, which is a cultural existence that people share in the community. Therefore,
the information source of a sign’s meaning (i.e., what the sign represents or conveys) depends on and is
distributed throughout the symbol system. Conversely, what signals convey in sensorimotor interactions
Frontiers 6
typically does not depend on the culturally shared symbol system within the community3. SESs exhibit
two main types of dynamics, namely (internal) representation learning by individual agents and symbol
emergence by multi-agent systems.
In artificial intelligence (AI), except for the studies on emergent communications (see Section 5.1),
discussions on language and representation learning have focused primarily on learning by individual
agents. Language is not merely a static external linguistic resource that a single agent internalizes and
retains. It is distributed throughout society and evolves continuously with use. A symbolic system is neither
directly observable nor owned by a single agent; instead, it exists abstractly and is shared across systems
in a distributed manner. Humans recognize the world, communicate with others, and are influenced in a
top-down manner by language, as illustrated by an arrow labeled “constraints” in Figure 2. While individual
cognition, development, learning, and behavior undoubtedly underpin language learning and its use, the
language cultivated within society and the dynamics that support it extend beyond individual cognition.
The concept of an SES embodies a model in which a symbol system originates from the environmental
adaptations of individuals. However, the system emerges and functions to enable communication among
individuals and influence their behavior within the society (Figure 2). As is discussed in Section 2.4,
the system possesses emergent properties4 in the context of complex systems and is characterized by an
internal micro-macro loop (Taniguchi et al., 2016c). It is a distributed autonomous system comprising
multiple agents. Notably, the term SES does not represent the symbol system itself but denotes a group of
agents with cognitive dynamics that meet certain conditions. Therefore, each agent can be a human or a
robot. Moreover, as their cognition is enclosed within sensorimotor systems based on their bodies, they
cannot directly observe the internal states of others, nor can they be directly observed or manipulated by
external observers. Agents act and continuously adapt to their umwelt (subjective world) (V on Uexk¨ull,
1992).
2.2 Learning Internal Representation based on Physical Interactions
By integrating multi-modal sensorimotor information to better predict future sensations, people can form
internal representations5. Even without supervision or linguistic input, humans can learn the physical
properties of objects by their autonomous interaction via multi-modal sensorimotor system. For example,
without any linguistic input, children can find similarities between different apples because of the similarities
in color, shape, weight, hardness, and sounds made when dropped. Such information is obtained through
3 For example, when a certain amount of force is applied to an object (such as a brick wall), a corresponding force is returned as a reaction, hence when we
strike an object with a certain force, we experience a certain level of response in terms of force. When we look at an apple, our visual system receives a sensation
of the color red. These factors do not change significantly with the community to which the agent belongs. Here, “red” is distinguished as a sign and sensor
signal, and its meaning is dependent on language, as the famous example of colors of the rainbow suggests. Thus, the physical information obtained by our
visual system is not different. However, the perception, (i.e., categorization) is affected by linguistic or semiotic systems (Gliozzi et al., 2009; Althaus and
Westermann, 2016; Deutscher, 2010). Although the meaning of a linguistic sign cannot be learned without semiotic communication with others, the physical
properties of the sign can be learned from physical interactions with the target object without supervision because the physical properties of the object can be
ascertained from the interaction.
4 Note that the idea of emergent properties here is different from that often mentioned recently in the context of foundation models, including LLMs (Bommasani
et al., 2021).
5 The term “internal representations” is used in a more general sense than in representational theories of the mind (i.e., representationalism) in the theory
of SESs. The internal representations in this study do not strictly refer to (physical) symbol systems that are often considered in classical representational
accounts of the mind and AI. For example, the activation patterns in neural networks are regarded as a type of internal representation. Conversely, the internal
representation system is not an amodal “symbol system.” Unlike the amodal physical symbol system in conventional symbolic AI, the representation system can
be formed without symbolic information or language and does not require symbolism in the sense of logic and physical symbol systems (Newell, 1980). Such a
system is similar to the perceptual symbol system in cognitive psychology proposed by Barsalou (1999). The perceptual symbol system theory (Barsalou, 1999)
argues that bottom-up patterns of sensory-motor multi-modal data are associated with the perceptual process and that perceptual symbols are formed 6. However,
merely forming an internal representation system, which involves representation learning or categorization, is not sufficient for semiotic communication. This is
because it is crucial to consider the degree of freedom associated with signs.
Frontiers 7
the visual, haptic, and auditory senses. The internal representation learning process or categorization begins
before learning linguistic signs, such as words) (Quinn et al., 2001; Bornstein and Arterberry, 2010; Junge
et al., 2018). Therefore, an internal representation system forms the basis of semiotic communication,
and the argument does not exclude the effects of semiotic information provided by another agent during
representation learning.
Owing to advancements in neural networks, including deep learning and machine learning techniques in
general, progress in computational models for representation learning has successfully produced several
types of generative models that directly predict multi-modal sensorimotor information and form distributed
internal representations (Suzuki et al., 2016; Pandey and Dukkipati, 2017; Wu and Goodman, 2018).
The achieved success and remaining challenges suggest that human cognitive systems form internal
representations in a bottom-up manner in interactions with top-down priors (Lake et al., 2017; Bengio,
2017; Taniguchi et al., 2018b).
2.3 Organizing a Symbol System through Semiotic Communications
Symbols possess inherent arbitrariness in labels. An object labeled as “X” by one agent may not be
recognized as “X” by another agent. The crux of symbols (including language) in the human society is that
symbolic systems does not pre-exist, but they are developed and transformed over time; thereby forming the
premise of the discussion on symbol emergence. Through coordination between agents, the act of labeling
an object as “X” becomes shared across the group, gradually permeating the entire society. Symbols exhibit
variability in associating signs with objects. An object identified as the sign “X” by one agent may not
be recognized as “X” by another. The essence of symbols, including language, in human society lies in
the fact that symbolic systems are not pre-existing; rather, they evolve and transform over time, forming
the basis for discussions on the emergence of symbols. Through coordination, agents collectively begin to
recognize an object as the sign “X,” a concept that gradually becomes widespread throughout society.
Semiotic communication primarily shares the internal states and intentions of agents. However, these
internal representations should not be explicitly discretized or directly shared without (arbitrarily designed)
signs. Given the flexible nature of symbols, agents negotiate and strive to align symbols. For example, if
two agents are jointly attending to a stone and one of them names it “bababa,” if the other agent agrees
with this naming, then “bababa” can be agreed to be used as a sign for the object. As similar interactions
and agreements proliferate, “bababa” solidifies as a commonly recognized symbol within the multi-agent
system. Although this example is the simplest version of negotiation, this kind of dynamics becomes the
basis of symbol emergence.
Although a symbol system is a multifaceted system, in its simplest form, it comprises at least a collection
of (structured) signs and their associated internal representations of perceptual experiences, events,
intentions, abstract concepts, or their relationships. An integral aspect of symbol emergence theory
is the inclusion of both syntax and pragmatics as parts of the shared system. However, in this study, our
primary focus is on the representational relationships based on the semantic aspect formation of symbol
systems. Such an organized structure underscores its emergent nature, with the symbol system developing
bottom-up through physical interactions and semiotic communication among agents. This system is then
referred to as an ’emergent symbol system’ (Figure 2), highlighting its emergent characteristics.
2.4 Micro-Macro Loop in SESs
The organization of an emergent symbol system can be considered a self-organization process in the
SES. However, the emergence of symbolic systems is not a unilateral, bottom-up process. Instead, it
Frontiers 8
imposes top-down constraints on semiotic communication among agents and on the physical interactions
of individual agents, especially on the perception and interpretation of events. Owing to the arbitrariness
of symbols, every sensible communication must follow an emergent symbol system involving phonetics,
semantics, syntax, and pragmatics shared across the multi-agent system. Agents that do not follow an
emergent symbol system cannot benefit from semiotic communication. The effect of a symbol system that
emerges in a high-level layer can be regarded as a top-down constraint on a complex system (Kalantari
et al., 2020).
Bilateral feedback between higher and lower layers is called the micro–macro loop (or effect) (Figure 2).
A pattern (or order) in a higher layer is organized in a bottom-up manner through interactions in the lower
layer, and the organized pattern imposes top-down constraints on the interactions of the lower layer. This
bilateral feedback provides functionality to the system, and the loop is a feature of a complex system with
an emergent property used to obtain a function that is not originally discovered by the agents in the lower
layer. An emergent system is a complex system with emergent properties. Taniguchi et al. argued that
symbolic communication emerges as a function of the micro–macro loop in complex systems. Hence, SESs
act as the basis for semiotic communication (Taniguchi et al., 2016a, 2018b). An SES is a type of emergent
system (Kalantari et al., 2020), which is crucial for explaining the emergence of symbolic communication.
An intuitive example can be found in perceptual categorization and naming behaviors. From the
perspective of an individual agent, categorization is influenced by the symbol system, such as language,
which is learned in a top-down manner. Perceptual categorizations affect semiotic communication, i.e.,
naming objects, in a bottom-up manner. SESs capture bilateral influence as a part of the total symbol
emergence dynamics in a social system7
3 PROBABILISTIC GENERATIVE MODELS FOR SYMBOL EMERGENCE
Prior studies aimed at modeling SESs using probabilistic generative models are introduced before proposing
the CPC hypothesis. These studies provide a mathematical and computational basis for the CPC hypothesis.
3.1 Multi-modal Concept Formation and Representation Learning
Constructive computational and robot models exhibiting internal representation learning capabilities
are explored. Roy and Pentland (2002) developed a language-learning system based on the multi-modal
perception model. Cangelosi et al. (2000) tackled the symbol grounding problem using an artificial
cognitive system. Developmental robotics researchers studied language development models (Cangelosi
and Schlesinger, 2014). Unlike most classical AI studies in the 2000s and 2010s that mainly focused on a
single modality, such as visual, auditory, or linguistic inputs, studies in robotics encompass a wider range
of methods as they deal with multi-modal sensorimotor information. Embodied cognitive systems include
various sensors and motors, and a robot is an artificial human with a multi-modal perceptual system.
Unsupervised multi-modal categorization and representation learning is an important prerequisite for
concept formation and semiotic communication. When considering an “apple,” the concept of an “apple,”
is based on multi-modal information. As Barsalou (1999) argued, multi-modal perceptual information is
crucial for the basis formation of perceptual categories and learning a grounded language. Accordingly,
bottom-up patterns of sensory-motor multi-modal data were associated via the perceptual process, and
perceptual symbols, i.e., internal representations, were formed. Recently, it has been discovered that
self-supervised learning methods, such as contrastive learning and masked prediction, endow AIs with

(2021); Radford et al. (2021); Kwon et al. (2022); Nakamura et al. (2023a). However, even before the
emergence of self-supervised learning trends, the field of symbol emergence in robotics had already been
exploring multi-modal concept formation and representation learning, using real robots equipped with
multi-modal sensorimotor systems. In this context, we revisit these conventional studies.
Researchers studying symbol emergence in robotics aimed to create computational models and robotic
systems that performed multi-modal concept formation, including multi-modal categorization through
representation learning based on sensorimotor interactions with the environment, such as objects (Taniguchi
et al., 2016c, 2018b; Friston et al., 2021). Nakamura et al. developed an unsupervised multi-modal latent
Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) learning method that enabled a robot to perform perceptual categorization
in a bottom-up manner (Nakamura et al., 2009). MLDA is an extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA), which is a probabilistic generative model widely used in NLP for topic modeling (D.M. Blei and
Jordan, 2003), and is a constructive model of the perceptual symbol system. The MLDA system integrates
visual, auditory, and haptic information from a robot to form a variety of object categories without human
intervention 8. Thus far, various extensions of the model have been proposed. Nakamura et al. (2011b)
proposed a multi-modal hierarchical Dirichlet process (MHDP) that allowed a robot to determine the
number of categories. Ando et al. (2013) proposed a hierarchical model that enabled a robot to form
object categories with hierarchical structures. The weight of each modality is important for integrating
multi-modal information. For example, to form the concept of “yellow,” a color sense is important, whereas
haptic and auditory information are not necessary. A combination of MLDA and MHDP methods has been
proposed and demonstrated to be capable of searching for appropriate correspondences between categories
and modalities (Nakamura et al., 2011a, 2012). Nakamura et al. (2015) also proposed a non-parametric
Bayesian extension of these models. Studies on multi-modal categorization provided linguistic information
such as utterances to a robot as a type of multi-modal information (i.e., observations of a probabilistic
generative model (PGM)). After performing multi-modal categorization, the robot inferred through cross-
modal inferences that a word corresponded to information from other modalities, such as visual images.
Thus, multi-modal categorization is expected to facilitate grounded language learning (Nakamura et al.,
8 Essential software for controlling robots and their behaviors to obtain sensor information are programmed by human developers.
Frontiers 10
2011b, 2015). Similarly, spatial concept formation models have been proposed by extending the concept of
multi-modal object categorization 9. Recently, owing to the enormous progress in deep generative models,
PGMs that exploited the flexibility of deep neural networks achieved multi-modal object category formation
from raw sensory information (Suzuki et al., 2016). Thus, high and low-level internal representations (i.e.,
object and spatial categories and features, respectively) were formed in a bottom-up manner.
Computational models for multi-modal concept formation in symbol emergence in robotics are based
on the mathematical framework of PGM. PGM represents a generative process of observations using
multi-modal data and is trained to predict multi-modal information (i.e., model joint distribution). Figure 3
illustrates the PGM of MLDA and an overview of the experiment using a robot (Araki et al., 2012). Latent
variables of the PGM were inferred using Bayesian inference. The inference of p(zd|od, wd) corresponded
to the categorization. Thus, the system was trained to predict sensory information and automatically identify
categories. Researchers reported that PGM could realize internal representation learning using multi-modal
sensorimotor information. Furthermore, the inference of the posterior distribution could be obtained using
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as Gibbs sampling (Araki et al., 2012).
Based on the variational inference perspective, multi-modal categorization (i.e., internal representation
learning) and the accompanying optimization criteria are discussed.

where DKL represents the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Instead of the direct minimization of (1),
variational inference is obtained by minimizing the free energy DKL[q(z)||p(z, o, w)], suggesting a close
theoretical relationship between multi-modal concept formation and FEP.
3.2 Symbol Emergence Through Metropolis–Hastings naming games
To develop a constructive model of the entire SES, the challenge lies in mathematically modeling
the process by which a group of agents, while adapting to the environment and engaging in internal
representation learning, forms a common symbol system. Conversely, the agents create and share external
representations. In this section, we discuss an approach based on PGM, which characterizes the formation
of a symbol system in an SES from the perspective of the entire group as it engages in representation
learning. Furthermore, this perspective can be interpreted as viewing the emergence of symbols through
the lens of collective intelligence.
Previous studies on emergent communication employed various types of language games, including
referential games, as detailed in Section 5. The naming game is one such language game (Steels, 1995).
Hagiwara et al. (2019) offered theoretical insight into naming games and introduced the concept of
inter-personal categorization. In their naming game, each agent suggested a name for a target object and
communicated the relationship between the names (i.e., signs) and their corresponding classes or attributes.
The naming game was inspired from the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm (Hastings, 1970), a variant
of the MCMC algorithm. Subsequently, Taniguchi et al. (2023b) expanded the naming game by dubbing it
the MH naming game.
9 Taniguchi et al. (2017a) proposed spatial concept acquisition and simultaneous localization and mapping (SpCoSLAM) for spatial concept formation.
SpCoSLAM integrated visual, positional, and (auditory) linguistic information to form a map, located the position of the robot, identified clusters of positions,
and discovered words in a bottom-up manner. Although the detailed features of PGM differed from that of MLDA, SpCoSLAM could be regarded as a variant of
a multi-modal categorization model. Additionally, SpCoSLAM was trained to predict observations and infer latent variables (i.e., spatial concepts) via Bayesian
inference. These studies were related to semantic map formation in robotics (Kostavelis and Gasteratos, 2015; Garg et al., 2020).

Figure 5. Metropolis–Hastings naming game (Taniguchi et al., 2023b). By presuming joint attention, the
naming game, which does not require explicit feedback, operates as a distributed Bayesian inference of
latent variables representing shared external representations.
In the MH algorithm, a new sample of the latent variablez was drawn as z∗ from the proposed distribution
q(z|zτ ) at step τ, where zτ denotes the current state. If the sample z⋆ was accepted with probability

, the samples converged to the targeted distribution p(z). The
theoretical relationship between the derived naming game and the MCMC algorithm rendered symbol
emergence in the game straightforward. The symbol system emerged as the posterior distribution of the
latent variable z shared by the agents, conditional on all of their observations. An overview of the MH
naming game and its derivation has been discussed, because it forms the basis of the CPC hypothesis. The
MH naming game was derived as:
First, the PGM shown in Figure 4 (left) was considered. The PGM represented a hierarchical Bayesian
model that integrated multiple types of sensory information. Two types of sensory observation, oA
d and
oB
d , were assumed from the two types of sensors for the dth object. The low-level latent variables zA
d
Frontiers 12
and zB
d corresponded to oA
d and oB
d , respectively. The high-level discrete latent variablew integrated two
latent variables, zA
d and zB
d , which represented two bits of different sensory information. The total PGM
was a simplified version of MLDA (Nakamura et al., 2009), which is a generative model for multi-modal
categorization. In the graphical model shown in Figure 4, the two types of sensors were considered
two different modalities of multi-modal categorization: auditory and haptic. Assuming that PGM to be
a cognitive model of a single agent with two modalities, A and B, the Bayesian inference of wd (e.g.,
Gibbs sampling, which is a widely used MCMC inference algorithm (Bishop, 2006)) was determined
by multi-modal categorization. Thereafter, the internal representation of object k was formed through
Bayesian inference to predict multi-modal sensory information.
Second, PGM was decomposed into two parts corresponding to sensors A and B, as shown on the
right side of Figure 4. Although the two elemental PGMs shared a latent variable wd, the variables in
one elemental PGM were conditionally independent of those in the other. Therefore, when the latent
variable wd or its probabilistic distribution was provided, the other variables were inferred independently
from another elemental PGM by using Gibbs sampling (Bishop, 2006). Only the shared variable wd was
updated depending on the internal parameters of the two PGMs. By exchanging information regarding the
probability distribution of wd between two modules, wd was updated. This algorithm represented as an
example of the SERKET implementation: a framework for decomposing a large-scale PGM into multiple
elemental PGMs (Nakamura et al., 2018; Taniguchi et al., 2020b). Currently, total PGM is an agent model
for multi-modal internal representation learning.
Third, the two PGMs were reconsidered as models of two different agents, where wd represented
an external sign. Here, oX
d and zX
d , with X ∈ {A, B}, were regarded as the observation and internal
representations of agent X, respectively. From a generative perspective, PGM indicated wd as a prior
information shared by the internal representation of each agent. Thus, metaphorically, language constraints
governed the thoughts of each agent in a probabilistic manner and the latent variable was shared among
the society members. Inferring the latent variables without referring to the internal variables of another
agent remained unclear. When the two elemental modules were considered the cognitive components of
an agent, any information found in both PGMs was theoretically available for the inference procedure.
Therefore, to update wd, the probabilistic distribution over wd calculated using each module was directly
utilized. However, when two elemental modules were regarded as different agents, the internal information
of each agent could not be used simultaneously because each was a self-enclosed system, which served as
a fundamental constraint in semiotic or symbolic communication.
Surprisingly, an MCMC algorithm for sampling wd without referring to the internal variables of another
agent could be derived as a naming game. Sample wd, based on the inferred latent variables (i.e., learned
parameters) of agent X, was regarded as an utterance of the name of the object agent X interacting with
(X, Y) ∈ {(A, B), (B, A) }. The signal was received by another agent Y , who judged whether the name
wd was appropriate for the object by considering the latent variables (i.e., internal representations zY
d and
learned parameters θY and ϕY ) of agent Y in a probabilistic manner. If the uttered name was acceptable by
agent Y , the internal parameters of Y were updated based on the accepted namewd. Otherwise, the name
wd was discarded. When Metropolis choice was adopted as the acceptance ratio, the total naming game
was theoretically the same as that of the MH algorithm. Generally, during the naming game, wd, which
was highly probable considering the observations and learned knowledge of agent Y , was accepted with
high probability. The overall process was a natural computational model for naming games, in terms of
language evolution and symbol emergence.
Frontiers 13
Importantly, from a generative perspective, the total PGM remained an integrative model that combined
all the variables of the two different agents. Therefore, the MH naming game worked as an MCMC
algorithm (considering strict mathematics), and signs such as words were guaranteed to be sampled from
the posterior distribution conditioned on those inputs as the sensory information of the agents, p(w|oA, oB).
Thus, MH naming games could integrate the sensory information of different agents and infer a word as the
category of an object similar to that by multi-modal categorization methods used to infer object categories
in a bottom-up manner as a Bayesian inference. Further additional algorithmic details are provided by
(Hagiwara et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2023b).
Hagiwara et al. (2019) were the first to provide a mathematical basis for bridging symbol emergence
involving inter-personal sign sharing and perceptual category formation based on PGMs. The proposed
MH naming game guaranteed improved predictability by the SES throughout the multi-agent system (i.e.,
the SES).
Considering variational inference, the sampling process corresponded to free-energy minimization, and
the optimization criterion was described as:
q∗({zk}k, w) = argmin
q({zk}k,w)
DKL[q({zk}k, w)||p({zk}k, w|{ok}k)] (2)
where variational inference was obtained by minimizing the free energyDKL[q({zk}k, w)||p({zk}k, {ok}k, w)],
suggesting a close theoretical relationship between multi-modal concept formation and FEP. The
aforementioned process was regarded as a PC that uses the total multi-agent system. Thus, symbol
emergence corresponded to free-energy minimization throughout the multi-agent system. These findings
lead us to propose the CPC hypothesis.
4 CPC HYPOTHESIS
4.1 PC, FEP, and World Models
PC is a broadly accepted theory in several disciplines including neuroscience, which posits that the human
brain constantly predicts sensory information and updates its mental, world, or internal models to enhance
predictability (Hohwy, 2013). During this process, the brain generates predictions of sensory inputs,
compares them with actual inputs, and uses the prediction errors to revise the mental model (Figure 6).
Furthermore, the aforementioned approach suggests that the brain learns to forecast sensory information
and formulates behavioral decisions based on its predictions. A more generalized concept related to such
an approach is FEP (Parr et al., 2022), which is associated with the idea of the Bayesian brain proposed
by Doya et al. (2007).
From a statistical perspective, prediction errors are naturally interpreted as negative log-likelihoods. For
example, least-squares errors are regarded as the negative log-likelihood of normal distributions, ignoring
the effects of variance parameters. Hence, minimizing the prediction errors corresponds to maximizing the
marginal likelihood, which is a general criterion for training PGMs using the Bayesian approach. In PGMs,
latent variables are usually inferred by model joint distributions over observations (i.e., sensory information).
Thus, a PGM-based approach usually falls under the umbrella of PC. Considering variational inference,
the inference of latent variables z corresponds to the minimization of the free energy DKL[q(z)||p(z, o)],
where o denotes observations. The FEP proposed by Friston was a generalization of PC (Friston, 2019),
which is a general and powerful concept.
Frontiers 14
Figure 6. Overview of Predictive Coding. Each agent (human) predicts and encodes the environmental
information through interactions using sensorimotor systems. Through the interactions, the agent forms
internal models and infers states.
The FEP explains animal perception and behavior from the perspective of minimizing free energy. The
perceptual state or future actions of animals are defined as latent variables of a cognitive system that
continuously interacts with the environment. Free energy emerges when variational inferences of these
latent variables are performed. From the perspective of variational inference, the aforementioned PC
approximates p(x|o) by minimizing the free energy using an approximate posterior distribution q(x). This
represents the crux of the FEP.
In contrast, world models are representation-learning models that include action outputs(Ha and
Schmidhuber, 2018; Friston et al., 2021). An agent is an entity that acts in the world and learns the
representation of the world in relation to its actions and understanding of events. Most research on V AEs
often considers only sensory information as somewhat static and neglects the temporal dynamics and
actions of the agent. World models, rooted in the umwelt of an agent, present the internal representation
learning of the agent as it operates within a cognitive world bounded by its sensory-motor information. The
relationship between world models and PC or FEP is discussed in detail by Friston et al. (2021); Taniguchi
et al. (2023a).
For simplicity, the dynamics in the temporal direction is temporarily ignored (or concatenated into a
vector representing a sequence) and the PC of the sensory information is focused. However, arguments
that temporal dynamics are essential in contexts such as active inference do exist. Therefore, such
extensions were incorporated later by including actions and considering temporal dynamics. For the
sensory information o, assuming an internal representation x, the prediction was presented p(o|x). This
recognition was expressed as p(x|o) = p(x|o)p(x). The former, p(o|x), represented the generative model,
while the latter was referred to as p(x|o) Taniguchi et al. (2023a). The idea behind PC was to recognize the
world by predicting sensory information o using the internally predicted internal representation x and to
adapt the internal state for predictions.
Notably, thus far, concepts of PC and world models have been utilized primarily to explain and model
single-brain cognition and learning capabilities. In contrast, the FEP offers a broader spectrum for
explaining the self-organization of cognitive and biological systems (Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Friston,
2013; Constant et al., 2018). However, the relationship between FEP and SES has not been thoroughly
described.

game via inter-personal categorization (Hagiwara et al., 2019) is an example of this approach. Thus, wd is
inferred to be a representation of the dth object in a collective manner.
4.2 CPC
CPC extends the idea of a PC from a single brain to multiple brain regions. In neuroscience, the subject of
a PC is a single agent (i.e., the brain of a person). With the emergence of symbolic communication, society
has become the subject of PC via symbol emergence. A mental model in the brain corresponds to language
(a symbol system) that emerges in society (Figure 1). Decentralized physical interactions and semiotic
communications comprise CPC. The sensory–motor information observed by every agent participating
in the system is encoded into an emergent symbol system, such as language, which is shared among the
agents.
A PGM (Figure 7) was conceptually obtained as an extension of the PGM for interpersonal categorization
(Figure 4). Generally, in contrast to representation learning, which is performed by individual agents to
form efficient sensory-motor system internal representations for mental model formation, the generative
model for symbol emergence frames the process in terms of society (i.e., a multi-agent system) to form a
symbol system such as language, representing the sensory-motor information obtained by all agents. In the
CPC hypothesis, the emergence of a symbolic system was considered as the social representation learning.
Moreover, multi-modal representation learning by the brain was mathematically and structurally equivalent
to the multi-agent categorization or social representation learning using the SES.
The computational model for CPC was obtained by extending the PGM to interpersonal categorization10.
Similar to the interpersonal categorization process, we first defined the total PGM by integrating multiple
elemental modules. Each elemental PGM was assumed to involve latent variables zk
d, and observations ok

corresponding to the k-th agent. If a super system capable of observing the internal variables of every agent

inference procedures are not specified. By specifying these, a variety of concrete models of CPC (i.e., symbol emergence) can be obtained.
Frontiers 16
existed, a general inference procedure, such as Gibbs sampling or variational inference (Bishop, 2006),
could be used to estimate the shared representation wd. However, no such super system exists.
Nonetheless, if humans could engage in a language game that allowed inference wd in a decentralized
manner, similar to the MH naming game, then a symbol system, such as language, could emerge to integrate
the distributed sensorimotor information gathered by individual agents. Thus, a symbolic system arises
when agents collaboratively engage in PC.
4.3 CPC Hypothesis
For the first time, CPC offers a framework that can theoretically and comprehensively capture the entire
picture of a symbolic emergence system. By capturing the dynamics of both cognition and society, CPC
can holistically explain the dynamics by which language emerges in human society. This depiction provides
new hypotheses on the functions imparted by emergent languages. One such hypothesis suggests “Is
language/symbol formed to collectively predict our experiences of the world through our sensory-motor
system?” The foundation for the dynamics through which language emerges in human society is proposed
in this study as the CPC Hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1. Collective Predictive Coding Hypothesis
Human language is formed through CPC.
The CPC hypothesis has the following sub-components:
1.Symbol emergence is perceived as social representation learning, which is a form of distributed Bayesian
inference. This distributed Bayesian inference is embodied through the autonomous decisions made by
each agent to reject or adopt a sign referring to their respective beliefs.
2.Language collectively encodes information about the world as observed by numerous agents through
their sensory-motor systems. This implies that distributional semantics encode structural information
about the world, and LLMs can acquire world knowledge by modeling large-scale language corpora.
From the perspective of language evolution, the question, “On what cognitive functions did
human language evolve?” was analyzed. The CPC hypothesis offers a new explanation for
environmental adaptation. Since CPC provides the perspective of environmental adaptation as collective
intelligence (Surowiecki, 2004), an extension of PC, more general explanatory principles such as FEP
were connected and a one-step extension from PC and the FEP, transitioning from “a system that merely
adapts to the environment based on the sensory-motor system” to “a system that forms symbol systems to
adapt to the environment based on the sensory-motor system together with others as a society,” was further
demanded.
The key concept of the CPC hypothesis is the possibility of decomposing the inference process of an
integrative PGM and its structural similarity to the multi-modal concept formation. The decomposed PGMs
are shown in Figure. 7. The interpersonal categorization model presented an example of a decomposition,
wherein the number of agents was K = 2. Hagiwara et al. (2019) suggested a naming game that performed
decentralized inference of the shared (emergent) symbol system. Similarly, the process of symbol emergence
was regarded as a decentralized inference process involving sharing between multiple agents. Inukai et al.
(2023) introduced a recursive MH naming game, which theoretically enabled multiple agents, more than
Frontiers 17
two, to undertake symbol emergence similarly to the MH naming game described by Hagiwara et al.
(2019).
The CPC hypothesis has the following implications for the origins of symbolic communication. If humans
evolutionarily obtain the capability of internal representation formation, which involves categorization
and concept formation, by using multi-modal sensorimotor information and judging the believability of
utterances of others based on appropriate probabilities calculated using their own beliefs, they can share
signs and optimize the shared external representation system to predict the observations of all agents
belonging to the SES. This system is referred to as the emergent symbol system illustrated in Figure 2.
Thus, the CPC hypothesis suggests that the ability to determine whether humans believe the statements of
other agents based on their own beliefs is crucial for symbol emergence.
4.4 Society-Wide FEP
Considering Figure 7 a deep generative model, CPC was regarded as representation learning involving
multi-agent multi-modal observations. Nevertheless, the agents conducted representation learning, in which
representations were not only organized inside the brain but also formed as a symbol system at the societal
level. Thus, symbol emergence was termed as social representation learning.
Since PC could be paraphrased as FEP in many contexts, CPC was viewed from the perspective of FEP.
The inference of the latent variables (i.e., representations) was formulated using free-energy minimization
considering variational inference. FEP is a general notion of PC and an influential idea in neuroscience as
scholars frequently mention that the human brain performs free-energy minimization. Beyond individual
FEP, the CPC hypothesis suggests that human society performs free-energy minimization at the societal
level by creating symbolic systems. This speculation suggested that symbol emergence was driven by
society-wide FEP. Notably, MH naming games based on MCMC algorithm and specific language games
that performed variational inference of free-energy minimization have not been invented. However, if
decentralized Bayesian inference was viewed from the perspective of variational inference, it would present
a society-wide free-energy minimization. This approach clearly provided a theoretical connection between
symbol emergence and FEP.
In terms of FEP, the CPC hypothesis suggests that the symbol system emerges by inferring internal
representations and shared symbols p(z, w|o) in a decentralized manner considering variational inference.
The CPC hypothesis posits that the formation of a symbolic system is the product of collective human
intelligence, which is rooted in the capabilities of each agent who allows its engagement in multi-modal
representation learning and individually rejects inputs or signs from other agents. Consequently, an
emergent symbol system is collectively structured as a system-level (or society-level) representation.
The FEP is not only concerned with the activities of individual brains but is also applicable to collective
behaviors and the cooperation of multiple agents. Researchers such as Kaufmann et al. (2021); Levchuk
et al. (2019); Maisto et al. (2022) have explored frameworks for realizing collective intelligence and
multi-agent collaboration within the context of FEP and active inference. However, the theorization of
language emergence based on FEP has not yet been accomplished. Furthermore, CPC represents the first
attempt to extend the concepts of PC and FEP by making language itself the subject of PC. Regarding
the relationship between language and FEP, Kastel et al. (2022) provides a testable deep active inference
formulation of social behavior and accompanying simulations of cumulative culture. However, even this
approach does not fully embrace the CPC perspective, where language performs external representation
learning utilizing multi-agent sensorimotor systems.
Frontiers 18
From the viewpoint of FEP, the CPC hypothesis argues that symbol emergence is a phenomenon of
free-energy minimization throughout a multi-agent system. In addition, the interpersonal categorization by
Hagiwara et al. (2019) suggests the possibility of decentralized minimization of the free energy for symbol
emergence. This hypothesis provides direction for future computational studies on symbol emergence,
communication, and collaboration between computational studies in language evolution and neuroscience.
Additionally, understanding linguistic communication from the viewpoint of CPC enables us to incorporate
ideas related to FEP, especially active inference, into language understanding and speech acts, thereby
expanding the scope of FEP.
4.5 LLM as collective intelligence
Why do LLMs seem to know so much about the “world”? Many studies have suggested that LLMs
behave as if they have grounded language (Gurnee and Tegmark, 2023; Kawakita et al., 2023; Loyola et al.,
2023) as we briefly described in Section 1. The reason why LLMs are so knowledgeable about our world
has not been fully understood (Mahowald et al., 2023). The perspectives offered by the CPC hypothesis
give us new speculative thoughts on this question. The CPC hypothesis explains how the language acquired
by LLMs is grounded.
In the concept of collective predictive coding, symbol/language emergence is thought to occur through
distributed Bayesian inference of latent variables, which are common nodes connecting numerous agents.
This Bayesian inference can be performed in a distributed manner without necessarily connecting brains,
as exemplified by certain types of language games such as MHNG. Unlike conventional discriminative
language games for emergent communication, emergent communication based on generative models (e.g.,
Ueda and Taniguchi (2023); Taniguchi et al. (2023b)) is consistent with the view of CPC. Thus, even without
connected brains, the observations of multiple agents are embedded in a language W. Each utterance
wd ∈ W is sampled from this shared node. Conversely, the prior distribution P(w) over the collection can
be considered a language model. As a result, language corpora have distributional semantics (Harris, 1954).
In more computational terms, if representational learning for the i-th agent involves inferring an internal
representation p(zi|xi) for the observation xi, then symbol emergence for a group involves inferring a
collective symbol/language (i.e., external representation) p(w|{xi}i) for the observations {xi}i. In the
context of variational inference, maximizing ELBO with respect to w corresponds to minimizing the free
energy for all agent observations {xi}i in a group performing symbol emergence, i.e., SES.
Integrating the information in sensorimotor observations of multiple agents’ Umwelts, i.e., self-centered
worlds, and forming representations that predict the sensorimotor observations requires more than
categorical representations; more complex information representations are needed. Therefore, it is suggested
that language adopts compositionality based on syntax. In the conventional work using MHNG, the common
node w in Figure 7 has been considered a discrete categorical variable. However,w can be many types of
variables, including compositional discrete sequences of variable length, typically found in natural language.
In such a case, W becomes a space of (external) representations that model sensorimotor information
observed by all agents in the SES.
CPC provides a worldview in which language integrates our internal representations formed through
our embodied experiences, corresponding to world models Ha and Schmidhuber (2018); Friston et al.
(2021); Taniguchi et al. (2023a), and represents this information as a series or set of sequences. If this is
true, then predictive learning of these collections of sequences indirectly models the world experiences
we obtain through our human sensorimotor systems. In other words, the latent structure embedded in
large-scale language corpora as distributional semantics, which can be learned through language modeling,
Frontiers 19
represents the latent structure of the world. This is because the language system has emerged to represent
or predict the world as experienced by distributed human sensorimotor systems. This may explain why
LLMs seem to know so much about the ’world’, where ’world’ means something like ’the integration of
our environments’.
LLMs are recently considered candidates for the creation of artificial general intelligence, and there are
also studies on the creation of autonomous agents based on LLMs. This leads to a growing perspective that
treats LLMs as corresponding to individual humans. However, from the point of view of CPC, it seems
more accurate to consider LLMs as a model of collective intelligence, which is collectively comprised
of a large number of people’s cognitive systems performing PC, rather than as a model of an individual
cognitive system performing PC. Therefore, the CPC hypothesis leads us to the understanding that LLMs
potentially have the ability to encode more structural information about the world and make inferences
based on it than any humans.
Recently, LLMs have been considered as candidates for creating artificial general intelligence, and there
are also studies focusing on the development of autonomous agents based on LLMs. This has led to a
growing perspective that treats LLMs as analogous to individual humans. However, from the viewpoint of
CPC, it seems more accurate to consider LLMs as models of collective intelligence, which is comprised of
the cognitive systems of a large number of people performing PC, rather than as models of an individual
cognitive system engaging in PC. Therefore, the CPC hypothesis suggests that LLMs potentially possess
the capability to encode more structural information about the world and make inferences based on it than
any single human can.
5 RELATED WORKS
This section presents an overview of previous studies on the emergence of symbol systems and language,
and examines their relationship with the CPC hypothesis.
5.1 Emergent Communication
Steels et al. proposed a variety of computational models for language emergence using categorizations
based on sensory experiences (Steels, 2015). In their formulation, several types of language games
were introduced and experiments using simulation agents and embodied robots were conducted. In a
computational experiment conducted in a simulated environment, a group of agents created ways to
identify each other using vocabulary-related spatial concepts (Steels, 1995). Steels and Belpaeme (2005)
proposed a variety of models to examine mechanisms through which a population of autonomous agents
could arrive at a repertoire of perceptually grounded categories. In real-world environments, Steels et al.
conducted the “Talking Heads” experiment, where each agent grounded a lexicon to a concept based on
visual information to develop a method of communication among agents (Steels, 2015). These experiments
showed that language games allowed agents to share lexicons and meanings of simple objects, such
as red circles and blue rectangles. Several studies extended the concept of the Talk-Heads experiment.
Mobile robots (e.g., AIBO), which have numerous modalities and behavioral capabilities, were used in
experiments to learn words and meanings of simple objects and spatial concepts (Steels and Kaplan, 2000;
Steels and Loetzsch, 2008). Spranger et al. studied the evolution of grounded spatial languages within a
language-game framework (Spranger, 2011, 2015). They implemented a perceptual system for the Sony
humanoid robots (Spranger et al., 2012). This study was extended by V ogt et al. from the perspective of
semantical and grammatical complexity (V ogt, 2002, 2005; De Beule et al., 2006; Bleys, 2015; Matuszek,
Frontiers 20
2018). Furthermore, a model for the evolution and induction of compositional structures in a simulation
environment was reported (V ogt, 2005).
Since 2016, the advancement of deep learning, particularly its capability for representation learning,
has invigorated research on emergent communications based on machine learning Foerster et al. (2016b);
Lazaridou et al. (2017a); Lazaridou and Baroni (2020). Trends followed until 2020 were discussed in
detail by Lazaridou and Baroni (2020). The group led by Lazaridou and Baroni achieved significant results.
Constructive models, such as signaling and reference games, were frequently employed to encourage the
emergence of language Lazaridou et al. (2017b); Havrylov and Titov (2017). Primary research focused on
the formation of languages with compositional structures were conducted in which simple representations
(such as words) were combined to form complex sentences.
In the same way as the CPC extends the idea of generative model-based emergent communication in the
joint-attention naming game (Okumura et al., 2023) to population level, models of emergent communication
based on Lewis-style signaling games have been extended to populations (Chaabouni et al., 2021). It has
been revealed in populated signaling games that larger communities tend to develop more systematic and
structured languages (Michel et al., 2022). Moreover, Rita et al. (2021) introduced the idea of partitioning,
which separates agents into sender-receiver pairs and limits co-adaptation across pairs, demonstrating that
such structure leads to the emergence of more compositional language.
One issue involved the reliance on reinforcement learning (RL)-like feedback principles based on
“success/failure of communication.” In Shannon’s information theory, understanding the symbol system
was confined to forming a communication channel Shannon (1948), either between two parties or among
multiple parties. However, their perspective did not adequately capture the emerging characteristics
of symbols in social systems. The communication model foundation relied heavily on the Shannon–
Weaver type, where the success or failure of communication served as feedback, rewriting the codebook
(relationship between the sign and object) of the speaker or listener. Such a view of language acquisition
was criticized by researchers such as Tomasello, who stated that the approach was not a valid metaphor
for explaining child language development Tomasello (2005). Before experiencing vocabulary explosion,
human infants engage in joint attention. Csibra and Gergely (2009) highlighted that children pre-suppose
the intention that parents are trying to teach them when integrating instructions from parents into their
learning. Rather than being post-communicative as in reference games, shared attention and teaching
intentions were foundational in language development.
From a computational perspective, most studies of emergent communication employed discriminative
models to represent semiotic communication. The receiver was required to distinguish between the targeted
objects. Contrarily, the CPC hypothesis is based on generative models. The objective of symbol emergence
was not merely the “success of communication,” but rather “organizing a symbol system to better predict
or understand the world.” This distinction was significant from a philosophical perspective.
5.2 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
The MARL framework was used to model the emergence of symbolic communication. In MARL-based
studies of symbolic emergence communication, agents were allowed to output signals as a particular type
of action, whereas other agents were allowed to use them as additional sensory information. Such an
approach had a long history of application. However, after the introduction of deep RL, RL systems could
easily use emergent signals to solve RL problems, benefiting from representation learning (i.e., feature
extraction), which is a capability of neural networks.
Frontiers 21
From the perspective of environmental adaptation, communication fundamentally alters the behavior of
others using signs emitted by oneself and changes one’s own behavior based on signs received from others,
thereby realizing adaptive behaviors for the group as a whole. This concept was modeled using MARL,
which included emergent communication. With recent advancements in deep RL, flexibly interpreting the
meaning of signals issued in communication using the representational capability of deep learning has been
possible Bus ¸oniu et al. (2010).
Research on symbol emergence using deep-learning-based MARL, such as differentiable inter-agent
learning (DIAL) (Foerster et al., 2016a) and CommNet (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016), has gained momentum
since the mid-2010s. Several methods have been proposed, including multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient(MADDPG), an extension of the deep reinforcement learning method known as deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2017). These studies were focused on the
formation of efficient communication channels for collaboration (Kilinc and Montana, 2018; Jiang and Lu,
2018; Kim et al., 2019; Iqbal and Sha, 2019; Kim et al., 2021). Often, the success of communication in a
given MARL task is evaluated by the achieved performance, specifically the amount of reward obtained,
with less attention paid to the structure of the emergent language.
When viewed as a model of language emergence, research on symbol emergence based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning produced languages that were task dependent. Thus, such issues require attention
when considering language emergence.
A theoretical connection exists between the MARL and PGM-based approaches (i.e., PC). Within the past
decade, the concept of control as a probabilistic inference (CaI) has gained significant attention (Levine,
2018). CaI allowed for the reformulation of RL as a probabilistic modeling of Bayesian inference.
Considering the reward function as an energy function of the probability distribution of optimality ¯ot:
p (¯ot = 1 | st, at) = exp (r (st, at)), made optimal action selection (i.e., policy search) equivalent to the
Bayesian inference of future actions:p(at|st, ¯o1:T ). Several model-based RL methods have been interpreted
as variational inferences of a future trajectory p(τ|¯o1:T ), where τ = (st+1,T , at,T ) (Okada and Taniguchi,
2020) .
Here, we considered partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) settings, which are more
general settings in RL where the state st is estimated from observations o1:t. In RL, we were interested
in a latent state sequence s = s1:T , a future action sequence a = at,T , and observations up to the present
o = o1:t, assuming a sequence of optimalities¯o = ¯o1:T . Thus, we demonstrated that RL could be considered
as a PC and Bayesian inference of latent variables, that is, states and a future action sequence, respectively.
By introducing CaI into MARL, emergent communication was formulated in terms of PGM-based modeling
(i.e., the context of PC performed by multi-agent systems).
Thus, the aforementioned interpretation paved the way for extending MARL from a CPC viewpoint. For
simplicity, we included optimality ¯o as part of the observations o. Emergent communication in RL was
suggested to be interpreted as a probabilistic inference of the shared variable w, that is, p(w|{ok}k). From
this perspective, emitting a message wk
t corresponded to sampling a message from the posterior distribution
p(w|{ok}k). From the viewpoint of variational inference, emergent communication (i.e., symbol emergence
in MARL) estimated the approximate distribution q(w) for the prior distribution p(w|{ok}k) as
q∗({zk}k, w) = argmin
q({zk}k,w)
DKL[q({zk}k, w)||p({zk}kz, w|{ok}k))] (3)
Frontiers 22
Optimization was performed by minimizing the free energy DKL[q(z, w)||p(z, w, o′)]. Thus, a multi-agent
system-wide free-energy minimization was interpreted. For example, Nakamura et al. (2023b) extended
the MH naming game and proposed a probabilistic emergent communication model for MARL.
5.3 Iterated Learning Models
The iterated learning model (ILM) emulates the process of language inheritance across generations and
seeks to explain how compositionality in human languages emerges through cultural evolution (Kirby,
2001). The ILM has been validated using agent-based simulations (Kirby, 2001, 2002; Kirby et al., 2015),
mathematical models (Brighton, 2002; Griffiths and Kalish, 2007; Kirby et al., 2007), and laboratory-
based language evolution experiments (Kirby et al., 2008; Scott-Phillips and Kirby, 2010; Kirby et al.,
2015). ILM models the social transmission of knowledge from parent to child generations. Specifically,
the process through which the language and cultural knowledge of one generation is passed on to
the next is modeled, allowing a compositional study on how language and culture evolve over time.
While research on emergent communication, multi-agent RL, and symbol emergence robotics has often
focused on the learning capabilities of individual agents, ILM adopts a more holistic view by examining
the transmission of language and culture through society. Thus, an approach akin to complex system
simulation research is offered, providing a compositional understanding by observing phenomena that arise
through interactions among groups of agents. The theoretical significance of ILM suggests that the unique
compositional language of humans can be reduced to a learning ability that does not pre-suppose linguistic
compositionality but is based on specific linguistic functions. However, ILM does not address how the
resulting languages represent and segment the world, especially in terms of continuous, multi-modal
perceptual information such as images and sounds, and how they contribute to the environmental adaptation
of agents.
Unlike CPC, ILM does not concentrate on representation learning but places more emphasis on the social
transition of linguistic knowledge between generations. Incorporating intergenerational communication
into CPC is a direction for future research. Theoretically, the integration is feasible. If realized, CPC can be
emphasized as a comprehensive framework that captures the dynamics modeled by the ILM. However,
forging a concrete connection between the CPC and ILM remains a challenge.
5.4 Symbol Emergence in Robotics
Symbol emergence in robotics is a constructive approach for SESs (Taniguchi et al., 2016c). Central
to these discussions is the question of how robots equipped with sensory-motor systems (embodiment)
segment (differentiate) the world, form concepts based on subjective experiences, acquire language, and
realize symbol emergence.
As introduced in Section 3, models have been proposed for the formation of orients/concepts based on
multi-modal information. Such methods focused on the formation of internal representations based on
multi-modal information. An environment even without a pre-existing symbol system can exist. Therefore,
numerous studies have integrated multi-modal information such as visual, auditory, and tactile data to form
the concepts of objects and locations (Nakamura et al., 2009, 2011a, 2015; Taniguchi et al., 2017b, 2020a).
Symbolic communication involves exchanging arbitrary signs. SESs require agents to segment continuous
vocal sounds into words as clusters of arbitrary symbols for language acquisition. Furthermore, research on
automatically discovering word units and acquiring vocabulary by obtaining unsegmented sound sequences,
together with multi-modal information related to objects and places, has been conducted (Nakamura
et al., 2014; Taniguchi et al., 2018a). Although word units can be discovered from character strings using
Frontiers 23
unsupervised learning (Mochihashi et al., 2009; Goldwater et al., 2009), such approaches have been
extended to consider speech input as an observation. PGMs and inference methods have been proposed to
analyze the two-layer structure (dual segmentation structure) unique to a language, consisting of phonemes
and words, and simultaneously estimate phonemes and words through unsupervised learning (Taniguchi
et al., 2015, 2016d).
Existing studies demonstrated that PGM-based approach could achieve word discovery and lexical
acquisition from continuous perceptual sensory information. Thus, the concept of PC could explain the
learning process of signs. However, such studies did not consider the emergence of signs (i.e., bottom-up
formation). Each robot learned phonemes and words assuming that the system of signs was fixed. Hence,
the lists and distributional properties of phonemes and words were fixed. Therefore, these studies were
insufficient for modeling the emergence of symbolic communication.
However, discussions on symbol emergence in robotics that evolved throughout the 2010s primarily
focused on multi-modal concept formation and language acquisition by individual robots. They were
unable to address the emergence of symbols (languages) in society. Following the discussion in Sections 3
and 4, CPC could be extended to the frontiers of symbol emergence in robotics (Taniguchi, 2023).
6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This study proposes the CPC hypothesis. First, the SES was revisited, providing an integrative view
that encompasses both individual internal representation learning and the emergence of symbols, i.e.,
external representations, for communication. This serves as preliminary knowledge to clarify the complete
phenomenon of symbol emergence. Second, multi-modal concept formation based on (probabilistic)
generative models was revisited, and a generative emergent communication model, symbol emergence
through MHNG, was explained as an extension of internal representation learning, called interpersonal
categorization. Third, by extending the idea of interpersonal categorization, we propose the CPC hypothesis,
which posits that symbol emergence in a multi-agent system can be regarded as decentralized Bayesian
inference through language games. This can be considered social representation learning, as well. This is
computationally analogous to the representation learning of multi-modal sensory information conducted by
an individual agent, with social representation learning performed through CPC in the same manner as by
individual PC. The connection to FEP and LLMs was also discussed. Fourth, four branches of research
related to computational models for symbol emergence are introduced: multi-modal categorization and
representation learning, word discovery and lexical acquisition, language-game-based approaches, and
MARL-based approaches.
The advantage of the CPC hypothesis is its generality in integrating preexisting studies related to symbol
emergence into a single principle, as described in Section 5. In addition, the CPC hypothesis provides a
theoretical connection between the theories of human cognition and neuroscience in terms of PC and FEP.
The limitations of the CPC hypothesis are as follows. Although CPC has new implications in terms of
the origin of human symbolic communication, including language, the CPC hypothesis does not explain
why symbolic communication emerged only in humans and not in other living species. However, certain
types of symbolic communication have also been observed in other living species (Rendall et al., 2009).
The symbol emergence described in this paper is not argued to be strictly limited to humans. Considering
that language and symbolic communication are multi-faceted phenomena, some types of the CPC may be
found in other living species.
Frontiers 24
The CPC hypothesis focuses primarily on the semantic aspects of the SESs. Language, the most
popular symbolic human system, is multi-faceted. Furthermore, the emergence of speech codes, such as
phonological systems, is an important topic in the study of SESs. This study focuses on the emergence of
the semantic aspects of symbol systems. However, the emergence of phonological systems is not discussed,
although word discovery is mentioned in relation to speech signals in Section 3.2, from the viewpoint of PC
by a single agent. Computational models for the self-organization of speech codes in multi-agent systems
have also been studied for more than a decade (Oudeyer, 2005). In particular, the work by Moulin-Frier et al.
(2015) proposed a Bayesian framework for speech communication and the emergence of a phonological
system, termed COSMO (Communicating about Objects using Sensory–Motor Operations). Integrating this
concept into the CPC framework may provide a possible path for creating a more general computational
model for SESs. We believe that the CPC framework possesses the generality to accommodate such
discussions.
Therefore, testing the CPC hypothesis is important. Tests may involve at least two computational and
cognitive approaches. Computational models can be developed to enable AIs and robots to perform symbol
emergence in a variety of tasks to test the feasibility of the CPC hypothesis in a constructive manner.
Psychological experiments can also be conducted to determine whether humans actually perform the
learning processes assumed in the CPC hypothesis. Particularly, Hagiwara et al. (2019) assumed that agents
decide whether to accept or reject another agent’s utterance using a certain probability calculated based
on their individual beliefs. The extent to which individuals act according to these assumptions must be
validated. Okumura et al. (2023) conducted initial studies on the aforementioned topic and reported that
human participants adhered to the acceptance probability suggested by the theory of the MH naming game
to a certain extent. In addition, the extent to which the free energy of wd in Figure 7 can be minimized
must be tested.
Understanding the dynamics of SESs that realize daily semiotic communications will contribute to
understanding the origins of semiotic and linguistic communications. To enable robots to participate in
daily human communication in the long term, the fundamental capability that enables humans to organize
emergent symbol systems in a decentralized manner without a designer or centralized mechanism to create
a language should be clarified. The CPC hypothesis, including the computational approach that decomposes
the CPC into a decentralized individual representation of learning and communication, can be adapted
to provide a general and promising direction for illuminating the mystery of the emergence of symbolic
communications and language.
