Objective: According to recent empirical taxonomies (eg, the Hier-
archical Taxonomy of Psychopathology), somatic symptom distress
represents a transdiagnostically relevant dimension of psychopathol-
ogy. To better understand the mechanisms, somatic symptoms can be
experimentally provoked by inducing negative affect (in the Affect
and Symptom Paradigm, ASP, formerly known as the Affective
Picture Paradigm). Potential moderators of this relation include car-
diorespiratory activationand body-focused attention.
Methods: In this preregistered, cross-sectional study (https://osf.io/
sc57z/), we tested whether cardiorespiratory activation and body-
focused attention modulate somatic symptoms in the ASP. Partic-
ipants (N 144= ) completed 3 ASPs, interlaced with cardiorespir-
atory activation (cycling) and rest. Participants were randomized to
a body-attention or distraction condition. We measured heart rate,
respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO2 during these tasks. The data
were analyzed using AN(C)OVAs,t tests, and multilevel models.
Results: Exercise signiﬁcantly increased, and rest signiﬁcantly
decreased immediatesomatic symptoms (F 53.80,1.86, 262.68 =()

signiﬁcantly related to a sustained greater decrease in somatic
symptoms in the ASP after cycling (vs. rest,Fp 8.061,1,136 ==()

nipulation was observed (Fp 0.52, .47,att part1, 141

Conclusions: Rest and exercise temporarily modulate somatic
symptom reports, and people with higher baseline somatic
symptoms show the strongest beneﬁcial effect of physical activity
on symptom reports in the ASP. Theﬁndings are compatible
with recent models of predictive processing and active inference.

INTRODUCTION
Feeling “out of sorts” and being miserable— often,
bodily symptoms and negative affect— go hand in hand.
Obviously, the experience of bodily symptoms can dampen
a person’s affective state.1,2 However, being in a bad mood
also induces bodily symptoms, as has been shown by re-
search using the Affect and Symptom Paradigm.
3
Current models of symptom perception suggest ex-
planations for this. For example, the predictive processing
model4–8 posits that symptom experience results from an
active (Bayesian) inference process in which a prior— a
(not necessarily explicit) hypothesis about the bodily
sensations— and the actual bodily sensations are in-
tegrated into a posterior model of the sensations repre-
senting the eventual experience of the symptom. The
reliability of the prior and the actual bodily sensations
determines their relative contribution to the eventual
symptom percept. Especially when physiological signals
are weak and unspeciﬁc, priors may dominate the symp-
tom construction process.
7 Because the posterior model of
previous symptom episodes generate priors for new epi-
sodes, priors and bodily signals (in terms of afferent sen-
sory input) may grow further apart, which can lead to
persistent somatic symptoms or even to mental health
problems, such as somatic symptom disorder.

The latter happens particularly when applying a
“Better Safe than Sorry” processing heuristic.11 In the face of
potentially threatening bodily sensations, high threat sensi-
tive individuals (those high on negative affectivity) may re-
duce the level of detail when processing sensory-perceptual
aspects of the bodily sensations and“jump to conclusions”
conﬁrming prior expectations about somatic symptoms. This
explains why persons with high habitual symptom reports in
daily life and patients with functional disorders show a re-
duced correspondence between experimentally induced
changes in the body and self-reported symptoms.
12
In this study, we intend to explore central mecha-
nisms behind somatic symptom distress (based on the
predictive processing model) by testing potential moder-
ators of somatic symptom perception in the Affect and
Symptom Paradigm (ASP). In this paradigm, participants
view negative pictures and subsequently rate their somatic
symptoms. Comparing with a control stimulus (usually
neutral pictures), this experimental setup typically pro-
vokes increases in somatic symptom reports, especially in
high habitual symptom reporters and in patients with
functional somatic syndromes.
3,13–16
Interestingly, using psychometric bifactor models of
somatic symptom distress,17 we found that the elevated
symptoms behind the ASP effect are mainly of cardiores-
piratory nature.16 This allows for interesting research ques-
tions, as the cardiorespiratory system can be easily
manipulated, for example, through exercise, breath-pacing
interventions, including meditative/mindfulness tasks. Add-
ing a physical activity task to the Affect and Symptom
Paradigm could lead to 2 potential scenarios regarding the
somatic input. On the one hand, physical activity creates
unspeciﬁc physiological and sensory noise, as many different
physiological processes are happening at once (ie, next to the
musculoskeletal system, the endocrine, nervous, car-
diovascular, and respiratory systems are involved). Possibly,
people with high negative symptom priors would experience
exercise as aversive, as some of the incoming signals might
seem to conﬁrm the prior of having serious symptoms of a
disease, such as a heart attack. In addition, trait neuroticism
is associated with functional disorders,
18 and meta-analyses
have conﬁrmed a small but signiﬁcant negative link between
neuroticism and physical activity.19–21 On the other hand,
people with less negative priors might have very precise and
neutral, perhaps even positive, expectations toward how it
feels when they exercise. This way, even preexisting symp-
toms could be“explained away” by having done exercise,
thus alleviating perceived symptom burden. In a previous
study, we showed that enhancing the strength of the prior
through repeating the symptom assessment increased the
level of symptoms elicited by the ASP.
22 Therefore, further
research is needed to investigate how manipulating cardior-
espiratory processes would affect the associated symptom
experiences in the ASP.
Attention directed to the body can also modulate the
effects of priors. It seems that different types of attention
exist, and that their characteristics determine whether this
modulation is beneﬁcial or not.
23,24 On the one hand,
some self-directed forms of attention can lead to negative
outcomes, including catastrophizing, heightened health
anxiety, and more symptom reports.25–27 Potentially, this
negative type of attention activates or strengthens symp-
tom-related priors— for example, by casting doubt on the
body’s health when physiological signals and symptoms
are vague.22 On the other hand, a more positive form of
attention toward the body can be beneﬁcial. Mindfulness-
based interventions were meta-analytically linked to more
accurate perceived awareness of the body.
28 Training in-
teroceptive attention allocation led to an improvement of
health-associated parameters, such as the upregulation of
heart-rate variability,
29 lower symptom reports,30 or re-
sponsiveness to physiological hunger/satiation cues.31 In
exercise contexts, there can be a competition of cues be-
tween internal information, such as perceived fatigue, and
external information, such as distractor cues given by the
experimenters.
32 For example, participants exercising on a
treadmill listening to distracting (ie, non –body-related)
sounds reported less fatigue and physical symptoms than
participants hearing their own breathing sounds.32 In an-
other study, however, this ﬁnding could not be
replicated.33 Thus, the role of attention in contributing to
somatic symptom experiences is complex and needs
further study.
The present study was designed to investigate the
effects of attention to the body (vs. distraction) and
physical activity (vs. rest) on symptom perception, using
the ASP. We chose physical activity as a potential modi-
ﬁer of cardiorespiratory activity, as it is easy to manipu-
late, feasible, and both physiology (“true signal” in the
predictive processing model) and symptom experience
(“posterior”) can be measured. In addition, measuring the
symptoms evoked by physical activity introduces an in-
teresting new dimension to the ASP. We hypothesized that
people in a body-attention condition would report fewer
net symptoms than people in the distraction condition, as
attention would strengthen the precision of the physio-
logical signal. We also predicted that participants would
report fewer net symptoms after rest phases than activity
phases, because there is less arousal or somatic input
during rest.

ultimately aiming to improve the understanding of
mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and stigmatization of
Functional Disorders.35
Participants
We used G*Power 3.1.9.7 to determine the ideal
sample size.36 When aiming ford = 0.5 at 80% power with
3 repeated measures in 4 groups and correlations up to
r = 0.5, N = 124 persons are required. To buffer for tech-
nical errors, dropouts, and other sources of attrition, we
decided on N = 150 as a stopping rule.
We originally wanted to only rerecruit persons who
participated in an earlier study.
16,37 Because of the weight
restrictions of the apparatus, only former participants who
self-reported their weight at≤95 kg were eligible.
However, we were unable to reach enough former
participants; therefore, we recruited new participants via
social media posts, posters around the city, newsletters,
and press outlets. For these new participants, the inclusion
criteria were being between 18 and 65 years old, weighing
maximally 95 kg, and sufﬁciently understanding German.
The total recruitment and data collection period
spanned from November 2023 to April 2024.
Materials
Questionnaires
In this study, participants were asked toﬁll in the
PHQ-15 questionnaire in advance online before their ap-
pointment with the experimenters. For this, we used the
online platform SoSci Survey.
38 The CSD and the SAM
are integral parts of the ASP and were therefore im-
plemented in Inquisit.
39
Patient Health Questionnaire—15 (PHQ-15). The
patient health questionnaire measures symptom burden in
the last 4 weeks.
40 It consists of 15 items which are an-
swered on a scale of 0 (not bothered at all) to 2 (bothered a
lot). The PHQ-15 is considered a reliable and valid ques-
tionnaire, as it has been tested in many different
settings.
41,42 The German version is by Löwe et al.43 We
measured an internal consistency ofα = 0.773.
Checklist of Symptoms in Daily Life (CSD). The
CSD was designed by Wientjes and Grossman44 to assess
the severity of 25 selected symptoms. The items are re-
sponded to on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very strongly).
We chose to only present 12 items of the CSD which had
provoked the most net symptoms (after negative minus
after neutral trials) in earlier studies,
16,22 see also Supple-
mental Digital Content, Supplement A, http://links.lww.
com/PSYMED/B117). The ﬁrst CSD in the experiment
had an internal consistency ofα = 0.755.
Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The SAM is a low-
verbal assessment instrument for valence and arousal de-
signed by Bradley and Lang.45 Per item, it consists of 5
schematic drawings of a manikin displaying low to high
valence/arousal. Participants can rate their current moods
using a 9-point scale anchored just below the drawings.
Affect and Symptom Paradigm
The Affect and Symptom Paradigm (ASP), also
known as the Affective Picture Paradigm, was originally
used by Bogaerts et al
3 to demonstrate the inﬂuence of
negative stimuli on symptom experience. Here, we used 24
negative and 24 neutral pictures from the International
Affective Picture System (IAPS),
46 Each trial consisted of
6 pictures of one valence level, which were presented for 7
seconds each (ie, the length of blocks was 42 s). After
viewing a block of pictures, participants were asked about
their own current valence and arousal using the SAM.
Then, they were also asked about the intensity of current
symptoms using the CSD. Negative and neutral trial
blocks alternated, starting with negative trials, as we had
determined that this was the best order.
16 In summary,
there were 4 negative and 4 neutral blocks per ASP task.
Participants completed this task 3 times (Figure 1 and
Supplemental Digital Content, Supplement B, http://links.
lww.com/PSYMED/B117).
Attention/Distraction Tasks
Attention/distraction was a between-subjects con-
dition. This task was modelled after the memory task by
Van den Bergh et al.
47 Participants were presented a series
of high and low tones (piano note C4 and B4), which were
randomly played at a ratio of 1:3. Between the notes was a
random jitter, spanning 3000, 4000, or 5000 ms (ratio of
2:1:1). This way, there were exactly 16 tones presented per
minute, which is similar to the average resting respiratory
rate.
48 Participants in the distraction condition were asked
to count the high notes and disregard the low tones, while
participants in the attention condition were instructed to
ignore the tones and count their breaths. Thus, people in
the distraction condition were doing a nondemanding
working memory task with an external attention alloca-
tion, while people in the attention condition were doing a
similar task with an internal attention allocation, to use
Pennebaker and Lightner’s
32 terms. After the task, par-
ticipants from both conditions were asked how many
tones/breaths they counted. All participants did this task
twice— once while resting and once while cycling (physical
activity).
Physical Activity Versus Rest
Activity and rest were within-person conditions, and
the order was randomized (Figure 1). For the rest, par-
ticipants were instructed to ﬁnd a “relaxed and cozy
seating position” and were offered to switch from sitting in
the regular chair to an armchair. For the physical activity
task, participants were instructed to get onto the bike er-
gometer and cycle at a self-chosen speed that was ad-
equate for them. Participants were told that the task was
not about maximal exertion, but that they should feel like
they were doing some exercise.
Both resting and activity had a duration of 5 mi-
nutes, during which we recorded end-tidal CO
2 (EtCO2),
heart rate (BPM), and respiratory rate (RPM) 6 times— at
the very beginning and after every minute. There were no

additional resting times between physical activity (or rest)
and the next questions, which were about current symp-
toms, valence, and arousal.
Apparatus
For the physical activity task, we used a Wahoo
Kickr Snap49 with a generic all-terrain bicycle with 24”
wheels. Bike resistance was set to the seventh gear on the
third chainring of a Shimano Freewheel 14-28T cassette.
50
This corresponds to a speed of 13.8 km/h at 40 revolutions
per minute, or 5.7 m per crank revolution. Participants
were not allowed to change gears or adjust the resistance
of the instrument.
We measured 3 types of physiological data using the
PC-900B handheld capnograph and pulse oximeter.
51
These measures, EtCO2, measured in mm Hg, heartbeats
per minute (BPM), and breaths per minute (RPM), were
added as a manipulation check. EtCO
2 represents the
partial pressure of CO2 in the total expiratory gas mix. It is
one of the main drivers of respiratory regulation.52 An
EtCO2 value of below 35 mm Hg is considered hypo-
capnia and is mostly caused by hyperventilation.
Design and Procedure
We contacted former participants by sending an
anonymized email through SoSci Survey. Former partic-
ipants were asked to contribute to a follow-up study to the
original study and were provided with a personalized link
to an online survey. In contrast, new participants got the
link through a QR code on a poster or by using a non-
personalized link. After giving informed consent, partici-
pants ﬁrst ﬁlled out demographic and health-related
questions, followed by the above-mentioned ques-
tionnaires. At the end of the survey, the participants were
redirected to a calendar tool to schedule a lab appoint-
ment with their anonymous code. Participants were sent a
reminder of their participation up to 2 days before their
appointment.
On the day of the lab appointment, participants were
randomized into the attention or into the distraction
condition. Within-person, the order of activity and resting
was also randomized, resulting in a 2×2 within-between
design: activity ﬁrst–distraction; activity ﬁrst–attention,
rest ﬁrst–distraction; and restﬁrst–attention. So, attention
versus distraction was a between-persons manipulation,
while activity versus rest was manipulated within persons
(Figure 1). When the participant arrived, weﬁrst assessed
the baseline of 3 physiological parameters, that is, EtCO
2,
RPM, and BPM. These values were noted down twice:
once immediately, and once after 1 minute of rest. After
that, people were asked about their current symptoms
(CSD), valence, and arousal (2 SAMs). Then, the partic-
ipants completed the ﬁrst run-through of the ASP, fol-
lowed by the rest of the activity task, respectively. After
answering the questions associated with the tasks (CSD
and SAMs), the participants completed the second run-
through of the ASP, followed by the remaining task (ac-
tivity or rest), where we again recorded the physiological
parameters 6 times. Participants also againﬁlled in the
CSD and SAMs. Following the third and last run-through
FIGURE 1. Procedure of the experiment with the 4 conditions. Note. Symptoms, valence, and arousal were assessed at baseline
and each postevent (dark gray rectangles). No further questions were asked at the endline, but physiological measures were
assessed for another minute. The timeline at the bottom of the figure indicates during which tasks physiological measurements
were taken. When accounting for both the within-person and the between-person factors, there were 4 conditions: activity first–
distraction; activity first–attention, rest first–distraction; and rest first–attention. Thus, attention versus distraction was a between-
subject condition and activity versus rest was a within-subject condition. CSD= Checklist of Symptoms in daily life; SAM= Self-
Assessment Manikin.

of the ASP, we assessed the 3 physiological parameters
again twice over the course of 1 minute. This procedure is
also summarized in Figure 1.
After this, participants were debriefed and asked
again for consent to use their data. Participants in the
attention conditions were furthermore given the oppor-
tunity to redo the physical activity task, this time with
distraction instructions, as we had hypothesized that this
would be the more favorable condition. Last, participants
were remunerated with 20€ or course participation credits.
Statistical Analysis
We used SPSS Version 2753 and R Version 4.1.254
for statistical analyses. Within the R environment, we used
packages foreign, psych, ggplot2, lme4, and lmerTest.55–60
First, we removed duplicates and then reconstructed
from which sources participants came and where they
dropped out. After removing one person where the ex-
perimental protocol was violated, we calculated indices of
interest, speci ﬁcally net symptoms (see below) and
interoceptive breath counting accuracy, as inspired by
Schandry’s
61 interoceptive heartbeat counting accuracy:
IBAc 1k
recorded counted
recorded
1= ∑ − − . Tone counting accuracy
(TAc) for people counting tones in the distraction con-
dition was calculated with the same formula.
As preregistered, we then conducted randomization
checks using t tests and ANOVAs. Manipulation checks
were conducted using the same methods— here, we tested
whether negative and neutral pictures provoked different
levels of symptoms, and whether the physiological mea-
sures ﬁt our interventions. We expected EtCO
2, BPM, and
RPM to be highest after cycling. Our hypothesis testing
consisted of repeated measures ANOVAs with before-in-
tervention/after-rest/after-activity as the repeated measure,
and order and distraction versus attention as between-
factors. First, we did this withnet symptoms (symptoms
after negative minus after neutral trials) in the 3 ASP
blocks as a main outcome; then, we calculatedevent-based
rmANOVAs— absolute valence, arousal, and symptoms at
baseline, immediate post-rest, and immediate postactivity
(in Figure 1, these are depicted as black vertical rec-
tangles). We used the PHQ-15 score as a covariate where
appropriate, but in line with Wysocki et al’s arguments,
62
we did not control for demographic variables.
Furthermore, we conducted some not-preregistered
exploratory analyses, such as 2 multilevel models. Weﬁrst
conducted a linear regression to assess the feasibility of a
hierarchical model. After centering net symptoms, we se-
quentially modelled an unconditional means model, the 2
unconditional growth models (random intercepts of time;
random intercepts and random slopes of time), and then
stated modelling conditional growth models. These con-
tained the level-2 variables attention/distraction and order.
All models were full maximum likelihood models. Models
were sequentially tested against each other using a Like-
lihood ratio test.
RESULTS
Demographics
We were able to recruitn 234= persons who started
ﬁlling out the online survey. Of these,n = 33 did notﬁnish
the survey, n = 15 were ineligible due to weight reasons,
n = 2 persons actively declined to participate after the
survey, and n = 39 did not come to a lab appointment.
Due to an experimental protocol violation, one additional
person had to be excluded from the analyses, which means
our total sample size wasN = 144. All demographic data
and other relevant characteristics can be seen in Table 1.
Manipulation Checks
In the ASPs, there was a stimulus material main
effect (Fp 44.40, .001, 0.237 part1.76,251.57
2=< η =() ). Post
hoc analyses revealed that negative pictures evoked sig-
niﬁcantly stronger somatic symptom reports than neutral
pictures, but not more than at baseline. As we were sur-
prised by the lack of difference between baseline and
negative pictures, we looked at the symptom reports per
trial. The trial-by-trial values suggested that absolute
symptom reports in the CSD of the ASPs decreased over
the course of the experiment and therefore obscured dif-
ferences between the one baseline measurement and the
mean of 12 gradually decreasing symptom reports after
negative trials. Therefore, we conducted a multilevel
model.
The analyses for physiological measures are de-
scribed in detail in Supplemental Digital Content, Sup-
plement C, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B117. The
physiological measures conﬁrmed a successful manipu-
lation: EtCO
2 and heart rate were highest while cycling
(EtCO2: MS E 39.76, 0.39,act == heart rate:M 88.45,act =
SE 1.55= ). This suggests a successful, albeit light, physical
activity manipulation.
Lastly, breaths per minute differed signiﬁcantly be-
tween events ( F 23.57,2.76,385.94 =() p .001, 0.1 4part
2<η = ).
Again, people breathed the most during physical activity
(
M 15.44, SE 0.35, 95% CI 14.74, 16.13act == = [] ), which
was higher than all other events at thep = .001 level. There
was a signiﬁcant between-person effect of attention/dis-
traction, as well as an event×attention/distraction inter-
action (between:
Fp 32.64, .001, 0.191,140 part
2=< η =() ;
interaction: Fp 29.71, .001, 0.1442.76, 385.94 part
2=< η =() ).
People in the distraction condition breathed more fre-
quently than people in the attention condition. There were
no signiﬁcant order effects, nor an event×order inter-
action.
People in the attention condition had an average
breath counting accuracy of IBAc= 0.75 (SD= 0.72), that
is, 75% of breaths were counted; the median was IBAc=
0.90. In the distraction condition, people scored a mean of
TAc = 0.88 (SD= 0.36), with a median of 0.98. This im-
plies that people indeed paid attention to the stimuli they
were instructed to pay attention to.

while being independent of baseline CSD (r 0.05, 95%=−

Hypothesis Testing
Randomization checks are reported in Supplemental
Digital Content, Supplement D, http://links.lww.com/
PSYMED/B117. The analyses for valence and arousal
are reported in Supplemental Digital Content, Supplement
C, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B117. In summary, for
event-based valence, the results were mostly insigniﬁcant.
People reported the least amount of arousal after resting.
Regarding the net symptoms over the 3 ASPs, the
between-subject effects of order and attention versus dis-
traction were not signiﬁcant (

The time effect was signiﬁcant (Fp 30.32, .001,2,282 =<()

In the event-based rmANOVA with absolute CSD

ple in the activity-ﬁrst order had more absolute somatic
symptoms in the CSD after activity, and people in the rest-
ﬁrst condition had more symptoms after rest.
Contribution of Habitual Symptom Reporting
Next to the above-mentioned repeated-measures
ANOVAs, we explored the contribution of habitual
symptom reporting as measured by the PHQ-15 on ASP
effects. To fully focus on the effects of attention versus
distraction and activity versus rest, we chose the 2 ASP
run-throughs after the interventions as dependent repeated
measures variables, order and attention condition as be-
tween-subjects factors, and PHQ-15 score, as well as ef-
fects of theﬁrst run-through as covariates.
On a within-subjects level, the repeated measures effects
were signi ﬁcant,

People showed higher ASP effects after cycling than after

sociations (allp>.23, all part

they start with the cycling task, their net symptoms are at

Time-Mapping the Net Symptom Reports
We conducted a multilevel analysis to check whether
net symptoms changed over the course of the experiment.
First, we ran a linear regression with just time. As this
regression showed a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of time on net
symptoms (
b p0.09, SE 0.02, .00 1=− = < ), we con-
tinued to model the time effect using a hierarchical
regression model.
The unconditional means model revealed that the
intraclass correlation was 50.2%. Adding the random in-
tercept of time, we discovered that 2.9% of the variations
in net symptoms can be explained by the main effect of
(linear) time (
b p0.09, SE 0.01, .001=− = < ). Next, we
added random intercepts of time, which showed that 7.0%
of net symptoms can be explained by the main and ran-
dom effects of time (
b p0.09, SE 0.02, .001=− = < ).
Next, we built a conditional growth model with at-
tention/distraction, order, and all interactions (3 two-way
and 1 three-way interaction). However, this model was not
signiﬁcantly better than the second unconditional growth
model, likely because none of the newly added predictors
was signiﬁcant (Supplemental Digital Content, Supple-
ment E, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/B117).
After that, we added PHQ-15 as an additional level 2
predictor of net symptoms. This model included time,
PHQ-15, attention/distraction, order, as well as the 3 two-
way and the three-way interactions of attention/dis-
traction, time, and order. PHQ-15 total score predicted
symptoms positively, meaning that people with higher
habitual symptom reporting generally report more symp-
toms. By adding a random intercept for the PHQ-15
scores, an additionalR
2 = 40.6% of the variance in inter-
cepts can be explained. This model performed signiﬁcantly
better than the second unconditional growth model
( df p52.85, 10, .00 1dif

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that an individual’s
pre-existing somatic symptom burden, and perhaps also
their pre-existing symptom priors, greatly inﬂuence how
easily symptoms can be evoked. Physical activity seems to
prevent the activation of symptom priors ( “net symp-
toms”) in the ASP of people with higher pre-existing
symptom burdens. We were not able toﬁnd any differ-
ences between the attention and distraction conditions,
except for an unexpected difference in respiratory rates.
As expected, cardiorespiratory activation through
cycling produced more event-based, absolute symptoms
than resting. Exercise activates the sympathetic nervous

system, which causes an excretion of adrenaline and leads
to peripheral physiological changes.65 These changes last
for a while after ceasing activity, which explains why we
found heightened symptom reports and arousal directly
post-exercise. From a predictive processing perspective,
this means that there is more internal noise, explained
away by the most available prior (here, the symptom
prior), which then leads to increased symptom reports
(and particularly so for those with a high level of somatic
symptom burden). An interesting avenue for future re-
search would be to administer the ASPduring an exercise
task (eg, by using virtual reality applications) to better
study the interplay of induced negative affect and physical
activity.
Interestingly, the effects and the“power” of physical
activity only become clear when taking pre-existing
symptom burden (as measured by the PHQ-15) into ac-
count. People with a clinically relevant PHQ-15 score
above 10 reported more net symptoms after resting than
people below this PHQ-15 score did, but these group
differences disappeared in the trials after physical activity.
This suggests that physical activity has a beneﬁcial, spe-
ciﬁc effect on people with higher symptom scores and can
sustainably lower their experimentally induced symptoms.
Even if the physical activity came ﬁrst, the effects of
physical activity were still visible many blocks later. From
a predictive processing perspective, this implies that in-
creased input from physical activity can lower the relative
inﬂuence of the symptom prior (which is strong in people
with higher pre-existing symptom burden) on the posteri-
or-forming process.
We were not able toﬁnd support for our hypothesis
on attention— people in the attention condition did not
have more symptoms than in the distraction condition.
Explaining this ﬁnding is difﬁcult and points to the com-
plex role of attention and distraction in somatic symptom
reporting. Two potential explanations refer to construct
validity: ﬁrstly, maybe the task only has short-term effects
and does not lastingly change symptom experience. Al-
ternatively, perhaps the task was too easy to produce any
effects. The mostly high interoceptive accuracy scores
(breath-counting accuracy) would support this concern.
Going deeper into issues of internal validity, we wonder
whether there was perhaps an issue with the nature of
tasks: capturing attention to execute a task may also re-
duce the automatic priming effect of symptom queries,
meaning that by measuring attention, we deleted its ef-
fects. This is in line withﬁndings from Kósa et al,
33 who
also did not ﬁnd effects of body-focused attention in a
physical performance task. Our inconclusiveﬁndings re-
ﬂect the state of theﬁeld of attention towards bodily sig-
nals: on the one hand, some studiesﬁnd that body-focused
interventions help people with somatic symptoms, 66,67
while others do not.68 On the other hand, next to ma-
nipulating state attention, the trait-level characteristic of
interoceptive attention— the degree to which people pay
attention to their bodily signals — is associated with
heightened somatic symptoms.26,27 One could conclude
that distraction away from the body would be better for
symptom experience, but ourﬁndings show no differences
between the conditions and do not imply that distraction
leads to lower symptom perception, either.
The only difference between attention and dis-
traction conditions was the respiration rate— people in the
attention condition breathed less frequently than people in
the distraction condition. Slower breathing is also asso-
ciated with psychophysiological beneﬁts, such as stress
reduction, higher heart rate variability, and reduced self-
reports of threat-related anxiety.69–71 This suggests that
while people in the attention condition did not improve on
symptom scores, they beneﬁcially adapted their breathing
rate, even if they were not explicitly aware of this.
We additionally found that net symptoms decreased
over time. To our knowledge, this is theﬁrst study that has
tested ASP effects over the course of about an hour, as
usually studies use the ASP as one task that only lasts
∼20 minutes. For example, in an earlier study, we found
no increases or decreases in net symptoms over the course
of 9 blocks,
22 but the current experiment was approx-
imately thrice the length and also showed all stimuli 3
times, which may have led to boredom effects. It would be
interesting to investigate whether (occasional) novel
stimuli or previously unseen symptom questions also lead
to this habituation effect, as oddball events lead to
heightened attention and alertness, thus likely engaging
participants more.
72
However, here, too, pre-existing symptom burden had
an interesting effect, as it positively predicted symptom re-
porting per timepoint. This means that people with higher
pre-existing symptom burden show less net symptom de-
crease over time. In addition, the PHQ-15 scores explained
over 40% of the variation in intercepts, and thus extend other
literature on the ASP thatﬁnds that high symptom reporters
have higher effects than low symptom reporters.
3,13
Lastly, end-tidal CO 2 had a signi ﬁcant negative
correlation with the pre-existing symptom burden. This
ﬁts the literature showing that people with persistent so-
matic symptoms often have lower partial CO
2 pressure at
expiration.73
From a predictive processing perspective, these
ﬁndings have multiple implications. We thought that
people in the attention condition would be able to“ex-
plain away” their symptoms, especially during physical
activity phases, because by paying attention to their
bodies, they could sample more somatic input or modify
their expectations of nonthreatening symptoms explain-
able by exercise. Meanwhile, we expected people in the
distraction condition to be unable to modify their prior
and therefore experience the symptoms as more threat-
ening. Interestingly, we saw that people who had a higher
pre-existing symptom burden— meaning they had a higher
symptom prior— were able to sustainably lower their
symptom experiences through physical activity. This
means that it was not the somatic input driving the change
in symptom experience, as people across the symptom
burden spectrum did the same activity. Instead, physical
activity seems to have reduced the precision of the prior in
people with very precise priors.

From a clinical point of view, this study provides
preliminary evidence that encouraging patients with PSS to
engage in physical activity might improve their symptom
burden. This is in line with a cognitive-behavioral approach
to treatment: Changing symptom experience likely needs
both cognitive-affective efforts (such as challenging one’s
preconceptions about bodily experiences) and behavioral
interventions to sample new information about one’s body
and symptoms.
74 Perhaps these interventions do not nec-
essarily have to be exercise, but might also consist of ex-
ercises to experience one’s body in new contexts.
To our knowledge, this is one of theﬁrst studies that
attempted to modify the ASP effect and thereby gain a better
understanding of the mutability of somatic symptoms, and the
ﬁrst to do this with physical activation. We also consider our
multimethod design, implementing self-reports, behavioral
tasks, and physiological measurements, to be a strength. As
with any study, there are also some limitations. First, we do not
know the exact number of breaths people took in the different
conditions, as we worked with average readings every 60 sec-
onds. However, it seems unlikely that people would slow down
or change their breathing exactly for the 60-second mark and
then speed up again, without the experimenters, who were
monitoring the capnograph non-stop, noticing. Secondly,
maybe prescribing a certain activity level or a more structured
instruction for the activity part would have led to different
results— although dose-response relationships in affective sci-
ences in sports are considered outdated
75 and our manipulation
checks were successful, asking participants to do“for them
adequate levels” of exercise and allowing them some level of
self-selection of intensity mayhave led to different effects.76
Our sample had very few exclusion criteria, and we
sampled from a variety of different sources. As a result, it is
a mostly young, educated group, but with many different
pre-existing conditions. We chose this sampling strategy to
increase heterogeneity and external validity compared with
a purely student sample, while also allowing for a full
spectrum of symptom burden. While we recommend this
approach overall, we acknowledge that one drawback is not
having exact diagnostic or other medical information.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, physical activity seems to buffer against
newly induced symptoms in people with higher pre-existing
symptom burden by reducing the precision of their priors. This
effect lasted at least until the end of the experiment. The role of
attention for symptom perception remains elusive, and the
question remains how, and which different modalities of at-
tention need to be addressed to improve the posterior symp-
tom experience. The Affect and Symptom Paradigm remains
a strong tool to experimentallyprovoke symptom experience
