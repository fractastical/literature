Abstract
Depression is one of the most disabling of all disorders across the community, yet many
aspects of the disorder remain contentious. Psychosocial and biological perspectives are
often placed in opposition to one another, which in part reflects a failure of our explanatory
frameworks. The active inference account of brain function breaks down this dualism,
demonstrating that bodily processes are deeply integrated with the social world. It shows
us that there is no contradiction in understanding depression as a product of the social en-
vironment at the same time as having a brain basis and manifesting in biological symptoms.
From an active inference perspective, depression can be thought of as a synaptopathy:
a disorder that arises from alterations to the excitatory-inhibitory balance enacted at the
synapse, reflecting the interoceptive precision-weightings that have changed in the context
of psychosocial instability. Therapies that alleviate depressive symptoms act at different
levels of the active inference framework to re-weight precision estimates and the confi-
dence we have in our predictions: this is true for psychotherapies, lifestyle interventions
and antidepressant medications. Their effectiveness is often only partial, and while dif-
ferent treatment modalities can complement one another, there is a need for continued
development of new and better treatment options.

1. Introduction
Depression is one of the most disabling of all disorders in the community. It is
estimated to affect about 8% of adults each year, at a relatively consistent rate across
cultures [1,2]. The first episode of depression is usually experienced in adolescence or
early adulthood, and while the course is variable, it tends to recur throughout adult life [3].
Depression has significant effects on functioning at the individual level, and this, along with
the long period of the life course over which it recurs, explains its substantial contribution
to disability at a population level [4].
While the community-level impact of depression has gained increasing recognition,
many aspects of the disorder remain contentious. Episodes of depression often appear
to be responses to stresses and losses, and there is resistance to considering that it could
therefore be related to underlying brain processes [5]. The major contributors to depression
are often argued to be social factors, especially those that impose themselves because of
a person’s poverty and marginalisation [6,7]. As a corollary, many commentators favour

treatments that address social and psychological factors. The public health response to
depression, it is argued, should be to address food and housing insecurity, unemployment,
childhood maltreatment and other social determinants, thereby reducing the stresses that
precipitate depression [8].
At the individual level, psychotherapy is an effective treatment for depression [ 9].
Lifestyle changes such as attending to diet and exercise can also be effective [10]. Research
findings showing their effectiveness are often promoted in newspaper articles and other
media, reinforcing the notion that depression arises as a result of unhealthy living, and can
be addressed by helping people to become physically healthier [11,12].
Antidepressant medications are the most frequently used treatments for depression,
used by about 1 in 8 adults in developed nations [ 13,14]. In contrast to psychosocial ap-
proaches to treatment, they are often reported in the media unfavourably [15,16]. Although
there is good evidence that antidepressants are effective for depression [17,18], it is true
that treatment effect sizes are relatively small, with a substantial minority of patients not
obtaining significant benefit [ 19]. (Their effectiveness is similar, it should be noted, to
other treatments for depression, and to treatments in psychiatry and medicine more gener-
ally [20]). The sense of suspicion about the promotion of medications as a treatment for
depression reflects a deeper concern. Why would a person use a medication to cure an ill
caused by our society? Why should we medicate what appears to be an understandable
response to the vicissitudes of life?
Many perspectives on depression are held in opposition: biological versus social, brain
versus mind, medication versus psychotherapy. They assume a dualistic understanding of
mental life: that the brain and mind exist separately and reflect different processes [21]. In
part, this dualist perspective reflects a failure of our explanatory frameworks. We have not
had good theories about why biological symptoms like insomnia, reduced appetite and
fatigue can arise from social precipitants.
There is a need then for a framework that can break down this dualism and show us
that brain (and bodily) processes are deeply integrated with the social world. The active
inference account of brain function proposed by Friston and colleagues [22,23] provides
us with such a framework. By showing how the brain creates predictions about bodily
processes in the context of the social environment, we can understand how extensively the
two domains are integrated [24]. There is no contradiction in understanding depression
as being a product of the social environment at the same time as having a brain basis
and manifesting in biological symptoms. Our aim in this manuscript is to demonstrate
how the active inference framework helps us to understand depression. We believe it can
usefully address areas of contention among the community of depression researchers. We
are keen to demonstrate how the framework allows us to break down the dualism that
pervades the space: we can understand depression as both a disorder of the brain and a
psychosocial disorder. Treatments can operate at different levels, but can be understood as
being effective within the active inference framework.
2. Depression as a Response to Environmental Stressors
Depressive episodes are often precipitated by social stresses and losses, especially
early in the course of illness [ 25]. These can include relationship breakups, job losses,
interpersonal difficulties and financial stresses [26]. Such events will be more frequently
experienced by people who live in communities with poverty, housing instability, high
levels of use of alcohol and other drugs, and racial discrimination [8]. While these structural
determinants are important, depression is experienced across the social strata [27]. Losses
and disappointments are universal experiences: they are often navigated without significant
effects on mental health, but for many people, depression arises in their wake.
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 3 of 14
Social stresses and losses create vulnerabilities across the lifespan. Early life stresses
such as neglectful parenting and childhood trauma leave people vulnerable to depression as
they enter adolescence [28]. The incidence of depression increases markedly after puberty,
with adolescence representing a critical window of vulnerability [ 29]. The biological
changes that accompany puberty are associated with increased sensitivity of young people
to interpersonal contexts and significant changes in their social environments, with the
development of more hierarchical peer group relationships and the beginning of intimate
relationships [30,31]. In this context, there are significant increases in the number and
intensity of socially salient stressful life events, which are major drivers of the increase in
the prevalence of depression from adolescence [ 32]. Such stresses continue throughout
adult life, with depressogenic factors such as loneliness becoming more important with
age [33,34], with the result that a relatively high prevalence of depression persists across
the lifespan [35].
The significant contribution that environmental factors make to depression is evident
in twin studies. These show that environmental factors account for 50–70% of the variance
for vulnerability to depression [36]; greater than their contribution to mental disorders such
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [37]. The
environmental factors that are important for depression include not only those that operate
in a person’s current environment (such as losses and stresses), but also those that have had
their effects during development, including the childhood home environment, schooling
and peer influences [38]. These early experiences increase susceptibility to negative life
events and the onset of depression during adolescence and adulthood [39].
The role of proximal environmental factors is important. But for many people, episodes
of depression are not precipitated by identifiable stressful life events. This is more likely
to be the case for later recurrent episodes [25,40]. Episodes later in the course more often
appear to arise autonomously, suggesting changes in the nature of the disorder over
time [41].
3. Depression in the Brain and Body
It is clear that depression has some relationship with brain processes, with many stud-
ies showing changes in brain structure and function in people with depression compared
to those without it [ 42–44]. The differences arise at the level of group comparison and
are small overall, with the groups largely overlapping: brain imaging does not usefully
discriminate those with depression from those without, and is not useful for diagnosis [45].
Brain imaging has shown, though, some consistency in the pattern of brain changes in
depression, implicating subcortical regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus and
midline frontal cortical regions [42,43,46,47].
Other biological differences are also evident. At a symptom level depression is as-
sociated with disturbances in sleep, appetite, psychomotor activity and energy levels.
Curiously, symptoms can show changes in either direction: patients can experience in-
somnia or hypersomnia, increased or decreased appetite, and psychomotor slowing or
agitation [48]. There can also be either decreased or increased energy levels, although
we characterise the latter as being part of mania (or hypomania), which can accompany
depression but in contemporary nosology forms a different illness—bipolar disorder [49].
There are group-level differences in inflammatory markers [50,51] and in measures
of autonomic reactivity [52,53]. While genetic factors are less prominent for depression
than for other mental illnesses, they do make a contribution. No individual genes confer
substantial risk; many small-effect loci are hypothesised to operate through interacting
biological networks to influence depressive vulnerability [54].
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 4 of 14
There is evidence that changes in the brain become more pronounced with depression
recurrence. For example, hippocampal volumes become smaller [ 42], and there is more
marked disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [55]. These disturbances,
which persist after depression remission, set the groundwork for future episodes. Depres-
sion is argued to be a neuroprogressive illness, which provides an explanation for why
later episodes of depression are more likely to arise autonomously rather than in response
to stressful life events [55,56].
4. Antidepressants and Their Effects on Monoaminergic Systems
The first antidepressants were developed in the 1950s, and were demonstrated to exert
their effects via their interactions with the brain’s monoaminergic systems [57,58]. Almost
all of the antidepressants that have been developed since have worked on the same systems,
albeit with greater specificity, and therefore fewer side effects—although without superior
effectiveness [59].
The brain’s monoaminergic systems consist of three main networks, which use sero-
tonin, norepinephrine and dopamine as neurotransmitters. These systems originate from
regions in the brainstem and project widely throughout the cerebrum. They have neu-
romodulatory actions: they are inherently neither excitatory nor inhibitory, but rather
modulate the excitatory and inhibitory actions of other neurotransmitters [60].
The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), which include fluoxetine, citalopram and sertraline. These drugs bind to
the membrane-bound serotonin transporter protein. The protein functions as a molecular
channel to transport serotonin back into serotonergic neurons after its release [61]. SSRIs
block this reuptake process, allowing more serotonin to accumulate in the synaptic space
and to stimulate post-synaptic serotonin receptors, thereby influencing neural signalling
patterns [62].
The observation that SSRIs exert their effects by increasing the amount of serotonin
in the synaptic cleft led drug companies to claim that the medications were reversing a
“chemical imbalance” [63]. This chemical imbalance theory of depression entered the public
discourse, and has often been used as a shorthand justification for the use of antidepressants.
There is little evidence, however, that there are differences in the levels of serotonin and
its metabolites in people with depression [64]. There is clearly a more complicated story
at play.
5. Non-Medication Treatments
The mainstay of depression treatments is psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT) is the most studied of these, but there are at least six other evidence-based
psychotherapies for depression [ 65,66]. With CBT, the therapist works with patients to
test and reconceptualise their aberrant beliefs about themselves, their social environments,
and their futures; and encourages more social activity [ 67,68]. Other therapies, such as
interpersonal therapy, focus more on improving the nature and quality of a person’s close
relationships rather than their cognitive attributes; but similarly, the therapist encourages
the patient to become more socially active rather than succumb to the tendency for social
withdrawal [69]. The therapies are effective overall, but similarly to antidepressants, their
effect sizes are modest [9].
Other approaches are effective in ameliorating depressive symptoms. Interventions
that focus on addressing diet and exercise have been shown to reduce depressive symp-
toms [70,71]; although their effectiveness must contend with the difficulty people with
depression have in engaging with prescribed health programs [72,73]. Anti-inflammatory
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 5 of 14
medications can also be effective treatments—at least in the subset of patients who show
evidence of inflammation [74,75].
6. The Active Inference Framework
The active inference framework of brain function, proposed by Friston, represents a
fundamental reconceptualisation of how the brain works [22,23]. The theoretical framework
builds upon a number of older ideas, including perceptual inference [76], cybernetics [77],
predictive coding [78] and other Bayesian models of brain function [79,80]. Active inference
is grounded in the principles of Bayesian probability theory, and describes the brain as an
inference machine that actively generates and tests predictions about the world. Rather
than passively processing sensory information, as in the classical cognitivist model, the
brain instead generates models of the world that it continuously refines by minimising
discrepancies between its prior beliefs about the body and its environment compared with
incoming sensory data (i.e., it strives to minimise prediction errors). This occurs via two
mechanisms: (i) by the brain updating its beliefs to better account for the sensory data, and
(ii) by the brain instigating action to align its sensory inputs with its predictions [22,81].
Of most relevance to depression, the active inference framework can be applied to
interoceptive processes, whereby the brain generates predictions about expected bodily
sensations and parameters. The nature of the active inference framework for interocep-
tion is provided in other manuscripts, which we recommend to readers who would like
more detailed explanations [82–85]. We provide a summary here. In the active inference
framework, bodily processes are understood as being managed according to environmental
contingencies so as to optimise one’s capacity to survive and flourish. As in other do-
mains, the brain generates predictions about bodily sensations, and where the sensations
differ from the predictions, it either updates its prior beliefs, or changes visceromotor and
neurohormonal output to align interoceptive sensations with its predictions [82,86]. Via
these mechanisms, the brain provides constant adjustments to parameters associated with
processes such as cardiorespiratory output, inflammation, sleep and appetite, adapting
them to environmental demands (Figure 1).
Figure 1. The active inference framework explains how the brain generates interoceptive predictions
in the context of the social environment. Top-down predictions modulate autonomic and neurohor-
monal processes, while prediction errors arising from bodily states update the models. This bidirec-
tional process is affected by environmental stressors that influence the precision-weighting of intero-
ceptive prediction errors, providing an account of how psychosocial factors manifest in the biological
symptoms of depression. Elements of the figure were created with https://www.biorender.com.
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 6 of 14
The active inference framework is inherently hierarchical. Prior (Bayesian) beliefs
generated at higher brain levels are applied to lower levels in a top-down manner. (Note
that in active inference, a “belief” is a formal mathematical construct that refers to neu-
ronally encoded probability distributions about the causes of sensory data, and should
not be confused with “beliefs” in a folk psychology sense [87]). Prediction errors ascend
in the opposite direction, modifying and refining predictions from the bottom up [ 22].
Higher level predictions are more general in nature, integrating predictions across multiple
domains, such as the broad shape of interoceptive processes in the context of the social
environment [24]. The predictions become more specific as they descend, generating ex-
pectations related to parameters such as heart rate, plasma osmolality and carbohydrate
craving. In a similar vein, the prediction errors that arise from the bottom of the hierarchy
are generated in specific sensory domains, informing lower-level predictions initially, and
if they are not able to be explained away (e.g., by reflex arcs), they ascend the hierarchy to
inform more general higher-level predictions [82,83].
7. Model Confidence and Precision Weighting
The influence of top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors exists in dy-
namic tension. The nature of this balance reflects model confidence. When confidence in
prior beliefs is high, prediction errors are explained away at lower levels by top-down
influences. In the interoceptive domain, this is hypothesised to occur via reflex arcs and
neurohormonal allostatic loops, which are enacted without conscious awareness [83,88].
When confidence in higher-level priors is low, however, there is greater reliance on predic-
tion errors to attune the brain’s models [81]. The prediction errors ascend the predictive
hierarchy and lead to belief updating, often entering conscious awareness: interoceptive
prediction errors become known to us as feelings (e.g., of hunger, anxiety or fatigue) [88].
The balance between top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors is enacted
by precision-weighting. Neural signals are either upweighted or attenuated as a reflection
of model confidence. This weighting is enacted at the synapse. Neurotransmitters such as
serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine act by modulating the influence of excitatory and
inhibitory neuronal signalling, which are enacted by glutamatergic and GABAergic neu-
rons, respectively [89,90]. While monoamine neurotransmitters provide rapid modulation,
other systems are also implicated. The excitatory-inhibitory balance can be influenced by
activation of glutamatergic NMDA receptors and by the action of neuropeptides [91,92].
The dynamic changes in precision-weighting enacted by these mechanisms are made
more enduring by the process of long-term potentiation, whereby the strength of synaptic
connections is altered via structural changes to the neurons [93].
8. An Active Inference Account of Depression
In viewing depression through the lens of the active inference framework, the social en-
vironment has particular significance for how interoceptive processes are managed [24,94].
By its nature, the social world is complex and often unpredictable. The stability of the
environment—and our confidence in it—is reflected in the confidence we have in our inter-
nal models. When we have confidence in the future, the biological rhythms that underpin
sleep, appetite and energy levels maintain their usual consistency.
When depressed, these interoceptive processes are altered. Depression is often pre-
cipitated by changes in a person’s social environment, with losses and stresses reflected
in reduced confidence in one’s beliefs about the world [24,85]. Depression emerges when
there is both uncertainty in one’s ability to successfully predict and respond to the social
environment, along with high confidence in this uncertainty. A depressed mood instan-
tiates hyperpriors that encode the expected long-term average of short-term fluctuations
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 7 of 14
in precision by determining new set-points for neuromodulatory mechanisms that gov-
ern the sensitivity of our responses to prediction errors [95]. In other words, moods—as
hyperpriors—determine the precision attributed to the confidence we have in our lower-
order, more rapidly fluctuating emotional states [85]. With depression, a self-reinforcing
negative affective state develops that is resistant to updating [96].
The symptoms of depression reflect changes in the way that interoceptive processes
are subsequently managed [85]. There is a changed array of emotions, with more anxiety,
irritability and tension, along with changes to longer-term physiological processes that
manifest in disturbed sleep, altered appetite and fatigue [85]. There are shifts in behaviour,
with withdrawal from social activities, which are anticipated to be aversive [24,94]. These
changes occur via alterations in precision-weighting, which provides a mechanism for
events in the social environment to influence biological processes. The active inference
framework can therefore be seen to unify competing perspectives of depression, allowing
it to be socially influenced as well as inherently biological.
9. Depression as Synaptopathy
From an active inference perspective, depression can be thought of as a synaptopathy.
Synaptopathies were initially defined as neurological disorders that arose from genetic
mutations of synaptic proteins, such as in Huntington’s disease [97]. It has more recently
been applied to disorders where the primary deficit is assumed to be at the synapse,
even though no precise causal deficit in synaptic protein function has been identified:
these include mental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and depression [ 98–100].
An active inference account of depression suggests that it arises from alterations to the
excitatory-inhibitory balance enacted at the synapse. This balance is shifted by the action
of neuromodulators and by neuroplastic changes, which reflect the interoceptive precision-
weighting that has changed in the context of psychosocial instability, and manifest in the
symptoms of depression [ 85]. It is the precision-weighting enacted at the synapse that
is critical.
To be clear, the concept of the synapse in this account is shorthand for the hierarchical
networks that consist of many billions of synapses; the coordinated, dynamic, extraordi-
narily complex activity of which underpins prior beliefs and the precision-weighting of
prediction errors. In considering depression as a synaptopathy, we do not imply that de-
pression can be reduced to brain function: while active inference processes might ultimately
be manifested at the synapse, they incorporate higher-level beliefs about the complex social
environment, and reflect the interpersonal and broader social milieu that provide the con-
text for interoceptive processes [85]. Expectations about future experiences are influenced
by past experiences, and are encoded at a synaptic level. That later recurrent episodes of
depression are less obviously precipitated by proximal psychosocial stresses suggests that
aberrant precision-weighting accrues from past experiences—both from developmental
stresses and from previous episodes of depression. They leave evidence of their occurrence
in their influence on precision-weighting models, creating a susceptibility to depression
even in the absence of social precipitants.
10. Treatments Target the Synapse
The active inference conception of depression provides insights into how treatments
for the disorder work. Depression arises from the complex re-weighting of interoceptive
precision, and treatments for depression aim to modify this re-weighting [85]. This is more
obvious for antidepressant treatments, but other treatments can also be seen to operate at
the synapse: they re-weight precision estimates and improve model confidence [101].
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 8 of 14
Psychotherapies directly address higher-order models of the self and the confidence
a person has in their interpersonal environments [ 102]. The active inference model of
depression described here emphasises the role of future social expectations, with the
success of therapies deriving from their ability to help patients scaffold a future that
they can have more confidence in [ 85]. This can be related to the explicit goals of the
therapy. In CBT, for example, correcting cognitive distortions about the future is one
of its aims [67,68]. The therapist might encourage the patient to consider what changes
they might make to their lives to instil a greater sense of stability and confidence; and
can indirectly instil confidence by providing a safe and supportive environment in the
therapy sessions themselves [103]. The behavioural component of CBT revises priors by
encouraging the exposure of depressed patients to corrective environmental (particularly
interpersonal) stimuli [104].
Interventions that aim to improve the lifestyle factors that contribute todepression—such
as those that improve diet and exercise—can be seen to target the interoceptive prediction
errors themselves as a means of alleviating depression by affecting depressogenic processes
related to oxidative stress, inflammation and gut microbiota, among others [105,106]. Simi-
larly, the treatment of depression with anti-inflammatory medications targets the aberrant
inflammatory processes that represent, in the active inference framework, unresolved
prediction errors [96].
Medications that affect the influence of monoamines have been the mainstay of an-
tidepressant treatments and are targeted more directly at the synapse. As discussed, SSRIs
act by modifying the amount of serotonin available in the synaptic cleft. While levels of
synaptic serotonin are evident after the first dose, the antidepressant effects of SSRIs are
not felt for a week or longer [107]. The mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of SSRIs
remain incompletely understood, but the delayed onset of effectiveness corresponds with
changes in gene expression and the synthesis of new proteins [ 108,109]. These changes
support neuroplastic processes such as the re-weighting of synaptic connectivity strengths
and the formation of new synaptic connections [110]. The evidence for such SSRI-induced
neuroplasticity is mainly drawn from animal studies, with only a few studies showing
evidence of this in humans [111,112]. This limited evidence is supplemented by indirect
evidence from human structural MRI and post-mortem studies that show morphological
changes in regions such as the hippocampus [113].
Other antidepressant treatments have effects with quicker onsets. Low-dose ketamine,
for example, acts directly on glutamatergic NMDA receptors and has an almost immediate
antidepressant effect that is maintained for up to a week after a single dose [ 114]. It has
neuroplastic effects, promoting synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in
the hours to days after a dose [115].
Interventions target different aspects of depression, but their effects are experienced
across levels. Interventions that address diet and exercise are targeted at lower-level somatic
components at the same time as addressing the lifestyle factors that are embedded in the
social environment. Psychotherapies target psychological and behavioural processes, but
they have biological effects too: they have been demonstrated to change brain function [116].
And while medications operate at the synapse, the act of prescribing them has psychosocial
aspects. They are provided in a therapeutic context, embedded in the supportive and
predictable relationship between the patient and their prescribing clinician [117]. One of
the reasons that SSRIs show only a small benefit compared to placebo treatments in clinical
trials is that depression shows robust response to placebo pills, suggesting that much of the
effectiveness of antidepressant medications can be ascribed to the therapeutic relationship
and the act of prescribing [118].
Entropy 2025, 27, 970 9 of 14
Many patients do not respond to first-line treatments, whether that be to medications
or psychotherapies. If medications work by adjusting precision-weighting in ways that
often see improvement in depressive symptoms, they do so only approximately: for
some patients more than for others (who might not notice any improvement, or even
deterioration). Combining medication with psychotherapy and lifestyle modification might
see aberrant precision-weighting nudged incrementally towards their previous long-term
averages, with each operating at different levels of the predictive framework and having
effects that are complementary.
11. Conclusions
Depression is a complex and disabling disorder that affects many people in the commu-
nity. The diagnosis and its treatment remain contentious, in large part because we maintain
a dualistic understanding of it. Many people view depression as an understandable re-
sponse to environmental stresses, and are antagonistic towards accounts that privilege
brain processes and promote the use of antidepressant medications. But this dichotomy
between depression as a response to environmental stresses versus brain pathology is a
false one. The active inference framework allows us to understand that environmental
factors have important causal influences on brain and bodily processes, which can manifest
in the symptoms of depression. We can understand depression as arising because our
beliefs about our future social environments have been shaken, and with this change in
model confidence, our management of interoceptive processes is set awry. We can also
understand that depression can be precipitated by asocial causes, such as chronic pain and
inflammation (or for no obvious reason at all), and that these then influence behaviours
and engender changes in the social environment.
Our treatments for depression act at different levels to readjust our generative models.
All treatments work at the synapse: either directly, as for antidepressant medications, or
indirectly, as for psychotherapies, which act to increase confidence in the psychosocial
environment. We should not see these treatments as acting in opposition, but rather in com-
plement. We can only agree that creating an environment that is lessdepressogenic—where
there is stable housing, ability to purchase food and other essential items, and supportive
social networks—provides a means of reducing the prevalence of depression. But depres-
sion will still occur, as we now see in wealthier people who do not have pressing financial
concerns but nonetheless struggle with depression. Depression is a complex disorder,
and different treatments will be more or less effective for an individual in ways that are
hard to predict. We should consider all effective treatments as operating within the same
active inference framework, and understand that there are multiple effective options for
alleviating depression. And while we pursue the development of more effective and better
tolerated treatments, we should continue to advocate for better communities that do not
generate such high levels of depression.
