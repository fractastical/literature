IBS AND EXPECTED LUMINOSITY PERFORMANCE FOR RHIC BEAMS 
AT TOP ENERGY WITH 56 MHZ SRF CAVITY

Introduction 
The purpose of RF system in RHIC is to capture injected bunches, accelerate them to the top 
energy, and store bunches at the top energy for many hours. The accelerating RF system operates at 
harmonic number h=360 of the particle revolution frequency p78.196 kHz, which corresponds to 
28.15MHz. The storage RF system accepts the shortened bunches at top energy and provides 
longitudinal focusing to keep these bunches short during the store time (collision mode). The 
storage system operates at harmonic number h=7x360=2520, which corresponds to an RF frequency 
of 197.05 MHz [l]. 
Recently, an upgrade of storage RF system with a superconducting 56 MHz cavity was 
proposed [2]. This upgrade will provide significant increase in the acceptance of storage RF bucket. 
Presently, the short bunch length for collisions is obtained via RF gymnastics with bunch rotation 
(called “re-bucketing), because the length of 197MHz bucket of 5 nsec is too short to accommodate 
long bunches otherwise. However, due to bucket non-linearity and hardware complications some 
increase in the longitudinal emittance occurs during re-bucketing. The 56MHz cavity will produce 
sufficiently short bunches which would allow one to operate without re-bucketing procedure. 
This Note summarizes simulation of beam evolution due to Intra-beam scattering (IBS) for 
beam parameters expected with the 56 MHz SRF cavity upgrade. Expected luminosity improvement 
is shown both for Au ions at 100 GeVhucleon and for protons at 250 GeV. 
Performance of Au ions beams at top energy of 100 GeVhucleon 
IBS limits the present performance of the RHIC collider with heavy ions. To achieve required 
luminosities for a future upgrade of the RHIC complex, the Collider-Accelerator department at BNL 
has been developing several approaches to counteract IBS such as electron and stochastic cooling 
[2, 31. Stochastic cooling in the longitudinal direction was already successfully implemented in 
RHIC, suppressing longitudinal emittance growth due to IBS in one of RHIC rings. Implementation 
of stochastic cooling in the transverse plane is presently under development [3]. 
In addition, the work is being done on the reduction of the transverse IBS growth rate with a 
modification of the RHIC lattice. This approach is less expensive and intrusive than cooling. As a 
first step in this direction, the new RHIC lattice was developed over several dedicated Accelerator 
Physics Experiments (APEX) [4, 51. In this Note, IBS for RHIC beams is simulated with the new 
“dAu82” lattice, used in 2008 RHIC physics run in Yellow ring. This newly implemented lattice has 
95” horizontal phase advance per arc cell and a transition gamma of yt=26.6.

Expected RHIC performance at top energy with 56MHz SRF cavity upgrade October 27,2008 
At injection energy typical 95% longitudinal emittance of Au ions is s95%=0.3-0.5 eV-s/nucleon. 
The emittance is growing during the ramp reaching the values of about 0.8 eV-s/nucleon at the top 
energy, which corresponds to a full bunch length of 9.7 nsec with 28MHz RF. Such bunch length is 
too long to fit into 5.1 nsec bucket length of 197MHz RF. The short bunch length for collisions is 
thus obtained via RF gymnastics with bunch rotation (called “re-bucketing”). However, some 
increase in the longitudinal emittance occurs during this procedure. Longitudinal emittance after re- 
bucketing is about 1 SeV-s/nucleon. Also, as a result of re-bucketing, significant intensity spill into 
the neighbouring buckets occurs as well. Typically, about 30% of bunch intensity is spilled into the 
neighbouring buckets. This would correspond to a two-fold reduction in useful luminosity if these 
satellite buckets would not contribute to the collisions within the detector vertex. Of course, 
bunches in the satellite buckets still collide within the vertex, making luminosity reduction caused 
by the spill slightly less severe.

The RF upgrade with 56MHz cavity will produce sufficiently short bunches which would allow one 
to operate without re-bucketing procedure. This would prevent longitudinal emittance increase as a 
result of re-bucketing and eliminate intensity spill in the neighbouring buckets thus maximizing 
useful luminosity. Comparison of RF parameters for present 28 and 197 MHz RF and planned 56 
MHz RF is given in Table 1. Also note that for longitudinal emittance of 0.8eV-s/nucleon the full 
bunch length with 56MHz RF is only 4.8nsec, which is smaller than the length of 197MHz RF 
bucket. This suggests that further shortening of bunch length may be possible by adiabatic capture 
from 56MHz RF into the 197MHz RF, which would maximize luminosity within vertex even 
further.

For a stationary RF bucket, the bucket acceptance is give by: 
where R is the machine radius, h is the RF harmonic number, 7 is the slippage factor, V$is the total 
RF gap voltage per turn, Z is the ion charge number and Es is the energy of synchronous particles. 
The choice of 56MHz cavity with 2.5 MV voltage results in RF bucket acceptance 6 times larger 
than the one of 197MHz RF. 
IBS simulations were performed with 56MHz RF for ion beam parameters in Table 2 with bunch 
intensities of 1*109 and 1.5010~ per bunch. Simulations were performed using Martini’s model of 
IBS in BETACOOL code [6, 71. Presently, typical bunch intensity of Au ion beam used in RHIC 
operation is about 1. l*109. Bunch intensity of 1.5010~ was already used in accelerator experiments 
but is not yet operational due to a beam instability at the transition energy which limits average

To summarize, the 56 MHz SRF cavity upgrade offers 6 times larger bucket acceptance compared 
to the 197MHz RF and shorter bunch lengths compared to the 28MHz RF. It also eliminates 
intensity spill in the neighbouring buckets and avoids longitudinal emittance increase, which 
happens during re-bucketing. Comparison of different RF systems is summarized in Table 1. Note 
that for small longitudinal emittances of 0.5-0.8eV-s/nucleon (which is expected at top energy 
without re-bucketing), the 56MHz RF provides bunches less than 5 nsec long which allows further 
reduction of bunch length with adiabatic capture into 197MHz RF without the need of re-bucketing. 
Expected improvement in average beam luminosity is summarized for different bunch intensities in 
Table 3. For bunch intensity N=l.5*1 09, without stochastic cooling, one gets full luminosity without 
vertex cut <L>full=4.8*1027 cm- s in a 4-hour store (for 112 bunches and p*=O.8 meters), and 
<L>f,l1=2.4* cm-2 s-’ for N=l .0*109. The best luminosity performance is expected with both 
56MHz RF cavity and all-plane (3D) stochastic cooling upgrades which should provide around 
<L>fu11=5.5*1027 cm-2 s-’ (with p*=0.5 meters) for bunch intensity of N=l.0*109 [SI and up to 
<L>full=7*1027 cm-2 s-’ for bunch intensity of N=l .5*109 [9].

Performance of proton beams at top energy of 250 GeV 
This section summarises expected performance for protons beams with 59MHz cavity 
upgrade. Comparison of RF parameters for present 28 MHz and 197 MHz RF and planned 56 MHz 
RF is given in Table 4. The choice of 56MHz cavity with 2.5 MV voltage results in RF bucket 
acceptance 6 times larger than the one of 197MHz. 
Table 4. Comparison of RF parameters for present and planned RF cavities. 
Up to now, operation with protons was limited by large longitudinal emittance at the top energy of 
100 GeV. The emittance was intentionally increased by mismatch at injection to avoid transverse 
emittance growth. With the ongoing 9MHz cavity upgrade operation with smaller longitudinal

emittance (0.5-1 eV-s) may become possible. The goal of 9MHz cavity is to get long bunches with 
low longitudinal emittance on the ramp to prevent transverse emittance growth suspected to be 
driven by electron cloud [lo]. At the top energy of 250 GeV such small longitudinal emittance 
would result in smaller bunch length with 28 MHz RF. The 56MHz RF cavity offers even smaller 
bunch length thus improving vertex luminosity compared to operation with the 28MHz RF, for any 
value of the longitudinal emittance. In addition, for small longitudinal emittances the 56MHz RF 
will allow even further shortening of the length of proton bunch with an adiabatic capture in 
197MHz RF without a need of re-bucketing. Tables 5-7 shows expected bunch lengths for different 
longitudinal beam emittances.

To summarize, for protons at 250 GeV, planned 56MHz SRF cavity upgrade offers 
significantly better vertex luminosity compared to present 28MHz RF due to shorter bunch length 
for any value of the longitudinal emittance (see Tables 5-7). Luminosity performance with 56 MHz 
RF seems to be slightly better than with 197MHz cavity for beam parameters shown in Tables 8-9. 
Compared to 197MHz no intensity loss due to longitudinal IBS is expected because of significantly 
larger bucket acceptance for 56MHz SRF cavity. In addition, the 56 MHz RF offers possibility of 
further shortening of proton bunches with adiabatic capture into 197MHz RF.
