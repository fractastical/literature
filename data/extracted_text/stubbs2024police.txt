In the realm of law enforcement, the “police hunch” has long been a mysterious 
but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework 
of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines 
the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that 
hunches – often vital in high-stakes situations – should not be described as 
mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind’s generative models. 
These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated 
and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make 
hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that 
hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity 
of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, 
thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only 
explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights 
for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference 
to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues 
for future research.

Introduction
In what can be  a high-stakes policing world, officers are often confronted with 
situations that demand swift yet informed decision-making. The ability to survive these 
complex and dynamic environments rests not only upon established operating procedures 
and training, but also on an officer’s intuition; their inherent capacity to generate 
“hunches” . These hunches, often perceived as instinct or a gut feeling, have long remained 
contested, even gaining the moniker: “suspicioning” ( Quinton et al., 2000 ; Quinton, 2010 , 
2014; Hendy, 2021). Research in this area is related to stopping and searching, where the 
hunch directs a conscious choice to intervene with a driver or perform an outer clothing 
search for contraband or weapons ( Alpert et al., 2005 ) and has often been collocated with 
race. Instead, this study focuses on the hunch as a more functional phenomenon that does 
not just arise at the point of discretionary choice but often as an involuntary response to 
sensory stimuli that cannot be readily explained.
Consider the following scenario.

A police officer arrived at the scene of a recently reported domestic 
disturbance. The scene is chaotic, with a distraught woman seated 
on the curb and her bloodied head shedding clumps of hair because 
of the violent altercation that has just occurred. Her trembling voice 
informs the officer of a violent and angry male within the residence, 
while also emphatically warning that her two-year-old child remains 
trapped in the house. At this critical moment, the responding officer 
grapples with a decision that demands split-second judgment. As the 
officer approaches the door, goosebumps begin prickling the back of 
their neck, and an indescribable feeling emerges – a hunch that 
something is amiss. The door swings open, revealing a bare-chested 
and seemingly composed man who is well-built, in his thirties. 
He  calmly invites the officer inside. Against a backdrop of 
uncertainty, the officer chooses to decline the invitation, and their 
internal alarm bells ring insistently.
This scenario creates a fundamental question: How does an 
officer’s body generate these hunches, these internal alarm bells, and 
what role do they play in navigating the intricacies of the police 
experience? To explore this question, this article delves into the 
theoretical framework of Active Inference and the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP) (Parr et al., 2022) pioneered by the cognitive scientist 
Karl Friston et  al. (2010) . Active inference relies upon the brain 
operating as a Bayesian engine ( Friston et  al., 2011 ), continually 
generating and updating probabilistic models of the world, and 
actively intervening to minimize what is referred to as surprise. In this 
article, we examine how this concept is not only relevant but also 
indispensable for understanding the formation and implications of 
hunches in the context of policing. We dissect the generative processes 
within the officer’s brain, assisted by active inference, to reveal how 
hunches may serve as crucial instruments in their decision-making 
toolkits. This discussion then allows for the generation of a number 
of hypotheses.
This conceptual investigation not only sheds light on the cognitive 
mechanics of the police hunch but also offers practical insights into 
harnessing the power of active inference for the future policing 
research agenda.
What is a hunch?
Taking the prior reference of suspicion as a starting point, we can 
begin to draw a more precise boundary around what could be called 
an officer’s hunch. Suspicion is a product of the officer’s interpretive 
view of the world, and although it may be based on prior experience, 
it is also based on a predicted generative model of what may happen 
in the future. An example, in simple terms, is:
Police officer: “I want to stop that car; I do not like the look of it.”
Such interactions with the public have been the subject of 
concentrated study (Alpert et al., 2005; Parks et al., 2005; Stroshine 
et al., 2008; Quinton, 2010, 2014), in which the discretion inherent in 
the decision becomes subject to scrutiny. Biases and stereotypes play 
a role in the formation of suspicion in these circumstances 
(Heussenstamm, 1971; Brown, 1981; Holmberg, 2000; Dunham et al., 
2005; Stroshine et  al., 2008 ), with aspects of the visual world 
influencing the formation of suspicion that leads to directed physical 
activity. Interestingly, there are also studies that illustrate suspicion as 
a moderator of correspondence bias (Fein, 1996), triggering active, 
sophisticated attribution rather than brute-force stereotyping.
This research evidence points only toward a small aspect of what 
could be considered a hunch, as the hunch does not just reside within 
discretionary stops and searches for individuals or vehicles. The hunch 
rests within an officer’s body and mind and is constantly available for 
deployment in any given circumstance. It can be  present after or 
during a police interview, when compiling evidence at a crime scene, 
or upon arriving at the scene of a particularly violent domestic 
incident. It is a cognitive product of the interpretation of sensory input 
at any given moment, formed upon the figurative grounding of the 
officer’s gathered and interpreted experience.
These hunches are not restricted to police officers, and may 
manifest as the product of experiential “build-up” over time in many 
professions and encounters. Intuition has been studied within nursing 
(Buckingham and Adams, 2000), medicine more widely (Adler, 2022), 
firefighting (Okoli et al., 2016), and the armed forces (McCown, 2010). 
These studies discuss how specific circumstances within these 
professions may generate particular hunches, with little research 
available to cross tabulate these experiences across genres. If these 
hunches are caused by repeated exposure to incidents within those 
lines of work, it is fair to suggest that hunches themselves may 
be particular, and in some cases may even be harmful. An example of 
this may be when disproportionate experience may contribute toward 
the development of a disproportionate hunch ( Hinton, 2017 ; 
Villiger, 2023).
If the police hunch can be considered wider than car stops and 
person searches, then the literature discussing its deployment is 
examining a small corner of what could be a much wider phenomenon. 
This has been discussed in the literature that defines suspicion as a 
cultural pillar (Bowling et al., 2019 ), a behavioral thread that runs 
through policing, rooted in the profession itself. The literature 
examining the operation of suspicion is international, and 
commonalities are present across international boundaries (Nickels 
and Verma, 2008). This may suggest a reliance upon a collectively built 
and reinforced schema ( Smith et  al., 2006) that rely upon scripts 
(Schank and Abelson, 2013 ). Schema and scripts are cognitive 
structures that represent organized knowledge about the world. They 
can involve events or processes that assist with guiding perception, 
interpretation, and action and represent a wider cognitive framework 
(the schema), and a more specific subtype (script). Scripts and schema 
enable individuals to anticipate courses of events in various situations, 
reducing cognitive load by providing a template for the user to access. 
This fits comfortably with an evolutionary psychology perspective 
and, in particular, cultural niche construction as the mechanism for 
co-constructing shareable world or generative models (e.g., Heyes, 
2018; Constant et al., 2019; Vasil et al., 2020). These psychological 
phenomena describe a shared way of understanding and navigating 
the real world — sometimes referred to in terms of “common ground” 
and alignment of “frames of reference. ” See for example (Allan, 2013; 
Fields et al., 2021; Friston et al., 2022).
This makes intuitive sense, as all police officers at some point will 
arrest people, stop cars, and enter violent situations. These experiences 
are not rare and make up a very normal day for the average uniform 
police officer in any corner of the world. However, they are not shared 
by other professions who do not experience physiological and 
cognitive reactions to entering such encounters. It is therefore not 
Stubbs and Friston 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1368265
Frontiers in Psychology 03
frontiersin.org
surprising that police officers who live through distinct experiences 
then form understandings of the world that are distinct from those 
that do not.
This gradual collection of distinct experiences then leads to a 
distinct development of cognitive processing, built upon experiences 
that non-officers do not share; to summarize, it theoretically sets 
officers cognitively apart from other professions. This was explored by 
Smith et al. (2006) in their investigation of whether prior experience 
influenced their application of suspicion, with gender providing some 
significant relationships with suspicion formation.
If this is the case, then it makes sense that any police officer 
experiencing a hunch is experiencing a cognitive event built upon the 
foundation of distinct experiences over time. To illustrate this, let us 
return to the initial scenario discussed at the start of this article.
Due to the goosebumps on their neck, the police officer declines the 
bare-chested male’s invitation to come inside and instead takes 
hold of the closest arm, yanking him into the front garden. A 
violent encounter then ensues where the taser is deployed twice 
and the male is eventually subdued and arrested. Upon entering 
the property to check the welfare of the young child, his attention 
is drawn to the large kitchen knife that the male dropped as he was 
yanked into the garden. It was positioned in the porch directly 
behind the front door.
This situation could be read as a complete chance, yet the officer 
will attest (they are the author of this article) that the feeling was quite 
different from anything they had felt before when attending hundreds 
of domestic incidents. Indeed, it was the sensory input that presented 
prior to the encounter which caused an embodied reaction construing, 
“Something is wrong here. ” This then generated a behavior that may 
have looked hyper-aggressive to onlookers; there was little 
conversation before the male was forcibly dragged into the front 
garden, and a significant physical altercation took place. All this 
occurred as the direct product of a hunch, a feeling that the normal 
cognitive models of prediction were being subverted by something that 
could not be isolated or understood by the person experiencing them, 
yet immediately influenced behavior.
Returning to the other discussed example.
Police officer: “I want to stop that car; I do not like the look of it.”
This noticeably short descriptive statement describes the 
operationalization of a hunch by the officer in question. They describe 
that they wish to act to stop the car because they do not “like the look 
of it. ” This is open to interpretive bias from an onlooker who does not 
have the foundational sensory input of a police officer, and it is 
possible to read this statement in a negative or even punitive manner. 
The officers’ choice of words leaves a great deal of descriptive 
information, which they themselves may not be able to sufficiently 
understand. It relies upon the same “Something is wrong here” feeling 
discussed in the scenario above, but how that feeling is generated is 
unobtainable to the officer experiencing them. This leads to a 
significant conundrum: How does the officer justify their hunch and 
what prior sensory input does their brain rely upon to influence 
their behaviors?
To answer this question, other literature was consulted in 
intuition, with the phenomenon described as follows:
“ ... knowing without being able to explain how we know” (Vaughan, 
1979, p. 46).
This describes a cognitive output in the form of ‘knowing, ’ with 
the person who receives it being subsequently unable to describe how 
they arrived at the intuition itself. In a literature review of intuition, 
Shirley and Langan-Fox (1996) described the following:
“…individuals sometimes do not even realize that a process is taking 
place until a solution appears in consciousness. Most writers also 
agree that intuition is characterized by intense confidence in the 
intuitive feeling. ” (p. 596).
Intuition as a studied subject has garnered a great deal of interest 
and has been researched in many different settings (Svenson et  al., 
2023), from the business and management sector (Kopalle et al., 2023), 
into education (Suwarto et al., 2023), leadership (Hallo and Nguyen, 
2021) and even machine learning (Dai et al., 2020). Interestingly, the 
hermeneutics of intuition in these research areas are linked with 
valuable tacit knowledge and experience, which are viewed positively. 
This contrasts with the attachment of suspicion as a referent lens in the 
policing research canon. It is possible that the balanced literature in 
other areas may illustrate some bias in the research, representing a 
divide between the police being viewed as oppressive enforcement/
intervention (negative lens) and the police as a profession that may 
demand some aspects of operational creativity in decision making. As 
criminals continually innovate to stay ahead of the police (Aldridge and 
Décary-Hétu, 2014; Broadhurst, 2018), it is fair to suggest that police 
may have a fundamental requirement to be intuitive in following new 
avenues or approaches during their operations.
A meta-analysis examined the relationship between rational decision-
making and intuition (Wang et al., 2017) constructs in psychology. This 
research indicates that they are separate constructs, and as such share few 
similarities, running upon dual cognitive systems, and often referred to 
as operating within the systems 1 and 2 thinking dichotomy (Stanovich 
et  al., 2000). Intuitive decision making in this sense is described as 
“emotional” (system 1) rather than rational (system 2) thinking, with one 
of the main discerning features being the temporality of the decision 
making; how long as the decision maker got to make the decision within 
context. This has severe implications for policing, as much of the 
operational uniform activity is temporal in nature. How much time does 
an operational officer arriving at an incident have to make their 
operational decisions? The reliance on System 1 thinking in the police 
environment may be  high, forcing an uneven emphasis on the 
development of high-speed, active decision-making.
Tentatively, with prior discussion in mind, the author posits a 
definition of a hunch for the following discussion:
An often unbidden, salient intuition experienced by a police officer 
that subsequently influences their actions.
This wording has been chosen purposely, as the hunch is often not 
consciously invited, only experienced. It is different to suspicion in the 
sense that it can arise in many different situations as a response to any 
kind of sensory stimulus, and the feeling within the officer is salient; 
it is prominently different to other “normal” or more rational 
day-to-day decision making. This distinction is important. If the brain 
is constantly generating hypotheses in response to stimuli, how does 
Stubbs and Friston 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1368265
Frontiers in Psychology 04
frontiersin.org
one distinguish between a hunch and any other hypothesis? The 
important word within the definition is “salience”: the officer 
recognizes (i.e., infers) something unique about a particular 
hypothesis. The nature of this difference is discussed later in this 
article, in relation to the imperatives for decision-making—that 
feature notions of salience and resolving uncertainty.
It is also clear that a hunch operates on a spectrum. On one hand, 
it is an unbidden feeling that subtly influences behavior, such as the 
feeling about a car that an officer wishes to stop. It is a minor feeling 
that on many occasions, is unexplainable and developed from previous 
experiences within that officer’s service. On the other hand, there is an 
immediate and severe feeling that requires far more active intervention 
in the environment, such as the domestic violence incident discussed; 
this is a hunch linked with personal survival.
To investigate the now defined hunch, it is important to consider 
how the brain cognitively generates these intuitions.
Generating hunches: the Bayesian 
brain, active inference, and the free 
energy principle
Bayesian reasoning
Bayesian reasoning is a mathematical approach that combines 
prior knowledge with incoming information, enabling the brain to 
develop and refine probabilistic models of the world continuously 
(Tiao and Zellner, 1964).1 This approach has been employed in various 
fields, including psychology and neuroscience, to analyze phenomena, 
such as motor skills and various mental processes (Bowers and Davis, 
2012). The idea of Bayesian inference aligns with the notion that the 
brain probabilistically represents information, utilizing neural coding 
as a suitable metaphor for its operations ( Brette, 2019). Bayesian 
models, as exemplified by Bayes’ theorem, allow the integration of 
existing beliefs with new evidence in a mathematically rigorous 
manner (Tiao and Zellner, 1964).
Bayesian reasoning is based on Bayes’ theorem, an equation that 
expresses the probabilistic connection between prior knowledge and 
observed data.
P HE PE HP H
PE| |/g11/g12/g32 /g11/g12/g152/g11/g12
/g11/g12
In this context:
P(H|E) denotes the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence 
after observation.
P(E|H) represents the likelihood of encountering the evidence if the 
hypothesis is true.
P(H) represents the prior probability assigned to hypothesis.
P(E) represents the marginal likelihood of the observed evidence.
1 Reasoning as a term will be explained within this section and has not been 
used prior in this article as it is peculiar to Bayes Theorem – yet to be properly 
explored.
If we remain with Bayes only, and relate it to our prior example 
upon arrival at the reported domestic incident, this theorem would 
represent the following:
The police officer responds to a domestic disturbance where the 
incoming sensory stimuli mix with their prior experiences and 
contribute to an internal Bayesian computation in the brain. As the 
officer encounters a distraught woman and hears of a potentially violent 
individual within a residence, the brain begins to calculate the likelihood 
of future violence given the available evidence, denoted by (P(E|H)). 
Simultaneously, the officer’s prior knowledge and training contribute to 
developing the prior probability of a hunch (P(H)). The brain combines 
this information with the overall likelihood of observing the given 
evidence in any situation (P(E)). Using Bayes’ theorem, we can posit that 
the officer computes the posterior probability of the hunch being 
necessary, given sensory evidence (P(H|E)), and the sensory input is 
such that it results in a unique internal alert – an unbidden feeling that 
guides their subsequent actions and decisions.
Although this would offer us some insight into the officer’s 
decisions, it does assume to some extent that the brain is not acting in 
any way to actively affect the environment; it is represented as 
non-agentic and essentially a simple database that continually updates 
its probabilistic beliefs. To consider the brain functioning as an agent 
within an environment, it is necessary to consider how the Bayesian 
Theorem is made more ‘complete’ via the addition of Active Inference 
and the Free Energy Principle.
Active inference and the free energy 
principle
Moving beyond traditional Bayesian reasoning, recent 
advancements in cognitive science have developed the concept of 
Active Inference (AI) as a corollary of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). 
This provides a richer and more complete model (Friston et al., 2016) 
to assist in understanding the generation and implications of hunches 
in police environments. AI extends the Bayesian brain concept by 
emphasizing not only the passive assimilation of sensory information 
but also the active engagement of the brain to generate and update 
probabilistic models of the world (Knill and Pouget, 2004). Referred 
to as a “Bayesian machine in action, ” this framework views the brain 
as an entity that not only infers from sensory input but also actively 
intervenes to minimize “surprise, ” aligning its internal model with the 
external environment (Knill and Pouget, 2004) via perception and 
aligning the external environment with its internal model (Friston 
et al., 2016), via action. There is some debate with regards to the nature 
of “action” and its epistemological (Rescorla, 2015) connotations. It 
involves the way that organisms coming to know and understand their 
world being inherently linked to their actions within it. Knowledge 
and understanding therefore, are not just related to passive 
observation, but are constructed through active engagement with the 
environment. This debate has implications for attempting to 
understand epistemology in biological systems; knowing can be seen 
an embodied, dialogic process.
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a foundational concept when 
considered alongside Active Inference and the Bayesian Brain 
framework. FEP suggests that living organisms, including the brain, 
strive to minimize the difference between their internal model of the 
world and the sensory inputs they receive (Friston, 2010), as scored by 
Stubbs and Friston 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1368265
Frontiers in Psychology 05

the extent to which the sensory inputs were surprising, given an 
internal (i.e., generative) model of what caused those inputs. AI, while 
building on traditional Bayesian principles, further accentuates this 
idea by highlighting that the brain not only processes information 
passively but also actively engages with the environment. It does this 
to minimize surprise, or what is essentially the mismatch between the 
brain’s predictions and actively sampled real-world observations 
(Friston et al., 2016). This unified framework emphasizes the brain’s 
continuous efforts to update its internal model, actively inferring and 
intervening to minimize free energy, which serves as a measure of 
surprise in ongoing interaction with the external world.
This surprise can be quantified mathematically in terms of the 
variational free energy (F), which is minimized during active inference 
(i.e., belief updating in the brain):

In the context of this article, free energy provides a mathematical 
expression for surprise: when the brain is confronted with sensory 
observations (o) it updates its posterior belief Qs a,/g11/g12 about the states of 
affairs causing those observations. Note that these states include the 
states of the world (s) and action upon that world (a). In the context of 
a police officer, these could be environmental factors and their behavior.
P sa o,| ,|/g11/g12 represents the true posterior probability based on 
sensory evidence to which the Bayesian beliefs converge (c.f., P(H|E) 
above – in this case the likelihood of future violence) under a model 
of how outcomes are caused. In the equation above, this generative 
model is expressed in terms of the likelihood of some observations 
P os a|, |,/g11/g12 , given their causes and prior beliefs P sa,/g11/g12 about those 
causes (that include action). In short, Qs a,/g11/g12 corresponds to the 
brain’s best guess about states of affairs that can be read as a hypothesis 
or hunch; namely, the best inference about what it expects to 
encounter in a given situation.
Technically, the above equation specifies Bayesian beliefs Qs a,/g11/g12 
– about states and actions – as those beliefs that minimize variational 
free energy, where variational free energy has been expressed in three 
equivalent forms; each affording a complementary interpretation. 
Because the (KL) divergences 2 cannot be  less than zero, the 
2 The KL divergence can be used to quantify the “surprise” or “free energy” 
of a system, given its model of the world. In this context, the brain aims to 
minimize this divergence (technical) measure of surprise in order to reduce 
the difference between the expected (internal model) and actual (sensory 
inputs) states. Minimising this divergence (free energy) measure of surprise 
(e.g., prediction error) is thought to underpin both perception (updating the 
internal model to better match sensory inputs) and any action (modifying the 
environment to better match the internal model).
penultimate equality means that free energy is zero when the Bayesian 
belief is the true posterior. At this point, the free energy becomes the 
negative log evidence for the generative model ( Beal, 2003). This 
means that minimizing free energy is equivalent to maximizing model 
evidence. Crucially, the negative log evidence is also known as 
surprisal or more simply surprise. Therefore, maximizing model 
evidence — also known as self-evidencing ( Hohwy, 2016) — is 
equivalent to minimizing surprise by minimizing free energy.
Surprise quantifies the discrepancy between what the brain 
expects and what it observes. In the generation of a hunch, high 
surprise values indicate a significant deviation from the brain’s 
predictions, triggering an alert or heightened awareness. Conversely, 
lower surprise values suggest closer alignment between expectations 
and observations. This equation denotes that surprise is a value that 
can be modeled, allowing for possible prediction of hunch generation 
and severity. A hunch is not something that is ephemeral, it is the 
outcome of underlying Bayesian processing, and the generation of a 
world model that seek to actively infer and manage the presenting 
‘level’ of surprise.
This is known as Bayesian belief updating, where prior beliefs 
about (unobservable) causes are updated into posterior beliefs after 
seeing (observable) consequences. For example, seeing a distressed 
woman outside her house (observable consequences) revises prior 
beliefs about domestic abuse (unobservable causes). With an updated 
belief about domestic abuse, seeing a victim in a state of distress is now 
less surprising.
This relative level of surprise can therefore be described as driving 
the brain to initiate active engagement with the outside world in order 
to drive changes in the observed environment. This causes an update 
to its internal model generation to align better with the now changed 
(and potentially more explainable) sensory evidence ( Knill and 
Pouget, 2004; Constant et al., 2019). In this context, surprise is not 
merely a passive reaction to unexpected events but rather a driving 
force behind the brain’s continuous adjustment of predictive models 
based on real-time interactions and sensory stimuli. In the context of 
the policing hunch, AI suggests that an officer’s brain operates as a 
dynamic Bayesian engine and not merely as a passive recipient and 
processor of information (Friston et al., 2016). This active engagement 
allows for the continuous adjustment of officers’ predictive models 
based on real-time interactions and sensory stimuli. Technically, this 
means selecting courses of action that minimize the expected surprise 
following that action. Because expected surprise can be  read as 
uncertainty, this means that action is compelled to resolve uncertainty, 
for example, making further inquiries to resolve uncertainty about 
whether domestic abuse is the right explanation for the evidence at 
hand. Please see Box 1 for a more technical explanation of active 
inference in terms of resolving risk and ambiguity.
To summarize the previous discussion,
 • The officer’s collected sensory input was predicted using the 
officer’s generative model.
 • They do not align properly, this denotes surprise
 • The severity of surprise generates a hunch that something 
is wrong
 • The FEP at work motivates action – through AI – that seeks to 
resolve uncertainty
 • Surprise is minimized bringing predictions back into alignment 
with the sensory input

This process ends with the building of the experience-based 
generative model in the police officer prior to any further incident 
attended. According to Bayes’ theorem, this indicates that prior 
experience moderates the boundary or magnitude of surprises 
experienced by police officers. In short, reliance upon experience 
within particular specialisms in policing may be far more important 
than previously thought for decision-making, long-term police 
capability, and well-being.
Note that exactly the same principles operate in our example over 
different timescales and levels of analysis. One can read the officer’s 
further investigation as being motivated to resolve uncertainty to best 
explain the evidence at hand. This is an example of active inference 
at a deliberative, propositional level that could be entered into an 
incident report. However, the same mechanisms also operate at a 
sub-personal level of gut feeling, which may be less easy to describe. 
For example, the fast, emotional (i.e., type) inference “that something 
is wrong” is a perfectly appropriate hypothesis to both cause and 
explain the surprising sensation of prickling goosebumps. The very 
notion of “gut feelings” speaks to active inference — not about extra 
personal states of affairs — but about the officers’ own body. This is 
known as interoceptive inference, and may be a key component of 
hunches, in which the officer uses their body as an additional source 
of evidence that the situation is surprising. This raises the notion that 
not only will the Bayesian brain be receiving external stimuli through 
which to denote surprise, it is also receiving embodied stimuli 
(Holzer, 2017). Both of these stimuli will manifest in different ways, 
in different situations, calling for an active resolution of ambiguity 
and minimization of risk of an interoceptive and exteroceptive sort. 
Interoceptive inference—along these lines—has many interesting 
aspects (Seth, 2013; Gu and FitzGerald, 2014; Barrett and Simmons, 
2015). At its simplest, one can read the minimization of surprise as 
homeostasis and the commitment to pre-emptive plans—that elude 
the need for homeostatic responses—as allostasis ( Pezzulo et  al., 
2015; Barrett et al., 2016 ; Seth and Tsakiris, 2018 ). Indeed, many 
suppose that an interoceptive component of active sensing is 
necessary to lend an emotional (i.e., valence) aspect to belief updating 
(Seth and Friston, 2016; Fotopoulou and Tsakiris, 2017; Duquette, 
2020). Box 1 provides a definition of ambiguity and risk, and see 
Barrett and Simmons (2015), Gu and FitzGerald (2014), Seth (2013) 
and Seth and Friston (2016)  for an introduction to 
interoceptive inference.
Note further that in active inference, both volitional and 
autonomic responses are the causes and consequences of sensory 
input. In other words, active inference rests upon a circular causality 
implicit in making sense of observations that are generated through 
behavior. For example, the volitional act of approaching the door 
causes it to “swing open. ” Similarly, autonomic responses to the feeling 
that “something is wrong” produces goosebumps that provides further 
evidence that “something is wrong.”
Hunches and niche construction
In light of this discussion, how this may manifest over longer 
periods is relevant. The Bayesian Brain, FEP and AI have all been 
discussed within the area of niche construction (Constant et al., 2018), 
where organisms experience long-term influence over their immediate 
environment (their niche) and are able to enter into what could 
be considered “low surprise, ” longitudinal relationships with their 
sensory inputs around them. This assists with the building of 
sustaining generative models in their brain that provide a reliable 
service for their organism, both controlling and altering the 
environment, while always taking in and adapting to the modified, but 
mostly predictable, sensory inputs. Unfortunately, the nature of police 
work does a great deal to prevent this function from being properly 
developed in the officer, which may result in the particular 
development of the hunch as a more sensitive alarm system than in 
other professions. This problem is discussed in the following section.
Within the dynamic environment of law enforcement, officers 
routinely confront swiftly unfolding, unique situations. The luxury 
BOX 1: Active inference.
Recent trends in theoretical neurobiology, machine learning, and artificial 
intelligence converge on a single imperative that explains both sense-making and 
decision-making in self-organizing systems, from cells (Friston et al., 2015) to 
cultures (Veissiere et al., 2019). This imperative is to maximize the evidence 
(a.k.a. marginal likelihood) for generative (a.k.a., world) models of how 
observations are caused. This imperative can be expressed as minimizing an 
evidence bound called variational free energy ( Winn and Bishop, 2005) that 
comprises complexity and accuracy (Ramstead et al., 2022):
Free energy = model complexity – model accuracy.
Accuracy corresponds to goodness of fit, while complexity scores the 
divergence between prior beliefs (before seeing outcomes) and posterior beliefs 
(afterwards). In short, complexity scores the information gain or cost of changing 
one’s mind (in an information theoretic and thermodynamic sense, respectively). 
This means Bayesian belief updating is about finding an accurate explanation 
that is minimally complex (c.f., Occam’s principle). In an enactive setting—apt 
for explaining decision-making—beliefs about ‘which plan to commit to’ are 
based on the free energy expected under a plausible plan. This implicit planning 
as inference can be  expressed as minimizing expected free energy ( Friston 
et al., 2010):
Expected free energy = risk (expected complexity) + ambiguity 
(expected inaccuracy).
Risk is the divergence between probabilistic predictions about outcomes, 
given a plan, relative to prior preferences. Ambiguity is the expected inaccuracy. 
An alternative decomposition is especially interesting from the 
perspective of CNT:
Expected free energy = expected cost – expected information gain.
The expected information gain underwrites the principles of optimal Bayesian 
design (Lindley, 1956; Fields et  al., 2021), while expected cost underwrites 
Bayesian decision theory (Berger, 2011; Fields et al., 2021; Gklezakos and Rao, 
2022). However, there is a twist that distinguishes active inference from expected 
utility theory. In active inference, there is no single, privileged outcome that 
furnishes a utility or cost function. Rather, utilities are replaced by preferences, 
quantified by the (log) likelihood of encountering every aspect of an observable 
outcomes. In short, active inference appeals to two kinds of Bayes optimality and 
subsumes information and preference-seeking behavior under a single objective.

of formulating protracted causal generative models is a rarity, as 
every attendance to a call for police is, to some extent, novel. The 
concept of cognitive niche construction is directly relevant to this 
peculiarity, as it discusses the process whereby organisms – herein, 
police officers – articulate and sustain cause-effect models (Constant 
et al., 2018) of their immediate environment as guiding frameworks 
for their behavior. In contrast to scenarios in ecological niche 
construction, where organisms may adapt to their environment over 
very long periods of time, officers grapple with very constrained 
temporal parameters. The requirement to make instantaneous 
decisions and navigate these novel, often risky, circumstances creates 
a necessity for highly temporal niche construction. This requires 
rapid modification of the selective and novel environment during 
police encounters.
This temporal facet of niche construction is particularly relevant 
for understanding the cognitive intricacies underpinning hunch 
generation within policing. Officers’ capacity to construct and 
promptly update cause-effect models of their immediate environment 
emerges as a vital adaptive mechanism. Police officers attending an 
incident often have no knowledge of the people, environment, or 
circumstances behind the call. Each call therefore represents a 
potential risk to their safety, and it is only through repeated attendance 
at calls over time that their predictive modeling becomes sufficiently 
general to accept more novel, higher bounds of surprise within their 
volatile work environment. The ability to adapt quickly and actively 
manipulate sensory input is fundamental to a police officer, and this 
phenomenon is present within the cultural literature, often discussed 
as pragmatism:
“Pragmatism, with its emphasis on getting things done and a focus 
on outcomes rather than processes, can create a culture that values 
action over reflection.”  (Loftus, 2010, p. 305).
Despite what can be quite a negative lens in cultural literature, if 
the theories discussed prior are in operation, this is a very likely 
outcome within police culture. Officers use their brains daily to adapt 
to incidents with high surprisal bounds (see Box 1), forcing their 
brains to generate action that is far more ‘active’ than in many other 
lines of work, especially in responding to epistemic affordances in a 
risk-sensitive fashion. It is possible to hypothesize that this 
characteristic has indeed been ‘trained’ into officers’ brains over time, 
and in turn bled out into their organizational practice and decision 
making. Other studies discuss this as a reliance upon command 
within police decision-making, when other methods of leadership 
may be more appropriate (Grint, 2010).
In general police work therefore, police officers do not have the 
luxury of longer-term, active involvement in their work environment. 
There are likely to be high levels of surprise and unpredictability, as 
the calls they are responding to will often not contain actors with 
which police officers are familiar. This will leave a requirement for the 
officers to rely heavily on prior beliefs and encourage far more active 
involvement within the niche environments they attend, thus gaining 
an immediate return on surprise minimization. The hunch is as a 
result more highly “tuned” than in other areas of work; officers need 
it to assist with the minimization of free energy (the gaining of 
immediate control), whilst surrounded by higher than normal levels 
of surprise.
This discussion generates the following hypotheses (Figure 1).
Discussion
If the theories of the Bayesian Brain, FEP and AI are integrated 
into the police context, cognitive science and neuroscience can 
be combined to explain what the brain is doing when hunches arise, 
why they arise, and how the agent in the world (the police officer) then 
becomes active in modeling their immediate environment. This is a 
more general approach for describing what the process of policing 
does. Although it is possible to describe police in terms of crime 
reduction, crime response, crime detection, and the maintenance of 
public order, the need to understand policing at a cognitive level can 
sometimes be missed in contemporary research.
To illustrate this, the continuing example of the domestic incident is 
explored. It is likely that this incident will be reduced to a crime statistic 
for the purposes of most research, or at the most, an anecdote in 
interview-based research, yet the experience of the most powerful hunch 
an officer ever felt is left uninvestigated. Several questions can be posed.
 • What cognitive signals were generated by initial attendance that 
contributed to the hunch generation?
 • When the Bayesian brain processes these signals, what is 
produced empirically during the process of active inference? 
What was the officer’s qualia?
 • How were these qualia interpreted – there is likely to be  a 
hermeneutic of hunches among active police officers? How can 
this be examined and shared?
 • How did the officer justify this hunch in later court proceedings? 
How did this influence the writing of police statements and other 
court documents?
This list is non-exhaustive but shows the potential for solid research 
in this area. Perhaps more importantly, it delves into what can 
be considered the art of policing. The consideration of these variables is 
referred to as combinatorically explosive because of the endlessly 
developing pot of variables leaking into the Bayesian brain (Kleiter, 
1992). The police brain is remarkably able to recognize and distil signals 
received at a rapid pace and interpret them into actions that minimize 
incredibly elevated levels of surprise. This is worthy of extensive study.
At an even wider level, it may be possible to push the theories of 
AI and FEP into calls for police services. It is possible that when the 
public calls for police, their ability to actively navigate and influence 
their immediate environment has reached its limit. The police become 
third-party interventions that deliver a return to homeostasis for the 
caller, which acts as a tool for the caller to minimize their free energy 
and bring their lives back into the bounds of predictability. Strangely, 
this returns to earlier research by scholars such as Bittner, who 
describes policing as dealing with the following:
“…something that ought not to be happening, and about which 
someone had better do something now,”  Bittner (1990, p. 24).
Although not within the direct scope of the preceding discussion, 
this quote encapsulates AI and FEP acting at a societal level. This has 
been discussed in other literature as working within ‘Regimes of 
Expectation’ (Constant et al., 2019), where predictability is constructed 
at a much wider scale than the individual. These can be described as 
shared expectations of what can be construed as normal – the police 
act as agents of returning the world to a certain level of normality.

From the micro-cognitive functions of the hunch to the much 
wider use of the hunch as a potential tool for officers to navigate 
surprise on behalf of the members of the public who call for their 
service, the ground is set for a series of thematic investigations.
Harnessing the hunch for future police 
research
To conclude this article, we  return to the example of the 
domestic incident.
The police officer’s response to the reported domestic disturbance 
can be evaluated using the frameworks of the Bayesian Brain, the Free 
Energy Principle (FEP), and Active Inference (AI). The Bayesian Brain 
continuously models probabilities, taking into account the prior 
likelihood of potential threats as the officer arrives at the chaotic scene. 
The FEP comes into play as the officer’s brain strives to minimize 
surprise, as evinced by volitional action (e.g., making further 
inquiries) and autonomic responses (e.g., goose bumps). This surprise 
triggers an adaptive response guided by AI, as the officer actively 
decides not to enter a location that they would usually go inside. This 
demonstrates the ability of the brain to dynamically adjust predictive 
models in response to real-time environmental stimuli. Therefore, the 
hunch played a crucial role in shaping officers’ split-second decisions 
in dealing with complex and unpredictable situations. It is unclear 
what experiences the officer had during the incident provided their

brain with anomalous data, heightening their awareness of potential 
risk, and encouraging the immediate use of active inference to 
minimize surprise.
From the prior investigation, the exact nature of the experience 
of hunches in policing is key to this study. The point where a 
particular hypothesis becomes salient is rooted in subjective 
experience, referred to as qualia (Shoemaker, 1990 ). It is possible 
that hunches in particular circumstances are raised into the 
experiencer’s consciousness in very particular ways, and this area 
of study could be  highly beneficial to police officers in many 
different settings. This is a contested area of scholarship because of 
the oft-referred ‘hard problem’ of consciousness itself ( Chalmers, 
2017), making it a highly fruitful area for further investigation. In 
active inference, qualia are generally read as the qualitative 
experience that attends recognizing a change in perceptual or 
attentional set, which is accompanied by instantiating top-down 
(inductive or empirical) priors that necessarily change the 
precision of lower belief updating. The associated phenomenology 
therefore rests on a kind of mental or covert action. Please see 
(Limanowski and Blankenburg, 2013 ; Limanowski and Friston, 
2018; Sandved-Smith et al., 2021 ), for discussion.
To summarize, it is reasonable to assert that this procedure 
occurs on a spectrum at every police attendance. Officers must 
confront unfamiliar circumstances to establish some degree of 
control over the environment. This topic has been explored 
extensively in various police research contexts. However, without 
incorporating the previously mentioned concepts, it remains unclear 
what the brain, and therefore the police officer, is attempting to 
accomplish cognitively. To identify and investigate potential avenues 
for further research in this area, the following ten topics listed in 
Table 1 are proposed.

TABLE 1 Areas of future research.
 1) Longitudinal Study on Hunch Development:
This would involve a longitudinal study tracking the development of hunches in 
police officers as their career develops. It would investigate how cumulative 
experiences over time contribute to the refinement and reliability of hunches.
 2) Comparative Analysis with Other Professions:
This research would compare the prevalence and effectiveness of hunches in police 
officers with professionals in other dynamic environments (e.g., the business world 
where hunches have been construed positively as intuition). This could help with 
exploring whether the unique demands of police work lead to distinctive hunch patterns.
 3) Neurobiological Correlates of Hunches:
It is possible to collaborate with neuroscientists to explore the neurobiological 
processes associated with hunch formation. This would require the use of brain and 
body imaging techniques to identify specific regions activated during hunch-
related decision-making.
 4) The Impact of Training on Hunch Accuracy:
Investigating the role of training programs in shaping and enhancing the accuracy 
of hunches would illuminate whether specific training interventions can improve 
officers’ ability to generate reliable hunches.
 5) Diversity and Bias in Hunches:
This research would explore the impact of diversity (in terms of gender, race, etc.) 
on the formation and reliability of hunches. As an example, this would provide 
some insight into potential gendered hunches and their implications for policing 
practices.
 6) Operationalization of Hunches in Policing:
This research would examine how hunches are operationalized in real-time police 
decision-making. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, it could 
investigate the factors that contribute to the activation and follow-through of 
hunches during specific incidents.
 7) Training for Surprise Management:
Using action research, it is possible to develop and evaluate training programs 
aimed at improving officers’ ability to manage and respond to surprise 
effectively. This could assist with assessing how surprise management training 
impacts the generation and utilization of hunches in good police work, and 
exploring how surprise is emotionally regulated in officers in active deployment.
 8) Comparative Analysis of Policing Models:
This research would compare the prevalence and effectiveness of hunches in 
different policing models (community policing, predictive policing, etc.), 
investigating how organizational structures and obligations influence hunch 
development and utilization.
 9) Impact of Technological Support:
This research could explore how emerging technologies, such as predictive 
analytics and artificial intelligence, influence the generation and reliance on 
hunches in policing. Assess the potential benefits and challenges associated with 
integrating technology into hunch-based decision-making.
 10) Public Perception and Trust:
Finally, it is possible to investigate how public perception and trust in law 
enforcement are influenced by officers’ reliance on hunches, and the 
communication of how they are being used during investigations or incidents. It 
would examine the role of transparency and communication in shaping public 
attitudes toward hunch-based decisions.
