Abstract
Interoception refers to the process by which the nervous system senses and
integrates signals originating from within the body,providing a momentary
mapping of the body’s internal landscape and its relationship to the outside
world. Active inference is based on the premise that afferent sensory input
to the brain is constantly shaped and modified by prior expectations.In this
reviewweproposethatinteroceptivepsychopathologyresultsfromtwopri-
mary interoceptive dysfunctions: First, individuals have abnormally strong
expectationsofthesituationsthatelicitbodilychange(i.e.,hyperprecisepri-
ors),andsecond,theyhavegreatdifficultyadjustingtheseexpectationswhen
the environment changes (i.e., context rigidity). Here we discuss how these
dysfunctions potentially manifest in mental illness and how interventions
aimed at altering interoceptive processing can help the brain create a more
realistic model of its internal state.

INTRODUCTION
Interoception, the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals
originating from within the body, provides organisms with a momentary mapping of the body’s
internallandscapeanditsrelationshiptotheoutsideworld.Thisisfundamentallyimportanttofa-
cilitatethesortofadaptivechangethatDarwinbelievedwascriticalforsurvival,anddysregulated
interoceptivestatesareincreasinglyrecognizedasadefiningfeatureofmentalillness(Khalsaetal.
2018a). Traditionally, interoception has been considered to be a one-way street in which bodily
signals traveling to the brain cause sensation and elicit regulatory responses when bodily home-
ostasisisdisrupted.Morerecently,interoceptionhasbeenadoptedintotheconceptualframework
of active inference (Barrett & Simmons 2015, Paulus & Stein 2010, Pezzulo et al. 2015, Stephan
et al. 2016), which is based on the premise that afferent sensory input to the brain is constantly
shaped and modified by the individual’s expectations. Thus, interoception can be conceptualized
as a bidirectional process between the brain and the body, with feedback and feedforward loops,
and as a rich internal model aimed at predicting future states of the body.
Despite these theoretical advances and the evidence showing that the brain and the body are
inseparable, most explanatory approaches in psychology and neuroscience attempting to under-
standcognitive,emotional,andbehavioralfunctioninghavenotintegratedthesetwodimensions.
In this review, we aim to (a) provide a brief overview of different conceptualizations of intero-
ception; (b) offer an intuitive understanding of the active inference framework; (c) develop two
main hypotheses about how interoceptive dysfunctions contribute to psychopathology in disor-

hypotheses lead to experimentally testable predictions using computational approaches, such as

psychological interventions aim to correct these dysfunctional interoceptive processes.
CLASSIFICATION MODELS AND INTEROCEPTION
Classification models based on syndromes include interoceptive symptoms prominently for anxi-
ety, mood, eating, addictive, and somatic symptom disorders (Am. Psychiatr. Assoc. 2013). How-
ever,despite this reliance on interoceptive phenomenology,the concept of interoception is com-
pletelymissingindiagnosticnosology,andthishashinderedprogressinunderstandingtheclinical
impact of interoception on mental health. For example, little progress has been made to identify
interoceptivebiomarkerstoimprovethediagnosis,prognosis,ortreatmentofmentalhealthdisor-
ders(Khalsaetal.2018a),whichmaybeduetoalimitedconceptualunderstandingofinteroception
and a lack of good methodological tools that can be broadly disseminated.The reliance of classi-
fication systems upon valid and reliable terminology,and the relative paucity of such information
with respect to interoception,may be another limiting factor (see the sidebar titled Terminology
and Nomenclature). Interoception is also not clearly represented in dimensional frameworks for
biologically phenotyping mental illness,such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative
(Kozak&Cuthbert2016),eventhoughinteroceptionprovidesadirectbridgebetweenbiological
and psychological processes in numerous mental disorders.For example,interoception intersects
withthenegativevalencesystems,arousal/regulatorysystems,andcognitivesystems,anditmight
have been initially overlooked as a domain because of this overlap. Thus, interoception has not

A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTEROCEPTION
One way that mental disorders can be broadly characterized is by a dysfunction in the way the
brain computes and integrates representations of the inner and outer worlds of the body across
time. According to this view, changes in mood and anxiety are a by-product of the brain’s biased
translation of what it expects will happen versus what is actually happening in these worlds,pro-
ducing a persistent discrepancy or error signal when outcomes are observed. Whereas adaptive
functioning relies on error signals to adjust expectations, perception, and subsequently actions,
dysfunctional processing is characterized by a persistent presence of error signals due to inad-
equate adjustment. In the case of interoceptive dysfunction, persistent prediction errors reflect
dynamic breakdowns in the brain’s tightrope act of simultaneously mapping objects in the world
external to the body, mapping objects in the world internal to the body, integrating these maps
with neural representations of the predicted state of the world,and subsequently modifying these
maps over time to maintain an updated representation of the self.
Recent developments in computational neuroscience have provided a conceptual framework
and quantitative approaches to better understand and measure interoception. These approaches
have helped to reexamine the traditional view that visceral sensations arise solely from percep-
tion of the body’s internal milieu via ascending afferent pathways. Based on the notion of active
inference (Friston et al. 2009), these conceptual models suggest that interoceptive perceptions

TERMINOLOGY AND NOMENCLATURE
There is an emerging consensus about the nomenclature of different components of interoception (Khalsa et al.
2018a).Accordingtothisview,interoceptionisamultidimensionalprocesswithseveralfeaturesspanningconscious
andunconsciousstates.Interoceptivesensingoccursacrossspectrumsofhigh/lowarousalandnegative/positiveva-
lence.Itmaybepainfulornonpainful.Itusuallyoccursoutsideofconsciousawareness(e.g.,bloodglycemicindex),
and it is often but not necessarily consciously experienced during instances of homeostatic perturbation. Intero-
ception can be contrasted with interoceptive awareness, which is the act of consciously sensing, interpreting, and
integrating information about the state of inner body systems.Interoceptive awareness can be parsed into different
elementsandexaminedacrossorgansystems(Garfinkeletal.2016).Interoceptiveattentionreferstotheprocessof
observing internal bodily sensation; it can be goal directed in a top-down manner (Schulz 2016) or can be driven

of correctly and precisely monitoring the sensation as assessed by comparisons between subjective and objective
indices.Interoceptiveinsightisametacognitiveevaluationofexperienceusuallymeasuredwithrespecttoaspecific
task (e.g., confidence-accuracy correspondence). Interoceptive sensibility is a self-perceived tendency to focus on
interoceptive signals, representing a trait-like feature. Finally, interoceptive self-report scales refer to the process
of conducting psychometric assessments with a questionnaire. There are numerous measures that cover state and
traitfeatures(seeKhalsaetal.2018a),reflectingamultitudeofpsychologicalconstructsthatawaitfurtherclassifica-

are dynamically constructed by the brain, meaning that interoception is the result of an iterative
process of comparing the brain’s expectation of sensation with the incoming sensation (Barrett
& Simmons 2015,Paulus & Stein 2010,Pezzulo et al.2015, Stephan et al. 2016).Before delving
further into these conceptual models, it is important to emphasize that they represent current

Active inference starts with the premise that the perceptual process is an interaction between

of models in mind,and for each of these models the individual holds a belief as to how likely this
model is to be correct, that is, to be a true representation of the world. Interoceptive afferences
provide the brain with sensory evidence for what is happening inside the body and are evaluated
relative to a given expectation (model). Perception changes future expectations, meaning that as
a consequence of processing these afferences, the individual’s beliefs about the probabilities of
the different models will change. The manner in which these changes occur is best described in
probabilistic terms according to Bayes’ rule:
Probability (that a certain model is correct given what has been sensed)
= Probability (what has been sensed given a certain model)∗ Probability (of a certain model)
Probability (what has been sensed given all available models) .
An important aspect of Bayes’ rule is that model and evidence contribute to the perception as a
function of their precision, which can be defined as the certainty with which a model is believed
to be true and the certainty of a particular afferent given an expectation. For example, a person
at home experiencing a tap on their shoulder by their partner might have a strongly positive per-
ception,whereas the same experience in a dark alley might be perceived as frightening.However,
a tap on their shoulder in a crowded space when waiting for their partner might elicit a much
morecomplexperceptionbasedonthecertaintywithwhichthepersonbelievesthattheirpartner
should be present. Thus, the perceptual process updates the expectations for future perceptions.
Inthatsense,perceptionistheiterativeprocessofupdatingmodelswithevidencefromtheinside
oroutsideworld.Ifthesumoftheevidenceprovidesinformationthatisdifferentfromthemodel,
the brain generates a prediction error. For example, a tap on the shoulder by a burglar at home
would generate a strong prediction error.In the context of interoceptive afferences,we have pre-
viously called this a somatic error (Khalsa & Feinstein 2018) or a body prediction error (Paulus
& Stein 2006) that serves as a signal to the brain to adjust the underlying model.As stated above,
it is important to recognize that the degree of adjustment is related to the precision of the model
and the precision of the evidence. Specifically, if the model is highly precise (i.e., the individual
holds a strong expectation about the state of the inside or outside world and does not believe that
there are alternative models of the world that can properly account for the afferent signal), then
even in the presence of somatic error the model will be adjusted only slightly. In comparison, if
the evidence is not very precise (i.e., it is not clear what the afferences are signaling), the model
will not be strongly adjusted even if it differs significantly from the evidence.Two proposed inte-
roceptive processing dysfunctions are depicted inFigures 1and 2,which provide a step-by-step
walk-through of the active inference process.
It has been hypothesized that the central nervous system implements active inference percep-
tual processing hierarchically and bidirectionally (Friston 2008).This means that models exist at
different levels, and models at a lower level of the hierarchy serve as evidence for models at a
higher level. In return, higher-level models modify the expectations of the lower-level ones. For
example,an accelerated heartbeat may serve to increase the expectation of arousal,which in turn
could provide evidence for fear or excitement, depending on the context. Each of these models
is thought to consume energy, a finite resource, leading to competition within the organism for
an optimal trade-off between model complexity, accuracy, and fitness—that is, a weighing of the
model’s accuracy in representing the world against the energy spent to entertain it.Minimization
of this energetic cost,based on the free energy principle proposed by Friston,aims to provide the
computational explanation for how the brain optimizes (selects) perceptions in the presence of
multiple expectations and models (Friston et al.2013).Via the active inference process,the brain

Figure 1
Active inference-based interoceptive dysfunction 1: hyperprecise priors.This image depicts priors symbolically; the size of the
individual symbol is proportional to the degree to which the individual believes this expectation.For example,say a person is walking in
the Rocky Mountain forest and is listening for animals known to inhabit the area.Suddenly,they hear a sound (uncertain evidence) that
is paired with an interoceptive prediction (heartbeat) that is proportional to the expected percept.Soon after,they see the source of the
sound,in this case a rabbit (certain evidence).In a healthy brain (a),if the person expects to encounter a rabbit and a bear with equal
frequency,then hearing a sound will trigger competing models (bear or rabbit) and elicit preparatory interoceptive responses (e.g.,
heightened sympathetic tone).If a rabbit subsequently appears (certain evidence),a prediction error ensues that should adjust (increase)
the prior expectation of encountering a rabbit when the same sound is heard again (new uncertain evidence).The perception of the
animal thus creates a prediction error in the presence of the prior expectation,which modifies these expectations for the next encounter.
In the healthy brain,the same sound presented after seeing a rabbit no longer elicits a prediction error,and the observed sensory
evidence leads to increased weighting of exteroceptive afferent input.In contrast,in the dysfunctional brain (b),if the person is highly
convinced to begin with that a bear will come charging out of the woods (i.e.,the model is very precise),then even if they hear a rabbit,
the expectation of encountering a bear charging out of the woods will continue with little adjustment.Importantly,a prediction error
persists over time because the model is not brought into congruence with the sensory evidence,an allostatic process that is perpetuated
by increased weighting of interoceptive afferent input.

A consequence of active inference models is that certain psychiatric disorders,especially those
characterized by chronic and unrelenting anxiety,are preferentially susceptible to top-down con-
structed dysfunctions; that is, they are the consequences of a persistent mismatch between pre-
dicted body states and afferent signals from the body. It has been proposed that sustained and

tional learning about bodily states over time (Van den Bergh et al.2017),and increased allostatic
load leading to increased stress and mental illness (Peters et al.2017,Sterling 2014).

In an adaptive individual, corrective action in the presence of somatic error can be achieved
by adjusting expectations (priors) to match the current physiological state or by engaging in reg-
ulatory actions that change the afferent signal, leading the current physiological state to con-
form more closely with expectations. In either case, successful corrective action reduces somatic
error, resulting in homeostatic balance within the nervous system. However, this adaptive ad-
justment can break down in a number of ways. First, hyperprecise priors (i.e., very strong be-
liefs that a certain model is correct) may be reinforced by prolonged periods of worry and
rumination (i.e., mental rehearsals). Consequently, the priors may not get appropriately up-
dated by the incoming sensory evidence. This can create persistent somatic errors or a noisy
baseline state such that bodily perceptions fail to conform with the evidence (Paulus & Stein
2006).
In a nonadaptive person, persistent somatic errors are hypothesized to be important for gen-
erating feeling statesaimed at motivating actions toward homeostasis.Forexample,a persistently
hyperprecise prior of expecting a bear instead of a rabbit (Figure 1) may lead the individual
to experience anxiety that motivates withdrawal or avoidance—that is, the person might with-
draw from the environment associated with these overly strong beliefs. Second, context rigidity
(Figure 2),or the lack of the ability to adjust expectation as a function of context,may contribute
to the persistent experience of somatic error because the individual does not adjust prior beliefs
about different models in a new environment, a hypothesis that can be tested with a hierarchi-
cal Gaussian filter approach using separate parameters for precision,prediction errors,and mean
expectations on different temporal hierarchies (Mathys et al.2011).
Most of the processing and regulation of somatic errors occurs beneath the surface of con-
scious awareness.However,if the somatic error magnitude becomes large enough,it can directly
lead to subjective feeling states marked by prominent (often aversive) interoceptive symptoms,as
well as an obligatory motivation to act to reduce the associated discomfort and distress. Prolon-
gation of somatic error for an unsustainable period of time will eventually force the system into
attempting long-term allostatic adjustments (see sidebar titled Terminology and Nomenclature).
In the adaptive individual, successful corrective actions resolve somatic error, resulting in home-
ostasis. In the nonadaptive individual, allostatic adjustments prevail, yet they often fail to quell
somatic error and instead promote states of chronic and uncontrollable anxiety, leading to help-
lessness and depression.In severe instances,the somatic error becomes so pervasive that the only
correctiveactionthatseemstoquelltheerroriscompleteavoidanceofallperceivedtriggers(e.g.,
agoraphobia).
This interoceptively focused model of psychopathology is predicated on the assumption that
a primary function of the nervous system is to develop accurate models of the world in an effort
to establish conditions ideal for optimizing bodily functioning. Corrective action failure results
in homeostatic dysregulation, which can manifest as sudden changes in symptom intensity, mis-
labeling of symptoms,a predominant focus on bodily signals in daily life,extreme hypervigilance
towarddisturbedbodystates,aberrantself-relatedthinkingpatterns,andattemptstoreducethese

Interoceptive

between subjective and
objective indices
MEASURING INTEROCEPTION
To date, most studies assessing interoceptive awareness (see sidebar titled Terminology and
Nomenclature) have focused on interoceptive accuracy within the cardiac system using mea-
surements of heartbeat attention,heartbeat tapping,heartbeat counting,heartbeat detection,and
heartbeat perturbation (Khalsa & Lapidus 2016). Heartbeat counting tasks have been the most
popular likely due to measurement convenience, given that they require only a cardiac monitor,
andeaseofanalysis,giventhattheyuseasimpleformulathatyieldsasingleaccuracyscore.How-
ever, a number of problems with this task cast doubt on its construct validity; for example, prior
knowledge of one’s resting heart rate, IQ scores, and time estimation ability substantially influ-
ence accuracy (Murphy et al. 2018). Counting accuracy correlates poorly with measured heart
rates(Zamariolaetal.2018),isactuallyinsensitivetoheartrateincreases(Windmannetal.1999),
and is substantially influenced by cognitive strategies (Desmedt et al. 2018). Moreover, count-
ing accuracy shows limited test-retest reliability [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)= 0.41]
(Wittkamp et al. 2018) and does not correlate with more rigorous measures of cardiac intero-
ception (Ring & Brener 2018). One way that the active inference framework can reconcile these
limitations with studies showing that heartbeat counting accuracy is related to clinical symptoms
is that accuracy scores predominantly reflect altered prior beliefs about the heartbeat (i.e.,hyper-
precise priors) rather than being an objective index of sensation.
An important caveat for the use of heartbeat perception tasks as an objective measure of in-
teroception is that only a third of individuals demonstrate accurate heartbeat detection at rest
(Khalsa & Lapidus 2016),suggesting that under baseline conditions,most individuals cannot ac-
tually sense their heartbeat regardless of their self-report. Because clinically and/or emotionally
significant events are arousing and frequently associated with homeostatic deviations, restricting
assessmenttorestingconditionsfailstocaptureanimportantgeneratorofsymptomvariability.In
comparison,the method of dynamically perturbing interoceptive systems has several advantages:
(a) Perturbations may unmask clinically relevant phenomena that are not present during baseline
states; (b) based on the amount of perturbation,these approaches avoid task-related floor effects,
whichareespeciallyproblematicforcardiovascularinteroception;( c)perturbationapproachescan
be used in combination with manipulation of environmental and contextual expectancies,such as
perceived controllability; and (d) perturbations provide a naturalistic assessment of interoceptive
systemsbytriggeringhomeostaticresponsessculptedbyevolution.Homeostaticperturbationsare
feasible via noninvasive methods (e.g.,Trier social stress test),although to adequately disentangle
the effects of expectation from sensation it is preferable to utilize tasks in which the predictability
and controllability of sensory stimulation vary (see Khalsa et al.2018a).
One experimental approach to explicitly measure interoception within an active inference
framework is to set up experiments that provide an inherent ambiguity between knowable and
fundamentally uncertain information. For example, in a recent exteroceptive experiment using a
conditioningprocedure,Powersandcolleagues(2017)differentiatedindividualswhowerehearing
voicesbutwerenotpsychoticfromindividualswhoshowedbothhallucinatoryandpsychotictraits.

modelrevealedthatindividualswithhallucinationshadastrongerpriorbeliefinexperiencinghal-
lucinations.Moreover,individuals who were psychotic at baseline were less likely to change their
belief about how conditions in the experiment were changing. Taken together, these data show
that whereas hallucinating individuals express greater prior belief in having a particular percept,
psychotic individuals have a higher-order hierarchical belief that the context in which one might

NEURAL BASIS OF INTEROCEPTION
The brain sits at the interface between two worlds: the external world,which it samples through
the exteroceptive senses, and the inner world of the body, which it accesses through interocep-
tivesensorychannels.Body-sensingbrainregionsincludethosethatplayprimaryrolesindirectly
mapping the autonomic, chemosensory, endocrine, and immune systems and which relay infor-
mationfromthelaminaIspinothalamicsystemandthevagusandglossopharyngealcranialnerves
through the brainstem [e.g.,nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)],hypothalamus,and thalamus (e.g.,
ventromedialposteriorthalamicnucleus)andintocorticalsectors,includingprincipallytheinsula
andsomatosensorycortices(Craig2002,Critchleyetal.2004,Damasio1999,Feinsteinetal.2013,
Khalsa et al. 2009). The processing of information across these channels occurs in a hierarchical
fashion,with multiple feedback loops starting in early levels of the brainstem.
Each waking moment the brain is in a state of flux, attempting to match the demands of the
outside world with the world within. Prediction signals reflect one way in which the brain an-
ticipates the influence of these sensory signals on the body. Body prediction generators include
visceromotor brain regions such as the anterior insula, anterior cingulate, posterior ventrome-
dial prefrontal cortices (vmPFC), and amygdala, the majority of which are evolutionarily older
than the neocortex and have a simple cellular structure lacking a granule cell layer; those gen-
erators also include newer neocortical regions with granule cell layers, including supplementary
motor areas and the premotor cortex,implicated in other forms of autonomic control (Barrett &
Simmons 2015).Collectively,these gatekeepers help to merge the internal and external worlds so
thatthenexttimetheycollide,thebodywillbebetterpreparedtocopewiththechallengesposed
by the environment.
A somatic error is produced within the brain whenever the predicted body state differs from
the actual body signals being continuously delivered and mapped in viscerosensory regions of the
brainstem,diencephalon,insular,andsomatosensorycortices.Sucherrorisfundamentallyasum-
mative reflection of the discrepancies in predicted and observed body states as information flows

culation of somatic errors occurs in brainstem nuclei such as the NTS and in cortical structures
such as the dorsal mid-insula, both of which are uniquely situated, anatomically, to (a) compare

and regulation of somatic errors.Important hubs for the generation of prediction signals include
thevmPFC(Barrett&Simmons2015),anteriorinsula(Simmonsetal.2006),amygdala/extended
amygdala (Davis et al. 2010), and parabrachial nucleus (Herbert et al. 1990), particularly in the
context of anxious anticipation and subjective uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast, important
hubsforthedetectionofsomaticerrorsincludeNTS,oneoftheprimaryrecipientsofinterocep-
tive signals from the cranial nerves and spinal cord,and the dorsal mid/posterior insula,which is
the first cortical recipient of these afferent interoceptive signals (Craig 2002) and a region highly
responsive to bottom-up physiological changes in the viscera (Gianaros et al. 2017). Finally, the
periaqueductal gray (Roy et al.2014),amygdala (Feinstein et al.2013),and dorsal anterior cingu-
late cortex (ACC) (Shackman et al.2011) are important hubs for the regulation of somatic errors
and the inhibition of pain and panic. Differences in the laminar organization may explain how
signal transmission flows between hubs,and more specifically why granular regions of the insula
detectsomaticerrors(Barrett&Simmons2015);moreover,agranularregionssuchastheanterior
insula and ACC have outsized roles in the prediction and regulation of somatic errors. Based on
this reasoning, it is plausible that sustained somatic error dysregulation may result in long-term
brain alterations localized to the regions involved in the prediction, detection, and regulation of
somatic errors. Supportive evidence comes from functional abnormalities seen in the amygdala,
insula, and ACC during emotion processing across multiple types of anxiety disorders (Etkin &
Wager 2007) as well as structural abnormalities localized to the insula and ACC across all mental
disorders (Goodkind et al.2015).
Considerable evidence suggests that the insula plays a vital role in anxiety (Paulus & Stein
2006),and the anterior insula appears to be particularly involved in making body predictions and
gauging uncertainty (Paulus et al.2003).However,we do not subscribe to the more extreme view
that holds that the insula is necessary for interoceptive awareness (Craig 2002), self-awareness
(Craig2009),emotionalawareness(Guetal.2013),andpain(Segerdahletal.2015).Althoughthe

blunted fear in response to exteroceptive threats in the environment (Feinstein et al. 2016a); on
the other hand, they show heightened fear, and even panic, in response to interoceptive threats
such as inhaling high doses of carbon dioxide (CO
2) (Feinstein et al. 2013) or receiving bolus
infusions of isoproterenol (a synthetic form of adrenaline) (Khalsa et al.2016).Clearly the neural
circuitry for generating interoceptive states is more complex and nuanced than any single brain
region,and more research needs to focus on deciphering the initial interoceptive maps contained
within the brainstem (Chang et al.2015,Davenport & Vovk 2009).
INTEROCEPTION AND MENTAL HEALTH
Recent Developments
Giventhestrongemphasisontherelationshipbetweenself-awarenessandinteroceptionproposed
by Craig (2009), it is not surprising that a number of investigators have aimed to experimentally
elucidate the role of these constructs.Some have argued that interoceptive awareness acts to sta-
bilize the mental representation of one’s self as distinct from others (Palmer & Tsakiris 2018).

Moreover, an exteroceptively driven sense of body ownership interacts with interoceptive body
signals to create a unique sense of embodiment and bodily self (Tsakiris 2017). Consistent with
the integrative role of interoception and self is the finding that those with greater interoceptive
accuracy also report a narrower peripersonal space boundary (Ardizzi & Ferri 2018).Others have
argued that interoception and exteroception for body signals are two different ways of perceiving
the self—the first from within, the second from outside—that interact significantly (Zamariola
et al. 2017), and that this interaction serves as a central process for understanding disorders of
brain, body, and behavior (Owens et al. 2018). However, much work needs to be done to bet-
ter delineate self-relevant processing and interoceptive processing and to better understand how
these activities influence each other.
A number of constructs contribute substantially to interoceptive processing; among these are
motivation (McMorris et al. 2018), hippocampal (Stevenson et al. 2018) and nonhippocampal
learning(Pfeiferetal.2017),andconditioning(Zamanetal.2016).Cardiacinteroceptionhasbeen
linked to better learning (Stevenson et al.2018),greater retrieval of emotional faces (Pfeifer et al.
2017),and stronger expectancies for unconditioned stimuli (Zaman et al.2016).Individuals with
highinteroceptiveaccuracyhaveshownhighersensitivitytonegativeaffectbutloweraccuracyin
therecognitionoffearandsadness(Georgiouetal.2018).Lastly,interoceptiveaccuracywasasso-
ciated with more specific topographical changes after emotional stimuli (Jung et al.2017).How-
ever,other researchers have reported interference patterns between exteroceptive processing and
interoception.Forexample,visualstimulipresentedsynchronouslytotheheartbeattakelongerto

stimuli can also be interfered with by heartbeat-evoked potentials (Marshall et al.2018),which in
turn are modulated by attention (Villena-Gonzalez et al.2017).Finally,interoceptive signals may
also confer outcomes of actions; for example,some have found an accuracy-dependent pattern of
cardiac activity such that the heart accelerates less after an incorrect stimuli discrimination than
afteracorrectone(Lukowskaetal.2018).Takentogether,interoceptiveprocessingcanbothfacil-
itate and interfere with exteroceptive processing.One interpretation is that body-relevant signals

evidence of a certain stimulus coming from the external world to allow the individual to better

The broad relevance of interoceptive processing for various behaviors has led investigators to
morecloselyexaminetherelationshipbetweenimportantconstructsinpsychologyandinterocep-
tion.For example,individuals who reported greater mindfulness during psychological challenges
weremorelikelytomeetestablishedinteroceptiveaccuracycriteria(Kikenetal.2018).Invarious
time-perception experiments,accurate time perception has been linked to interoceptive accuracy
(Wittmann et al. 2011). Interoceptive sensitivity has also been associated with greater altruism
(Piech et al. 2017), greater feeling of knowing (Fiacconi et al. 2017), better prospective memory
performance (Umeda et al. 2016), better sleep (Ewing et al. 2017), and less ruminative process-
ing (Lackner & Fresco 2016).These findings,which should be considered with caution given the
different assessment procedures used, seem to suggest that interoceptive processing ability con-

Clinical Examples of Interoceptive Dysfunction

engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury reported greater interoceptive deficits than those with no self-
injury history (Smith et al. 2018). Other researchers found that these individuals had a greater
tendencytodistractthemselvesfrombodilysensationsandusedlessself-regulationbasedonbod-
ily sensations (Rogers et al. 2018). Several investigators have examined both children and adults
with autism spectrum disorder and found reduced interoceptive accuracy (Palser et al.2018) and
interoceptivesensitivity(Muletal.2018).Similarly,severalstudieshavebeenconductedwitheat-
ing disorder subjects (Jenkinson et al. 2018), postulating sensory processing deficits in bulimia
(Klabunde et al. 2017), general interoceptive appraisal dysfunctions (Brown et al. 2017), and re-
duced interoceptive accuracy (Kunstman et al.2016).Interoceptive dysfunctions of various kinds
have also been found in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (Yoris et al. 2017), bor-
derline personality disorder (Loffler et al. 2018), and female sexual arousal disorder (Handy &
Meston 2018). Several medical conditions have also been linked to interoceptive processing
deficits.Specifically,individualswithhypertensivediseaseshowpoorerinteroceptiveperformance
andreducedheart-evokedpotentialmodulations(Yorisetal.2018).PatientswithParkinson’sdis-
ease (Santangelo et al. 2018), functional motor disorders (Ricciardi et al. 2016), and fibromyal-
gia (Borg et al. 2018) also exhibit lower interoceptive accuracy. Similarly, individuals with fron-
totemporaldementiashowdeficitsinbothinteroceptiveaccuracyandperformance(Marshalletal.
2017).Thesestudiesindicatethatinteroceptivedysfunctionisnotlimitedtopsychiatricdisorders
but may be an important aspect of dysfunctional processes across medical conditions. More ro-
bust, sensitive, and quantitative assessments of these deficits may provide a truly transdiagnostic
approach to assess risk, progression, and intervention response across a broad swath of medi-
cal conditions.Below,we review in detail certain psychiatric conditions that feature prominently
within the domain of interoceptive dysfunction.
Panic disorder.Individuals with panic disorder demonstrate a prototypical sensitivity to intero-
ceptive cues signaling increased bodily arousal. Surprisingly, however, most resting measures of
cardiac interoceptive accuracy have failed to clearly demonstrate whether panic disorder patients
perceive heartbeat sensations differently or whether they have a systematic bias toward reporting
suchfeelings(Domschkeetal.2010).Ontheotherhand,manystudieshaveshownthatpanicdis-
orderpatientsperceiveinteroceptivesensationsmoreintenselywhenthebodyisstimulatedbycaf-
feineingestion(Charneyetal.1985),CO
2 inhalation(Rassovsky&Kushner2003),orintravenous

(Schunck et al. 2006), or isoproterenol (Pohl et al. 1988). This discrepancy may be explained by
the view that under resting homeostatic conditions, interoceptive signals do not have as much
biological salience as during nonhomeostatic perturbations that can signal threats to survival—
be they physical, emotional or social. Individuals with panic disorder show increased autonomic
arousal,heightened anxiety,and escape behaviors during exposure to experimental paradigms in-
volving nonpharmacological approaches (e.g., being trapped in a small dark chamber) (Richter
etal.2012)aswellaspharmacologicalones(e.g.,oralcaffeineingestion)(Benkeetal.2015).Inte-
roceptivedysfunctioninpanicdisordercanbeconceptualizedasaproblemofhyperprecisepriors
and a lack of corrective adjustment following the sensory evidence.Therefore,sensing heartbeats
in the presence of a high expectation of having a heart attack drives such patients to emergency
departments and mental health clinics under the false premise that they are dying.
Depression. The available data seem to suggest that depression is associated with blunted car-
diac interoceptive awareness. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) show lower ac-
curacy on heartbeat counting tasks (Furman et al. 2013), and depression symptoms negatively
correlate with heartbeat counting accuracy (Pollatos et al. 2009). Depressed individuals also

exhibit lower counting accuracy compared to patients with panic or anxiety disorders (Ehlers
& Breuer 1992). However, poorer resting heartbeat interoception is not always seen in depres-
sion. In a study comparing healthy participants to moderately depressed and severely depressed
patient samples,the severely depressed sample showed higher heartbeat counting scores than the
moderately depressed sample (Dunn et al. 2007). Although the authors controlled for many in-
dividual differences between the moderately depressed community and the clinical population as
a group, the more severely depressed patients were also higher in anxiety, which might explain
differences in accuracy. Indeed, in a follow-up study by the same group, poor counting accuracy
was observed in a depressed sample but was found to increase as a function of reported anxi-
ety(Dunnetal.2010).Homeostaticperturbationsindepressedpatientsyieldmixedobservations,
withsomestudiessuggestinghyperactivesympatheticrespondingandothersreportingattenuated
responsiveness(Nemeroff & Goldschmidt-Clermont2012).Patientswith MDD reported higher
levels of palpitations, restlessness, flushing, sweating, tremors, and anxiety than healthy compar-
isons during a sympathomimetic challenge with yohimbine (Heninger et al. 1988). On the other
hand, despite similar physiological responses, patients with depression were more tolerant than
panic patients to symptoms induced by CO
2 inhalation (Gorman et al. 2001). Attenuated insula
activation has also been observed in depression.Avery et al.(2014) found decreased activation in
the mid-insula during an interoceptive attention task, with insula-limbic system dysconnectivity
predicting depression severity.In a heartbeat counting study,depressed patients showed reduced
activity in the anterior insula,and this signal correlated with depression severity (Wiebking et al.
2010). In our proposed model of active inference, interoceptive processing dysfunctions can be
viewed as the consequence of allostatic load due to the persistence of prediction errors that arise
fromamismatchbetweentheinternalmodelandtheinteroceptiveafferences.However,suchdys-
functions could also be due to context rigidity,that is,a failure to adjust the model in response to
a different context.These two possibilities will need to be further investigated within the experi-
mental framework proposed above.
Somatic symptoms.Despite the exaggerated symptom reports characterizing somatic symp-
tom disorder (SSD), interoceptive awareness seems to be quite poor in SSD. SSD patients en-
dorse higher dyspnea based on contextual environmental cues and show poor task performance
(Bogaerts et al. 2008), and individuals reporting high amounts of physical symptoms have a ten-
dency to overestimate the intensity of inspiratory breathing loads (Petersen et al. 2015). Pa-
tients with psychosomatic disorders score lower on heartbeat counting tasks than healthy con-
trols (Mussgay et al. 1999). Medical outpatients complaining of palpitations show low resting
heartbeatdetectionaccuracydespitetheiroverstatedexperiences(Barskyetal.1994).Atthesame
time, these patients have poorer interoceptive distress tolerance, evidenced by greater anxiety
and physical discomfort during an exercise treadmill test (Barsky et al. 1998). The high psychi-
atriccomorbidityandlowinteroceptivetoleranceinthesepatientssuggestthatpanicandsomatic

fore, these dysfunctions are best understood as the result of a persistent discrepancy between a
model that generates strong expectations of an aversive interoceptive percept and evidence that
is at odds with this expectation, together with an inability of the prediction error to adjust the
model.

 double-blinded  infusions of  either  saline or  isoproterenol,  a  peripherally  acting  beta-adrenergic
 agonist  akin to  adrenaline  (Khalsa  et  al.  2015).  The  general  notion  was  to  perturb  the  observed
 body  state  systematically  under  different  contexts,  either  shortly  before  or  after  a  calorically  dense
 meal. In  general, AN  patients  reported  feeling  isoproterenol-induced  sensations at  the  same  rate  as
 healthy  comparison  participants,  suggesting  preserved  interoception  for  changes  in  their  observed
 body  state. However ,  there  was  one  important  exception.  During  saline  infusions,  which  did  not
 alter  the  observed  body  state,  the  patients   reported signi/f_icantly  heightened  sensations of palpita-
 tions  and  dyspnea,  and  they  disproportionately  localized  heartbeat  sensations to  the  chest  (Khalsa
 et  al.  2018b).  This  presence  of  interoceptive  sensation  without  visceral  change  suggests  that AN 
 patients  were  actually  feeling  cardiorespiratory  visceral  illusions; moreover ,  these  illusions  were
 only  present  during  the  premeal  state,  a  time  period  that  is  known to  trigger  strong  feelings  of
 fear  and  anxiety  in  patients  with AN . It  seems  possible  that  such  visceral  illusions  permeate  many
 aspects of  these  patients’ lives,  leading to  maladaptive  corrective  actions  that  often  include  a pro-
 found  avoidance of  food.  At  the  neural  level, AN  patients  also  show  exaggerated  neural  responses
 in  the  absence  of  stimulation.  For  example,  recovered  AN  patients  showed  hypoactivation  in  the
 insular  cortex  during  the  anticipation  and  resolution  of  restricted  breathing  but, surprisingly ,  not
 during  the  loads  themselves  (Berner  et  al.  2018).  This  sustained  discrepancy  into  recovery pro-
 vides  preliminary  evidence of  the  presence  of  visceral  illusions at  the  neural  level  as  well. T  aken
together ,   these /f_indings  support  the  hypothesis  that AN  patients may   have context-speci/f_ic  (e.g.,
 hunger  state)  hyperprecise  priors  that  generate  strong  expectations  about  visceral  sensations. Im-
portantly , it may  be  the  selection  of  particular  actions  in  response  to  these  hyperprecise  priors
 (e.g.,  starvation  to  avoid  the  actual  sensing  of  visceral  sensations)  that  forms  one  core  feature of 
 the psychopathology.
 Anxiety sensitivity .  Corrective  actions  are  not  always  adaptive  and  can  readily  perpetuate psy-
chopathology ,  as  evidenced  by  the  slippery  slope  of  anxiety sensitivity . The  trait of  anxiety sensi-
 tivity  refers  to  an individual’ s  fear of  experiencing  anxiety-related  symptoms  and  sensations, espe-
 cially  those  arising  from  within  the  body  (e.g.,  heart  palpitations or  dyspnea);  such  fear  is  a  core
 dimensional  construct  underlying  the  initiation  and  maintenance  of  pathological  anxiety (T  aylor
 2014).  Individuals  with  high  levels of  anxiety  sensitivity  often  believe  that  these  sensations  can  lead
 to  adverse  consequences  such  as  death, insanity , or  social  rejection.  Such  catastrophic misinterpre-
 tations  make  anxiety  sensitivity an   anxiety ampli/f_ier;  people  with  high  levels of  anxiety  sensitivity
 are  quickly  alarmed  by  anxiety-related  sensations,  and  this   further intensi/f_ies  their  anxiety  and re-
 inforces  their  avoidance.  For  this  reason,  anxiety  sensitivity  has  been  referred  to  as  a  fundamental
 fear  that  is  distinct  from  derivative  ones,  such  that  the  fear of  anxiety  can  provide  a  motive  for
 avoiding  any  stimulus  likely to  incite  anxious  symptoms  (McNally  2002). Consequently ,  most pa-
 tients  with  pathological  anxiety  also  have  heightened  anxiety sensitivity ,  including  patients  with
 panic disorder ,  agoraphobia,  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  generalized  anxiety disorder ,
 and  social  anxiety  disorder as  well as  depression  and  substance  addiction  (Naragon-Gainey  2010,
 Olatunji  & Wolitzky-T  aylor 2009).
 Recent  evidence  suggests  that  reducing  anxiety  sensitivity may  be  important  for  the preven-
 tion  and  treatment  of  anxiety  across  diagnostic  categories.  Prospective  studies  have  shown  that
 anxiety  sensitivity  is  a  strong  predictor  for  the  onset  of  mood  and  anxiety  disorders  and  the de-
 velopment of  spontaneous  panic  attacks (T  aylor  2014, T elch  et  al.  2012),  whereas  longitudinal
 studies  have  shown  that  individuals  with  high  anxiety  sensitivity  have  a  propensity  for  greater
 chronicity  of  illness  and  a  higher  likelihood  of  experiencing  future  anxiety  symptoms (Naragon-
 Gainey  2010,  Schmidt  et  al.  2006).  Controlled  studies  have  demonstrated signi/f_icant  reductions
 in  anxiety  sensitivity  following  successful  treatment  with  psychotherapy  (Smits  et  al.  2008a) or

pharmacotherapy(Simonetal.2004),andseveraltransdiagnostictreatmentshavebeendeveloped
to specifically target anxiety sensitivity using different forms of interoceptive exposure (Deacon
et al. 2012, Worden et al. 2015). Taken together, this evidence supports the notion that anxiety
sensitivity is a fundamental driver of anxiety, and treatments that target anxiety sensitivity have
the potential of helping patients overcome anxiety irrespective of their specific anxiety diagnosis
(Boswell et al.2013).
Inthecontextofthisframework,anxietysensitivitycanbeconceptualizedasmanifestingfrom
two primary disturbances: (a) hyperprecise priors that generate exaggerated body predictions
whenever exposed to sensory signals that have become associated with anxiety, and (b)t h ep e r -
sistent triggering of abnormally large somatic errors by sensory signals (either real or imagined)
irrespective of context, that is, context rigidity. These sensitized sensory triggers lead to somatic
error, followed by corrective action that upregulates the observed body state to be more in line
with the predicted body state. However, by upregulating the very visceral signals one is sensi-
tized to, the process can quickly escalate into a vicious cycle that culminates in the avoidance of
all sensory cues associated with the experience of anxiety. Although avoidance of perceived trig-
gers quickly reduces the somatic error, the relief is only temporary, and the vicious cycle returns
wheneverthetriggerisonceagainencountered.Becausetheultimategoalofthecorrectiveaction
is to minimize somatic error as quickly and efficiently as possible, whether or not the corrective
action is adaptive or maladaptive is not considered during the regulatory process.For this reason,

If the body is the nexus by which therapies can directly alter interoceptive states, then it follows
that body-based therapies should provide a more direct entry point by which to manipulate the
interoceptive system and correct somatic error.These practices provide the brain with an intense
inflow of salient and unambiguous bottom-up sensory inputs, albeit across different interocep-
tive channels depending on the intervention, ultimately forcing a shift (or potentially a reset) in
the brain’s mapping of the observed body state.
Based on our framework, exposure-based therapies principally target avoidance behaviors by

nisms such as habituation and desensitization, but importantly, it seems to rely on the successful
learningofnewinformationviaexpectancyviolations(e.g.,bychangingone’sexpectationofharm
when encountering an avoided situation) (Craske et al.2008).
Exposure therapy focuses on introducing patients to a range of different anxiety-inducing sit-
uations, contexts, memories, and thoughts. For any given individual, especially individuals with
high levels of anxiety sensitivity, there could exist a myriad of different contexts and stimuli that
can trigger feelings of anxiety, making it impossible to expose one to all possibilities. If it is true
that context rigidity is part of anxious psychopathology within an active inference framework,
then systematically changing expectations in one context may facilitate using the adjusted model
in another context. Interoceptive exposure therapy capitalizes on the fact that priors focused on
interoceptive afferences may generalize more easily than exteroceptive stimuli (which can differ
dramatically from one context to the next). Anxiety sensitivity, the target of most interoceptive
exposure interventions, has historically been conceptualized as distress in response to symptoms
of fear and anxiety (e.g., elevated heart rate and other indicators of sympathetic arousal). How-
ever,this sensitivity to the physical symptoms of anxiety may be part of a broader aversion to any
physical symptom that has been conditioned to an aversive emotional state. This broader con-
struct can be reframed as somatic sensitivity, and it incorporates all forms of somatic sensations
that have been aversively conditioned (Domschke et al. 2010). Interoceptive exposure serves to
weaken this conditioned association through extinction learning,whereby instead of erasing pre-
viously learned associations (e.g.,between physical sensations and aversive emotional outcomes),
these same physical sensations acquire new, competing associations (e.g., they are safe, tolerable,
and do not always lead to an aversive outcome) that serve to inhibit the original conditioned as-
sociation (Boettcher et al.2016).
Themosteffectiveinteroceptiveexposurescloselyreproducethespecificsensationsassociated
with a given patient’s emotional distress. For example, interoceptive exposure for panic disorder
uses strategies that direct patients to attend to their feared sensations and challenge their catas-
trophic cognitions so that the sensations of physiological arousal no longer provoke panic and
avoidance behavior (Stewart & Watt 2008).To date,the majority of interoceptive exposures have
focused on reproducing cardiovascular sensations (e.g.,racing heart),respiratory sensations (e.g.,
shortnessofbreath),orvestibularsensations(e.g.,dizziness)usingsimpleandcontrollableprovo-
cation procedures (e.g., running in place to achieve a racing heart, breathing through a straw to
achieve shortness of breath,spinning in circles to achieve dizziness).Beyond treating panic disor-
der with agoraphobia (Craske et al. 1997, Meuret et al. 2018), interoceptive exposure techniques
havebeensuccessfullyappliedtootherconditions(Khouryetal.2018),includingPTSD(Wald&
Taylor2008),socialanxiety(Dixonetal.2015),eatingdisorders(Boswelletal.2015),substanceuse
disorders (Zvolensky et al. 2003), and somatic symptom disorders like irritable bowel syndrome
(Craske et al.2011).
Mindfulness techniques represent a different approach to processing aversive interoceptive
sensations,whichmayhelpminimizesomaticerrorsbyshiftingattentionawayfromthepredicted
body state and toward the observed body state (Farb et al. 2015). In the ideal setting, body pre-
dictions and somatic error signals may naturally dissipate as the mind attempts to function with
low-precisionpriorsthattriggerfewerregulatoryresponses,allowingthe entirepredictivemodel
to be driven by incoming sensory input from the present moment in time. Despite promising
results early on (Hofmann et al. 2010), recent meta-analyses have found rather small effects for
mindfulness-based interventions in clinically anxious populations, with many patients finding it
difficulttosustaintheirattentiononpresent-momentinteroceptivesensations(Goyaletal.2014).

Mindfulness has fared better for depression, showing medium to large effects for preventing re-
lapse (Goldberg et al.2018),although it is unclear how much of these effects are being driven by
mindfulness per se or by the cognitive component of the therapy.
OurgrouphasrecentlystartedinvestigatingFloatation-REST(ReducedEnvironmentalStim-
ulation Therapy),an intervention that attenuates exteroceptive sensory input to the nervous sys-
tem through the act of floating supine in a pool of water saturated with Epsom salts. The float
experience is calibrated so that sensory signals from visual,auditory,olfactory,gustatory,thermal,
tactile,vestibular,gravitational,and proprioceptive channels are minimized,as is most movement
and speech. The effect of this profound sensory reduction appears to be one of heightened in-
teroceptive awareness and physiological relaxation (Feinstein et al. 2018a). Initial studies have
shownthatFloatation-RESTleadstolowerlevelsofchronicanxietyingeneralizedanxietydisor-
der(Jonsson&Kjellgren2016)aswellaslowerlevelsofacuteanxietyinpatientswithheightened
anxiety sensitivity (Feinstein et al. 2018b). By attenuating all external sensory input to the brain,
environmentally triggered predictions are minimized, creating a unique circumstance in which
predictive models have very little incoming sensory information. This reduced sensory environ-
ment may provide an anxious and hypervigilant nervous system with a rare respite from the daily
barrage of external triggers and stressors that it has been sensitized to over the years.Moreover,a
reduction in muscle tension,especially in the upper and lower back,was one of the more promi-
nent effects we have found so far in our float research (Feinstein et al. 2018a,b); such reduction
couldbeplayinganespeciallyimportantrole,giventhatarecentstudyfoundthatmusculoskeletal
pain and tension is the most commonly reported somatic symptom across all types of depressive
andanxietydisorders(Bekhuisetal.2015).Weconsideritpossiblethatthefloatenvironmentmay
help facilitate access to mindful states because it seems to provide a robust enhancement of inte-
roceptive awareness for cardiorespiratory sensations, helping individuals to focus their attention
on the observed body state and on present-moment sensations such as the breath (Feinstein et al.
2018a). In anxious patients, this interoceptive enhancement may weaken the bond between vis-
ceral sensations and anxiety,especially when these sensations are experienced against a backdrop
of reduced muscle tension and physiological relaxation. Ultimately, this may lead to long-term
reductions in anxiety sensitivity and to the formation of a new predictive model, one that links
the experience of visceral sensations with a state of relaxation instead of anxiety (Feinstein et al.
2018a).
Another potentially promising interoceptive approach is whole body hyperthermia (WBH),
whichinvolvestheselectivestimulationofheat-sensitivethermosensorypathwaysprojectingfrom
the skin to subcortical and cortical brain regions to achieve an elevated core body temperature
of 38.5°C. A recent randomized sham-controlled trial found that a single session of WBH pro-
duced a significant antidepressant effect lasting up to six weeks in depressed patients (Janssen
et al. 2016). Although the underlying mechanism is uncertain, the study’s effective sham control
suggests that the active antidepressant component was related to the heightened modulation of
observed thermosensory and, possibly, inflammatory signals from the body. From the perspec-
tive of somatic error,this intervention also relies heavily on modulation of the current body state,
potentially forcing a recalibration of the prior set point. Other interventions involving intero-
ceptive modulations of the observed body state that have been found to benefit mental health
include the following: the modulation of muscle tension via Swedish massage (Rapaport et al.
2016),yoga (Jeter et al.2015),and exercise (Smits et al.2008b); repeated brief exposures to high
doses of CO
2 (Wolpe 1987); and cyclic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and sup-
pressionoftheimmuneresponsethroughcoldimmersionandCO 2 modulationusingalternating
cycles of hyperventilation followed by breath holding (Kox et al.2014).

CONCLUSION
Interoception is essential for maintaining a homeostatic balance between the brain and the body
inadynamicallychangingworld.IfDarwin’sthesisistrue,andthesurvivalofthespeciesdepends
on the ability to adaptively respond to change, then the active inference framework described
herehighlightstwopotentialfailuresofadaptation:hyperprecisepriorsandcontextrigidity.Both
create an insensitivity to change,leading to persistent somatic error,unsustainable allostatic load,
maladaptive corrective actions, and eventually psychopathology. There remain many details to
workout.Forexample,whatrolesdodifferentbrainregionsandbrainstemnucleiplayinthisdy-
namicprocess?Whatarethedevelopmental,physiological,andbehavioralbasesfortheproposed
interoceptive dysfunctions? How can interventions be targeted to ameliorate these dysfunctions,
and does accomplishing this objective improve mental health? It is our hope that the active in-
ference approach to interoceptive psychopathology will provide a framework for answering these
questions and advancing our understanding of the role of interoception in mental health.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
1. Investigations of interoceptive psychopathology within an active inference framework
should model the influence of hyperprecise priors and context rigidity in generating
somatic error.
2. Somatic error detection and interoceptive awareness can be optimized using homeo-
static perturbations and exposure to anxiogenic stimuli that vary in predictability and
controllability.
3. Sustainedsomaticerrordysregulationmayresultinlong-termbrainalterationslocalized
to regions involved in the prediction,detection,and regulation of somatic errors.
4. Body-based interoceptive interventions provide a direct entry point by which to manip-
ulate the interoceptive system and correct somatic error.
