The primary motor cortex (M1) is increasingly being recognized for its vital role in proprioceptive somatosensation. However, our 
current understanding of proprioceptive processing at the laminar scale is limited. Empirical findings in primates and rodents suggest 
a pronounced role of superficial cortical layers, but the involvement of deep layers has yet to be examined in humans. Submillimeter 
resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged in recent years, paving the way for studying layer-dependent 
activity in humans (laminar fMRI). In the present study, laminar fMRI was employed to investigate the influence of proprioceptive 
somatosensation on M1 deep layer activation using passive finger movements. Significant M1 deep layer activation was observed in 
response to proprioceptive stimulation across 10 healthy subjects using a vascular space occupancy (VASO)-sequence at 7 T. For further 
validation, two additional datasets were included which were obtained using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence with 
ultrahigh (0.3 mm) in-plane resolution, yielding converging results. These results were interpreted in the light of previous laminar fMRI 
studies and the active inference account of motor control. We propose that a considerable proportion of M1 deep layer activation is due 
to proprioceptive influence and that deep layers of M1 constitute a key component in proprioceptive circuits.

Introduction 
Theprimarymotorcortex(M1)playsakeyroleingeneratingcorti-
cospinal output to facilitate voluntary movement, relying heavily 
on contextual information from other brain regions associated 
with limb position, limb kinematics, motor planning, etc. Beyond 
its well-known motor functions, M1 is increasingly recognized as 
acriticalhubforprocessingproprioceptivesomatosensation—the 
sense of body position and movement (
Naito 2004; Hatsopoulos 
and Suminski 2011). Proprioceptive inputs to M1 originate from 
muscle spindles and joint receptors, providing essential feedback 
for seamless coordination of movement and spatial awareness 
(Proske and Gandevia 2012).As such,understanding how proprio-
ception is processed in M1 has significant implications for motor 
control theories and clinical contexts, including neurorehabilita-
tion and neurodegenerative diseases. 
The present understanding of the circuitry underlying infor-
mation passing in M1 is primarily derived from tracer studies in 
rodents and nonhuman primates (Fig. 1A).Briefly,somatosensory 
input (including proprioception and tactile sources) has consis-
tently been reported to terminate in superficial depths of M1 (lay-
ers II to III and layer Va) (
Shipp 2005; Mao et al. 2011; Adams et al. 
2013; Petrof et al. 2015; Hooks 2017). The reciprocal connection 
to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) also originates from 
these layers (Mao et al. 2011; Hooks 2017). Motor-related inputs 
from frontal and secondary motor areas may terminate more 
widelyacrossthefullcorticaldepthbutappeartofavorsuperficial 
layers (Barbas and Pandya 1987; Watanabe-Sawaguchi et al. 1991; 
Adams et al.2013; Hooks 2017; Ninomiya et al.2019).Importantly, 
these inputs are transmitted from superficial depths to pyramidal 
cells in layer V via strong interlaminar connections where they 
influence corticospinal and corticothalamic outputs (
Weiler et al.
2 | Knudsen et al.
Fig. 1. Study overview. A) Model of possible M1 microcircuitry, based on animal literature (references listed in main text). Most input to M1 arrives 
in superficial layers, and the majority of output (corticofugal) originates from deep layers. The strong intracolumnar projection from superficialt o 
deep layers is consistent with the view that preprocessed information from superficial layers is integrated by deep layers before the resulting output is 
directed to, eg the spinal cord (
Bastos et al. 2012). Superficial and deep layers can thus be roughly segregated into input and output layers, respectively. 
B) Illustration of the research questions of the present study. Previous laminar fMRI studies found robust M1 deep layer activation during active finger 
movements, interpreted to primarily reflect motor output (see main text). Here, we test if passive movement (proprioceptive stimulation, no motor 
output) also activates deep layers of M1. This would suggest that proprioception, alongside motor output, contributes to the deep layer signal observed 
during active movements. Please note that we do not make predictions about the relative laminar activation strength between active and passive 
conditions,andtheresponseamplitudewasthusdeliberatelymadeequalinthismodel.Thedepth-dependentsignalwasmodeledastwopeaksbasedon 
prior M1 laminar fMRI studies (see main text).C) Illustration of the methodological setup used to assess this question.Two different fMRI sequences with 
a complementary set of strengths and weaknesses were used in separate sessions,ie VASO and 2D-bSSFP.All sessions included active and passive finger 
movements. The finger was moved voluntarily by self-generated force during active finger movements (red device, top panel). For passive movements, 
subjects would relax while their finger was moved by an fMRI-compatible pneumatic muscle driven by air pressure (blue device, top panel, 
Lolli et al. 
2019). These conditions alternated with rest in a block-designed manner and were performed in separate runs in counterbalanced order (middle panel). 
The bottom panel shows the perpendicular slice placement with respect to the cortical surface of M1 due to anisotropic voxels. 
2008; Bastos et al. 2012; Shipp 2016). The majority of corticofugal 
output cells are located in deep layers Vb (corticospinal/upper 
motor neurons) and VI (corticothalamic). It is currently unknown 
whether a similar input/output structure is present in human M1, 
primarily due to a lack of human-relevant methodology operating 
at the scale of cortical layers. 
To this end, the advent of laminar fMRI (Lawrence et al. 2019; 
Norris and Polimeni 2019; Bandettini et al. 2021) has enabled 
assessment of the layer-dependent functional organization in 
humans,underpinningprominenttheoriesofbrainfunction,such 
as predictive coding (Rao and Ballard 1999; Stephan et al. 2019). 
Laminar fMRI was employed by Huber et al. (2017) to compare 
laminar activation of the M1 hand representation in response to 
tasks with varying degrees of motor and somatosensory involve-
ment. Active finger movements elicited a double peak response 
pattern with signal increases in both superficial and deep layers, 
which has been replicated in several subsequent studies (
Huber 
et al. 2018; Beckett et al. 2020; Chai et al. 2020; Guidi et al. 2020; 
Persichetti et al. 2020; Shao et al. 2021; Knudsen et al. 2023; 
Pais-Roldán et al.2023).Moreover,tactile stimulation (Huber et al. 
2017; Shao et al. 2021) and imagined finger movements ( Turner 
2016; Persichetti et al. 2020), both of which presumably lack 
corticospinal motor output,were found to predominantly activate 
superficial layers. Informed by the animal literature (see Fig. 1A), 
the general interpretation across these studies has therefore been 
that superficial peak activation mainly reflects somatosensory 
and premotor input, while the deep peak reflects motor output 
(seealso
Dumoulin2017;Larkumetal. 2018;McColganetal. 2020). 
Due to a paucity of studies employing a direct proprioceptive 
control condition, the pattern of laminar activation associated 
with proprioceptive somatosensation is currently unknown. 
Although tactile somatosensory processing appears to pre-
dominantly engage the superficial layers of M1, proprioceptive 
somatosensory processing may additionally engage deep layers. 
For example, the lack of robust deep layer activation during 
tactile somatosensory stimulation might simply be due to the 
fact that signals were extracted from the phylogenetically older 
and upper part of M1 (BA4a) (
Huber et al. 2017; Shao et al. 
2021), which has few tactile responsive cells (Rathelot and Strick 
2009). In contrast, proprioceptive responsive cells are particularly 
concentrated in that region ( Tanji and Wise 1981; Strick and 
Preston 1982; Stepniewska et al. 1993). Also, electrophysiological 
measurements obtained during proprioceptive stimulation in 
nonhuman primates demonstrated activation in pyramidal tract 
cells, which are selectively located in deep layers (
Wiesendanger 
1973; Lemon and Porter 1976). However, it remains unknown 
whether such activation extends to humans. Although human 
positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI studies have
Cerebral Cortex, 2025, Vol. 35, Issue 4| 3
consistently reported robust M1 activation in response to 
proprioceptive stimulation induced by passive movements, these 
studies lacked the spatial resolution necessary to decipher the 
laminar origin of the measured signals ( Weiller et al. 1996; 
Ciccarelli et al. 2005; Guzzetta et al. 2007; Blatow et al. 2011; 
Mehta et al. 2012; Michels et al. 2014). 
In the present study, we aimed to determine the laminar 
response of human M1 to proprioceptive stimulation.Specifically, 
we used 7 T laminar fMRI with vascular space occupancy (VASO) 
(
Huber et al. 2014) and 2D passband balanced steady-state 
free precession (2D-bSSFP) sequences ( Miller 2012; Scheffler 
et al. 2018) to examine whether passive finger movements 
(proprioceptive stimulation) elicit deep layer responses in the 
hand knob of contralateral M1 ( Fig. 1B). Addressing this basic 
neuroscience question may advance our understanding of 
laminarfunctioninhumanM1andcontributetothedevelopment 
and validation of theories concerning motor control and 
somatosensory perception. 
Materials and methods 
Subjects 
A total of 12 healthy volunteers (23 to 30 years, 6 females) partic-
ipated in the study. The 2D-bSSFP dataset of one subject, which 
was also scanned with VASO, was excluded due to excessive 
motion and nonperpendicular slice placement (
Imaging Protocol). 
Analysis was thereby performed on 10 VASO subjects and 2 2D-
bSSFP subjects (one of which was scanned twice across differ-
ent days to display the reliability of 2D-bSSFP activation maps, 
Supplementary Fig. S1)( Fig. 1C). Before participation, all subjects 
provided written consent and were carefully informed about the 
procedures, approved by the institutional review board (2012-IRB-
011) of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
Active and passive movement devices 
Passive finger tapping was performed using a fMRI-compatible 
device inspired by (
Lolli et al. 2019)( Fig. 1C). It was driven by 
a fluidic muscle (DMSP type, diameter 10 mm, length of the 
contracting part 150 mm; Festo AG & Co, Esslingen, Germany), 
which shortens upon increased air pressure and extends toward 
itsinitialpositionuponpressurerelease.Airsupplywascontrolled 
via a preprogrammed electrical valve to obtain the desired fre-
quency and amplitude. An identical device was used for active 
tapping except it did not contain any muscle (
Fig. 1C). The design 
goal was to make active and passive movements as similar as 
possible to standardize sensory input. A custom-made handprint 
was positioned around each device for each subject to standard-
ize the amplitude of vertical movement across conditions while 
enabling subjects to switch devices within the scanner. A soft pad 
was inserted inside the active device to roughly match impact 
forces between the movable part (to which the finger is attached) 
and the outer tube across conditions. 
Imaging protocol 
Rationale behind choice of functional sequences 
We intended to assess the laminar pattern of passive movements 
within the same functional region as in previous laminar M1 
studies, ie the part of the hand knob in Brodmann area 4a (BA4a) 
expressing a double peak response pattern during active move-
ments (
Huber et al.2017; Beckett et al.2020; Chai et al.2020; Guidi 
et al. 2020; Persichetti et al. 2020; Han et al. 2021; Shao et al. 2021; 
Knudsen et al. 2023; Pais-Roldán et al. 2023). Observing distinct 
peaks at certain depths not only facilitates comparison with 
existing literature but also enhances confidence in the activation 
of the underlying layer. That is, it helps rule out the possibility 
that the observed signal is merely an artifact of blurring or partial 
voluming from adjacent activated layers. Accordingly, 3D-echo 
planar imaging (EPI) SS-SI-VASO (
Huber et al. 2014) was chosen 
as the main sequence due to its cerebral blood volume (CBV)-
weighted contrast associated with high laminar specificity, which 
has proven successful for reliable identification of the double 
peak feature (
Huber et al. 2017; Beckett et al. 2020; Guidi et al. 
2020; Persichetti et al. 2020). The strong microvascular weighting 
of VASO, however, results in inherently reduced contrast-to-noise 
ratio (CNR), which was amplified by a relatively weak propriocep-
tive stimulus (passive movement of a single finger with a small 
range of motion),yielding noisy activation maps and laminar pro-
files.Tofurthersupportthatdeeplayersignalisarobustfeatureof 
proprioceptive stimulation, we included additional data from two 
subjects scanned with 2D-bSSFP.This sequence was also expected 
capable of resolving laminar activation peaks due to its ultrahigh 
in-plane resolution (0.3 mm), minimal T2∗-based blurring, no 
spatial distortions, and spin echo-like contrast mechanism yield-
ing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast with reduced 
sensitivity toward spatially unspecific large veins.Combined with 
relatively high sensitivity, it was expected to facilitate further 
support for our main conclusion at the level of individual subjects 
(
Miller 2012; Báez-Yánez et al. 2017; Scheffler et al. 2018; Liang 
et al. 2022). 
Sequence parameters 
Imaging was performed using a MAGNETOM 7 T MRI scanner 
(Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 
standard 32Ch-receive head coil (NOVA Medical, Wilmington, 
MA, USA) and a SC72 body gradient coil for spatial encoding. 
Anatomical T1-weighted images were acquired with an MP2RAGE 
sequence (
Marques et al. 2010) and parameters: TR=4,000 ms, 
TE =3.05 ms, voxel size=0.7 mm isotropic, field of view 
(FOV)=224 × 224 × 179.2 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor=3, 
TI1=750 ms with flip angle=4 deg and TI2=2,500 ms with 
flip angle=5 deg, phase and slice partial Fourier factor=7/8, 
bandwidth=240 Hz/px). 
The parameters of the functional sequences were: 
• VASO: voxel size=0.82 ×0.82×1.5 mm3, TI1/TI2=1,593/3,780 
ms, volume acquisition time (nulled and not-nulled com-
bined)=4,872 ms, TE=25 ms, GRAPPA acceleration factor=3, 
phasepartialFourier=6/8,bandwidth1064Hz/px,andmatrix 
size=162
×216×26. A variable flip angle scheme was used to 
minimize T1-related blurring (see Huber et al. 2017). 
• 2D-bSSFP: v oxel size=0.3 ×0.3×3 mm3, slice acquisition 
time=3 s, TE=4.79 ms, TR=9.58 ms, no parallel imaging, 
no partial Fourier, nominal flip angle=35 deg, bandwidth 
174 Hz/px, and matrix size 302 ×320×1. Prior to acquiring 
data for each slice, a series of radio frequency (RF) pulses 
were applied to ensure that the MRI signal reached a steady 
state. To avoid the banding artifact of bSSFP images, we 
carefully adjusted the RF frequency to keep the region of 
interest (ROI) in the middle of the passband off-resonance 
profile.AseriesofimageswerecollectedwithanRFfrequency 
shift (
/Delta1f) from −70 to 70 Hz with a step of 10 Hz. The optimal
/Delta1f was determined from the off-resonance profile from the 
location of interest in M1 gray matter. 
Both functional sequences had partial brain coverage. Imaging 
slabs were placed in the left hemisphere to cover the hand knob 
(
Yousry et al. 1997) in the upper part of M1, ie BA4a, in line with
4 | Knudsen et al.
previous M1 laminar fMRI studies. Due to the anisotropic voxels 
in VASO and 2D-bSSFP, slabs were placed perpendicularly to the 
cortical surface of the hand knob (Fig. 1C). 
Experimental paradigm and procedures 
Prior to scanning, subjects practiced reproducing the passive 
movement pattern (∼1.5–2 cm amplitude, 2 Hz movement fre-
quency) during active movements of the right index finger and 
were instructed to completely relax during the passive condition. 
Movement frequency was guided visually by blinking text saying 
either “you tap” for the active condition, “machine tap” for the 
passive condition, or “relax,” presented with an MRI-compatible 
projector onto a semitransparent screen (1,024 × 768, 60 Hz). 
The visual stimuli were programmed in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.) 
using the Psychophysics Toolbox (
Brainard 1997). Subjects were 
asked to keep their fixations on the visual stimuli during the 
whole experiment, except in resting periods between runs. Each 
session consisted of an anatomical scan (T1-weighted MP2RAGE) 
followed by 2 functional runs per condition for VASO sessions and 
3–4 runs per condition for 2D-bSSFP. Each run had a duration of 
12 min for VASO and 6 min for 2D-bSSFP. In active runs, ∼30 s of 
restalternatedwith∼30sofactivemovementwiththerightindex 
finger. Passive runs alternated between∼3 0so fr e s ta n d∼3 0so f 
passive movement where the subject would relax while the finger 
was moved by the device (
Fig. 1C). The order of conditions was 
counterbalanced across subjects, and, after finishing the runs of 
one condition, subjects were asked to slowly shift from the active 
to the passive device (or vice versa) while trying to minimize head 
motion. Head motion was restricted by custom-made bite bars. 
A functional localizer run (12 min of active finger movements) 
using a 2D gradient echo EPI BOLD sequence (volume acqui-
sition time: 2,000 ms, TE: 25.6 ms, flip angle: 80 deg, GRAPPA 
acceleration factor: 3, phase partial Fourier: 6/8, voxel size: 
0.75
×0.75×0.86 mm3, and matrix size: 170×170×28) was included 
at the end of VASO sessions for the purpose of ROI definition (see 
ROI Definition). 
Data analysis 
Preprocessing 
The VASO data underwent standard preprocessing steps in line 
with previous laminar VASO studies (Huber et al. 2017; Finn et al. 
2019). SS-SI-VASO produces two time series in an alternating 
fashion,one where the blood-signal is nulled and another without 
blood-nulling (BOLD time series). Nulled and not-nulled images 
were motion-corrected separately with theapplicationof a spatial 
weighting mask to optimize the realignment around M1 using 
SPM12 (Functional Imaging Laboratory, University College Lon-
don, UK). To correct for the influence of positive BOLD effects, 
which counteract the negative CBV response, dynamic division 
of nulled and not-nulled images was implemented after trial 
averaging using the LN 
BOCO function in LAYNII (version 2.4.0) 
(Huber et al. 2014; Huber et al. 2021). Realigned nulled and not-
nulled images were further used to compute an image with T1-
weighted anatomical contrast (Huber et al. 2017),which was used 
as a “high-quality reference image” for nonlinear registration of 
the MP2RAGE image to EPI space.This coregistration step was per-
formed by combining rigid, affine and nonlinear (SyN-algorithm) 
transformations in ANTs (
Avants et al. 2011). 
ThebSSFP datawere preprocessedusingAnalysisof Functional 
NeuroImages (AFNI) ( Cox 1996), including removal of outliers 
using 3dToutcount (the definition of outliers used here is described 
in the AFNI documentation, https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/ 
dist/doc/program_help/3dToutcount.html), motion correction 
(in-plane only, ie two translation and one rotation parame-
ters using 3dAllineate), brain masking, and coregistration of 
the T1 weighted anatomical volume to the mean functional 
image with localized Pearson correlation as the cost function 
(align 
epi anat.py). Functional bSSFP images have minimal distor-
tions,analogous to MP2RAGE,and high-quality coregistration was 
thus possible using linear transformations only (
Liang et al.2022). 
For all sequences, activation maps were computed voxel-wise 
as the average of condition-block timepoints minus the average 
of resting-block timepoints. This difference was converted to 
percent signal change by dividing by the average of resting-
block timepoints. The first two volumes of the nulled and 
not-nulled data, as well as the first four volumes of the 2D-
bSSFP data, were discarded to limit the influence of transition 
periods. Also, activation-induced CBV increases result in negative 
VASO signal changes, and the corresponding activation maps 
were thus inverted. To reduce noise in the activation maps, 
within-layer smoothed versions were also generated. This was 
done using LAYNII’s LN2 
LAYER SMOOTH (full width at half 
maximum (FWHM)=0.75 mm for VASO, FWHM=0.5 mm for 2D-
bSSFP), including the option to mask out activation outside the 
segmentation boundaries (
Huber et al. 2021). These maps were 
used for visualization of the activation maps only. 
ROI definition 
ROIs were defined by first identifying the hand knob based on its 
omega-shaped anatomical landmark (
Yousry et al. 1997). Then, 
to identify the double peak region, VASO activation maps of the 
active condition were used to localize the subregion of the hand 
knob in area BA4a that most clearly expressed a double peak 
response pattern, inspired by 
Persichetti et al. (2020).S i n c e V A S O 
activation maps had relatively low CNR, independent localizer 
maps with BOLD contrast were used to confirm robust responses 
to index finger movements in the selected area. Connected ROIs 
spanning 1–2 slices and without holes were manually drawn in 
this area, with columnar widths roughly corresponding to that 
expected from individual finger representations in M1 (
Huber 
et al. 2020). The same procedure was followed for 2D-bSSFP, 
except it was done on the single available slice. For the subject 
that was scanned twice with 2D-bSSFP, we selected the ses-
sion with strongest activation for the active condition to evalu-
ate the response to passive movements. The other session was 
used to assess the robustness of activation maps across sessions 
(Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Note that since data from the active 
condition were used to extract ROIs, we only statistically ana-
lyzed data from the passive condition to avoid “double dipping” 
(
Kriegeskorte et al. 2009). Laminar profiles corresponding to the 
active condition are still shown for reference but are likely biased 
and should be interpreted as such. 
Laminar profiles and assignment of cortical layers to 
relative depths 
For VASO,white matter (WM)/gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF)/GM boundaries were drawn manually around ROIs 
based on MP2RAGE images and used to compute equidistant 
depth maps with LAYNII’s LN2 LAYERS (Huber et al. 2021). This 
was done on an upsampled grid with 0.2 mm in-plane reso-
lution. The same procedure was followed for 2D-bSSFP, except 
that upsampling was not required due to the inherently high 
in-plane resolution of this sequence. Laminar profiles with 18 
bins were generated for each condition by computing the average 
percent signal change across all ROI voxels within each bin (no 
thresholding).
Cerebral Cortex, 2025, Vol. 35, Issue 4| 5
Layer Va’s approximate depth and width were inferred from 
laminar thickness estimates outlined in Zilles and Amunts (2012) 
and Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles (2019).This depth co-localized 
with the dip between deep and superficial peaks in the active 
condition’s group-level VASO profile and the T1-profile plateau, 
which have previously been used as M1 layer Va landmarks 
(Huber et al. 2017)( s e e Supplementary Fig. S2 for details). 
Statistical analysis 
Cluster-based permutation testing(Nicholsand Holmes 2003)was 
employed to determine the significance of bins in passive laminar 
profiles. The permutation strategy used here accounts for multi-
ple comparisons (ie controls Type I error, see 
Nichols and Holmes 
(2003) for details) by deriving statistical distributions and values 
based on the profiles as a whole rather than individual layer-bins. 
Testing was performed across subjects for VASO (group level) and 
across trials for 2D-bSSFP (subject level). For each permutation, 
passive laminar profiles were randomly inverted with a minus 
sign since, under the null hypothesis, all profiles could equally 
likely have come from the contrast “rest>passive” as from the 
contrast “passive>rest.” P-values were then calculated for each 
bin across resulting profiles using one-sample t-tests. The max-
imum t-value sum observed for a cluster (range of consecutive 
bins with uncorrected P-values < 
0.05) was recorded for each 
permutation.This was repeated in 100,000 permutations,yielding 
a null distribution from which the P-value could be derived for the 
t-valuesumofagivenclusterinthemeasureddata.NotethatWM 
andCSFbins(bins1:3,and18,respectively)wereexcludedinthese 
analyses as our goal was to test for significant activation in gray 
matter (bins 4:17). This method tests the significance of a cluster 
as a whole, but significance of individual bins within the cluster 
cannot be inferred (
Nichols and Holmes 2003). Thus, to evaluate 
significance of deep layer bins in isolation (without contribution 
from bins in superficial layers), P-values were also derived for 
subclusters that only contained deep layer bins (between the 
GM/WM boundary and the layer Vb/Va boundary). We derived 
one-sided P-values to test our hypothesis that proprioception is 
a contributing factor to the positive laminar activation observed 
during active finger movements (see 
Fig. 1B); this hypothesis pre-
dicts a unidirectional effect where only an enhancement—not a

Results 
To test whether human M1 deep layer responses are evoked by 
proprioception, laminar profiles were extracted from ROIs con-
taining the characteristic double peak response pattern for active 
movements (see 
ROI Definition). Figure 2A depicts the raw VASO 
activation maps of an example subject for each condition. The 
active map has robust activation in the expected part of the 
hand knob (BA4a), but it is relatively noisy, making the double 
peak feature less clearly visible (
Fig. 2A, upper middle). This was 
alleviated in the within-layer smoothed activation maps, from 
which the double peak pattern more clearly emerged in the active 
tappingcondition( Fig. 2A,upperright).Thesmoothedmapforthe 
passive condition also shows superficial and deep activations in 
similarlocations(asindicatedbyarrowsin Fig. 2A,lowerright)but 
wasweakercomparedwiththeactivetappingcondition. Figure 2B 
shows the group-level VASO profiles associated with active and 
passive finger movements (for individual subject profiles, see 
Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Significant clusters of activation were 
foundduringpassivemovementsinboththesuperficial(P=0.039) 
and deep layers (P=0.014) (shown as horizontal black lines in 
Fig. 2B;numbersdenoteasignificantsubclusterofdeeplayerbins, 
P= 0.022). Interestingly, the deep layer peak appears to be slightly 
displaced toward layer Va during passive movements compared 
to active movements (Fig. 2B). 
Activation maps (Supplementary Fig.S4A) and laminar profiles 
(Fig. 2B,Supplementary Fig.S3) were similarly generated from the 
not-nulled timeseries of the VASO sequence (referred to here as 
EPI-BOLD to avoid confusion with the BOLD-contrast of bSSFP). 
In line with VASO results, significant activation was found in 
both superficial and deep layers during passive movements (all 
GM bins were above threshold, resulting in a single large cluster 
shown with the horizontal black line in 
Fig. 2B, P = 0.002; num-
bers denote significant subcluster of deep-layer bins, P=0.019). 
However, the maps and profiles were characterized by a bias 
toward superficial layers, and no clear double peak was observed 
at the group level in either condition. This is expected due to the 
sensitivityofgradientechoEPI-BOLDtowarddrainingveins,which 
displace the signal from local neuronal activity and thus limit its 
laminar specificity (
Turner 2002; Menon 2012). Consequently, the 
superficial layer signal becomes hard to interpret, but the deep 
layer signal, which is of main interest for our research question, 
is largely unaffected by large veins ( Turner 2002; Menon 2012). 
Nevertheless, in an attempt to account for the signal disper-
sion originating from intracortical veins, spatial deconvolution 
(
Markuerkiaga et al. 2016; Marquardt et al. 2018) was applied to 
theprofilesinasupplementaryanalysis( SupplementaryFig.S4B ). 
After deconvolution, the profiles began to resemble the corre-
sponding VASO profiles (low superficial bias and indications of 
doublepeaks),knowntobelessinfluencedbymacrovascularcon-
tamination. However, considering the limitations of the applied 
correction strategy (see 
Supplementary Fig. S4B ), the corrected 
profiles should be interpreted with caution. 
The activation maps for 2D-bSSFP are shown in Fig. 3A.O n l y 
one of the subjects had a clear double peak response within 
the same area in both conditions, but both subjects appeared to 
have robust deep layer activation in the passive tapping condition 
where activation of the active condition mostly resembled the 
doublepeakfeature(denotedbyarrows).Thisissupportedbyboth 
subjects’ laminar profiles (
Fig. 3B) showing significant subclus-
ters of activation in the deep layers during passive movements 
(P=0.004 and P=0.001 for subject 1 and subject 2, respectively). 
Due to bSSFP being relatively insensitive to T2∗contributions,it is 
expected to have less bias toward large veins than gradient echo 
EPI (
Miller 2012; Báez-Yánez et al.2017; Scheffler et al.2018; Liang 
et al. 2022). Nevertheless, as visible in activation maps, we did 
observe strong signals toward CSF, which likely reflects high sen-
sitivity of bSSFP-BOLD to intravascular signals and inflow effects 
(Liang et al.2022).Inspired by Liu et al.(2020),voxels with percent 
signal change exceeding 4% in the across-condition averaged 2D-
bSSFP map were excluded from the map of each condition before 
generating laminar profiles to minimize the effect of large vessels 
(uncorrected profiles are shown in 
Supplementary Fig. S5). 
Discussion 
In the present study, we used submillimeter resolution VASO and 
bSSFP at 7 T to demonstrate significant deep layer activation in

human M1 in response to proprioceptive stimulation. Below, we 
discuss how this finding aligns with existing literature, interpret 
the M1 deep layer signal in the context of previous laminar fMRI 
studies and motor control theories,and address study limitations. 
Proprioception explains signal in both superficial 
and deep layers of M1 
Multiple studies have investigated the M1 laminar activation 
pattern associated with active finger movements. A consistent 
finding is the characteristic double peak response within the 
hand knob of BA4a ( Huber et al. 2017; Beckett et al. 2020; Chai 
et al. 2020; Guidi et al. 2020; Persichetti et al. 2020; Shao et al. 
2021; Knudsen et al. 2023; Pais-Roldán et al. 2023). This could 
similarly be observed in the present study, both in VASO ( Fig. 2) 
and2D-bSSFP(Fig. 3).Ournovelfindingisthatdeeplayersarealso 
activated in response to passive movement,ie a task in which vol-
untary motor aspects are presumably absent. Specifically, group-
level VASO laminar profiles revealed significant activation in both 
superficial and deep layers during proprioceptive stimulation 
(
Fig. 2). Significant deep layer activation was similarly observed 
at the group level for EPI-BOLD ( Fig. 2B) and at the individual-
subject level for the two subjects scanned with 2D-bSSFP (Fig. 3). 
These findings suggest a direct proprioceptive influence on M1 
deep layer signals. 
To our knowledge, M1 activation in response to proprioceptive 
stimulation has not been studied at the human laminar level 
previously, but, consistent with our findings, numerous studies 
have established strong M1 involvement in relation to propri-
oceptive perception. For instance, tendon vibration can induce 
proprioceptive illusions of limb movement that strongly activate 
M1 without actual or intended movement (
Naito 2004). Similarly, 
proprioceptive stimulation significantly increases M1 activation 
(Weiller et al. 1996; Ciccarelli et al. 2005; Guzzetta et al. 2007; 
Blatow et al. 2011; Mehta et al. 2012; Michels et al. 2014)a n d 
modulates its excitability ( Carel et al. 2000; Lewis and Byblow 
2004; Onishi 2018). These findings suggest an important role of 
M1 in the proprioceptive hierarchy and that voluntary movement 
is not a prerequisite for its activation. Our study extends these 
findings by demonstrating involvement of both superficial and 
deep layers. This is consistent with nonhuman primate elec-
trophysiological studies showing that a large proportion of M1 
cells are responsive to proprioceptive stimulation (see 
Naito 2004, 
and references therein) and that such cells are found in both 
superficial and deep layers, including corticospinal pyramidal 
tract neurons (Wiesendanger 1973; Lemon and Porter 1976). 
Interpretation of the deep layer signal in M1 
Huber et al. (2017) suggested that the peak in superficial layers 
mainly reflects corticocortical input from somatosensory (tactile 
and proprioception) and premotor areas. This interpretation was 
informed by anatomical tracer studies in rodents ( Mao et al. 
2011; Weiler et al. 2008, see also Fig. 1A) and was supported by 
their resting state connectivity results in humans. Furthermore, 
tactile stimulation was shown to affect superficial layers only, 
as has been shown for imagined movements, believed to 
entail substantial input from premotor areas ( Turner 2016; 
Persichetti et al. 2020). In other words, tasks devoid of corti-
cospinal motor output appear to lack deep layer signal changes, 
whereas active movements, involving motor output, are linked 
to deep layer activation. When factoring in that corticospinal

neurons are selectively located in layer Vb, it is reasonable 
that the double peak has commonly been interpreted as pre-
motor/somatosensory input in superficial layers and voluntary-
movement-related corticospinal output in deep layers ( Dumoulin 
2017; Huber et al. 2017; Larkum et al. 2018; Beckett et al. 2020; 
Chai et al. 2020; McColgan et al. 2020; Persichetti et al. 2020; Shao 
et al. 2021; Knudsen et al. 2023; Pais-Roldán et al. 2023). Our 
observation of significant deep layer activation during passive 
movements indicates a concomitant proprioceptive contribution 
to the deep layer signal. 
Based on the model proposed in Fig. 1A, proprioceptive 
information is predominantly received by superficial layers 
for preprocessing before being relayed to deep neurons via 
strong superficial-to-deep intracolumnar connections (
Weiler 
et al. 2008; Bastos et al. 2012). This circuitry largely aligns with 
a follow-up psychophysiological interaction (PPI) connectivity 
analysis (detailed in the “Supplementary PPI Analysis” section 
in the Supplementary Material ), which showed a significant 
interaction between S1 and M1 superficial layers and between M1 
superficial and deep layers during active movements. However, 
these interactions were not observed in the passive condition, 
possibly due to the inherent sensitivity limitations of PPI analysis. 
These results and the associated limitations are discussed in 
further detail in the 
Supplementary Material. 
Considering that M1 relies on proprioceptive state information 
forpropergenerationofmotorcommands( HatsopoulosandSum-
inski 2011; Proske and Gandevia 2012; Omrani et al. 2017), deep 
layeractivationmaypartlyreflectdeliveryofproprioceptiveinfor-
mation to pyramidal tract cells in layer Vb to shape corticospinal 
output. Furthermore, M1 has been shown to contribute to the 
generation of proprioceptive perception (
Nudo et al. 2000; Naito 
2004;Gandeviaetal. 2006),anddeepoutputlayersmaybeactively 
involved in shaping proprioceptive sensations, rather than solely 
using it to guide output. 
In view of the increasing prominence of hierarchical Bayesian 
theories of brain function and their inherent link to laminar cir-
cuitry, we additionally propose an interpretation of the observed 
deep layer signal based on the active inference account of sensori-
motor function (
Friston 2010; Adams et al.2013; Shipp et al.2013). 
In this framework, proprioceptive stimulation should strongly 
activate the superficial layers of M1 since neuronal units at this 
depth are the targets of driving feedforward proprioceptive pre-
diction errors, which continuously update expectations about the 
current proprioceptive state (
Adams et al. 2013; Shipp et al. 2013). 
The potent superficial-to-deep intracolumnar pathway conveys 
these expectations onto deep layer prediction units (Weiler et al. 
2008; Bastos et al. 2012), which is accompanied by feedback 
connections from the premotor cortex. Thus, deep layer units 
integrate extensive synaptic input, which in itself may give rise 
to deep layer fMRI signals (
Logothetis 2008). Furthermore, based 
on this input, proprioceptive predictions are generated and trans-
mitted to S1 and to thalamic somatosensory nuclei so to inform 
proprioceptive perceptions (“perceptual inference” component of 
active inference) (
Adams et al. 2013; Shipp et al. 2013). Within 
this framework, corticospinal output constitutes these same pro-
prioceptive predictions directed to lower motor neurons in the 
spinal cord (the distinction between motor output and propri-
oception, as in 
Fig. 1B, is thus rendered meaningless as motor 
output and proprioception become two sides of the same coin). 
Corticospinal predictions about the current proprioceptive state 
are compared with incoming data from the muscular Ia stretch 
receptors. Any disparity between prediction and data yields a
8 | Knudsen et al.
proprioceptive prediction error that activates the motor neuron 
until the prediction is realized in the subsequent movement 
(“action”component of active inference) (Adams et al.2013; Shipp 
et al. 2013). Consequently, another possible explanation for the 
observed deep layer signal is corticospinal drive being present 
even during passive movements; if the afferent data from the 
externally induced movement are not matched by a corticospinal 
proprioceptive prediction, a prediction error ensues leading to 
a countermovement (akin to the classical stretch reflex, 
Lidell 
and Sherrington 1924). Thus, for participants to be able to relax, 
M1 may continuously transmit corticospinal drive in the form 
of predictions about proprioceptive consequences of the passive 
movement. This interpretation is consistent with the observation 
that pyramidal tract neurons in layer Vb fire in response to 
passive movements (
Wiesendanger 1973; Lemon and Porter 1976) 
and with clinical indications that upper motor neuron damage 
includes a failure to relax during passive movement (Menon and 
Vucic 2021). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the observed 
deep layer signal originated from nonpyramidal tract cells and 
more evidence for corticospinal drive during passive movements 
is necessary to support this explanation. 
Thedeeppeakforthepassiveconditionappearsslightlyshifted 
toward layer Va compared to the active condition (Fig. 2B). Layer 
Va links M1 and S1 (Mao et al.2011; Hooks 2017),whereas layer Vb 
contains all corticospinal cells. In line with the active inference 
framework, one possible explanation is that the proprioceptive 
predictions transmitted to S1—proposed to mediate “perceptual 
inference”—dominate during passive movements, whereas corti-
cospinal drive may exert more influence during “action” (
Friston 
2010; Adams et al. 2013; Shipp et al. 2013). However, this remains 
speculative.Giventhesmallsamplesizeandintersubjectvariabil-
ity observed in laminar profiles ( Supplementary Fig. S3), further 
studies are needed to establish whether the shift is a robust fea-
ture distinguishing laminar profiles of active and passive finger 
movements using rigorous statistical testing. 
Limitations 
Our conclusion that proprioceptive stimulation activates deep 
layers of M1 is partly based on the significant deep activation 
cluster in the group-level laminar VASO profile (
Fig. 2B). How-
ever, large intersubject variability was observed in the profiles 
(Supplementary Fig. S3 ). This limitation is alleviated to some 
extent by corroborating BOLD-EPI and bSSFP data. Nevertheless, 
our findings would provide stronger evidence if robust lami-
nar patterns of VASO activation could be demonstrated across 
subjects for passive movements, as 
Huber et al. (2017) did for 
active movements. Part of the variability is likely explained by 
relatively weak stimuli in our movement tasks where only one 
finger was moved, and the range of motion was small due to 
the passive movement device’s constraints. To increase response 
magnitudes, it would be interesting to replicate the experiment 
of the present study using a passive movement device that tol-
erates multifinger movements and generates a wider range of 
motion. 
Additionally, passive movement may involve attentional 
effects, tactile input, or premotor contributions, which were 
not controlled for in this study. That is, other neural sources 
than proprioceptive processing could potentially explain the 
observed deep layer signal. However, the effect of attention on 
the fMRI signal has been reported to primarily modulate BA4p 
(
Binkofski et al.2002) but not the ROI in the present study,ie BA4a. 
Furthermore, the lack of robust M1 deep layer activation during 
tactile and imagined movement conditions ( Turner 2016; Huber 
et al. 2017; Persichetti et al. 2020; Shao et al. 2021), makes tactile 
and premotor input unlikely to confound our interpretation of 
proprioceptive processing being the main source of deep layer 
activation during passive movements. That being said, future 
studies controlling directly for such nonproprioceptive sources 
would be needed to definitively settle this. 
Finally, our findings are only valid if subjects relaxed their 
fingers during passive movements, which could have been 
confirmed through electromyography (EMG) recordings.Although 
we did not obtain such recordings, previous research has 
demonstrated that subjects generally have no difficulty relaxing 
their muscles during passive movements (
Mima et al. 1999; 
Thickbroom et al. 2003; Ciccarelli et al. 2005). 
Conclusion 
We used 7 T laminar fMRI to investigate the laminar pattern of 
activation in M1 in response to passive finger movements. Signif-
icant activation was observed in both superficial and deep layers. 
Our results align with the M1 laminar input/output structure 
proposed by animal studies and human laminar fMRI research. 
They further detail this model by suggesting that M1 deep layers 
constitute an important component in proprioceptive circuits and 
that a non-negligible portion of the M1 deep layer activation 
likely reflects proprioceptive influence. We believe this study 
enhances our understanding of the laminar circuitry in human 
M1,thereby facilitating interpretations of future laminar research 
and contributing to the development of theoretical frameworks of 
motor control and somatosensory perception.
