abstract
The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes the existence and function of living organisms. The principle
speciﬁes that biological systems comprise a disorder within constrained random boundaries. Per this
principle, living organisms are machines with a degree of error that do not strive to optimize. Their dif-
ferentiator from non-living organisms is their intrinsic disorder within personalized dynamic random
boundaries. The constrained disorder is mandatory for the systems’ existence and proper operation. It
provides living organisms the ﬂexibility and adaptability required for operating under continuously
changing internal and external milieus. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes health and disease
states by specifying the degree of the disorder and the arbitrary boundaries of biological systems.
Disturbed systems lose their disorder or operate out of the disorder boundaries leading to diseases.
The principle provides a platform for applying the constrained disorder to correct systems disturbances
and improve disease outcomes.

1. Introduction
Numerous currently used schemes provide some actionable
frameworks that allow retrieval of some properties of biological
systems. However, they cannot give an entirely accurate descrip-
tion of biological reality. A better understanding of biological orga-
nization is needed.
Randomness is inherent to complex systems, including biologi-
cal systems. Its detailed contribution to the systems’ function and
its potential use for correcting malfunctions were not yet
described.
The constrained disorder principle (CDP) deﬁnes living organ-
isms based on their requirement for a disorder within arbitrary
boundaries, which is mandatory for their existence and proper
operation. The CDP provides a way to interpret biological processes
and describe them with improved accuracy providing a means for
overcoming some of the challenges of the current models.
This paper presents the deﬁnition of the principle and its use for
determining health and disease and correcting disturbances in bio-
logical systems.
A. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes biological
systems
i. The constrained disorder principle speciﬁes the necessity of
intrinsic randomness in biological systems.
The CDP speciﬁes that the disorder kept within random person-
alized boundaries is fundamental to biological systems. The con-
strained disorder provides systems with the ﬂexibility and
adaptability to the continuously changing random internal and
external milieus.
Randomness and variability are intrinsic to biological systems
and occur in the genome, cell organelles, proteins, and whole
organs[1–10]. The inherent variability of biological systems speci-
ﬁes a role for the disorder in living organisms. These systems pos-
sess a mixture of order and disorder and require a certain degree of
disorder for proper function[5,11].
ii. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes disorder as the
differentiator and the advantage of living organisms over
non-living systems

The CDP deﬁnes living organisms’ subcellular and cellular orga-
nelles and whole organs as aimless machines functioning within a
degree of error. Their structure mandates disorder and operation
within its arbitrary boundaries. Systems malfunctioning implies
operating outside these boundaries.
The CDP is mandatory for life under variable settings. Living
organisms can be viewed as purposeless machines that are inher-
ently ﬂexible and adaptable due to their intrinsic constrained
disorder.
The CDP deﬁnes the difference and the advantage of living
organisms over non-living organisms. Per this principle, living
and non-living organisms operate like machines, not striving to
improve or optimize.
Per the principle, living organisms comprise a disorder within
arbitrary boundaries, differentiating them from non-living organ-
isms that lack this assembly. This structure gives living organisms
an advantage, enabling them to adapt to the continuously changing
internal and external milieus and better respond to ongoing ran-
dom stimuli.
The principle does not eliminate the importance of genetics and
order, which underlie systems. Randomness is one of the aspects of
living organisms, and deterministic rules are always part of sys-
tems’ backbones[12]. The complex three-dimensional organiza-
tion of genomes involves chromatin domains, DNA loops, and
higher-order compartments, which involve deterministic and
stochasticity in transcription and high variability of chromatin
architecture in individual cells[13]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic
sources of variability in genome organization were described. Sim-
ilar features were deﬁned for the transcription and translation pro-
cess. The inherent combination of deterministic and stochastic
components of systems has functional implications in complex
systems [14,15].
iii. iii The constrained disorder principle implies that biological
systems operate in alignment with the second law of
thermodynamics
The CDP speciﬁes that systems possess a mixture of order and
disorder within arbitrary boundaries required for existence and
operation. It implies that they operate under the second law of
thermodynamics.
The second law determines entropy as a property of a system.
Entropy cannot decrease, as isolated systems always arrive at a
state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest
[16,17]. The second law predicts the direction of spontaneous pro-
cesses and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible
despite obeying the energy conservation requirement expressed by
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.
Biological systems are far from equilibrium. Self-organizing sys-
tems organize themselves and function close to the edge of insta-
bility towards chaos but never reach complete chaos[1–3]. Living
organisms are not committed to eliminating their entropy produc-
tion rates in the face of numerous internal and external random
stimuli. Per the CDP, evolution balances order and disorder essen-
tial for proper function, and this balance is mandatory for thermo-
dynamic energy conservation.
iv. iv Formulations of the constrained disorder principle.
Using mathematics to describe biological functions and their
variable processes enables a better understanding of complex sys-
tems. Using formulas for the ﬂow of random dynamical systems is
helpful for modeling time series generated by processes far from
equilibrium [18].
The CDP implies entirely random systems that lack rules. Math-
ematically expressing the disorder and its arbitrary boundaries can
improve understanding of complex biological systems. However,
they cannot reach absolute accuracy, as these systems comprise
numerous variables, many of which are unknown and continu-
ously change randomly.
Formulas based on descriptive analysis of biological systems,
using estimations, and means, while determining trends of sys-
tems, do not reﬂect biological reality with complete accuracy.
The internal and external stimuli affecting systems, many of which
are unknown and dynamically change, are entirely random and
unpredictable—framing them within formulas assists in understat-
ing these systems but cannot reach complete accuracy while
attempting to reﬂect the real biological world.
B. The constrained disorder principle and ergodicity, the
free-energy theory, Markov blankets, and random ﬂuctu-
ations in biological systems
i. The constrained disorder principle speciﬁes a continuous
balancing of complexity and surprise with information and
accuracy.
The CDP accounts for entropy, surprise, and uncertainty associ-
ations. The principle implies that a degree of disorder, uncertainty,
and lack of causality is mandatory for the proper operation of bio-
logical systems.
The free-energy principle (FEP) is an information theory that
measures the bounds of a surprise given a generative model. The
model is probabilistic of the dependencies between causes and
consequences from which samples are generated [19,20]. The
energy minus entropy provides free energy (F = U-TS). The energy
here is the surprise about sensations and their perceived causes,
and entropy is that of a system’s recognition density, an estimated
probability distribution of the reasons for data[19]. Free energy is
also a surprise plus a divergence term. The divergence is the differ-
ence between the recognition and posterior density, representing
the prediction of actual causes. This theory suggests that free
energy is an upper bound on surprise, which is the negative log
probability of an outcome[19]. It measures how unlikely an obser-
vation would be by associating a system’s sensory state with an
observation [20,21].
Accuracy is the surprise about sensations expected under the
recognition density[19]. Free energy is also complexity minus accu-
racy, where complexity is the difference between recognition and a
prior density of causes. It means integrating the difference between
the previous density, which encodes beliefs about the world before
sensory data, and posterior beliefs, the recognition density.
The free energy theory suggests that biological systems violate
the second law of thermodynamics and avoid surprises within
boundaries [19,22,23]. Systems resist the tendency to disorder,
and natural selection limits the number of states near equilibrium
and reduces entropy production[19,24]. A subtle difference in per-
spective to the FEP proposed that the whole is considered a pri-
mary and biological system that deconstructs information about
the world rather than constructing representations[25–28].
The role of the meaning of relative or relational information is
essential for the understanding of biological systems’ stability.
Shannon’s notion of relative information between two physical
systems enables statistical and quantum mechanics without refer-
ring to subjectivism or idealism. It allows a realistic picture of the
world, providing a tool for dealing with its apparent limitations
[28–30]. The concept thatMeaning = information + evolutionwas
proposed to provide an approach for the understanding of informa-
tion in complex systems[31].

The CDP deﬁnes a continuous balancing of complexity and sur-
prise with information and accuracy within arbitrary dynamic
boundaries. Systems’ function is independent of causes and conse-
quences, and they do not violate the second law and do not resist a
tendency for disorder. Per this principle, systems are machines that
mandate a certain degree of disorder and surprise within the range
deﬁned by the disorder’s arbitrary boundaries for their function
and do not strive toward accuracy.
ii. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes the balance
between information and surprise and between maximizing
and minimizing free energy.
The CDP speciﬁes that the system balances disorder with order
and maximizing with minimizing free energy. Systems’ existence
and adaptation require a degree of disorder and free energy. Per
the CDP, systems mandate a degree of errors for existence under
unpredictable random stimuli irrespective of the settings around
them.
The free-energy theory proposes that organisms are prediction
machines that model the world and minimize prediction errors
[32,33]. The theory suggests that adaptive systems occupy a lim-
ited range of states to reduce the long-term surprise associated
with sensory exchanges with their environments [19]. Surprise
relates to the current state of systems, which cannot change, and
movements between states vary. This motion is complicated when
revisiting a small set of states, termed global random attractor.
Attractor states that goal rather than optimization is a critical
theme [34]. An attractor is a set into which a dynamic system
develops with time. Points adjacent to the attractor remain close,
even under small perturbations[19].
The free-energy theory suggests that adaptive systems resist a
natural tendency to disorder[19,35–37]. If systems minimize free
energy, they minimize surprise[19,38]. Predictive coding, where
prediction error or local surprise propagates until eliminating
residual error signals, happens by updating the beliefs[39–41].
For reducing free energy, systems ﬁt their observation with com-
plex models with lower entropy, subtracting less from their free
energy [42]. Minimization of the free energy through time ensures
that entropy is bounded [20]. A minimum free energy leads to
minor actions for minimizing expected cost and the free energy
[19,43–46].
Per the CDP, a movement between several states is mandatory
for existence and proper function. The number of states is random
within limits. It implies that biological systems balance maximiz-
ing with minimizing free energy and uncertainty with accuracy.
They mandate a degree of free energy and uncertainty for existence
and functionality. It implies that the systems do not strive to min-
imize actions and costs.
The CDP applies to all organs, including the brain, where struc-
ture assembly comprises a balance between information and sur-
prise. Cell plasticity is an example of a continuously balanced
system where disorder exists. Organ responses, including those
of the brain, do not mandate predictions or explanations of stimuli
[19,47–53]. It responds to its sensory epithelia sampling within a
range of errors[19]. Organs balance information with predictabil-
ity between the sensorium and their internal representation while
keeping a certain level of uncertainty required for its proper func-
tion [54–61].
iii. The constrained disorder principle accounts for the concept
of Markov blankets in biological systems.
The CDP is in line with the concept of Markov blankets. It
deﬁnes biological organs as comprising random blankets over ran-
dom blankets. The variabilities of the Markov blankets reﬂect the
disorder in these systems. Markov blankets are dynamically ran-
dom and continuously changing, and their boundaries are variable
[62].
The free energy theory suggests that biological systems include
Markov blankets that outline their structure[63–65]. These bound-
aries are ﬂexible and are not co-extensive with an organism’s phys-
ical boundaries[20]. Markov blanket signiﬁes a partition of states
into internal states, their Markov blanket comprising sensory and
active states and the external or hidden states concealed behind
the blanket[38]. Internal states and their Markov blanket respond
to hidden states in the environment
[20,38,62]. The internal states
do not affect the external states while generating active states can
affect the external ones. The external states do not affect the active
states [18]. The theory proposes that systems couple between
internal and external states, exhibiting circular causality funda-
mental for self-organization, and blankets create dependencies
among states[18,20,38,66–69]. Generalized synchrony is the syn-
chronization of chaotic dynamics inside and outside the blanket.
Both internal and external states are synchronized, and there is
symmetry due to the Markov blanket[18]. It suggests that gener-
alized synchronization is expressed as a principle of most minor
action, minimizing free energy[68,70,71].
The CDP implies that systems respond to random stimuli irre-
spective of causality. Per this principle, systems have limited syn-
chronization and symmetry, resulting from an ongoing balancing
process between the different states and their Markov blankets.
The CDP infers that Markov blankets manifest themselves in the
short-range electrochemical and nuclear forces, where cell mem-
branes form blankets for internal intracellular states [38. The inter-
nal states link with the intracellular states of cells. The sensory
states develop into the surface states and cell membranes overly-
ing active states, such as the actin ﬁlaments of the cytoskeleton.
The active state is the cell ﬁlaments, and sensory states are the
receptors on the cells[72]. These processes are random within cer-
tain limits and manifest in the dynamic instability of the micro-
tubules [6–9,73,74]. Each hierarchy level manifests Markov
blankets comprising active and sensory states in the brain, where
the active states inﬂuence lower levels not linked with predictions.
The exchange of effects between the various levels keeps certain
degrees of disorder and errors.
Autopoiesis is a property of living systems that enables them to
maintain and renew themselves by regulating their composition
and preserving their boundaries [18,20,33,38,46,75–77] Action
maintains the structural and functional integrity of the Markov
blanket via autopoiesis or self-assembly[20]. Per the CDP, actions
and autopoiesis result from a continuous balance between the
order and the disorder within arbitrary boundaries in entirely ran-
dom systems. This process is mandatory for the renewing of bio-
logical systems under random settings.
The FEP, Markov blankets, and other models are approaches
with limitations that do not provide an entirely accurate descrip-
tion of biological reality. They describe actionable frameworks that
allow retrieving some properties of the biological systems but are
insufﬁcient for complete accuracy. The CDP provides a method to
interpret biological processes with better accuracy.
iv. The constrained disorder principle implies that biological
systems are ergodic.
Multiple examples of ergodicity inherent to biological systems
align with the principle of constrained disorder. Ergodicity under-
lies cyclin activity levels during the cell cycle, where stochastic
external signals induce continuous oscillating motion[78]. Ergod-
icity explains each phase of the budding yeast. Diffusion in cell
membranes displays anomalous dynamics and a high rate of ﬂuc-
tuations. The potassium channels’ machinery comprises ergodic
Y. Ilan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6087–6096
6089
and nonergodic processes in membranes[79,80]. The macromolec-
ular assembling reﬂects an ergodic process, and the binding to the
actin cytoskeleton is a nonergodic process[80].
The free-energy theory suggests that ergodicity is the time aver-
age of a measurable function of a system that converges over an
appropriate period [38,81]. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty
and is the average self-information or surprise of outcomes sam-
pled from a probability distribution or density[19]. Low entropy
means that the result is relatively predictable. Per this theory,
ergodic systems converge to an invariant set of states[82–87].
The ergodic sets are groups of states from which the system, once
entering, does not leave when subject to internal noise[88,89].
Entropic dynamics is an outline in which dynamical laws are
derived as an application of entropic methods of inference[90].
It implies a lack of an underlying action principle and that dynam-
ics is driven by entropy subject to the constraints appropriate to
the problem. A standard diffusion process is an example of the nat-
ure of time, and imposing the additional constraint that the
dynamics are non-dissipative leads to Hamiltonian dynamics.
Using concepts from information geometry led to the type of
Hamiltonian that describes quantum theory[90].
The geometric information approach to the chaos framework
suggests that when identifying a complex system’s microscopic
degrees of freedom, it is mandatory to obtain data and select
essential information constraints on the system[91]. A statistical
model describes the system in probability distributions character-
ized by macro variables determined by the data and the speciﬁc
functional expression of the information constraints used to imple-
ment statistical inferences. When a system changes, the corre-
sponding statistical model evolves from its initial to ﬁnal
conﬁgurations in a manner speciﬁed by entropic dynamics, the ele-
ments of which are probability distributions [91]. A change in
probability distributions is a principle of entropic inference. Entro-
pic dynamics speciﬁes theexpected rather than theactual dynami-
cal paths of the system[92].
In physical systems, forces change according to Newtonian laws
and are redeﬁned by the methods of Lagrange and Hamilton using
an identiﬁcation of the governing action principle as a general
framework for dynamics. Living systems’ structure generates infor-
mational metrics and course conﬁgurations for the required action
dynamics [93]. The experiential process of acquiring and translat-
ing information into actionable meaning for adaptive responses is
the driving change in biological systems. It involves an innate
action principle that determines the system’s directional changes.
An entropically driven trajectory minimizes the information gradi-
ent differences and is an inference procedure for directional change
considered an action functional for the living system[93].
The CDP implies that entropy, a measure of a system’s disorder
and randomness, is obligatory for proper operation. Systems man-
date a degree of uncertainty and are not striving to eliminate
unpredictability. Per this principle, systems maintain numerous
states to keep their ﬂexibility under dynamic random settings.
Modeling systems can provide a tool for determining the trends
of biological systems, but per the CDP, they may not reach com-
plete accuracy.
v. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes the self-
organization and non-equilibrium steady states of biological
systems
The thermodynamics and information theories explain the self-
organization of far-from-equilibrium systems [94]. The CDP
implies that the non-equilibrium steady state is mandatory for
the systems’ proper operation. It speciﬁes that non-equilibrium
steady-state systems comprise a dynamic balance between contin-
uously changing and opposing random forces. Random dynamical
systems exhibit stochastic chaos and involve a degree of indepen-
dencies at non-equilibrium steady-states[18].
Self-organization in biology is a property of ergodic random
dynamical systems
[18,38,95–98]. Systems’ self-organization to
non-equilibrium forms underlies their structures [99]. The CDP
implies that systems are part of larger disordered organizations.
The Markov blankets, boundaries, and attractors have a degree of
randomness, indicating that systems are dynamic and random
within their arbitrary boundaries. Per this principle, biological
self-organization is continuously dynamic under random internal
and external stimuli. It balances maximizing with minimizing
free energy and uncertainties with information. Systems are
ensembles of Markov blankets that are random and self-
organize into global random systems. Systems are affected and
inﬂuence their milieus. Randomly states of systems impact the
functional and structural states of other systems [20,100–102].
Per the CDP, existence means having certain degrees of disorder,
errors, and free energy.
The free energy theory suggests that self-organization means
minimizing free energy or maximizing the evidence for their mod-
els of the world[103]. Systems remain in non-equilibrium steady
states by restricting themselves to a limited number of states
[104]. Existence means resistance to a dispersion of structure and
molecules by random ﬂuctuations [21, 67, 72 105]. If systems are
in non-equilibrium steady-state existence, the gradient ﬂow bal-
ances the dispersion caused by the random ﬂuctuations
[18,72,106–113]. It suggests that systems with random dynamical
attractors minimize their free energy and engage in active infer-
ence, acting upon their external milieu to maintain an internal
homoeostasis [38,85,96,98,114–120].
The CDP implies that disorder is a mechanism for keeping sys-
tems’ existence and operation under highly random, continuously
changing internal and external milieus. It deﬁnes a dynamic bal-
ance between random ﬂuctuations with the gradient ﬂow and
between uncertainties with accuracy. It implies balancing between
random dispersive ﬂuctuations and opposing random construction
forces. Per this principle, a certain degree of random ﬂuctuation is
not associated with molecule dispersion and is part of the pro-
cesses that underlie their structure under ﬂuctuating conditions.
Cyclic processes in the cell cycle exempliﬁed this principle[6–
9,24,73]. The CDP implies that the disorder and its arbitrary bound-
aries are individualized. What is surprising for a system may not be
surprising for another system under identical settings.
C. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes biological sys-
tems as purposeless machines that operate under ran-
dom internal and external stimuli
i. The constrained disorder principle is independent of sys-
tems’ trajectories.
The CDP speciﬁes that the disorder is mandatory for the sys-
tems’ existence, evolution, and operation. Systems are machines
that do not strive to reach a target. A process of balancing disorder
and order is intrinsic to systems’ operation in highly dynamic ran-
dom environments. Randomness is intrinsic to biological systems
and is part of the evolutionary process, manifesting in variabilities
at the genome level, microtubules, protein sequences and struc-
ture, cell organelles, and whole organs[12,73,74,121–125].
The CDP speciﬁes that systems do not strive to reduce uncer-
tainty. Existence and proper operation reﬂect an ongoing balance
between uncertainty and surprise with information and precision
[20,126]. The principle implies that systems’ functions under
dynamic random settings require degrees of uncertainty and free
energy. A constrained degree of the disorder is mandatory for sys-
tems’ ﬂexibility and adaptability. When the degree of the disorder
is too low or too high, the system is disturbed.
Y. Ilan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 20 (2022) 6087–6096

The free-energy theory is about optimizing systems; it suggests
gaining information to create an accurate world model and keeping
an open mind on the future[127–130]. It suggests that minimizing
free energy optimizes empirical priors informed by sensory data to
enhance prior expectations[84,131–135]. Systems aim to reduce
surprise, resolve uncertainty, and minimize prediction errors. This
theory suggests that systems behave, select information, and
ignore information that contradicts their beliefs[2, 19, 127,136,
137, 138]. The theory suggests that minimizing free energy maxi-
mizes efﬁciency and that systems aim to fulﬁll the requirements
created for themselves and their environments[138].
The CDP deﬁnes systems as purposeless operating machines
that function within boundaries of disorder and errors, and that
value is not inversely proportional to surprise. Operations are inde-
pendent of actions’ potential values and costs. It means that exist-
ing in a continuously random dynamic world necessitates a degree
of errors and uncertainty and implies an ongoing dynamic balance
between opposing random trajectories. The principle entails keep-
ing a degree of entropy as part of the requirement for system
existence.
The CDP implies that organisms possess numerous states that
randomly change and are associated with higher entropy manda-
tory for operation. It speciﬁes that operating in random milieus
requires a degree of surprise, and actions do not follow trajectories
of consequences and rewards. Systems are machines that do not
look into the future and signiﬁcance of their actions when selecting
their activities. The future is entirely random, and internal and
external settings continuously change and are unpredictable;
hence organisms do not make extrapolations about the outcomes
of their activities.
Biological systems do not strive to reach perfection, and a
degree of imperfection is intrinsic to their reality. Improving efﬁ-
ciency does not underlie systems’ function. They are machines that
function under continuous perturbations and alarms and are not
mandated to move toward speciﬁc targets. This machinery pro-
vides a solution for systems to cope with continuously randomly
evolving internal and external milieus. How disorder contributes
to ﬂexibility varies for diverse systems, differs under different set-
tings, and is yet to be determined.
ii. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes the cross rela-
tions between biological systems and their internal and
external environments.
The CDP deﬁnes homeostasis as an ongoing process without
perfection and a total balance. Biological systems function under
unpredictable internal and external stimuli but do not monitor or
react to them [20]. Systems do not strive to eliminate surprise
and do not violate the second law when interacting with their
environments. If the internal and external milieus are random,
and the organisms are models of their surroundings, it implies a
degree of disorder and a limit to free energy minimization. Sys-
tems’ operation in real life reﬂects the randomness in their internal
and external milieus. There are cross-reactions between systems’
randomness and their milieus’ randomness.
The free-energy theory suggests that organisms are close to
becoming models of their environments and that organisms have
beliefs about the world, making these beliefs happen, minimizing
expected surprise, and resolving uncertainty by actively sampling
their milieus[20,139–141]. Adaptive active inference implies that
organisms actively change their environmental relations by occu-
pying states with minimum free energies[20,142].
Per the CDP, systems’ and environments’ operations reﬂect the
numerous dynamic random stimuli that affect them. This machin-
ery underlies the proper function of systems and enables them to
operate under continuously changing random stimuli. At the cellu-
lar level, each cell’s environment has embedded irregularities at
the tissue level, and the cell manifests irregularities as part of its
phenotype [4–7,143]. Under the CDP, systems exist within random
domains, and their relations with their milieus are random pro-
cesses that reﬂect the multiple unpredicted opposing dynamic
forces, necessitating a degree of free energy.
iii. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes the personalized
random boundaries required for systems’ functionality.
The CDP speciﬁes that the disorder and its boundaries are ran-
dom, personalized, and mandatory for existence and function.
Boundaries continuously ﬂuctuate in a subject’s-tailored way. Sys-
tems are disturbed when there is no disorder or the disorder is out
of control. Moving outside the boundaries increases the energetic
thermodynamic burden on systems and reduces their functional-
ity. Different organisms exhibit diverse responses to random inter-
nal and external stimuli. A controlled degree of variability keeps a
balanced degree of free energy. If the variability gets out of the
arbitrary boundaries, systems lose control.
Heart rate variability (HRV) is an intrinsic irregularity in the
heart rate determined by a balance between the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems. It is an easily measurable
parameter for modeling variability in biological systems. HRV
exempliﬁes how a degree of variability intrinsic to the heart’s
proper function varies under random stimuli, such as exercise
and sleep, while keeping a healthy cardiac function[144–147].
HRV is an example of a disorder within boundaries that change.
If HRV is uncontrolled, it manifests in severe cardiac disease and
increased mortality and alters the response to chronic medications
[148–152]. Loss of HRV is associated with increased cardiac death,
implying that the system lost part of its normal function. However,
short-term HRV measurements are not always markers of healthy
cardiopulmonary interaction. The concept of heart rate fragmenta-
tion (HRF) was introduced to overcome this challenge. It is based
on the observation that sustained physiologic changes in heart rate
cannot persist at frequencies higher than those at which the entire
parasympathetic nervous system operates. The primary variable of
HRF is an overall increase in the frequency of changes in heart rate
acceleration sign[153,154]. Both coronary artery disease and older
age are associated with higher levels of HRF[153].
Both HRV and HRF measurable variables, similar to additional
quantiﬁable variability parameters, can assist in determining
trends of systems but may be insufﬁcient for formulating the
CDP with complete accuracy.
D. The constrained disorder principle provides a method for
correcting disturbed biological systems
i. The constrained disorder principle deﬁnes health and
disease.
The CDP deﬁnes undisturbed healthy states and disturbed dis-
eased states. It implies that a system’s operation necessitates an
intrinsic disorder restricted within its continuously changing ran-
dom boundaries. Loss of disorder, or getting out of its boundaries,
a too-high degree of disorder, manifests in systems’ disturbances
and disease states.
Getting out of the boundaries indicates a loss of the ability to
adapt to the continuously ﬂuctuating internal or external stimuli
leading to diseases. It implies a loss of systems’ ﬂexibility and
adaptability, which are mandatory for existence and proper func-
tion. Disturbances at the organelles, biochemical pathways, or
whole organs exhibit diverse phenotypes in different organisms
[155,156].
Loss of or augmented HRV leads to increased cardiac-related
morbidity and mortality[157–159]. Similarly, alterations in nor-

mal ﬂuctuation in glucose level dynamics deﬁne metabolic dis-
eases such as diabetes[160]. These examples, showing how vari-
ability is inherent to organ function and its loss is associated
with diseased conditions, support the fundamental role of con-
strained disorder in biological systems.
ii. Using the constrained disorder principle for correcting dis-
turbances in systems.
The CDP speciﬁes that the proper structure and function of
molecules, cells, and organs necessitate a randomly-bounded
degree of disorder. The principle provides a method for improving
function by introducing subject-tailored variability to improve the
system’s functionality. Disturbed systems that lost their disorder
can beneﬁt from implementing personalized constrained-tailored
variability into their operation scheme to correct malfunction
and improve functionality.
Table 1
The differences between the constrained disorder principle and some theories about biological systems.
Theme Existing theories The constrained disorder principle
Order or disorder The free-energy theory suggests that biological systems resist the
tendency to disorder[33,130,186].
- Randomness is intrinsic to biological systems.
- Systems do not resist disorder but comprise a balance of disorder
and order within arbitrary boundaries.
-The disorder is required for systems’ existence, evolution, and
behavior.
Living organisms Evolution is about order and optimization [19,38,187,188]. -Living organisms are purposeless machines.
-They operate with a degree of disorder and errors.
-The intrinsic disorder differentiates living organisms from non-
living organisms. It provides living systems with adaptability to
continuously changing internal and external milieus.
-Evolution is about improving the balance of disorder and order in
dynamic environments.
Formulas Using formulas to describe biological functions enables a better
understanding of complex systems. It is helpful for modeling
processes that are far from equilibrium[19].
- The disorder and its boundaries are random and have no rules.
- Formulas based on descriptive analysis oversimplify biological
processes and do not reﬂect biological reality.
- One cannot formulate the constrained disorder principle.
The second law of
thermodynamics
Systems violate the second law of thermodynamics and the
ﬂuctuation theory [19].
- Systems function in alignment with the second law of
thermodynamics.
- Systems always arrive at a state ofthermodynamic equilibrium
and highest entropy.
Entropy Systems maintain low-entropy distributions over their internal
states and their Markov blanket[20].
The free-energy theory suggests that systems ﬁt their observa-
tions, requiring complex models with lower entropy[19,189,190].
- Entropy is mandatory for existence.
- Systems are not mandated to reach a complete elimination of
entropy.
- It is a continuous process of balancing opposing random forces
within a range of arbitrary boundaries.
Efﬁciency Proper function necessitate order [191]. -Systems are not mandated to improve their efﬁciency. They are
machines that function with a range of errors.
-A constrained disorder enables higher ﬂexibility and adaptability
in continuously changing internal and external milieus.
Surprise Systems act and have intentions to reduce surprise, uncertainty,
and prediction errors[20,38,126,190,192]. Systems remain innon-
equilibrium steady-statesby restricting themselves to a limited
number of states[1–3,33,130].
- Systems are aimless machines that do not strive to reach a state
of lack of uncertainty and surprise.
- Existence and proper function require degrees of surprise,
uncertainty, complexity, and errors.
- Operations mandate moving between numerous states.
Markov blankets Markov blankets are dynamically random [38,62] - Systems comprise blankets over blankets that possess
randomness, continuously change, incorporate variabilities, and
have inconstant boundaries.
- Variabilities in Markov blankets ﬁt the requirement for a degree
of disorder in systems.
Self-organization in biology Self-organization means resistance to the dispersive effects of
ﬂuctuations and minimizing free energy[18,38,94–98,103].
- Systems existence is an ongoing balance between dispersive
effects of ﬂuctuations and boundaries on these ﬂuctuations and
between maximizing and minimizing the free energy.
Random ﬂuctuations At every level of self-organization, there are ﬂuctuations [105].I fa
system is in a non-equilibrium steady-state and exists, its ﬂow
counters random ﬂuctuations[18,72,106–109,109–112].
- Proper structures and functions mandate a degree of ﬂuctuations.
- A degree of random ﬂuctuation is not associated with the
dispersion of molecules’ structure and function.
Future Systems look into the future, select their targets and act
accordingly [12].
-Systems do not look into the future for selecting their actions.
- The future is random, and the internal and external milieus
continuously change.
- Systems do not act towards a target. Targets keep changing and
are randomly selected.
Disturbed systems Disturbances are associated with insufﬁcient minimization of free
energy and disorder[12].
-The constrained disorder is obligatory for existence and proper
operation.
-An excessively low or high degree of disorder and getting out of
its arbitrary boundaries leads to disturbances and disease.
Correcting disturbed
systems
-The constrained disorder principle provides a method for
correcting disturbed systems.
-Disturbed systems with a low level of the disorder can beneﬁt
from implementing constrained subject-tailored variabilities to
correct their malfunction and improve functionality.
-Systems that function outside of arbitrary boundaries beneﬁt
from tightening them.

The principle applies to three types of biological systems:
machines that function with a relatively minimal degree of errors,
such as biochemical reactions; entirely random machines, mani-
festing unpredictable responses toward random stimuli; and bio-
logical systems, such as HRV, that operate along imprecise
trajectories comprising a degree of random behaviors within arbi-
trary boundaries. For all three types of machines, applying the CDP
to the disturbed systems implies implementing disorder into sys-
tems’ operation schemes with a lower degree of disorder or tight-
ening the disorder boundaries for systems where their disorder is
out of control.
This method based on the CDP is similar to defective engineer-
ing of materials, suggesting that introducing a degree of error
improves the structures and functions of various constituents
[161–163].
Table 1 summarizes some of the differences between the CDP
and several theories on biological systems.
Second-generation artiﬁcial intelligence platforms comprise
algorithms based on the CDP for improving the therapeutic regi-
mens for chronic diseases [164,165]. These platforms integrate
the CDP into machine learning algorithms, getting them closer to
the fundamentals of biology. They implement variability within
pre-deﬁned personalized boundaries into therapeutic regimens
designed to improve clinical outcomes using personalized signa-
tures of variability intrinsic to health and disease states [164–
166]. The algorithms quantify variability signatures relevant to
the disease, such as HRV in patients with cardiac diseases, variabil-
ity in cytokines secretion in patients with inﬂammatory disorders,
or variability in electro-encephalographic tests in patients with
epilepsy, and implement them into the treatment regimens
[10,143,167–184].
This CDP-based method overcomes the loss of response to drugs
and the harmful compensatory mechanisms that reduce the effec-
tiveness of chronic therapies [166]. Implementing variability-
based algorithms enhances the response to interventions in multi-
ple chronic diseases, including cancer, chronic pain, heart failure,
epilepsy, hypertension, inﬂammatory diseases, diabetes, and liver
diseases [2,5,6,8–10,143,164–180,185]. Using the CDP-based algo-
rithms, which implement variability in a personalized way, the
platform can overcome the challenge of drug resistance in patients
with chronic disorders[164–166].
In summary, the CDP deﬁnes biological systems and the associ-
ations related to their existence and function. It describes health
and disease by specifying the ongoing random process of balancing
disorder and order and the personalized random boundaries of the
disorder in systems. This principle provides a method for correct-
ing disturbances of systems and, hence, improves therapies and
outcomes for diseased states.
