An integral vision of pain and its
persistence: a whole-person,
whole-system, salutogenic
perspective

Persistent pain remains a signiﬁcant global health challenge, with prevailing
biomedical and biopsychosocial models often falling short in capturing its full
complexity. These models frequently lack conceptual and contextual
coherence, overlooking the deeply subjective, cultural, and systemic
dimensions of pain. As a result, care can become fragmented and suboptimal.
This perspective article introduces an integral vision of pain, grounded in the
All Quadrants, All Levels (AQAL) framework, which offers a multidimensional
approach that integrates subjective experience, objective mechanisms, cultural
meaning, spiritual perspectives, and systemic structures. The article outlines
how a simpliﬁed AQAL framework can serve as a heuristic tool to synthesise
individual and collective dynamics— including psychological development and
socio-environmental conditions— thereby informing a more comprehensive
understanding of pain and its persistence. This includes recognising the role of
painogenic environments and the impact of evolutionary mismatch in shaping
pain experiences. This integral perspective reframes persistent pain within a
salutogenic social model of health, adopting a whole-person, whole-system
approach that supports the co-creation of compassionate, community-driven,
and context-sensitive care. Ultimately, it reconceptualises persistent pain not
merely as a disease state or clinical symptom, but as a dynamic, relational, and
meaning-laden experience embedded within the evolving journey of life. This
integral vision challenges reductionist paradigms, advancing a more coherent,
salutogenic, and humanistic model for understanding and addressing
persistent pain.

Introduction
Persistent (chronic) pain is a signiﬁcant burden to individual well-being, societal
health, and the sustainability of healthcare systems ( 1–3). Despite advances in and
widespread availability of biomedical and psychological interventions, persistent pain
continues to affect nearly one-third of the global population— a treatment-prevalence
paradox (
4–6). Pain is a complex and deeply human phenomenon that encompasses
hidden subjective inner states, observable physiological and behavioural correlates, and
interconnectedness to shared cultural and socio-ecological systems. Pain science is the
systematic study of the biological, psychological, and social mechanisms underlying pain
experience associated with actual or potential damaged and/or dysfunctional tissue (
7).

Historically, the focus of pain science on damaged and/or
dysfunctional tissue led to biomedical dominance and reduced
emphasis on subjective, cultural, and existential dimensions
(
8–10). The biopsychosocial model of pain redresses the
imbalance created by the dominance of the biomedical model.
The term biopsychosocial denotes an interdisciplinary
approach to health, illness, and care delivery, grounded in the
interplay between biological processes (e.g., genetics, physiology),
psychological dimensions (e.g., emotions, cognition, behaviour),
and social contexts (e.g., culture, relationships, socioeconomic
status). While representing a signi ﬁcant advancement over
reductionist biomedical paradigms — which reduce complex
human experiences to their simplest biological components— the
biopsychosocial model has faced critique for its limited sensitivity
to the subjective experience of pain and for the conceptual
fragmentation of its biological, psychological, and social domains
(
11–20). These domains often become disjointed in both
theoretical discourse and clinical practice, resulting in fragmented
care and a lack of explanatory coherence that is disconnected
from the lived reality ofbeing human.
This conceptual disjunction is further compounded by the
cultural and epistemological underpinnings of the model itself,
which originated within a Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,
and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural worldview (
21). The WEIRD
worldview tends to privilege individualism, analytical reasoning,
mechanistic interpretations, and impersonal prosociality, which
emphasizes cooperation among strangers based on abstract norms,
institutions, and rule-based fairness rather than close interpersonal
ties (
22–26). Such orientations may have driven the reductionist
biomedical paradigm and marginalization of relational, spiritual,
and existential dimensions of pain that are often foregrounded in
non-WEIRD cultural contexts (
27, 28). In many indigenous and
collectivist traditions, pain is not merely a pathological disruption
but a meaningful aspect of life’s natural rhythm — interwoven with
communal, emotional, and spiritual realities (
29–32).
The continued in ﬂuence of biomedical paradigms has
contributed to the recognition of persistent (chronic) primary pain
as a distinct (pathological) disease entity in the latest revision of
the World Health Organization ’s (WHO) International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-11) (
33–35). While this framing
offers many advantages, it also legitimizes biomedical interventions
that have, at least in part, contributed to systemic harms— such as
the global opioid crisis (
1, 36). Moreover, the empirical foundation
of many clinical interventions remains tenuous, with numerous
treatments demonstrating limited ef ﬁcacy in practice — often
attributed to a broader crisis in research quality (
37–39).
Conceptual ambiguities within pain science, including the
conﬂation of nociception with pain and the reliance on speculative
constructs further undermine theoretical clarity (
40–42).
A growing body of scholarship contends that pain is too
idiosyncratic, context-dependent, and meaning-laden to be
adequately captured by mechanistic or reductionist models
(
43–47). Meta-ethnographic perspectives have likened pain to an
ecosystem— dynamic, adaptive, and shaped by intersecting
biological, psychological, social, and environmental forces ( 48,
49). The sobriquet of "sticky pain"— a term coined by Borsook
et al. (50) to describe persistent, treatment-resistant pain— reﬂects
the failure of certain pain episodes to resolve. As a colloquial
term "stickiness" can be used to draw attention to the ecology of
pain and factors in contemporary life that may hinder pain
resolution (i.e., socio-ecological risk factors).
While the biopsychosocial model nominally incorporates
multiple domains, it does not explicitly engage with existential or
phenomenological frameworks — those that foreground
temporality, meaning, and the lived experience of suffering
(
11–17). There is increasing recognition that such perspectives
are essential for understanding pain not merely as a clinical
symptom but as a socially grounded, deeply human condition
(
45, 46, 51). However, the prevailing structure of professional
knowledge production continues to favour specialization over
integration, thereby impeding the development of comprehensive
models that re ﬂect the full scope of pain as a lived and
relational experience.
In response to these limitations, this article proposes a
contextual “integral” view of pain and its persistence that
includes all dimensions in a uniﬁed way. An integral approach
weaves together inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge, lived
experience, and re ﬂective inquiry to synthesise subjective
experiences of pain with its objective mechanisms, all within the
broader cultural, systemic, and environmental contexts of
contemporary life. It seeks to avoid reductionism, embrace
complexity, and honour both the inner life of the person in pain
and the scientiﬁc understanding of pain processes. An integral
approach emphasises the interconnectedness of the individual
within their social and environmental context — supporting a
whole-person, whole-system, whole-health perspective (
52–56).
The aim of this article is to present an integral vision of pain
that seeks to unify diverse disciplinary insights, fostering a
whole-person, whole-system, and salutogenic perspective on
understanding and addressing the persistence— or stickiness— of
pain. Building on previous work, this article extends the author’s
earlier mapping of pain onto a simpli ﬁed version of Ken
Wilber’s All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL) framework (
57).
Rooted in a contemporary, non-religious understanding of
spirituality— as meaning, purpose, and connection to self, others,
and nature — the integral, AQAL framework enhances the
traditional biopsychosocial approach by incorporating subjective
experience, objective mechanisms, cultural meaning, and systemic
inﬂuences. In doing so, it offers a more holistic, context-sensitive,
and experientially anchored understanding of pain and its
persistence, framed through an evolutionary mismatch,
salutogenic, and socially embedded model of health.
This integral perspective is shaped by the author ’s own
positionality as a white, male academic based at a post-1992 UK
university, with over four decades of experience in pain research.
Drawing on critical realism, positivist science, and re ﬂexive
inquiry, this work blends methodological rigour with integral
thinking that combines multiple perspectives — including
individual and collective, interior and exterior, science and
spirituality. It is informed by Integral Theory, biopsychosocial
and salutogenic paradigms, and evolutionary psychology. The
author remains critically aware of how his social and disciplinary
Johnson 10.3389/fpain.2025.1641571
Frontiers in
Pain Research 02 frontiersin.org
positioning informs his interpretations of the persistence of pain
and its cultural signiﬁcance, acknowledging the inﬂuence of both
personal and epistemological standpoints in shaping this
multidimensional approach.
Theoretical foundations and integral
framework
The understanding of pain has evolved from spiritual and
humoral interpretations to Descartes’ mechanistic model and the
dominance of biomedicine, before being reframed by Melzack
and Wall’s 1965 Gate Control Theory, which introduced the
nervous system’s modulatory role (
58). This set the stage for
Engel’s introduction of the biopsychosocial model in 1977
arguing that complex health conditions require considering not
only biological factors but also psychological and social
inﬂuences (
59). Following the adoption of the biopsychosocial
model (60), its translation into clinical practice has remained
partial, with the social dimension frequently marginalised or
insufﬁciently addressed. Advances in neuroscience reframed pain
as a complex brain-generated output shaped by context, emotion,
and cognition, prompting the emergence of psychologically
informed physiotherapy and interdisciplinary pain management.
More recently, scholars have advocated for post-biopsychosocial
approaches— such as enactive and 5E frameworks — that
emphasise the embodied, embedded, enacted, emotive, and
extended nature of pain (
11, 13). These developments reﬂect a
growing recognition of pain as a dynamic, lived experience
shaped by both internal processes and external environments,
reinforcing the need for holistic, patient-centred care.
Ken Wilber, a populist American psychologist/philosopher,
developed the concept of theintegral mindas a means of unifying
the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensionsof human
experience (
61, 62). His work is characterized by an effort to bridge
longstanding divides between Eastern and Western philosophies,
science and spirituality, and individual and collective perspectives.
At its core, integral thinking seeks to cultivate a holistic
understanding of reality in which diverse perspectives are not
merely acknowledged but actively harmonized (
61, 63). In practice,
the integral mind reﬂects an individual’s capacity to synthesize
multiple dimensions of experience into a coherent worldview. This
integral orientation aligns particularly well with existential models
of pain, which offer a deeply humanistic perspective— one that
recognizes both inner subjective experience and objective bodily
processes as inseparable from the shared cultural, environmental,
and spiritual dimensions of contemporary life.
Wilber developed the AQAL framework to create a
comprehensive model for understanding complex human
experiences (
61, 64). All Quadrants (AQ) refers to four different
perspectives on experience:
 individual-interior [upper-left (UL)]: intrasubjective, personal,
inner experience
 individual-exterior [upper-right (UR)]: intraobjective,
biology, behavior
 collective-interior [lower-left (LL)]: intersubjective, societal
culture and meanings
 collective-exterior [lower-right (LR)]: interobjective, societal
systems and structures.
All Levels (AL) refers to stages of development (complexity) that
shape how individuals and collectives interpret and respond to
an experience over time — represented by levels (stages) of
psychological development in the left side“interior” quadrants.
The AQAL framework is underpinned by several core
principles that render it particularly suitable for advancing an
integral perspective of pain:
 Non-Exclusion: All perspectives — psychological, biological,
social, environmental, and spiritual— are considered valid and
necessary for a comprehensive understanding.
 Enfoldment: Recognizes that experiences and interpretations
evolve across nested levels of personal and cultural development.
 Enactment: Emphasizes that reality is co-constructed through
interaction; pain is not merely a passive experience but is shaped
by relationships, environments, and meaning-making processes.
These principles resonate strongly with phenomenological and
socio-ecological understandings, which emphasize the meaning-
laden nature of embodied, embedded and enacted pain
experience of people interconnected with the shared culture of
others and environmental settings [e.g., (
11, 65)]. The AQAL
framework’s emphasis on the “inner-world” (interiority) and
developmental levels of psychological complexity supports the
integration of such insights into both clinical and theoretical
models (
61, 64).
While the biopsychosocial model acknowledges multiple
domains, it lacks the structural coherence and contextual depth.
In contrast, AQAL integrates:
 Subjective experience and existential meaning of the individual
(UL)
 Objective bodily correlates of the individual (UR)
 Cultural narratives and meanings of the collective (LL)
 Systemic and institutional inﬂuences of the collective (LR)
 The evolving nature of psychological understandings (levels of
development)
Furthermore, the AQAL framework supports a transdisciplinary
synthesis by bridging insights from philosophy, psychology,
medicine, sociology, ecology, and spirituality. This consolidative
capacity makes it an ideal foundation for a comprehensive,
whole-person, whole-system, whole-health model of pain and its
persistence that is both scientiﬁc and existentially meaningful. In
this context, the act of modelling becomes inseparable from the
phenomenon being modelled. Any framework used to
conceptualise pain not only reﬂects but also shapes how pain is
understood, treated, and even experienced. In this sense, models
of pain do not merely describe reality— they actively participate
in constructing it.
This dynamic is evident in the evolution of pain models
themselves. The biomedical [“pain pathway”(sic)] model, with its
emphasis on tissue damage and pathology, historically shaped
clinical practice around physical (biomechanistic) interventions.

Nowadays, the biopsychosocial model, incorporating psychological
and social dimensions, shapes multidimensional understandings
and multidisciplinary clinical practices adopting patient-centred
approaches. Building on this progression, an integral model —
framed through an AQAL, evolutionary-mismatch and
salutogenesis (origins of health) lens — seeks to hold multiple
perspectives simultaneously to construct person-centred, context-
sensitive, meaning-making approaches to empower people to
actively reshape their living experiences of pain in the modern
world. Thus, the vision for an integral framework is not only to
represent the persistence of pain more comprehensively, but to
actively reshape how it is lived and addressed — expanding the
possibilities for healing.
Mapping pain to the AQAL framework
Previously, the author mapped features of pain onto a
simpliﬁed version of the AQAL framework highlighting certain
limitations of the biopsychosocial model while preserving its
foundational insights, thereby enabling an extension of the
biopsychosocial model’s conceptual scope (
57). As a heurist tool
the simpliﬁed AQAL framework is capable of accommodating
both personal experience and systemic context in an organizing
structure that visualises the location of multidimension aspects of
pain, as represented by the four quadrants in
Figure 1.
All quadrants
While the biopsychosocial model emphasizes the interplay of
biological, psychological, and social factors at the level of the
individual, the simpliﬁed AQAL framework broadens this scope
by integrating individual, collective, interior and exterior
perspectives offering insights that enables a more nuanced and
layered understanding within the context of structures and
systems of contemporary living. The quadrant structure aligns
closely with the multidimensional nature of pain, contextualizing
pain within a biopsychosocial-existential paradigm. Pain emerges
from an individual’s biological processes (UR) to be experienced
by the individual subjectively (UL), shaped by collective cultural
and existential narratives (LL), and interaction with collective
systems and structures of social and physical environments (LR).
Visually and conceptually distinguishing aspects of pain and its
persistence between quadrants enhances the clarity of pain theory
in ways that the biopsychosocial model alone does not achieve. By
locating pain within the subjective (UL) quadrant, AQ mapping
helps to expose conceptual errors, such as the reiﬁcation of pain
(the fallacy of misplaced concreteness)— treating pain as a ﬁxed,
object-like “thing”— as well as conﬂating pain with nociception, a
miscommunication that continues to obscure theoretical and
clinical clarity (
40, 41). Quadrant analysis informed by
transdisciplinary knowledge provides opportunities to analyse,
evaluate and integrate contemporary pain theories such as the
FIGURE 1
The quadrants framework offers a comprehensive lens through which to understand the multidimensional nature of pain. The Upper Right (UR)
quadrant represents the objective, observable aspects of the individual, including neuroscientiﬁc and biological mechanisms that govern bodily
functions and behaviours. In contrast, the Upper Left (UL) quadrant addresses the subjective, psychological, and experiential dimensions of the
individual’s inner life. The Lower Left (LL) quadrant encompasses the intersubjective domain, highlighting the cultural, moral, and relational
inﬂuences that shape meaning within collective society. Finally, the Lower Right (LR) quadrant captures the interobjective dimension, focusing on
systemic, structural, and environmental factors that inﬂuence the broader socio-ecological context. Together, these quadrants provide a holistic
framework for understanding pain as a complex interplay of individual and collective, internal and external factors. Based on (
57).

Embodied Predictive Processing Theory of pain experience (66),
the 5E Enactive Theory of Pain (11), and the Healthy Settings
Model of Pain ( 67), within the contextual reality of
contemporary life.
For example, by embedding Bayesian and Active Inference
models within a broader integral framework, we gain a more
nuanced understanding of how pain is continually remodelled
through both internal cognitive processes and external
sociocultural structures. Active Inference and Bayesian
approaches to cognition offer insights into how pain experience
arises from neural tissue. Grounded in the predictive processing
paradigm, these models propose that the brain is not a passive
recipient of sensory input but an active constructor of experience
— constantly generating predictions about the world and
updating them in response to sensory evidence in order to
minimise prediction error.
In the context of pain, this suggests that the experience of pain is
not a direct reﬂection of tissue damage, but a probabilistic inference
shaped by prior beliefs, contextual cues, and learned expectations.
Persistent pain may reﬂect a state in which entrenched priors,
encoded within cortical and subcortical networks, infer non-
noxious stimuli as threatening or harmful— even in the absence of
nociceptive input— thereby sustaining maladaptive predictions that
resist revision. Active Inference extends this view by highlighting
the role of action in reducing prediction error: neuroplasticity
updates entrenched priors encoded in neural networks by acting
on the world — or the body — to align sensory input with
expectations. This dynamic interplay between perception,
cognition, and action underscores how pain is not merely passively
experienced but actively constructed and sustained.
A four-quadrant framework provides a structured lens through
which this process can be understood. For example, the
intrasubjective quadrant (UL) captures the inﬂuence of prior beliefs
and expectations on a person ’s inner living experience; the
intraobjective quadrant (UR) addresses the physiological and
neurological mechanisms underpinning predictive processing; the
intersubjective quadrant (LL) reﬂects the role of cultural narratives
and shared meanings in shaping understandings of pain; and the
interobjective quadrant (LR) encompasses the systemic and
institutional structures that embed and reinforce these predictive
models. This integrative perspective not only deepens theoretical
insight but also opens new pathways for therapeutic intervention—
targeting maladaptive predictions, enhancing agency, and reshaping
the experiential reality of pain. Beyond informing intervention, the
quadrant framework can also serve as an analytical tool to analyse
and evaluate dimensions of existing treatments and practices.
Quadrant mapping reveals the individualistic, downstream bias
of current thinking dominated by biomedical and psychological
treatment, such as surgery, pharmacotherapy, and psychologically
orientated interventions that focus on upper quadrant domains
of the individual. Quadrant mapping fronts the collective cultural
and socio-ecological dimensions, highlighting their interplay with
the evolutionary mismatch between the UR and LR quadrants—
namely, the tension between our Paleolithic physiology (UR) and
a contemporary physical and social environment (LR) with
painogenic in ﬂuences that prime development and hinder
resolution of pain i.e., make pain "sticky" (
68, 69). Embedded
within the lower quadrants are large-scale social, cultural,
economic, and political forces that subtly, and often invisibly,
shape individual and communal experiences in harmful or
oppressive ways. Some of these inﬂuences are insidious such as
medicalization of suffering, neoliberal ideologies, capitalist
productivity culture, technocratic governance, colonial legacies,
structural racism, patriarchy, ableism and, importantly, damage-
laden and militaristic medical language (
70–74). Some insidious
macro-level forces go unrecognized within the conventional
biopsychosocial model of pain, including damage-loaded
warmongering pain language (
70).
All levels
The AQAL framework also incorporates levels of psychological
development across multiple lines of intelligence — cognitive,
emotional, moral, and spiritual (61, 64). Levels of development
reﬂect how individuals and societies evolve in their
understanding and response to complex phenomena such as
pain. They illuminate how beliefs, attitudes, and values toward
pain shift over time — for instance, from premodern
undifferentiated blends of philosophical, religious, and medical
thought; to modernist biomechanistic models, and more recently,
to postmodern biopsychosocial perspectives. Psychological
developmental sensitivity offers a nuanced understanding of how
pain is conceptualized and managed across diverse personal and
cultural contexts. Viewing pain through a developmental lens can
help explain variations in lived experiences and treatment
responses, depending on whether individuals, practitioners, or
healthcare systems interpret pain through biomedical,
biopsychosocial, holistic, or spiritual frameworks. See reference
(
57) for further detail on developmental levels in the context of
pain, including examples of how understandings of pain evolve
across different stages of psychological development— in patients,
practitioners, and healthcare systems.
In summary, the AQAL framework offers a more dynamic and
personalized understanding of the persistence of pain, including
the role of upstream in ﬂuences— such as cultural narratives,
environmental stressors, and systemic inequities— that contribute
to painogenic conditions. Hence, an integral worldview would
not only consider biopsychosocial domains focussing on the
individual but extends this to cultural narratives, social structures
and systems, and existential meaning, aiming for a whole-person,
whole-system, whole-health understanding.
Main perspectives
An integral vision of pain and its persistence
The goal of applying the AQAL framework to pain begins with
an integral vision: a guiding worldview that seeks to advance how
pain and its persistence (stickiness) is understood and engaged
with— moving beyond a fragmented, decontextualised and
Johnson 10.3389/fpain.2025.1641571
Frontiers in
Pain Research 05 frontiersin.org
symptom-focused biopsychosocial interpretation toward a more
compassionate, whole-person, and context-sensitive integral
perspective (
Figure 2).
An integral vision of pain reconceptualizes pain as a dynamic,
relational phenomenon shaped by subjective experience and
meaning-making, biological processes, and interconnectedness
with cultural narratives, systems and structures. In doing so, it
moves beyond the traditional biopsychosocial model by expanding
both its conceptual and contextual scope. Conceptually, it
incorporates four irreducible dimensions of human experience: the
individual-interior (subjective experience), individual-exterior
(biological processes and behaviours), collective-interior (cultural
meanings), and collective-exterior (social and environmental
settings). It also integrates developmental levels, acknowledging
that individuals and systems evolve over time. Contextually, it
situates pain within broader ecological, relational, and historical
frameworks, highlighting the importance of meaning-making
processes that may be overlooked in conventional biopsychosocial
approaches [see (
57)].
An integral vision of pain reclaims spirituality as a vital
dimension of psychological growth and a deepened sense of
interconnectedness with broader existential realities, recognising
its role in identity, resilience and healing. In a contemporary
context, spirituality is understood in non-religious terms — as
meaning, purpose, and connection to self, others, and nature
(
75). Spirituality remains central to end-of-life and palliative care
yet is largely absent from guidelines about managing persistent
pain (
76). This omission reﬂects a broader tendency to overlook
the existential and cultural dimensions of pain in chronic
care contexts.
Systematically mapping the multifaceted nature of pain onto a
simpliﬁed AQAL framework helps illuminate these neglected
domains— particularly the collective cultural and socio-ecological
factors implicated in an evolutionary mismatch. Evolutionarily
conserved physiological systems, shaped by ancestral Paleolithic
environments, may be poorly adapted to contemporary
“painogenic” conditions— such as sedentary lifestyles, social
disconnection, and fragmented healthcare (
68). This mismatch
may be particularly relevant to the development and persistence
of chronic primary pain (
69, 77).
An integral vision builds on insights from evolutionary-
mismatch (68), salutogenic theory (78, 79), trauma-informed care
(80, 81), and a socio-ecological "settings" model (67) to deepen
understanding of the persistence — or “stickiness"— of pain. It
provides a foundation for restoring coherence across the AQAL
quadrants through narrative integration, socially responsive care,
FIGURE 2
Mapping pain through All Quadrants to inform an integral vision for pain and its persistence. Thisﬁgure synthesizes the outcome of applying the All
Quadrants framework to the experience of pain, revealing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional perspective that transcends reductionist models. By
situating pain within all four quadrants— biological, psychological, cultural, and systemic— the mapping exposes conceptual limitations in conventional
pain science and extends the biopsychosocial model toward a more integrative, coherent, and holistic paradigm. AQAL framework mapping supports
enhanced conceptual clarity, traces the evolution of pain theories, and aligns with holistic philosophies that reclaim spirituality and promote
salutogenesis. It highlights the in ﬂuence of macro-level forces, structural barriers, and power dynamics, while advocating for upstream,
community-empowered, and whole-person approaches. This integral mindset reframes pain from a purely clinical issue to a lived, contextual
experience— shifting the focus from tissue to experience, from pain to "stickiness," and from pathogenesis to salutogenesis. Ultimately, it lays the
foundation for transformative, culturally responsive, and systemically informed pain support services. Based on (
57).
Johnson 10.3389/fpain.2025.1641571

and meaning-making practices that support healing as part of an
evolving life journey. This approach addresses the evolutionary,
environmental, and developmental factors that may contribute to
the entrenchment of suffering, aiming not only to account for
the persistence of pain but also to inform how it might be more
effectively understood, lived with, and addressed. By drawing
together diverse perspectives, the integral model offers a
framework that supports personal narratives, reduces stigma, and
encourages more empathetic, person-centred clinical dialogue.
The integration of salutogenesis— anchored in the principles
of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness —
transforms pain from a chaotic disruption into a coherent and
meaningful aspect of one ’s evolving identity. This process,
supported by the intrasubjective (UL) and intersubjective (LL)
quadrants of the integral model, fosters a growth-oriented, life-
afﬁrming approach to pain and associated suffering. By
promoting a more coherent and resilient orientation toward
healing, salutogenesis also facilitates shared decision-making,
afﬁrms lived experience, and strengthens both therapeutic
relationships and broader public engagement.
While building on the foundations of the biopsychosocial
model, this integral approach seeks to extend its reach by more
fully engaging with the lived experience of pain. Through
fostering personal agency, narrative coherence, and socially
responsive care, it offers a more holistic and potentially
empowering path to healing — one that considers not only
symptoms, but the broader context of the person’s life. In this
light, an integral vision invites a gradual cultural shift in how
pain and its persistence are conceptualised and addressed, with
an emphasis on complexity, compassion, and collective wellbeing.
An integral approach to healthcare
An integral vision advances the biopsychosocial model by
reframing it as a dynamic, context-sensitive framework capable
of more fully engaging with the complexity of lived experience,
cultural meaning, and structural context in the understanding
and treatment of persistent pain. It offers a conceptual
architecture for reconﬁguring the limits of healthcare, enabling a
more inclusive, multidimensional approach that aligns healthcare
with the full spectrum of human experience and systemic
complexity— supported by communities committed to whole-
person, whole-system care.
Applying the integral perspective: a case
illustration
The case of a 45-year-old ofﬁce worker with chronic low back
pain illustrates how the integral framework can enrich
understanding: in the intrasubjective quadrant (UL), they contend
with fear of movement, emotional distress, and limiting beliefs
such as “I’m broken, ” which shape their inner world and inﬂuence
their pain experience. The intraobjective quadrant (UR) quadrant
captures observable physical symptoms including muscle tension,
altered posture, and reduced mobility, alongside diagnostic
ﬁndings from laboratory tests, imaging, or clinical assessments.
In the intersubjective quadrant (LL), cultural norms— such as a
damage-loaded pain narrative, ideals of masculinity, expectations
of productivity, and beliefs about aging — inform how the
individual interprets and communicates their pain, while the
presence or absence of social support from family, colleagues, or
healthcare providers signiﬁcantly affects their coping capacity. The
interobjective (LR) quadrant re ﬂects broader systemic and
environmental inﬂuences, including living conditions, income,
employment status, workplace ergonomics, access to healthcare,
and policy frameworks that shape the trajectory of recovery.
Together, these dimensions create a whole-person, whole system
understanding of the person’s situation.
The four-quadrant framework informs a comprehensive care
strategy to address the full spectrum of the individual ’s
experience. For example, psychological support such as Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT) targets maladaptive beliefs, emotional distress,
and fear-avoidance behaviours, fostering greater self-efﬁcacy and
meaning-making (UL). Physical rehabilitation, including
physiotherapy, graded activity, and movement-based
interventions targets observable impairments such as muscle
tension, reduced mobility, and postural dysfunction, alongside
ongoing review of diagnostic ﬁndings (UR). Culturally sensitive
pain education and therapeutic dialogue help reframe
internalised narratives around pain, masculinity, and
productivity, while peer support and family involvement
strengthen social cohesion and emotional resilience (LL).
Systemic and environmental interventions may include workplace
adjustments, improved ergonomics, coordinated multidisciplinary
care, and navigation of healthcare access pathways (LR).
Together, these quadrant-aligned strategies advance the
biopsychosocial model into a more integral, whole-person,
whole-system paradigm — one that supports healing through
coherence, connection, and contextual responsiveness across all
domains of human experience. Framing this support within a
salutogenic perspective, further enhances care by fostering
comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness — three
foundational elements that help individuals make sense of their
pain, feel equipped to navigate it, and ﬁnd purpose in their
recovery journey.
Reimagining pain within a salutogenic social
model of health
An integral vision supports a reconﬁguration of persistent pain
within a social model of health with equal partnerships between
pain livers, the voluntary, community and social enterprise
(VCSE) sector, and healthcare providers. It opens opportunities
to frame persistent pain not merely as a clinical symptom but as
a socially embedded, meaning-laden phenomenon. It has
potential to facilitate a shift from a fragmented, pathogenic
model of care to a coherent, salutogenic, and humanistic
paradigm. An integral vision supports the co-production of
culturally relevant services, tailored to local needs and grounded
in shared values. It emphasizes relationality, empowerment, and
systemic awareness.

First-person research suggests that individuals living with
persistent (chronic) pain beneﬁt from approaches that validate
their pain through meaningful explanations so that they feel their
personal stories are heard and acknowledged (
49, 82). A healing
journey with chronic pain involves being reconnected with a
sense of identity and purpose to restore self-worth and
reintegration into social life — especially within safe and
supportive environments that foster a sense of belonging and
community (
49). Healthcare services often fail to address these
experiential and existential needs, focusing instead on
downstream interventions. An integral model of care shifts the
focus upstream, reimagining support services aligned with health
promotion, community-based settings and salutogenic principles.
Antonovsky’s concept of salutogenesis, introduced in 1979,
shifts the focus from the origins of disease to the origins of
health (
78, 83). Within this framework, the experience of
persistent pain is understood not solely as a pathological
condition but as an opportunity for individuals to derive
meaning and coherence from suffering. Central to this approach
is the sense of coherence , which enables individuals — either
independently or collectively — to interpret pain in a way that
supports psychological resilience and positive adaptation.
Salutogenesis acknowledges the in ﬂuence of socio-economic,
environmental, and contextual factors on health outcomes,
recognising that individuals can maintain or regain health despite
ongoing pain.
The salutogenic model of health promotion (
78, 84, 85), which
emphasizes the origins of health and well-being, aligns closely with
the integral approach by highlighting three key salutogenic
dimensions:
 Comprehensibility – making sense of pain and its persistence
 Manageability – having the resources to cope with and
transform through painful experiences
 Meaningfulness – ﬁnding purpose in experiences of pain and
its persistence
Salutogenic strategies promote positive health behaviours through
education and literacy, social support, and community
engagement that validates pain through compassionate listening,
self-kindness, and safe social reconnection — principles that are
often absent in conventional pain care.
Cultural transformation: from integrative to
integral
The greatest challenge to integral transformation lies in
dismantling entrenched structural hierarchies. Despite widespread
acknowledgment of the importance of environmental
determinants of health— such as housing, transport, and living
conditions— public health and health promotion in countries like
the UK, US, and Australia continues to prioritise individual
behaviour change. This disconnect is attributed to “lifestyle
drift,” where policies initially aimed at addressing upstream social
determinants shift focus to downstream lifestyle interventions.
Lifestyle drift is partly due to the relative ease of designing and
evaluating individual-level interventions compared to
structural ones.
In pain management, this trend is particularly evident, with
care guidelines remaining individual-centred. Green et al. (
65)
argue that while health promotion should target structural
factors, it is often reduced to personal responsibility, and then
medicalised— e.g., lifestyle medicine, prescriptive exercise.
Nonetheless, there is growing recognition that health is shaped
largely by factors beyond individual control, prompting
international calls— such as the Shanghai Declaration (
86)— to
prioritise supportive environments that make healthy choices
more accessible.
Despite long-standing policy commitments to community-
empowered care, power, funding, and decision-making remain
disproportionately concentrated in healthcare-led institutions,
marginalising the very social, relational, and community assets
essential for whole-system change. Contemporary healthcare
systems promote integrated or integrative pain care, often
through multidisciplinary teams that combine biopsychosocial
approaches. The International Association for the Study of Pain
(IASP) deﬁnes integrative care as a coordinated, evidence-based
model that blends conventional and complementary treatments
(
87–89). Integrative services frequently remain extensions of
existing systems, relying on mechanism-guided, single-treatment
interventions that privilege UR quadrant domains. This narrow
focus not only overlooks the socio-ecological complexity inherent
in the experience of pain, but also externalises the ﬁnancial,
logistical, and administrative burdens of coordinating multiple
services— consequences that often manifest as systemic
inefﬁciencies, increased clinician burnout, and the perpetuation
of fragmented care pathways (
90–92). A persistent “silo effect”
and misalignment between clinicians and patients further hinder
collaboration and shared understanding.
Gaudet (
56) argues that incremental improvements in existing
services are no longer suf ﬁcient, calling for systemic “true”
transformation across healthcare, culture, and community.
“We are starting from the wrong place. To change the
outcomes of the system, we need to change the conversation.
We need to start with discovering what gives each of us a
sense of meaning and purpose. What matters most deeply in
our lives?” (
56) p.2
An integral vision is for“true cultural transformation” through
reinterpretation of the persistence of pain within a social model of
health aligned with whole-person perspectives (
93, 94), person-
centred health care ( 51), and unitary care science ( 95). An
integral vision would be to reconﬁgure pain from always being a
pathologic problem to be eliminated, to a meaning-making,
growth-orientated experience that warrants interpretation within
an evolving life-journey. Such a shift necessitates aligning what is
important to patients with reimagined care systems, professional
roles, and cultural narratives.
Rethinking Pain: community-based support for
chronic pain
Overcoming structural and cultural barriers is a major
challenge to integral transformation. UK health policy has long
Johnson 10.3389/fpain.2025.1641571
Frontiers in
Pain Research 08 frontiersin.org
advocated for community-empowered care yet implementation has
been limited (
96, 97). Funding and authority in the UK and
elsewhere remain concentrated in healthcare-led services, often
sidelining social care, patients and community organizations
(
98–100). An integral vision of pain challenges this imbalance,
advocating for the redistribution of power and the collaborative
design of services that reﬂect the lived realities of those they aim
to support. This is exempliﬁed by initiatives such as the UK’s
Rethinking Pain programme (
101, 102) commissioned by a
National Health Service (NHS) Integrated Care Board (ICB) and
led by a VCSE-sector organisation [Keighley Healthy Living (
103)].
Rethinking Pain is a co-produced, community-based pain
support service that values relationality, community
empowerment, and systemic awareness, developed under NHS
clinical governance to address chronic pain and health
inequalities through culturally adapted, holistic care. Informed by
guidelines for assessing and managing persistent pain published
by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
(
104) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
(105), the Rethinking Pain service integrates physical, mental,
social, environmental, and spiritual dimensions of health. With
input from service users, VCSE partners, clinicians, health
promoters, and academics, Rethinking Pain offers a three-tier
care pathway to support people living with persistent pain
through a holistic, culturally responsive approach. The service
includes workshops that cover a wide range of topics such as
beliefs, faith and spirituality, “your story ”, creative therapies,
emotional wellbeing, keeping active, diet therapy, sleep therapy,
and pain education. These workshops are delivered in various
languages to ensure they are accessible and culturally relevant.
Service users also engage in personalised care planning, working
alongside trained health coaches to co-develop strategies tailored
to their individual physical, emotional, social and spiritual needs
(
102). Grounded in salutogenic principles and community
ownership— with health coaches as the cornerstone of delivery—
Rethinking Pain enhances engagement, treatment adherence, and
equity by aligning care with diverse cultural values and lived
experiences. While not explicitly structured around the AQAL
framework, the Rethinking Pain service reﬂects many of its core
principles, particularly its commitment to whole-person, whole-
system, whole-health care for individuals with persistent pain not
linked to serious underlying medical conditions.
Challenges and priorities
Looking ahead, the AQAL framework offers a powerful tool for
enhancing service design and delivery by ensuring that all
fundamental dimensions of the pain experience— individual and
collective, internal and external— are systematically addressed. Its
integrative architecture promotes conceptual and contextual
coherence, helping services avoid reductionist tendencies and
instead embrace the full complexity of human experience. By
accommodating different levels of psychological development and
cultural worldviews, AQAL can guide the tailoring of
interventions and narratives to meet the evolving needs of
diverse individuals and communities. This makes it especially
valuable for designing dynamic, community-based, person-
centred care models that are both inclusive and adaptive —
advancing the biopsychosocial model into a truly
integral paradigm.
Despite its conceptual strengths, the AQAL framework has had
limited exposure in peer-review academic literature and lacks
empirical validation. While theoretically rich, levels of
psychological development as formulated by Wilber (
61, 62,
64, 106) are conceptually ﬂuid and may be prone to
overinterpretation, e.g., transpersonal levels of development lack
mainstream psychological acceptance (
107, 108).
A common critique of Wilber ’s integral framework is its
perceived complexity, which not only encompasses quadrants
and levels but also includes lines of development, states of
consciousness, and types — making it challenging to apply in
practical or clinical contexts without signiﬁcant interpretive effort
(
63, 107, 108). A challenge in applying the integral model to
clinical practice lies in the overwhelming complexity that
emerges when attempting to account for every possible variable.
This level of detail introduces a substantial computational
burden, making real-world implementation dif ﬁcult without
deliberate simpli ﬁcation. To address this, model reduction
becomes essential— a process of selectively narrowing the scope
to focus on the most relevant and inﬂuential variables. Achieving
model reduction within an integral vision of pain, while
preserving its theoretical depth and multidimensional scope,
requires balancing conceptual richness with clinical usability.
This can be accomplished by adopting the four quadrants as the
primary heuristic framework and selectively incorporating
developmental levels to align narratives with an individual ’s
worldview, thereby simplifying the model into a more accessible
and clinically useful tool (
57).
Rather than aiming for exhaustive quadrant coverage, clinicians
can use the quadrants as a reﬂective guide to identify patterns and
gaps in care. Translating the model into practical tools for
practitioners and livers — such as structured checklists or
narrative-based guides — would further enhance applicability.
Distributing quadrant responsibilities across interdisciplinary
teams fosters shared ownership and would reduce cognitive
burden, enabling the AQAL framework to function as aﬂexible,
coherent, unifying lens. When integrated with established models
such as the biopsychosocial framework or Bayesian and Active
Inference theories, AQAL supports enhanced clinical reasoning
without overwhelming practitioners.
To enhance the applicability and scholarly credibility of the
AQAL framework within pain science, several research priorities
warrant attention. Cultural and contextual analyses are needed to
examine how sociocultural and environmental factors contribute to
the persistence of pain and inﬂuence treatment outcomes. At the
macro level, it is important to investigate the impact of broader
social forces— such as public policy, socioeconomic inequality, and
media representations— on the lived experience of pain. Evaluative
studies of AQAL-informed policies and community-based
programs can help assess their effectiveness in improving health
outcomes and promoting health equity. Integrating diverseresearch

paradigms may also facilitate a more holistic understanding of pain,
shifting the focus beyond symptom alleviation to encompass
broader outcomes such as wellbeing and quality of life.
Interdisciplinary collaboration across all quadrants — biological,
psychological, cultural, and socio-ecological— is essential to ensure
comprehensive analysis. Engaging a wide range of stakeholders,
particularly individuals with lived experience of persistent pain, is
vital for validating researchﬁndings and ensuring their relevance.
Finally, the design of interventions should remain adaptiv e,
incorporating ongoing stakeholder feedback and responding to
evolving cultural narratives.
Conclusion
This article proposes that an integral perspective— drawing on
the AQAL framework, evolutionary mismatch theory, and
salutogenic principles— offers a novel way to reconceptualize the
nature and treatment of persistent or "sticky" pain. From this
foundation emerges an integral model, a practical tool that maps
the biological, psychological, social, cultural, and existential
dimensions of pain across individual and collective contexts,
offering a more coherent and holistic approach that
acknowledges pain as a deeply embedded, meaning-
rich experience.
By conceptualising pain as both a physiological event and a
meaning-laden experience, this approach interprets its persistence
as a reﬂection of broader cultural and environmental conditions
in contemporary life. It challenges the limitations of reductionist
paradigms and fragmented understandings by reframing the
biopsychosocial model to account for the dislocated domains of
pain— where biological, psychological and social in ﬂuences are
often treated in isolation rather than as interconnected elements.
This reconceptualization positions pain as a dynamic, relational,
and context-sensitive phenomenon, capable of more fully
engaging with the complexity of lived experience, cultural
meaning, and modern habitats.
By enhancing conceptual clarity, the AQAL framework invites
the general public into a more nuanced and relatable
understanding of pain by building on established pain education
concepts— such as an “overprotective brain (sic)” and reductive
explanations focussing solely on a hyperexcitable nervous system.
Through narrative and storytelling, mapping lived experiences
across four interrelated domains can be brought vividly to life.
For instance, a woman living with ﬁbromyalgia may describe
how her body ﬂares up under stress (UR), how she feels
emotionally dismissed and misunderstood (UL), how her daily
environment lacks appropriate adaptations to support her
condition (LR), and how her family struggles to believe that her
pain is as severe as she reports (LL). These stories help
individuals explain their pain within a broader, integrative
framework— one that validates their experience, challenges
fragmented models of care, and opens new pathways for healing
that are both compassionate and contextually grounded through
salutogenesis to catalyse a sense of coherence. Such conceptual
clarity lays the foundations to develop an integral vision that
empowers communities and the VCSE sector services to co-
create health-promoting solutions. With the support of
healthcare providers, this model exempli ﬁes a shift toward
relational, whole-person, whole-system care.
Ultimately, an integral vision calls for a cultural
transformation in how persistent pain is conceptualized,
communicated, and addressed— emphasizing the importance of
meaning-making and ensuring access to resources that support
coping and psychological growth through health promotion. An
integral vision of pain places individual empowerment at its
core— recognizing each person ’s capacity to transform painful
experiences into transformative purpose (
109). Realizing this
integral vision requires a shift from institutional control to
fostering personal agency within empowered communities
rooted in the cultural and environmental realities of
contemporary life.
