This study considered three aspects of residential wood energy use in Alaska: 
current conditions and fuel consumption, knowledge and attitudes, and future use 
and conditions. We found that heating oil was the primary fuel for home heating 
in southeast and interior Alaska, whereas natural gas was used most often in 
south-central Alaska (Anchorage). Firewood heating played a much more impor-
tant role as a secondary (vs. primary) heating source in all regions of Alaska. In 
interior Alaska, there was a somewhat greater interest in the use of wood energy 
compared to other regions. Likewise, consumption of fossil fuels was consider-
ably greater in interior Alaska. Cost was a primary factor influencing motivation 
to convert to wood energy. Most respondents were at least somewhat familiar 
with residential wood-burning systems, however relatively few were familiar with 
Environmental Protection Agency certified woodstoves. Firewood/cordwood 
was by far the preferred wood fuel choice, whereas wood briquettes were least 
preferred. Similarly, firewood was the type of wood fuel that respondents were 
most familiar with. Variations were observed between Alaska’s primary regions 
(southeast, south-central, and interior). This could be attributed to a number of 
factors including colder climates in interior Alaska, and overall low use of wood 
energy in south-central Alaska because of preferences for natural gas. Fuel oil 
prices of $4.00 to $5.00 per gallon would be needed for most homeowners to 
convert to wood heating. There was a broad range of willingness to pay for new 
wood energy systems (from about $1,000 to $3,000). However, this survey was 
not random and results may not be representative of the populations at each 
sampling location.

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
1
Introduction
Given the peak in fuel oil prices during 2008, there has been an increased interest 
in renewable energy for home heating in many areas in Alaska. Wood energy is an 
important renewable energy option in forested regions of the state, and can be eas-
ily implemented on a small scale using local resources.  During the past few years, 
a resurgence of wood energy for home heating has occurred in addition to larger 
scale wood heating facilities, including a school (Craig, Alaska) and several wood 
products facilities having lumber dry kilns (Craig, Thorne Bay, Hoonah, and Delta 
Junction, Alaska). On Prince of Wales Island, feasibility assessments have identi-
fied potential opportunities for even more facilities, including cordwood heating of 
schools, community centers, and several other public buildings (T.R. Miles 2006). 
In Sitka, a city resolution has set a goal of using “local labor and materials includ-
ing recycled paper and cardboard” to heat 800 homes by the end of 2009 (City and 
Borough of Sitka, Alaska 2008). Benefits of increased use of biomass energy in 
Alaska could include reduced home heating costs, efficient use of waste products, 
and additional revenues for local sawmills. Other benefits that could be more dif-
ficult to quantify include carbon emission reductions, improved forest health, and 
habitat and watershed restoration benefits (Tongass Futures Roundtable 2008). 
Natural gas is the major fuel used in south-central Alaska. There have been 
recent price increases for this source of energy, and the potential exists for natural 
gas shortages in this region by 2012, especially if colder than normal winters persist 
(Loy 2009). Regardless of these factors, natural gas still has a competitive advan-
tage over wood in south-central Alaska, although with an uncertain future. In inte-
rior Alaska, heating oil is commonly used for residential heating. However, wood 
energy is being increasingly used for residential heating, and larger facilities have 
been established in Delta Junction and Dot Lake, Alaska (Nicholls 2009). Although 
high fuel oil prices have resulted in a significant interest in wood energy, recent 
price fluctuations underscore the importance of developing stable fuel sources not 
subject to demand based on world markets or changing economic conditions. 
An important first step in adopting wood energy will be understanding con-
sumer preferences for various wood energy products, the types of existing and new 
equipment, and the ones preferred by residential consumers. Several wood energy 
equipment dealers in southeast Alaska have become established, and in recent years 
business has increased considerably (Bauman 2005). Other forest products firms 
and fuel suppliers have expanded their product lines to include firewood. Fuel avail-
ability differs by region, but wood energy products that are available to southeast 
Alaska residents include firewood/cordwood (figs. 1 and 2), pellets (fig. 3), and 
other densified fuel products. Cordwood is firewood cut and split into conveniently

sized pieces for easy stacking. Pellets are made from compacted sawdust or other 
wood waste products. Biobricks are made from compressed wood waste (like 
pellets) but formed into larger stackable bricks. On Prince of Wales Island, a new 
biomass cooperative has been formed among local mill owners to combine and 
utilize mill waste wood. A business plan is being developed to build a facility to 
manufacture biobricks for an alternative source of energy. 
In 2007, the Fairbanks Economic Development Council conducted a survey to 
determine interest of consumers in the Fairbanks area to convert to wood pellets 
(Robb 2007). When consumers were made aware of the costs, 42 percent of those 
in the southeast and 55 percent of those in the Fairbanks areas stated they would 
consider converting to pellet fuel. Important wood fuel properties include unit 
size, density, moisture content, and moisture resistance. Also important will be 
fuel delivery method and labor requirements to prepare, transport, and burn fuel in 
homes. In Sitka and other parts of southeast Alaska having limited road systems, 
an important consideration will be whether wood fuel is to be transported by barge 
from outlying areas (vs. harvested adjacent to local roads). Already, a major wood 
products facility in southeast Alaska is producing firewood and has started delivery 
service to regional markets by barge.

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PNW-GTR-826
Challenges to increased wood energy use in Alaska include having relatively 
few wood products producers or harvesters capable of supplying firewood on a 
steady basis and in economic quantities. Once the extent of wood fuel markets is 
known, interested entrepreneurs can plan business startup activities for production 
and distribution of wood fuel as well as sales of wood-burning equipment.
Potential Wood Fuel Sources 
The following sections identify potential sources of wood fuel, and these could 
differ by region. For example, more sawmill residues could be available for wood 
energy in southeast Alaska, whereas in south-central and interior Alaska, other 
sources, such as hazardous fuel clearings, could be used. 
Sawmill Residues
There is limited information relative to the volume of lumber produced in Alaska 
outside the southeast region. Southeast Alaska is home to 12 active mills, 3 of 
which each produce in excess of 3 million board feet annually. Since 2002, actual 
lumber production in southeast Alaska has ranged between 31 and 34.6 million 
board feet per year (Brackley and Crone 2009, Brackley et al. 2006). About half of 
the stated log volume is processed into lumber, and the remaining volume includes 
slabs, edging, chips, sawdust, bark, and trim ends. Sawmill residuals are located at 
the mill site, in proximity to users, and available for use or conversion to various 
energy products.
Harvesting Residues
Saw logs are the only product harvested by most logging operations in Alaska. In 
all areas of Alaska, trees and portions of trees that are not suitable for saw logs can 
be recovered and processed into energy products. The potential sources of energy 
products include rough and rotten trees, tops, limbs, and stems from trees that are 
below the size required to produce saw logs. In all harvesting operations, a trans-
portation system has been established to move material from stump to market. A 
case-by-case analysis of the economics of producing energy products from existing 
harvest areas is beyond the scope of this paper. Obviously, harvesting areas that are 
near users have a higher potential than those in remote areas.
Thinnings From Forest Management Activities
Approximately 425,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska 
have been harvested since 1950 (Nowacki et al. 2001). Option 6 of the Tongass 
Land Management Plan (USDA FS 2008) identifies 225,000 acres available for 
5

future thinning. Thinnings have the potential to provide both high-value products 
such as house logs and biomass for home and district heating projects. Wildlife 
habitat enhancement on Prince of Wales Island includes a variety of silvicultural 
operations such as precommercial thinning, commercial thinning, pruning, gap cre-
ation, and tree planting (USDA FS 2007). During fiscal years 2004 through 2007, 
an average of 5,449 acres per year were precommercially thinned in the Tongass 
National Forest.
1 During fall 2007 in a managed watershed near Sitka (Starrigavan 
area), forest restoration activities treated 10 acres. This stand was about 35 years 
old and yielded close to 18 cords of firewood to 31 clients.
2 Although each client 
used only about half a cord of firewood, this could provide significant benefits to 
residents who use wood as a secondary heating source. 
DeMars (2000) found that precommercial thinning of spruce-hemlock ( Picea 
sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) stands in southeast 
Alaska were generally beneficial when managing for wood production, and that 
medium to heavy thinnings should be favored. Heavy thinning could reduce wood 
quality; however, wildlife habitat could be improved through additional understory 
vegetation. Other studies considered Sitka spruce and western hemlock manage-
ment on high-productivity and low-productivity sites in southeast Alaska (Barbour 
et al. 2005). By using the forest vegetation simulator (FVS), researchers found that 
precommercial thinnings could be used at stand age 20, and that stand spacing 
(ranging from 12.1 ft by 12.1 ft to 20 ft by 20 ft) had an important influence on 
merchantable timber volume. 
Hazardous Fuel Clearings
Some communities in Alaska are close to hazardous fuels that increase fire risk. 
For example, in the Fairbanks area, 250 acres has already been harvested in the 
Cash Creek drainage to reduce hazardous fuel loads. It is estimated that over 
100,000 green tons of biomass could become available for power generation in 
the Fairbanks area within the next 10 years (assuming harvests on 5,000 total 
acres of 20 green tons per acre) (Nicholls et al. 2006). More than 1,200 acres are 
listed within 13 hazardous fuel treatment units in the Fairbanks area (Hanson 
2007), potentially offering additional opportunities for biomass utilization. One 
of the potential problems with using hazardous fuel removals for bioenergy is the 
possibility of a sudden surge of biomass over a short timeframe as severe fire risks

are being mitigated, and conversely, potential shortfalls in biomass supply during 
years in which few acres burn.
Research Objectives 
This study evaluates wood energy use by residential consumers in Alaska (fig. 4). 
The scope of this project is to evaluate current consumer knowledge and attitudes in 
Alaska relative to wood energy use versus other heating fuels. A specific objective 
of this study is to characterize the current use of wood energy for residential heat-
ing in Alaska’s three most populated regions (southeast, south-central, and interior). 
The scope of this paper is to evaluate conditions related to future and expected 
conditions for residential wood energy use in Alaska. Specific objectives include:
•
 A
ssess heating oil prices needed to induce Alaska residents to convert to 
wood energy.
•
 E
valuate daily maintenance time that wood energy adopters would be  
willing to spend.
•
 E
valuate willingness to pay for new wood energy systems and for home 
energy efficiency measures.

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
Methods 
In this study, we evaluated consumer preferences for renewable energy by using 
survey methods. The survey was conducted at local businesses in five Alaska 
locations (tables 1 and 2). Venues included hardware stores and home improvement 
centers, grocery stores, a large “big-box” retail center, and a home and garden show. 
Most locations were sampled over several days (however, two of the locations in 
Fairbanks were sampled for only 1 day). All surveys were conducted in partnership 
with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF), Cooperative State Research, Edu-
cation, and Extension Service, Forest Products Program. Surveys were reviewed 
and approved for use by the UAF Institutional Review Board.

Response data were collected in Sitka (March–May 2008), in Juneau (May 
2008), and in Anchorage, Ketchikan, and Fairbanks (September 2008). Note that 
home heating oil prices in general experienced a significant increase during our 
sampling period (March to September 2008). Thus, survey results may have dif-
fered if a respondent had answered in September versus in March. The surveys 
considered preferences for renewable energy use, equipment, and energy products. 
A total of 758 usable responses were collected (from the 509 participants in south-
east, 149 in south-central, and 146 in interior Alaska). Screening questions were 
used so that a respondent who was under 18 years old, from a household that had 
already responded, or not a local resident, was omitted from the survey results.
8
GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PNW-GTR-826
Respondents were asked to consider only space heating applications for their 
home. Because several of the questions pertained to household energy use, we 
evaluated only one survey per household. Respondents who were landlords were 
asked to provide information based on all properties owned (e.g., total use of energy 
for home heating). Those who were renters were still permitted to complete sur-
veys, although people whose primary residence was a boat were not included. No 
information on household income was collected. Surveys were conducted at various 
times of the day and various days of the week (including weekdays and weekends). 
Prospective respondents were asked at random if they would be interested in 
completing a survey; however, there was no way to control who actually completed 
surveys (and so the survey was not random).
3 Thus, the survey was not representa-
tive of each region or location sampled. For example, the state’s largest population 
center, Anchorage, was sampled at only one location (a home show), whereas in 
southeast Alaska, samples were conducted at seven locations in three cities. Also, 
we conducted the survey in urban areas (the largest Alaskan cities), and there are 
likely differences in viewpoints between these residents and those living in rural 
towns and villages. 
Questions were broadly grouped into three themes, all relating to use of wood 
energy for home heating (complete survey is provided in the appendix):
•
 C
urrent conditions for household wood energy use
•
 K
nowledge and attitudes of residential energy consumers
•
 F
uture (expected) use of wood energy
Visual displays of firewood, pellets, and densified wood fuel were present 
while respondents completed their surveys. An incentive (small candy or key chain) 
was also offered to respondents who completed a survey.
Results 
This paper focuses on current conditions for residential heating with wood energy 
in Alaska, including primary and secondary home heating sources as well as 
fossil fuel type, price, and consumption. The data were evaluated based on geo-
graphic region (southeast, south-central, interior) and by gender (male vs. female 
respondents).
3 It was observed that people who seemed more interested in wood energy were more likely 
to take the time to complete a survey.

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
Primary Home Heating Source
This survey found that heating oil was the primary fuel for home heating in 
southeast and interior Alaska, whereas natural gas dominated in south-central 
Alaska (including Anchorage) (fig. 5). Heating sources were more diversified in 
southeast Alaska, where electricity and firewood also played important roles. Very 
few respondents (less than 1 percent of responses, statewide) indicated using wood 
pellets as a primary heating source (fig. 5). Firewood use (cords per year) was 
moderately higher in the interior region vs. other regions.

Secondary Home Heating Source
In general, secondary home heating represented a much more diverse energy mix 
(vs. primary heating) (table 3). Firewood heating played a much more important 
role, especially in south-central and interior Alaska, where it was the leading 
secondary home heating energy source. In most cases, electricity was preferred to 
heating oil for secondary heating, and this was especially true in southeast Alaska. 
Wood Heating Use and Equipment Purchases
Most respondents had considered wood as a home heating source, with the great-
est interest occurring in the interior region (for both male and female respondents) 
(table 4). Of those using wood fuel, firewood was preferred by a wide margin over 
wood pellets (table 5). Average firewood use was greatest in the interior region

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
(versus other regions) for both male and female respondents. Firewood use in south-
central Alaska was the lowest of any region, based on number of responses and also 
average cords per year.
Fewer respondents had actually purchased wood heating systems within the 
past 10 years (and again, the greatest interest in wood heating was by interior 
Alaska respondents). In the 2000 Census (U.S. Census Bureau 2000), it was 
estimated that wood was the primary fuel for home heating in about 4 percent of 
Alaska households (fig. 6). The Census does not collect any information about 
secondary sources of energy for home heating. Our survey data indicated a consid-
erably higher use of wood fuel (approxi-
mately 30 percent of total respondents). 
However, our survey included primary and 
secondary heating use, and did not cover 
all regions of Alaska (but rather focused 
on the largest cities in Alaska). Further-
more, the survey was not random in that 
people having a greater interest in wood 
may have been more likely to voluntarily 
complete a survey, and the survey was 
generally offered only for a short period at 
each sampling location. Lastly, the season 
could have influenced respondent attitudes 
and answers. For example, the Fairbanks 
survey was administered during late Sep-
tember (beginning of the winter heating 
season), whereas in Sitka, responses were 
collected in spring (end of heating season).

Fossil Fuel Type, Price, and Consumption
In our survey, fuel oil was the most widely used fossil fuel (table 6); however, most 
natural gas use occurred in the south-central region. Consumption of fossil fuel 
(among those who indicated some use of fossil fuels) was considerably greater in 
interior Alaska vs. southeast or south-central Alaska (table 7). Fuel oil prices were 
relatively uniform across the state (ranging from about $4.10 to $4.25 per gallon) 
(table 8). It should be noted that prices have fallen considerably since the data were 
collected (during spring, summer, and fall of 2008), and the time this report was 
prepared (December 2009).

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
Factors to Motivate Conversion to Wood Energy
Cost was the key factor influencing respondent’s motivation to convert to wood 
energy from some other fuel type (see fig. 7). Interior Alaska respondents were 
especially cost-conscious, whereas southeast Alaska respondents were less 
concerned about overall cost. In general, respondents were not concerned about 
a lack of local wood energy equipment vendors, and this was especially true in 
the interior region (Fairbanks). Of the three regions sampled, southeast Alaska 
respondents were the most concerned about finding local equipment vendors or 
local wood fuel suppliers.

Potential Barriers to Wood Energy Use
Here, respondents were provided with a list of potential barriers (i.e., negative attri-
butes) that could either prevent them from converting to future use of wood energy 
or might restrict their current use of wood energy. Note that within the “other” 
category, a number of positive comments were voluntarily offered (see fig. 8). The 
written comments by those who selected “other” included a variety of other barri-
ers, such as fire hazard, lack of storage room for wood fuel, high initial/conversion 
expenses, asthma, allergies, and environmental concerns. The fact that so many 
written comments were offered (197 total) suggests that wood energy is very much 
on people’s “radar.”

“Too much work” was the main barrier or objection to wood energy adoption. 
This was most often cited in south-central Alaska (close to 45 percent of responses), 
and less often cited in the interior (close to 22 percent of responses). “Expensive” 
was rarely listed as an objection, especially among interior respondents. Also infre-
quently listed as a barrier was “not widely available yet.” The interior appeared to 
have greatest overall availability of wood energy (i.e., least often cited “not widely 
available”).
Most wood energy barriers (including “smoky,” “expensive,” “availability,” and 
“too much work”) were generally greatest for south-central respondents; therefore, 
it is not surprising that overall wood energy use was lowest in this region. There 
was great variation between regions in the “other” response (fig. 8). Here, respon-
dents could write in any comment of their choice (either negative or positive).
Knowledge Regarding Residential Wood Burning
Most respondents were “somewhat” familiar with residential wood burning (fig. 9). 
South-central respondents had overall lower knowledge than those in southeast or 
interior Alaska, and southeast Alaska and interior Alaska respondents were fairly 
evenly matched across all knowledge levels. Once again, people more interested in 
wood energy may have been more likely to stop and complete a survey.

Knowledge Regarding Environmental Protection Agency  
Certified Woodstoves and Standards
Respondents were asked “How familiar are you with EPA certified woodstoves and/
or EPA standards for residential wood burning and air quality?” Most respondents 
were “not at all” familiar with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified 
woodstoves (ranging from about 40 to 70 percent by region) (fig. 10). However, in 
interior Alaska this was fairly even between “somewhat” and “not at all” categories. 
South-central respondents had overall lower knowledge than southeast or interior 
Alaska, whereas interior respondents had overall greatest knowledge of EPA-
certified woodstoves.
Environmental Protection Agency-certified woodstoves and other high-
efficiency wood burners could help improve air quality within areas that are 
“at-risk.” Juneau has experienced burn bans and other air quality issues in the 
Mendenhall Valley area. In Fairbanks, continued use of outdoor wood boilers 
could exacerbate winter air quality problems related to vehicle use. This could be 
significant given that Fairbanks is already an air quality nonattainment area for 
carbon monoxide (CO) and likely to be designated nonattainment for particulate 
matter (PM 2.5) as determined by the EPA (Alaska Division of Air Quality 2010).

Preferred Wood Fuel Types
Firewood/cordwood was by far the preferred wood fuel choice, accounting for 
between 50 and 70 percent for responses for all regions (fig. 11). The interior had 
the highest preference for firewood (over 70 percent of respondents). Briquettes 
were least preferred with fewer than 10 percent of responses in all three regions 
(and 0 percent in the interior). South-central Alaska had a higher percentage of 
respondents answering “don’t know” for preferred fuel type. The local wood fuel 
supply and availability could have influenced these responses (i.e., introduced a 
bias). 
Wood Fuel Knowledge
Most respondents had either somewhat or very little overall knowledge of wood 
pellets (fig. 12). South-central respondents had the least overall knowledge of the 
three regions, and southeast and interior respondents were very closely matched for 
all three knowledge levels. Relatively few respondents considered themselves to be 
“very knowledgeable” regarding wood pellets. Most respondents had very little or 
no knowledge regarding wood briquettes (fig. 13), with between 75 and 85 percent 
of respondents, by region. Less than 5 percent of respondents in any region consid-
ered themselves “very familiar.” Firewood was by far the type of wood fuel with

which respondents were most familiar (fig. 14). Overall, interior respondents had 
the greatest familiarity and south-central respondents the least familiarity. Similar 
to the results of “Preferred Wood Fuel Types,” the local availability of the differ-
ent types of wood fuel, as well as respondent experience with wood heating could 
have influenced these findings. 
Fuel Oil Price Needed to Convert to Wood Energy
Most respondents indicated a price range of $4.00 to $5.00 per gallon as the 
market price for fuel oil at which they would convert to wood energy. Our results 
suggest that there is an “elbow” between $3.50 and $4.00 per gallon (fig. 15). 
At $3.50 per gallon fuel oil, very few people (about 5 percent of respondents 
at each location) were willing to switch to wood energy. Overall, a surprising 
number of respondents indicated that they would not switch from fossil fuels to 
wood heating, regardless of price. This was especially true among south-central 
respondents, where about 34 percent of respondents fit this category. This could be 
in part due to the relatively small sample size in Anchorage (n = 41), and because 
most respondents used natural gas and therefore did not respond to this question. 
Interior respondents indicated a sharp increase in willingness to convert between 
$4.00 and $5.00 per gallon (fig. 15).

Figure 16—Maximum maintenance time willing to spend on wood energy system, by Alaska region.
Note that fuel oil prices rose sharply during the data collection period (from 
about March to September 2008), and that interior respondents were sampled 
during the later part of this period, when fuel oil prices were higher. It is also likely 
that there was some variation in fuel oil market prices between regions, and in our 
study we did not attempt to normalize prices across sampling locations. Thus, fuel 
oil at a stated price may have seemed expensive to respondents in some locations, 
but not in other locations. 
Maintenance Time Willing to Spend on Wood Energy System
Most respondents indicated a willingness to spend 15 to 30 minutes per day 
on maintenance for a residential wood energy system (fig. 16). Relatively few 
respondents indicated a willingness of 45 minutes per day or more maintenance 
time; however, the response rate was uniform between 45, 60, and more than 60 
minutes per day. South-central Alaska had the highest proportion of respondents 
indicating “0 minutes per day” (approximately 20 percent of all respondents), and 
this was more than double that of southeast or interior. It is interesting to note that 
“too much work” was widely cited as a barrier to potential use of wood energy,  
also part of this same survey. 
This question was presented hypothetically to respondents (i.e., they were  
asked “If you owned a wood energy system for home heating, how many minutes 
per day would you be willing to spend on maintenance?”). Therefore, the responses 
included prospective, as well as actual, wood energy users. Further, we defined

“maintenance” to include a wide range of activities related to wood energy use, 
including receiving fuelwood (but not cutting or splitting it), “stoking” the burner, 
ash removal, and routine maintenance. Because our definition of “maintenance” 
was so broad, this could have influenced the higher proportion of respondents in  
the 45 minutes and greater categories.
Willingness to Pay for a Wood Energy System
Responses covered a broad range of prices; however, most respondents indicated 
a willingness to pay between $1,000 and $3,000. This would be within the price 
range of many commercial firewood and pellet home heating systems. South-
central Alaska respondents had the greatest proportion of “$0” willingness to 
pay (about 22 percent of respondents) (fig. 17). For both southeast and interior 
Alaska, the highest response rate occurred for the $1,000 to $2,000 price range 
(with approximately 30 and 28 percent of respondents, respectively). A surpris-
ing number of respondents in the interior (approximately 14 percent) indicated a 
willingness to pay more than $5,000 for a new wood energy system. 
Note that respondents included those who already owned wood energy 
systems as well as those who did not, and no information was provided to respon-
dents about actual market prices for wood heating systems. Also, respondents’ 
willingness to pay could have been influenced by their choice of wood energy 
system (e.g., firewood vs. wood pellets).

GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PNW-GTR-826
Figure 18—Willingness to pay for home energy efficiency measures, by Alaska region.
Willingness to Pay for Home Energy Efficiency
Respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay annually for 
energy efficiency improvements to their home. Most responses ranged from $250 
to $1,000 per year (fig. 18). Interior respondents indicated a high willingness to 
pay, with steadily increasing response rates from $0 per year to more than $1,000 
per year. Indeed, the greatest response category was for interior residents at greater 
than $1,000 per year (almost 35 percent of respondents). About 60 percent of 
interior Alaska respondents indicated a willingness to pay $500 per year or greater. 
For southeast Alaska respondents, responses were fairly evenly distributed for all 
categories greater than $100 per year. Most south-central Alaska respondents indi-
cated a willingness to pay $500 per year or less (almost 70 percent of respondents). 
A limitation of this question was that it asked for annual expenses for home energy 
efficiency. Based on feedback for those completing surveys, a more appropriate 
indicator might have been expenses over a longer period (perhaps 5 or 10 years), to 
more closely match actual spending habits for energy efficiency improvements.

Wood Energy for Residential Heating in Alaska: Current Conditions, Attitudes, and Expected Use
Conclusions
Current Conditions and Fuel Consumption
Current residential heating needs were met primarily by heating oil in southeast  
and interior Alaska, and by natural gas in south-central Alaska. Firewood was 
generally more important as a secondary fuel source (versus primary fuel source)  
in all regions of Alaska. Further, firewood was favored by a wide margin among 
wood fuel users in Alaska, with almost no current use of wood pellets, briquettes, 
or other densified fuel. This could be due to a lack of local sources for pellets, 
briquettes, or other densified fuel. 
These results indicate that most Alaska households sampled have at least 
considered wood energy for home heating, and that the greatest near-term 
opportunity is for increased use of firewood. However, production of wood pellets 
and other densified fuels has been considered in Alaska, and the state’s first major 
pellet facility is planned for operation in late 2009 (Mowry 2009). Separately, 
a pellet-making facility in Delta Junction, Alaska, has been in development for 
several years. Households that have multiple-fuel heating systems can increase 
their use of wood incrementally, as greater supplies become available. Although air 
quality issues were not considered in this paper, increased use of wood energy is 
likely to have some impact on emissions. This is an important concern in Alaska 
cities like Fairbanks and Juneau, where air quality can be a problem during winter 
months. Lastly, fuel oil price fluctuations could have an important influence on 
wood energy use and equipment purchasing decisions. Prices are currently well 
below recent highs, and it remains to be seen what impact this may have on wood 
energy use. 
Knowledge and Attitudes
We found numerous regional variations in expected wood energy use between 
southeast, south-central, and interior Alaska. Cost was the most important factor 
influencing motivation to convert to wood energy. Of the three regions sampled, 
southeast Alaska respondents were the most concerned about finding local equip-
ment vendors or local wood fuel suppliers. “Too much work” was the main barrier 
or objection to wood energy use for residential heating. Most respondents were at 
least somewhat familiar with residential wood burning, although Anchorage area 
respondents had overall lower knowledge than those in southeast or interior Alaska. 
Most respondents had very little familiarity with EPA-certified woodstoves. 
Firewood/cordwood was by far the preferred wood fuel choice, whereas compressed 
wood briquettes were least preferred. Similarly, knowledge of firewood was the 
highest of any fuel type. 
24
GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PNW-GTR-826
These findings are significant because of the importance of consumer attitudes 
in influencing wood energy use and equipment purchasing decisions. As potential 
consumers become more knowledgeable about wood energy or adopt a favorable 
viewpoint, they will become more likely to use wood fuel. Outreach and educa-
tion programs through schools, universities, and government agencies can have a 
beneficial effect in knowledge transfer and diffusion. Although these findings are 
important, they do not represent a random sampling of residents at the survey loca-
tions, and should not be used for marketing or product development decisions. The 
findings indicate the need for more detailed research on wood fuel use in Alaska, 
especially in regions of the state that were not sampled in this study. 
Future Use and Conditions
We found numerous regional variations in expected wood energy use among 
southeast, south-central, and interior Alaska. This could be attributed to factors 
such as climate, familiarity with wood for home heating, and underlying 
preferences for nonwood fuel sources. We found that a fuel oil price of $4.00 to 
$5.00 per gallon should be sufficient to induce most homeowners to convert to 
wood heating. Although this fuel price (or higher) was prevalent in many parts 
of Alaska in summer 2008, recent dramatic price declines could already have an 
effect on consumer interest in wood energy. Most consumers were willing to pay 
from between $1,000 to $3,000 for new wood energy systems. However, the recent 
economic downtown (late 2008 and early 2009) could already have an influence 
on consumer spending decisions, their willingness to pay, and ability to borrow 
money. When considering expenses for home energy efficiency, most respondents 
were willing to pay between $250 and $1,000 per year, with interior residents 
at the higher end of this range. Fairbanks area residents also exhibited a greater 
willingness to pay for wood energy systems. Although household income was not 
evaluated in this study, it is an important consideration and could be incorporated 
into future research. This study identifies significant regional differences in the 
way Alaskans perceive wood energy, their potential use of wood for residential 
heating, and their willingness to pay for wood energy versus other sources.
