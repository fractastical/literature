Abstract 1 
PRX-3140 is a partial agonist to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4) and a ligand for the 2 
sigma-1 (S1R) and sigma -2 (S2R) receptors. Although few publications have inferred S1R 3 
agonists/antagonists modulate blood glucose, Di et.al (2017) reported S1R deficiency in knockout 4 
mice impacted regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis , with a 5 
dexamethasone-induced reduction in level of corticosterone markedly attenuated in S1R −/− 6 
knockout mice, implicating S1R in feedback response to the HPA axis. The hypothesis that S1R 7 
deficiency causes down -regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and attenuates GR -8 
mediated feedback inhibition of HPA axis, as well as stress response of HPA axis, suggest that the 9 
inverse, the activation of S1R under normal conditions, may modulate glucocorticoid insulin 10 
suppression (as a direct S1R-GR effect) as well as cortisol levels ( producing HPA axis feedback 11 
inhibition). In the present study, coadministration of 10 µM PRX -3140 with 100 nM cortisol  12 
significantly increased  insulin release ( to 74.8 ng/ml, P -value <0.0001). Similar effects were 13 
observed when cells were exposed to dexamethasone  (Dex), with 10 µM PRX -3140 and 10 nM 14 
Dex producing 1.87-fold significantly more insulin than 10 nM Dex alone.  Daily glucose 15 
concentrations in the 14-day clinical study (NCT00384423) of PRX-3140 demonstrate a reduction 16 
for 10 mg once-daily at days 1, 7, 10, and 15. Urine free cortisol levels at 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg 17 
dose levels of PRX-3140 demonstrated a larger reduction at 7 and 14 days compared to placebo. 18 
As an agonist of S1R that acts as a chaperone of GR, PRX-3140 has demonstrated GR modulating 19 
effects in INS-1 cells and in 14 -day clinical studies in healthy adults with low incidence of side 20 
effects.  The results of the present study suggest that S1R activation, with PRX-3140 and NP-18-21 
2 S1R agonists, modulates glucocorticoid insulin suppression and cortisol levels. 22

1 Introduction 27 
PRX-3140 is a partial agonist to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4) and a ligand for the 28 
sigma-1 (S1R) and sigma-2 (S2R) receptors that has shown promise in preclinical and clinical 29 
studies for its potential therapeutic effects in cognitive disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. 30 
[Johnson-2012]. By modulating S1R activity, PRX -3140 may enhance neuroprotective 31 
mechanisms, improve synaptic function, and promote neuronal health, thereby addressing 32 
neurodegenerative conditions associated with cognitive deficits [Nguyen-2017]. Studies have 33 
indicated that S1R agonists can positively influence neurotransmitter systems, including 34 
acetylcholine (ACh), which is crucial for memory and learning [van Waarde-2011]. In male Long-35 
Evans rats, PRX -3140 intraperitoneal (IP) injection increased ACh output in the hippocampal 36 
formation under “resting” and behavioral testing conditions [Johnson-2012].  Furthermore, early 37 
clinical trials have suggested that PRX -3140 is well -tolerated and may lead to improvements in 38 
cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Continued research into 39 
PRX-3140 could provide insights into its efficacy and safety, as well as its broader implications 40 
for treating cognitive impairments. 41 
Three Phase 1 and two Phase 2 trials in 248 subjects have been conducted with PRX-3140 dosed 42 
orally at 5 to 250 mg daily up to two years. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, 43 
and occurred  primarily in the higher dose groups, including dizziness , postural dizziness, 44 
headache, abnormal dreams, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, and somnolence. 45 
Whereas earlier 5 -HT4 agonists (e.g., cisapride and tegaserod) have been associated with 46 
cardiovascular adverse events, including hERG (cardiac potassium) channel effects (QT 47 
prolongation), no cardiovascular safety concerns were reported for PRX-3140. In dose escalation 48 
studies, improvement in cognitive scores in subjects with mild Alzheimer’s Disease were observed 49 
from 5 to 50 mg delivered orally once a day.  In a two-week clinical study (NCT00384423), clinical 50 
laboratory measurements demonstrated modulation of glucose levels and cortisol at low doses of 51 
PRX-3140.  However, post-hoc analysis was not performed to address this effect. 52 
Drugs with S1R activity, such as haloperidol [Walter-2006], dextromethorphan [Marquard-2014], 53 
and pentazocine [Kavitha-1999] have been shown to have effects on glucose levels. Only a few 54 
publications have inferred that S1R agonists/antagonists modulate blood glucose levels [Paniagua-55 
2016].  In 2017, Di et.al reported S1R deficiency in knockout mice impacted regulation of the 56 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis such that acute mild restraint stress (AMRS) 57 
induced a higher and more sustainable increase in activity of HPA axis  [Di-2017]. In another 58 
experiment, Dexamethasone (Dex) -induced reduction in corticosterone levels was markedly 59 
attenuated in S1R −/− knockout mice , implicating S1R in glucocorticoid mediated feedback 60 
inhibition of  the HPA axis. The hypothesis that S1R deficiency causes down -regulation of the 61 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and attenuates GR-mediated feedback inhibition of HPA axis, as well 62 
as stress response of HPA axis, suggest that the inverse, activation of S1R under normal conditions, 63 
may modulate glucocorticoid mediated insulin suppression (direct S1R-GR effect) as well as 64 
cortisol levels (HPA axis feedback inhibition) . The present s tudy investigated the relationship 65 
between PRX -3140 and other S1R agonist s to glucocorticoid insulin suppression and cortisol 66

levels to obtain a better understanding of these direct and indirect mechanisms compared to 5-HT4 67 
activity. 68 
2 Materials and Methods 69 
2.1 Chemicals 70 
S1R ligands 6,7-Dihydro-4-hydroxy-7-isopropyl-6-oxo-N-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl)thieno[2,3-71 
b]pyridine-5-carboxamide potassium salt (PRX-3140), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonyl 72 
aminobutyl)-piperazin-1-yl]phenyl} acetamide hydrochloride (NP-2), and 5-((4-(6-73 
chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamino)piperidine-1-yl)methyl)-2-fluorobenzonitrile 74 
monofumarate (NP-3) were all synthesized in -house (Alchem Laboratories Corp.) .  All other 75 
reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. 76 
2.2 Receptor Binding Assays 77 
In vitro  radioligand competition receptor binding assays were performed to evaluate the 78 
pharmacologic profile s of PRX -3140, NP -2 and NP -3, including the S1R, S2R , a panel of 79 
serotonin receptor subtype assays  (5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5 -HT4) and other off -target receptor 80 
subtypes. Standard receptor binding methods were employed and the majority of assays were 81 
performed using a human recombinant receptor. Where a human assay system was unavailable, 82 
receptor binding was performed in tissue from mouse, rat, guinea pig, chicken, or bovine source. 83 
Human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells and guinea pig cerebral cortex were used to prepare S1R in 84 
HEPES/Tris buffer pH 7.4. PRX-3140 was incubated with 2 and 15 nM [3H] Pentazocine for 120-85 
150 minutes. Non-specific binding is estimated in the presence of 10 µM Haloperidol. Membranes 86 
were filtered and washed, and the filters then counted in a beta scintillation counter to quantify 87 
total binding of [3H] Pentazocine, with specific binding then calculated by subtracting non-specific 88 
binding. Inhibition constants (Ki) values were calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff 89 
[Cheng-1973] using the observed IC50 of the tested compound, the concentration of radioligand, 90 
and the historical values for the KD of the ligand (obtained experimentally at Eurofins Panlabs, 91 
Inc.) ± the standard error of the mean (SEM). 92 
2.3 Acute Brain Slice Preparation and Electrophysiology Studies  93 
All procedures performed on live animals as described below were reviewed and approved by the 94 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida.  Animals were deeply 95 
anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (0.1 ml of 10% ketamine and 0.05 ml of 2% 96 
xylazine). Brains were quickly extracted and submerged into ice -cold sucrose -laden normal 97 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 206 mM sucrose, 10 mM d -glucose, 1 mM MgSO 4, 2 mM 98 
KCl, 1.25 mM NaH 2PO4, 1 mM CaCl 2, and 25 mM NaHCO 3). A VT1000s vibratome (Leica 99 
Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) was used to make 300 μm coronal sections that included the 100 
nucleus accumbens (NAc). Sections were maintained at 37 ºC in normal ACSF (126 mM NaCl, 11 101 
mM d -glucose, 1.5 mM MgSO 4, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2PO4, 2.4 mM CaCl 2, and 25mM 102 
NaHCO3) and subsequently equilibrated to room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes prior 103 
to experimental use. Importantly, normal ACSF was used for incubation rather than a low -Ca2+ 104

ACSF (1 mM CaCl 2) as NAc MSNs  (medium spiny neurons)  do not regain normal AP firing 105 
function following prolonged submersion in the latter [Scala et al., 2018; Tapia et al., 2020 ]. All 106 
external solutions were saturated with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 and had a pH of 7.3. 107 
Brain slices used in whole -cell patch clamp electrophysiology studies were transferred to a 108 
recording chamber continuously perfused at 2 mL/min with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 28ºC. 109 
Picrotoxin (PTX, 100 μM), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNWX, 20 μM), and (2R)-amino-110 
5-phosphonovaleric acid  (AP5, 40 μM) were added to ACSF  to block fast synaptic currents  111 
mediated by GABAA receptors, AMPA/kainate receptors, and NMDA receptors, respectively. An 112 
Olympus BX51WI stereomicroscope supporting infrared differential interference contrast 113 
microscopy (IR-DIC) was used to visualize cells.  114 
Patch pipettes (borosilicate glass capillaries 1.5 mm/0.8 mm, Sutter Instrument Company) were 115 
made using a Flaming/Brown-type pipette puller (Sutter Instrument, P -07), and had an with an 116 
open tip resistance of 4-6 MΩ when filled with a K-gluconate based internal solution that contained 117 
in mM: 2 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 115 K-gluconate, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 Na 2-ATP, 0.4 118 
Na3-GTP, and 5  KCl adjusted . This solution was adjusted to  pH 7.25 using KOH and volume 119 
adjusted to 295 mOsm. Whole -cell recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, 120 
Digidata 1440A digitizer, and Clampex 10.7 software (Molecular Devices). All whole -cell data 121 
were sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Cells were identified as NAc MSNs based 122 
on location (proximity to the corpus collosum) and resting membrane potential (≤ -70 mV) 123 
[Belleau and Warren, 2000; Cao et al., 2016; Willett et al., 2018; Aceto et al., 2022]. 124 
Analysis of electrophysiological recordings was performed with custom software written using 125 
Python 3.10 and the pyABF package [Harden, 2022 ] and in OriginC (OriginLab Corporation, 126 
Northampton, MA). Data presented were not corrected for the liquid junction potential. Cells were 127 
excluded from analysis that had a resting membrane potential > -70 mV , that did not survive 128 
through experiment completion, or that experienced a sudden change in seal quality during 129 
recording. 130 
Frequency of evoked action potentials (APs) was recorded from NAc MSNs in current -clamp 131 
configuration. Evoked APs were measured during a 4 second current injection starting from -100 132 
pA with a 20 pA increase per sweep, every 10 seconds. The resting membrane potential (RMP) 133 
was measured at the beginning of each sweep as the average voltage observed over a 3 -second 134 
period with I = 0, when cells were quiescent. 135 
2.4 INS-1 832/13 Rat Insulinoma Cell Line 136 
The INS-1 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA) and 137 
cultured according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, cells were thawed and expanded in 138 
RPMI-1640 supplemented with L-Glutamine and 25mM HEPES (Corning, Manassas, V A), 1 mM 139 
sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 0.05 mM -mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco, Grand 140 
Island, NY), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), and 10% EmbryoMax® ES Cell 141 
Qualified FBS at 37°C, 5% CO 2, 95% humidity. After 2 days in culture, medium is exchanged 142 
with fresh medium containing G-418 (Gibco, Grand Island, New York) at 0.3 mg/ml for selective 143 
pressure. When the cells were confluent, cells were subcultured with a 1 to 6 split. For 144

subculturing, cells are detached using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Passages 145 
13 through 27 were used for the insulin release assays. 146 
2.5 Insulin Secretion Assays 147 
The insulin secretion assay was based on the Millipore manufacturer insert for the INS -1 832/13 148 
cells as well as the original published paper [Hohmeier, et al, 2000]. Briefly, t he INS-1 832/13 149 
cells were seeded in Costar 24-well TC plates (Corning, NY) at a cell density of 5X10 5 cells per 150 
well using the expansion media without G418. Cultures were then i ncubated for 48 hours 37°C, 151 
5% CO2, 95% humidity to confluency. The media was then replaced with fresh media containing 152 
test compounds. The control wells were 2.5 mM glucose and 16.7 mM glucose with 0.1% DMSO. 153 
Plates were incubated for 18 hours (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity), then wells were washed with 154 
HBSS twice (114 mmol/L NaCl, 4.7 mmol/L KCl, 1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4,1.16 mmol/L MgSO4, 20 155 
mmol/L HEPES, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 25.5 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 156 
7.2). Next HBSS containing 2.5  mM glucose was added and  incubated 1 hour (37°C, 5% CO 2, 157 
95% humidity). Cells were then washed twice with HBSS and followed by addition of HBSS with 158 
2.5 mM or 16.7  mM glucose, as well as test compounds diluted in 16.7  mM glucose. Note that 159 
DMSO was supplemented in the control wells to maintain a consistent  DMSO concentration  160 
(0.1%) in all wells. After a f inal i ncubation for  2 hour s (37°C, 5% CO 2, 95% humidity) , the 161 
supernatant was removed to measure the concentration of insulin using the ALPCO Insulin Rodent 162 
(Mouse/Rat) Chemiluminescence ELISA (ALPCO, Salem NH). 163 
2.6 Insulin ELISA Assay 164 
Insulin secretion was evaluated by using the ALPCO Insulin Rodent (Mouse/Rat) 165 
Chemiluminescence ELISA (ALPCO, Salem NH). Briefly, 75 µl of working strength conjugate 166 
was dispensed to each well pre -coated with a monoclonal antibody specific to insulin. Next, 5 μl 167 
of the standards or test samples were dispensed in duplicate. The plate was sealed and incubated 168 
at room temperature for 2 hours at 700 rpm on a microplate shaker. After the incubation, the content 169 
of the wells was decanted and washed 6 times with 350 µl of working strength wash buffer. After 170 
each wash, the plate was firmly tapped on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid. After the last 171 
wash, 100 µl of working chemiluminescent substrate was dispensed into each well and incubated 172 
5 minutes at room temperature. Then, 80  µl were transferred to a pureGrade ™ S white plate 173 
(Brandtech Scientific, Dawsonville, GA). The plate is immediately read on the PerkinElmer 174 
Envision multi-mode plate reader in ultra-sensitive luminescent mode.   175 
2.7 ATPLite Cytotoxicity Assay 176 
Test compounds were diluted in DMSO. Ten nanoliters of each compound or combination of 177 
compounds were dispensed to the 6 designated test wells of a Corning 1536 well TC white plate 178 
(Corning, Kennebunk, ME) using a Labcyte/Beckman Coulter Echo 555 acoustic dispenser. For a 179 
positive control for 100% cell death, 10 nl of 10 mM MG-132 was dispensed to the positive control 180 
wells of the assay plate (final assay concentration 25  µM) and for the negative controls (no cell 181 
death), 10 nl of DMSO was dispensed to negative control wells of the assay plate.  Next, the cells 182 
were detached from the flask, centrifuged, counted on a Cytometer T4 (Nexcelom Biosciences, 183 
Lawrence, MA) and resuspended in growth medium at a density of 400 cells per 4  µl. Then the 184

cells were dispensed to the assay plate using the Thermo-Scientific™ Multidrop™ Combi Reagent 185 
Dispenser (4 µl of cells in each well). The plate was centrifuged at 800rpm for 15 seconds and the 186 
clear lid was replaced with a Kalypsys lid (Kalypsys, Inc. San Diego, CA) to reduce edge effects 187 
and allow the even distribution of CO 2 to all wells of the plate. The plate was incubated for 48 188 
hours at 37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity. After the incubation, 4 µl of ATPlite 1step reagent (Revvity, 189 
Waltham, MA) was dispensed into the wells using a Beckman Coulter BioRAPTR FRD. The assay 190 
plate was centrifuged at 1000rpm for 1 minute and incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room 191 
temperature. The signal was then read on a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-mode plate reader in ultra-192 
sensitive luminescence mode. 193 
2.8 Clinical Studies  194 
Data from a 14-day clinical study (NCT00384423) with PRX-3140 were analyzed (Quintiles. Inc. 195 
CRO). Each study protocol was approved by their respective investigational review board or 196 
human subjects committee. Healthy volunteers were initially enrolled with six subjects completing 197 
all treatments. Serum concentrations of PRX -3140 were determined using a validated liquid 198 
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. Serum 199 
concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin ® 200 
Professional. The first cohort to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PRX -201 
3140 was conducted in 32 healthy adult male and female volunteers from 18 to 45 years of age .  202 
Each subject was administered an oral dose (capsules) of PRX-3140 or placebo once daily for 14 203 
days. Eight (8) subjects were randomly assigned to each of 4 sequential dosing cohorts and 204 
received either 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of PRX -3140 or matched placebo. If a dose 205 
regimen was found to be safe and well tolerated, then the succeeding group of 8 different subjects 206 
received the next higher dose of PRX-3140 (N = 6) or placebo (N = 2) for 14 days. Dose escalation 207 
was dependent on safety parameters (physical examination findings, vital signs, adverse events 208 
(AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory values including glucose and cortisol). 209 
Urine free cortisol was measured by LC -MS/MS from the first morning void urine samples 210 
collected at baseline (predose on Day 1) and predose on Days 7 and 14. Continuous glucose 211 
monitoring (CGM) was applied in a single patient with placebo compared to 10 mg PRX -3140.  212 
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) sampling was performed. Subjects 213 
were monitored closely throughout the study.  214 
2.9 Statistical Analysis 215 
Within groups, a paired Student’s t -test was used to evaluate the effect relative to the baseline 216 
mean. Across groups, an unpaired Student’s t -test was used to compare data at matching time 217 
points. Differences were considered significant where p ≤ 0.05.  218 
For patch clamp studies, data are reported as mean ± SEM . Comparisons between groups were 219 
made with a one -way ANOV A in OriginPro (Originlab, Northampton, MA) using Sidak-Holm 220 
post-hoc tests when indicated.   221 
INS-1 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line insulin release data analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 222 
Box and Whiskers plots graphed using the Tukey Boxplots analysis. The software calculates the 223 
IQR which is the inter-quartile distance (the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile). Then 224

adds the 75th percentile to 1.5 times the IQR. If this value is greater or equal to the largest value 225 
in the data set, an upper whisker is drawn at the largest value. If this value is less than the largest 226 
value, the upper whisker is set at the largest value less than the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times IQR. 227 
Any values that are greater than this value are plotted as individual points and are considered 228 
outliers for our study. For the lower whisker, the software calculates the 25th percentile minus 1.5 229 
times IQR. If this value is less than the smallest data value, the whisker is drawn at to the smallest 230 
data point. If the value is greater than the smallest data point, the whisker is set at the lowest value 231 
greater than the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times IQR. Any values that are less than this value are 232 
drawn as individual points (again, these are considered outliers for our study). The GraphPad Prism 233 
software also was used to determine P values for the Student’s T-tests. The percent cell death in 234 
the cytotoxicity assays was determined using GeneData software (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland) 235 
which normalizes the data in reference to the control values. 236 
Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on patients who received active study treatment. AUC24 237 
and Cmax values reported as geometric mean (CV%). T1/2, glucose concentrations and urine free 238 
cortisol are expressed as arithmetic mean (SD).  239 
3 Results 240 
3.1  5-HT and S1R Receptor Binding  241 
PRX-3140 was evaluated in a panel of serotonin receptor subtype assays to establish the selectivity 242 
for 5-HT4 binding sites. PRX-3140 shows high affinity (Ki = 22nM) and selectivity for 5-HT4R 243 
with more than 100 -fold difference in affinities compared with all other  5-HT receptors tested. 244 
PRX-3140 also has good affinity for the S1R (Ki = 79 -160nM) and S2R (Ki = 40 -100nM) in 245 
receptor binding assays.  The binding data for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT4, S1R, S2R activity is 246 
listed in Table 1.  247 
NP-18-2 is a selective full agonist to the 5 -HT1A and a ligand for the S1R. NP-18-2 is a high  248 
affinity (Ki = 5.1 -17 nM) 5 -HT1A agonist in radioligand binding assays. NP -18-2 also 249 
demonstrates affinity for the S1R (Ki = 100 nM) in radioligand binding assays (Table 1). 250 
NP-18-3 is a selective full antagonist to the 5-HT2B receptor and a ligand for the S1R. NP-18-3 is 251 
a highly selective for 5-HT2B (Ki=3.4 nM) with more than 500-fold differences in affinity for 5-252 
HT2BR compared with all other 5-HT receptor subtypes tested except for the 5-HT1A receptor (5-253 
HT1A, Ki = 100nM). NP-18-2 also demonstrates binding to the S2R (Ki = 42 nM) and S1R (Ki = 254 
100 nM) in radioligand binding assays. NP-18-3 affinities for receptors are listed in Table 1.  255 
3.2  PRX-3140 Reduces Excitability of Medium Spiny Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens 256 
In order to determine whether PRX-3140 directly interacts with S1R in vivo, we evaluated its 257 
ability to impact the intrinsic excitability of medium spiny neurons  (MSNs) in the NAc. 258 
Specifically, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from visually identified MSNs  in 259 
acute tissue slices through the NAc (see methods). MSNs were injected with a series of current 260 
pulses ranging from -120 to 800 pA, and action potential frequency in response to each stimulus 261 
was measured in current clamp. Our results revealed a concentration-dependent decrease in 262

maximum action potential frequency observed in response to current injection (Figure 1, one-way 263 
ANOV A, F4, 24 = 17.6, p < 0.0001). Additional post-hoc tests revealed a significant effect of PRX-264 
2140 vs. control at 10 µM and 100 µM (p<0.0001 in both cases), but not  at 500 nM or 1 µM.  265 
Overall, these effects of PRX -3140 are consistent with the reported results  of other known S1R 266 
interacting compounds as described in greater detail in [Alleyne-2023].  267 
3.3  Insulin Release Modulation by 5-HT/S1R Agonists in INS-1 832/13 Rat Insulinoma Cells 268 
To examine the effect of PRX -3140 on insulin production in INS -1 832/13 cells, the cells were 269 
exposed for 18 hours to varying concentrations of PRX-3140 and then starved for 1 hour with low 270 
glucose (2.5  mM glucose). The test compound/compounds were then added back to the cells 271 
diluted in 16.7 mM glucose. The addition of 16.7 mM glucose with 10 µM PRX-3140 or 10 nM 272 
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) showed a slight increase of insulin release in these cells (138.2 273 
and 138.0 ng/ml, respectively compared to 113.8 ng/ml for 16.7 mM glucose with no compound) 274 
but the difference was not significant (Figure 2). In our studies, 10  µM dehydroepiandrosterone 275 
sulfate (DHEA -S) slightly decreased  the insulin release (107.8  ng/ml compared to 112  ng/ml 276 
glucose alone).  277 
To examine the effect of endogenous glucocorticoids on insulin production in INS-1 832/13 cells, 278 
the cells were exposed to cortisol and corticosterone at physiologically relevant concentrations for 279 
18 hours, washed with HBSS twice, starved for 1 hour with low glucose (2.5  mM glucose) and 280 
then exposed to the glucocorticoids diluted in 16.7 mM glucose for 2 hours triggering the insulin 281 
release. The amount of insulin release was then determined using the insulin ELISA assay (Figure 282 
3). In these studies , 100 nM cortisol diluted in 16.7  mM glucose significantly reduced insulin 283 
release (median value 48.8 ng/ml) compared to 16.7 mM glucose alone (median value 117.3 ng/ml; 284 
p<0.0001; Student’s T-test). As expected, 500 nM cortisol had more of an effect on insulin release 285 
with a median value of 37 ng/ml. Corticosterone (100 nM in 16.7 mM glucose) also significantly 286 
decreased the insulin release giving a median value 78.2 ng/ml (P value = 0.0011). If 10 µM PRX-287 
3140 was co-administered with the 100 nM cortisol, the insulin release was significantly increased 288 
(median value of 74.8 ng/ml, P<0.0001). If 1  µM DHEA-S was co -administered with 100  nM 289 
cortisol, there was no difference between this combination compared to 100 nM cortisol alone. If 290 
a combination of 100  nM cortisol plus 10 nM DHEA was added to the cells, the insulin release 291 
dropped to 37.0 ng/ml which is significantly different from 100  nM cortisol alone (P value = 292 
0.0015). The combination of 500 nM Cortisol plus 10 nM DHEA had a median value of 33.2 ng/ml 293 
which is statistically the same as 500 nM cortisol (30.4 ng/ml).  294 
To examine the effect of a highly potent glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex) was tested in INS-295 
1 832/13 cells. As described previously, chronic exposure to the compound/compounds for 18 296 
hours was followed by starvation with 2.5  mM glucose and stimulation with 16.7  mM glucose 297 
with and without compounds. Then, insulin released was measured in the insulin ELISA. The 298 
results are shown in Figure 4. The amount of insulin produced with 10  nM Dex in the wells was 299 
52.5 ng/ml while 100  nM Dex yielded 38.6  ng/ml of insulin. If 10 µM PRX -3140 was included 300 
with the 10  nM Dex, significantly more insulin was produced (98.3 ng/ml, P value = 0.0124). 301 
When 10 µM PRX -3140 was combined with 100  nM Dex, the amount of insulin produced was 302 
62.6 ng/ml which was greater than the amount with 100  nM Dex alone but it was not considered 303

significant when the T -test analysis was performed. NP-18-2 released 138.15 ng/ml which was 304 
almost identical to PRX-3140 (138.20 ng/ml). However, when combined with 10 nM Dex, NP-18-305 
2 did not recover the insulin release to the extent that PRX -3140 did (76.4 ng/ml vs 98.3 ng/ml, 306 
respectively). When NP-18-3 was dispensed to the cells, the median insulin production was 126.7 307 
ng/ml. In combination with 10 nM Dex, NP-18-3 yielded only 40.7 ng/ml which was less than 10 308 
nM Dex alone (52.4 ng/ml). However, the difference here was not significant.  Cytotoxicity at 48 309 
hours in INS -1 832/13 rat insulinoma cells was dose dependent based on steroid concentration 310 
similar to published studies [Suksri -2022].  All S1R agonists alone were not cytotoxic  (data not 311 
shown).   312 
3.4  PRX-3140 Modulates Glucocorticoid Insulin Suppression and Cortisol Levels 313 
Serum concentrations of PRX-3140 were detectable after administration of a single 5 mg dose and 314 
all other doses tested up to 16 hours and, in general, the mean serum concentrations of PRX-3140 315 
increased with ascending single doses of 5 to 250 mg. The PK data suggested that PRX-3140 was 316 
absorbed at a relatively rapid rate (Tmax 1 to 2 hours) and the exposure showed moderate to high 317 
intersubject variability  median values across this dose range studied but were generally dose -318 
proportional. The Cmax values at the doses of 30 to 200 mg were less variable than those at the 319 
lower doses studied (5 and 10 mg). The mean half-life (T1/2) at doses of 50 to 250 mg was 8 to 14 320 
hours, respectively, suggesting the feasibility of once daily dosing. The Cmax values at the doses 321 
of 25 to 250 mg (CVs 34-43%) were less variable than those at the lower doses studied. Following 322 
multiple oral dose administration of 10, 30, 100, or 200 mg PRX-3140 for 14 days, mean exposures 323 
(Cmax and AUC24) of PRX -3140 appeared to increase in a dose proportional manner. Dose -324 
related increases in the mean trough serum concentration increases were evident throughout the 325 
treatment period and appeared to reach steady state by approximately Day 7 for the 10, 30, and 326 
100 mg cohorts and Day 14 for the 200 mg PRX-3140 cohort. Non-compartmental PK parameters 327 
are presented in Table 2. 328 
Daily glucose concentrations in the 14 -day study at 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg dose levels of PRX -329 
3140 demonstrate a reduction for 10 mg once-daily at days 1, 7, 10, and 15 (Figure 5). Because of 330 
the small patient number (n= 6 for PRX-3140 groups) and interpatient variability, t his reduction 331 
was not statistically significant  (Table 3.)  Average daily glucose concentrations for placebo vs. 332 
10mg PRX -3140 using CGM were 125 and 108 mg/dL, respectively, demonstrating a 15.6% 333 
reduction (data not shown).  Out -of-range % > 140 mg/dL showed a reduction for 10mg PRX -334 
3140 compared to placebo (4.1% vs.  17%, respectively), demonstrating an improvement in 335 
glycemic control. 336 
Urine free cortisol levels in the 14-day study at 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg dose levels of PRX-3140 337 
compared to placebo demonstrate a reduction at 7 and 14 days compared to initial Day 1 (Figure 338 
6).  In particular, 10 mg PRX-3140 demonstrated a reduction from -450 vs. 159 nmol/L at Day 7 339 
and -288 vs. -57 nmol/L at Day 14 for 10mg PRX -3140 vs. placebo , respectively  (Table 3). 340 
Because of the small patient number (n=8) and interpatient variability, the reduction for placebo 341 
vs. 10 mg PRX -3140 at Days 7 and 14 were not statistically significant (p=0.15 and 0.27, 342 
respectively). 100 mg PRX -3140 demonstrated a higher reduction from -674 vs. 159 nmol/L at 343 
Day 7 and -318 vs. -57 nmol/L at Day 14 for 100 mg PRX -3140 vs. placebo, respectively, but 344

baseline urine free cortisol at Day 1 was higher for 100 mg PRX -3140. 200 mg PRX -3140 345 
demonstrated a reduction from -298 vs. 159 nmol/L at Day 7 and -346 vs. -57 nmol/L at Day 14 346 
for 200 mg PRX -3140 vs. placebo, respectively, but accompanied a higher incidence of side 347 
effects. The trend for all mean PRX-3140 doses demonstrated lower cortisol levels at Day 7 and 348 
14 compared to placebo. 349 
4 Discussion 350 
Direct acting medications that lower cortisol levels include ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, 351 
mifepristone, osilodrostat, and pasireotide, blocking the production or binding to the GR.  All of 352 
these drugs have notable side effects, including adrenal insufficiency, headache, vomiting, nausea, 353 
fatigue, and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention), and with mifepristone abortion.  As an 354 
agonist of S1R that acts as a chaperone of GR, PRX-3140 has demonstrated GR modulating effects 355 
in INS-1 cells and in 14-day clinical studies in healthy adults with low incidence of side effects.  356 
Since the report that S1R knock -out mice demonstrated down -regulation of GR attenuating 357 
feedback inhibition of the HPA axis [Di-2017], the potential of S1R agonists to modulate GR -358 
mediated insulin suppression and cortisol levels became of interest. Di et al. presented in vivo 359 
evidence to show that S1R deficiency in CRF cells attenuates the GR-mediated feedback inhibition 360 
of the HPA axis and facilitates the stress response of the HPA axis by down -regulation of PKC 361 
signaling to suppress the GR phosphoryl ation. The results of the present study suggest that S1R 362 
activation, with PRX -3140 and NP-18-2 S1R agonists, modulates glucocorticoid insulin 363 
suppression and cortisol levels. 364 
In receptor binding assays, PRX-3140 is highly potent (Ki = 22nM) and selective for 5-HT4R with 365 
more than 100-fold difference in affinities compared with all other 5 -HT receptors tested. PRX -366 
3140 also displays affinity for the S1R (Ki = 79 -160nM) and S2R (Ki = 40 -100nM) in receptor 367 
binding assays.  NP-18-2 is a selective agonist for the 5-HT1A with affinity for the S1R but not 368 
the S2R.  NP-18-3 is a selective antagonist to the 5 -HT2B and also demonstrates binding to the 369 
S2R (Ki = 42 nM) and S1R (Ki = 100 nM) . The three compounds demonstrate selectivity for 370 
different 5 -HT receptors and differential selectivity for S1R and S2R, with NP -18-2 with the 371 
highest S1R selectivity.  Binding to over 50 other receptor subtypes was low and did not overlap 372 
for any one compound. 373 
Receptor binding assay results cannot reflect activity, and while a cell-based assays monitoring the 374 
dissociation of the sigma -1 receptor from its chaperone protein, BiP (also known as GRP78)  is 375 
used to determine activity [Yano et al., 2018], this assay is prone to variability based on conditions 376 
and S1R ligands tested that may complicate interpretation.  Therefore, to confirm the S1R activity 377 
of PRX-3140, in vitro electrophysiology was used as a functional assay. Neuronal excitability on 378 
NAc excitability showed a dose dependent reduction in maximum evok ed AP firing similar to 379 
results with the known S1R antagonist CM304 [Allyene-2023]. Notably, PRX-3140 and NP-18-2 380 
demonstrate S1R a ntagonist activity at high doses, but reports have also shown antagonists 381 
administered at low concentrations can produce the agonist-like effects [Maurice-2021].   382

Cortisol, an endogenous glucocorticoid hormone produced with a circadian daily rhythm, plays a 383 
critical role in the body’s stress response, but prolonged elevation of cortisol levels can lead to 384 
various health issues. Cortisol is released by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropic 385 
hormone (ACTH), which is released by the pituitary in response to corticotropin -releasing 386 
hormone (CRH) released by the hypothalamus in response to stress.  Chronic stress and high 387 
cortisol levels are associated with conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and 388 
cardiovascular diseases [Abraham-2013].  Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), proposed as the 389 
endogenous ligand for the S1R (Ki=15 µM), is the most abundant circulating steroid in the human 390 
body produced in the adrenal gland and de novo in the central nervous system [Yabuki-2015]. After 391 
smoking a cigarette, plasma ACTH  and epinephrine increase , followed by cortisol and DHEA 392 
reaching peak levels between 30 and 60 minutes after smoking  [Mendelson-2005]. The increases 393 
in cortisol and DHEA were significantly correlated, and each had a similar half -life after high 394 
nicotine cigarette smoking.   395 
Cortisol and DHEA interact with the S1R and can influence the expression and activity of S1R, 396 
affecting neuronal health and resilience to stress [Rennekamp-2016]. The S1R is thought to play a 397 
protective role in neuronal survival and stress response, and its modulation could offer therapeutic 398 
avenues for addressing stress -related disorders [Penke-2018]. Cortisol suppresses insulin and 399 
glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP -1) production in the pancreas and can lead to insulin resistance 400 
[Joseph-2022]. The effect of cortisol, DHEA, and the S1R agonist PRX-3140 on insulin production 401 
was measured using the INS-1 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line . S1R agonists DHEA, PRX-3140 402 
and NP -18-2 alone moderately increased insulin release at 10  µM, but this increase was not 403 
statistically significant. 100 nM cortisol significantly reduced insulin release (48.8 ng/ml of insulin 404 
released compared to 117.3 ng/ml exposed to 16.7 mM glucose alone, P-value of <0.0001). If 10 405 
µM PRX-3140 was co-administered with the 100 nM cortisol, the insulin release was significantly 406 
increased (74.8 ng/ml, P-value <0.0001). This improvement of insulin release was not seen w ith 407 
DHEA-S or DHEA co-administration. Co-administration of 1 µM DHEA-S with 100 nM cortisol 408 
yielded no difference from 100 nM cortisol alone. Co-administration of 10 nM DHEA and 100 nM 409 
cortisol drops the amount of insulin released (37.0 ng/ml) when compared to 100 nM cortisol alone 410 
(48.8 ng/ml, P value = 0.0 015). Similar effects were observed when cells were exposed to 411 
dexamethasone, with 10 µM PRX-3140 with the 10 nM Dex producing significantly more insulin 412 
than Dex alone.  Dex+NP-18-2 demonstrated similar insulin release recovery  to PRX -3140, 413 
however, Dex+NP-18-3 (S2R ligand) did not , potentially because the concentration tested or 5 -414 
HT2 / S2R activity.  415 
5-HT1 and 5 -HT4 agonists are known to interact with the HPA.  The S1R is proposed as a 416 
contributor in modulation of g lucocorticoid insulin suppression and cortisol levels .  PRX-3140 417 
was shown to lower glucose and cortisol levels at low 10 mg daily doses up to 14 days.  In a phase 418 
I clinical study NP-18-2 demonstrated lower glucose levels at low oral doses and cortisol lowering 419 
effects 1-6 hours after administration (unpublished results).  PRX-3140 and NP -18-2, both S1R 420 
ligands in the 100  nm range, demonstrated similar ability to improve insulin release and lower 421 
cortisol levels at low doses but variable effects at higher doses in clinical studies suggesting a bi-422 
phasic dose response relationship.  Although 5-HT1 and 5-HT4 receptors are known to modulate 423
