Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to leverage the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory,
active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable model of the representational capacities of
living creatures; that is, a theory of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are
concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of
ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The
active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition
systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the
blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally
independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures
emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which
together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational
capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory
over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states
to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this,
we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can
come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the
2
neuronal packet hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent representation,
we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing ensembles of active inference
agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic generative model are able to encode recoverable
information about a stimulus array.

1. Introduction
Living creatures are endowed with a representational capacity: they behave as if states of their
bodies encode information or probabilistic beliefs about salient features of their environment,
which they seem to leverage to generate contextually appropriate, adaptive behaviour (Egan,
2018; Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018; Ramstead, Friston, & Hipólito, 2020; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, &
Friston, 2019). Most multicellular creatures have evolved specialised cell populations – nervous
systems, comprising neural and nonneural (e.g., glial) cells – that are dedicated to realizing this
representational capacity. Through continuous tuning of network connections, groups of neurons
self-organize to form functionally integrated ensembles that look as if they are recapitulating the
statistical structure of the environment, in a manner that organisms can leverage to generate
adaptive patterns of behaviour.
Population codes, where neural ensembles look as if they encode probabilistic beliefs about the
statistical structure of the environment (i.e., probability densities over the latent causes of
sensory data), are as ubiquitous as they are well documented (Pouget, Dayan, & Zemel, 2000).
Single neurons are known to respond preferentially to specific kinds of stimuli; e.g., neurons in
primary visual cortex respond preferentially to specific orientations and luminance contrasts of a
stimulus presented in their receptive field. Neurons also look as if they work together to infer the
most likely causes of sensory input in distal sensory epithelia, such that stimulus information can
only be fully recovered by examining activation patterns across many cells. This has been shown
extensively in the visual system (Usrey & Reid, 1999). It is well known, for instance, that
neurons in primary visual cortex look as if they infer the causes of stimuli (i.e., the patterns of
photons) that impinge upon retinal neurons (Maunsell & Van Essen, 1983); that is, the average
activity pooled over these neural populations looks as if they track features of the stimulus
presented to retinal neurons. Something similar can be said of many other neural populations,
e.g., place cells in the hippocampus (Bair, 1999; Borst & Theunissen, 1999) and topographically
organized neurons in motor cortex (Tolhurst, Movshon, & Dean, 1983).
How are these coordinated feats of representation possible? How does specialised neural tissue,
and indeed any kind of phenotypic state, come to encode information about the world in which
the organism is embedded? Is it possible to formulate a general theory of how the confluence of
brains, bodies, and their behaviours can represent the environment? Can we construct a general
theory of phenotypic representation?
In this paper, we leverage the apparatus of the free-energy principle and its corollary process
theory, known as active inference, to propose a general theory of neural representation. This
framework opens, more broadly, onto a theory of phenotypic representation, where the brains,
bodies, and behaviours of organisms – and indeed, the coordinated behaviour of groups of
organisms – are cast as engaging in inference about the causes of their sensory states at several
nested spatial and temporal scales.
The free-energy principle is a novel multiscale framework for studying belief-driven adaptive
action (Friston, 2020). The free-energy principle provides us with a theory derived from first
principles regarding what it means to exist as a system with a phenotype (i.e., to exist in a
nonequilibrium steady state regime). On this account, to exist as a living system entails
4
continually revisiting the neighbourhood of the same set of states (e.g., remaining within a
certain range of body temperatures or ecological environments). Technically, such systems are
endowed with a random dynamical or pullback attractor. This engenders a nonequilibrium steady
state density that we can associate with the phenotype of a living system. Active inference, in
turn, provides us with a (Bayesian) mechanics that explains how organisms remain within their
phenotypic bounds (Ramstead, Badcock, & Friston, 2018). The framework rests on the Markov
blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest into internal states, external
states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal states conditionally
independent of external states. This fundamental nonequilibrium Markovian structure (Friston,
Wiese, & Hobson, 2020) will guide our investigations here. We argue that representational
capacities of living creatures can be formalized in a biologically realistic way via the active
inference framework. We develop a generic and generalizable model of the representational
capacities of living creatures or, indeed, particles with particular states (namely, internal states
and their Markov blanket).
We draw on one prescient operationalization of this distributed representational capacity – the
construct of a neuronal packet – and provide a proof of principle for the neuronal packet
hypothesis (Yufik, 1998; Yufik & Friston, 2016). According to the neuronal packet hypothesis,
cortical neurons perform inference about the causes of patterns in sensory neuron stimulation by
forming neuronal packets, which are neural ensembles wrapped in a Markov blanket, such that
neuronal packets come to represent recoverable features of the stimulus. In one sense, the notion
of a neuronal packet can be read as homologous to the notion of a neuronal group, ensemble or
assembly that has a long pedigree in neurology and neuroscience (Buzsaki, 2010; Edelman,
1993; Edelman, 1998; Gerstein & Kirkland, 2001; Hebb, 1949; Mountcastle, 1997; Nicolelis &
Lebedev, 2009; Sherrington, 1911; von der Malsburg, 1981).
We argue that the representational capacity of creatures is a consequence of their Markovian
structure. The Markovian partition of a system in a nonequilibrium steady state regime equips
the internal states of a system with a dual-aspect information geometry. Internal states have an
intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as
an extrinsic geometry based on probabilistic beliefs about fictive external states (that is, beliefs
that may or may not correspond to true external states), encoded by internal states. Here, we
show simulation results that concretely demonstrate in silico that – when suitably configured
under the right probabilistic model – the self-organizing ensembles of active inference agents
(ensembles of simulated neurons) that share the same model are able to encode recoverable
information about a stimulus array. We argue that the configurations at which the system arrives
through such self-organised coordination can be cast as a form of embodied inference (i.e.,
arriving at posterior state estimates over the causes of sensory stimulation).
Although we focus on neuronal ensembles, it is important to highlight that the account that we
develop here, based as it is on the free-energy principle, can be applied to any group of living
(sub-)systems that entertain a shared generative model. This means that the representational
capacity that we discuss in this paper is general. It need not be restricted to cells, or even to
animals, and has the resources to account for potential collective representational capacities
across all kinds of self-organising systems; e.g., plant dynamics (Calvo & Friston, 2017).
5
Extant work on this topic has focused on the representational capacities of individual systems
(Friston, 2013; Kuchling, Friston, Georgiev, & Levin, 2019), sometimes composed of other
systems (Palacios, Razi, Parr, Kirchhoff, & Friston, 2020). In this paper, we extend this line of
reasoning to patterns of group activity that enable a group of agents (be they neurons or other
elements of larger systems that realise the appropriate dynamics) to collectively represent
features of an external environment. This extension is crucial for understanding the intentional
capacities of living systems, where hierarchical and distributed dynamics are ubiquitous.
2. Background: Multiscale active inference
2.1. Active inference and Markov blankets
The free-energy principle begins from the observation that living creatures tend to revisit the
neighbourhood of the same states of being (Ramstead et al., 2018). This is formalized as the
claim that the dynamics of living creatures are underwritten by a nonequilibrium steady state
(Friston, 2020). Living systems exist far from thermodynamic equilibrium, in a regime of
characteristic states that we associate with a nonequilibrium steady-state density over the
system’s states, with high probability states corresponding to typical states given ‘the kind of
creature that I am’, i.e., to those that are consistent with an organism’s phenotype. The free-
energy principle explains how living creatures remain alive (i.e., away from equilibrium), by
continuously generating patterns of adaptive action that bring about preferred sensory data or
observations compatible with their survival (Friston, 2020). Thus, according to active inference,
to exist as a living thing means to continually produce sensory evidence of one’s own existence
(i.e., evidence that ‘I am in or near a nonequilibrium steady state); what is sometimes called self-
evidencing (Hohwy, 2016).
Active inference rests on a few fundamental, interlocking mathematical constructs: these
comprise the nonequilibrium steady state densities just discussed, as well Markov blankets,
generative models, and variational free-energy (Ramstead, Constant, Badcock, & Friston, 2019;
Ramstead et al., 2020; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al., 2019). A growing literature appeals to
Markov blankets to account for biological self-organization and the ability of living systems to
remain alive over time (Constant, Ramstead, Veissière, Campbell, & Friston, 2018; Friston,
2013, 2020; Hipólito, 2019; Kirchhoff, Parr, Palacios, Friston, & Kiverstein, 2018; Kuchling,
Friston, Georgiev, & Levin, 2019; Palacios, Razi, Parr, Kirchhoff, & Friston, 2020; Ramstead et
al., 2018; Ramstead, Constant, et al., 2019). This scheme gives us a principled definition of what
it means to exist as a system (Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018). Minimally, to exist
as a system implies a form of conditional independence with respect to the rest of the world; and
Markov blankets operationalize this independence.
A Markov blanket defines a system of interest by identifying the states that mediate its
probabilistic relations with the events and regularities of the environment in which it is
embedded, and which cause or generate those sensory states. By inducing conditional
independence (Pearl, 1988), Markov blankets enable us to define the boundaries between a
system and its environment, and thereby delimit the system as such (Friston, 2013, 2020; Friston,
Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 2015). We define a system of interest, delimiting it from the system
6
in which it is embedded (e.g., a living creature in its ecological niche, or a cell in the intercellular
milieu), by defining a third set of states – the Markov blanket itself – that mediate the causal
influences between them. The Markov blanket is further partitioned into sensory and active
states: active states affect, but are not affected by, external states; whereas sensory states affect,
but are not affected by, internal states. Given this partition, internal states are independent of
external states, given blanket states. See Figure 1.
Figure 1. Markov blankets under active inference
This figure depicts the statistical relations that define the Markov blanket. The existence of a Markov blanket
induces certain conditional independences: the presence of the blanket partitions the system into internal states
(denoted s), external states (denoted s), and the blanket states themselves – which render internal and external states
independent of each other, when conditioned on blanket states. The Markov blanket itself comprises active states (a)
and sensory states (o). From Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al. (2019).
2.2. Generative models, variational free-energy, and the mechanics of inference
Active inference is a formulation of Bayesian mechanics, which tells us about the flow of
internal and active states and how this keeps the Markov blanket in play (i.e., keeps the
boundaries that separate an organism from its environment intact). For action and perception to
be adaptive and knowledge-driven, some structures must exist that harness this knowledge in a
form amenable for use in guiding adaptive action. These structures are the internal states of
creatures, shielded behind their Markov blankets. Active inference allows us to cast perception
and action (i.e., the flow of internal and active states, respectively, in response to perturbations
from sensory states) as maximising the evidence for an implicit statistical model, which living
creatures embody and which guides their production of adaptive action through the selection of
(beliefs about) sequences of actions, or policies (Friston, 2020).
Formally, generative model is a joint probability density over the variables of a system; in the
case of active inference, this a joint probability density over organismic states (so-called
particular states, i.e., internal, sensory, and active states) and fictive external states (Ramstead,
Kirchhoff, et al., 2019). Under the free-energy principle, the generative model is just an
interpretation of the nonequilibrium steady state density that we associate with the organism’s
7
phenotype (Friston, 2020). Heuristically, we can either look at this density from the point of view
of the physics of flow, as the underlying manifold that structures the flow of states; or as a joint
probability density over all systemic states (Ramstead et al., 2020). In brief, the presence of a
Markov blanket in a system at nonequilibrium steady state means that we can look at the
system’s internal states as if they parameterize beliefs about (probability distributions over)
external states. Because the external states now play the role of random variables they are often
referred to as the latent or hidden states (i.e., hidden behind the Markov blanket). These hidden
states can be read as explanatory fictions that the organism entertains to explain how its data
were caused (Ramstead et al., 2020).
A modest representational capacity follows from this Markovian, nonequilibrium setup (Friston,
2020; Friston, Wiese, et al., 2020; Parr, Da Costa, & Friston, 2020). Indeed, the Markovian
structure just described leads to a dual-aspect information geometry that licences a description of
internal states where they encode a conditional (Bayesian) belief about the external world.
Information geometry is essentially concerned with measurement of spaces that represent (the
sufficient statistics of) probability distributions. Simply put, the existence of the Markovian
partition implies that, for any blanket states of a system, one can identify (an average over)
internal states and a corresponding conditional belief (i.e., probability density) about external
states. Thus, in addition to the ‘intrinsic’ information geometry of the system – which captures
the probability of internal states over time – the Markovian structure endows the system with an
‘extrinsic’ information geometry, which captures beliefs about concurrent external states
(Friston, Wiese, et al., 2020).
According to the free-energy principle, living systems enact dynamics (patterns of action and
perception) that entail a generative model (Friston, 2012; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al., 2019).
What this means is that, mathematically, the behaviour looks as if it was produced by a specific
causal process (a specific generative process), the structure of which is recapitulated in the
generative model. In producing adaptive behaviour, living systems will look as if they are
performing inference about the causal structure of their ecological niche, and maximising the
evidence for a model of the world that they implicitly embody. More specifically, they do so by
optimizing a bound on the (negative log) of this evidence known as the variational free-energy –
which the organism can compute from the dynamics of its sensory states. By minimizing
variational free-energy (a.k.a. maximizing model evidence), internal states of an organism come
to encode a probabilistic ‘best guess’ about the causes of sensory input (Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018;
Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al., 2019). This is known as the (variational) free-energy principle
(Friston, 2010, 2020).
To summarize, the entailment of a generative model by adaptive behaviour, and the concomitant
partition of the system into internal and external states separated by blanket states (and thereby
the maintenance of the Markov blanket), leads to the induction of beliefs or knowledge about
external states, parameterized by internal states. The physical states of the system then come to
encode (the sufficient statistics) of distinct posterior beliefs about latent states. These are
explanatory fictions or hypotheses about what is causing the sensory states. This means that the
physical quantities that organisms embody encode the (parameters of) posterior or conditional
density (i.e., Bayesian beliefs) over hidden or latent states that might best explain the manner in
which sensory data were generated (Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al., 2019). Theexistence of a
8
partition into internal, blanket, and external states thus also induces beliefs or knowledge about
external states encoded by internal states and leads to the emergence of representational capacity
in living creatures (Friston, 2012; Friston, 2020; Friston, Wiese, et al., 2020; Ramstead et al.,
2020). The ensuing Bayesian mechanics suggests a deep if somewhat deflationary connection
between existence and knowledge; namely, to exist is to know – in the sense of holding Bayesian
beliefs (John Campbell, personal communication).
2.3. Nested Markov blankets and multiscale self-organization
This Markovian structure of living systems is iterated recursively across all levels of biological
organization (Friston, 2020; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios et al., 2020). Since most living
systems are composed of parts that are themselves living systems (e.g., organisms are made of
organs, which are made of cells), the Markovian structure iterates recursively, allowing us to
explain the dynamics of any system that exists at nonequilibrium steady state across levels of
description – from cells to societies (Friston, 2020; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018;
Ramstead, Constant, et al., 2019). It is thus blankets of blankets, as it were, all the way up, and
all the way down. See Figure 2.
Figure 2. Nested Markov blankets
This figure depicts the recursive structure of nested Markov blankets. At each successive level of the nested
hierarchy, superordinate dynamics at successively larger and slower scales emerge from, and constrain, dynamics
arising at subordinate, smaller and faster scales. We can read the figure starting with the bottom panel. This panel
9
depicts an ensemble of nine states – denoted x – which have not yet been differentiated into the partition prescribed
by a Markov blanket. The formalism deploys renormalization group theory to derive a scale-free dynamics (Friston,
2020). In brief, we start at the bottom panel with a group of vector states (here, nine are depicted). We use a
grouping operator G to group these states according to their conditional independences, by computing the Jacobian
of their adjacency matrix. This leaves us with a particular partition of the same states, now grouped into blanket
(sensory and active) and internal states. We then use a dimension reduction operator R to derive dynamics at the
next scale. Here, the fast and stable modes of the blanket states and the internal states are dropped. The principal
eigenstates of each blanket are taken to define new vector states at the scale above; and the process repeats until all
states have been accounted for. Depicted in the upper panels are particles, which are defined in terms of the
conditional dependences between these states and that define the Markov blanket of each particle. Here, a particle π
is a mixture of blanket states (b) and internal states (μ). From Friston (2020).
The strategy deployed by proponents of active inference to model self-organization at several
scales is to show that some higher-level phenomenon (e.g., pattern formation) emerges from the
coordinated inference dynamics of component phenomena at the subordinate scale, given that
they share a generative model (Friston, 2013; Kirchhoff et al., 2018). In this work, each
individual agent is equipped the same generative model (which is a metaphor for a shared
genetic code). The parameters of this generative model encode knowledge about the kinds of
signals that different cell types receive and send, as a function of the kind of cell they are. (We
discuss this in detail in the Methods and Results sections below). Based on this shared
knowledge, each cell in the ensemble is able to infer its place and its role (as an internal, active,
or sensory state) in the higher-order system, as a function of the evidence that each cell
accumulates that is indicative of such a role, in terms of probabilistic relations between roles as
defined by the Markovian partition – e.g., internal states do not communicate directly with other
internal states (which are shrouded behind their blankets), but can communicate with blanket
states, etc.
In other words, an ensemble self-organizes to some target configuration because its components
share the same expectations about the typical observations or data that are generated by the
behaviour of it and other members of the ensemble. For a system of units sharing a generative
model, the free-energy minimum for each cell coincides with the free-energy minimum for the
ensemble (Friston, 2013; Friston et al., 2015; Kuchling et al., 2019; Palacios et al., 2020). Target
morphologies emerge as the result of group inference operating on a shared generative model;
where each unit comes to ‘know its place’ by inferring what role it must be playing, given the
signals it is receiving from other units and those it sends.

This figure depicts the numerical results reported in Friston et al. (2015), which were expanded upon by Palacios et
al. (2020) and by Kuchling et al. (2019), and which are described further in the text. The bottom right panel depicts
the target configuration and the movement of cells towards this configuration, and the central bottom panel depicts
the signalling profile associated with each target position, which each cell uses to find its place. The top panels
display the expectations of each cell as it moves towards the final position. The bottom left panel depicts the free-
energy of the ensemble. Free-energy increases initially as each cell figures out what kind of cell it is, and then drops
to the global minimum, which coincides with each cell finding its place in the target configuration.
2.4. Markov blankets in the brain and the neuronal packets hypothesis
As discussed above, Markov blankets have been used to define the boundaries and dynamics of
systems interacting across scales (Friston, 2020; Hipólito, 2019; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios
et al., 2020; Ramstead et al., 2018; Ramstead, Constant, et al., 2019). This applies to the brain as
well (Friston, Fagerholm, et al., 2020; Hipólito et al., 2020; Palacios, Isomura, Parr, & Friston,
2019; Parr & Friston, 2018). To start with, single neurons have their Markov blankets (Kiebel &
Friston, 2011). The sensory states of the neuron are the synapses through which it receives
signals from other cells. The active states of neurons are their axons and synaptic terminals
through which they convey action potentials and patterns of neurotransmitter release onto other
cells. Each neuron has a preferred receptive field profile or response vector that represents its
11
preferred stimulus type, which we can associate with the afferent synaptic connections of the
neurons that encode its likelihood function (i.e., that encode what inputs are those that provide
evidence for the hypothesis it represents). Active inference can be used to explain neural
behaviour at three different scales: the fast timescale of inference (changes in activation or
depolarization), the slower timescale of associate learning (changes in synaptic efficacy or gain),
and the even slower timescale of structure learning (structural change in dendritic architecture)
(Kiebel & Friston, 2011). Empirically, there is emerging evidence for the self-evidencing
behaviour of neuronal ensembles in terms of dendritic architectures; even in cell cultures
(Isomura & Friston, 2018).
On the active inference account, the architecture of (nested) Markov blankets discussed above
might form the basis of brain organization generally (Friston, Fagerholm, et al., 2020; Hipólito et
al., 2020). The causal factors that figure in generative models are thought to correspond to
anatomically segregated brain areas (Friston & Buzsáki, 2016; Parr & Friston, 2018). The
evidence once thought to suggest modular processing in the brain may be better interpreted as
evidence for structures enabling this factorization. In other words, functionally specialised brain
regions may encode factors of a factorized probability density, which are conditionally
independent but related to each other through their mean fields (Friston, Parr, & de Vries, 2017;
Parr, Sajid, & Friston, 2020). This means that neuronal populations may encode distinct factors,
each segregated by their Markov blanket (e.g., the identity of an object vs. its spatial location).
This leaves open the question of how neural ensembles come to encode information. The
neuronal packet hypothesis (Yufik & Friston, 2016) proposes that neurons are able to encode
information about external causes by forming coherent, bounded ensembles, enshrouded behind
a Markov blanket. The self-organization of a Markovian ensemble of neurons in response to
perturbations (action potentials) coming from sensory neurons can thus be interpreted as a form
of posterior inference, with each packet encoding a different hypothesis (Yufik, 2019; Yufik &
Friston, 2016). This is broadly consistent with theories of structural representation, according to
which neurons encode exploitable information about a target domain by mirroring the
(mathematical or statistical) structure of that target domain (Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018, 2019;
Kiefer, 2020). The neuronal packet hypothesis goes further and proposes that the capacity of an
organism to infer and interpret the causes of its sensory states results from the binding together
of neuronal populations through the formation of a boundary (i.e., a Markov blanket) around the
neuronal packet. To ‘mobilise’ such a packet – in response to sensory perturbation – would be to
understand a world composed of interacting causes (Yufik, 2019; Yufik & Friston, 2016).
Empirical evidence supports the neuronal packet hypothesis, suggesting that neurons process
information by forming task-dependent, transient coalitions on the fly; for an extensive review of
the empirical evidence for this type of ‘neural reuse’ (Anderson, 2014). Thus, brain activity
arises from coalitions of neurons functioning together as a cohesive unit, in a context- and goal-
dependent manner. This allows for the combination of information about more or less
independent causal factors encoded by the physical states of brain networks (Parr, Sajid, et al.,
2020). Neurons are thus trying to form functional coalitions dynamically, to bring to bear the
factors that they encode in a multifactorial coordinated inference; see also Park and Friston
(2013). Strikingly, evidence for the Markovian structure of brain dynamics comes from recent
12
work in neuroimaging, which demonstrates that brain regions form Markovian ‘parcels’ (Friston,
Fagerholm, et al., 2020).
In recent active inference models, neurons are endowed with the prior belief (encoded in their
shared generative model) that, in the absence of external perturbations, their signalling profiles
will align or synchronise (Palacios et al., 2019). This might provide the initial impetus for packet
formation. Each neuron is equipped with a generative model that allows it to infer its functional
identity (or role in the Markovian partition) in the superordinate ensemble. It thus follows that
perceptual inference arises as the neuronal system self-organizes into coherent packets in
response to sensory perturbations.
One further phenomenon of interest that may be worth considering in this context is structural
self-organization – and associated functional segregation (Zeki, 2005) – during early
development and neuronal differentiation. Instead of neurons being genetically hard-wired to
come to represent specific stimuli, some work suggests that common patterns of functional
segregation may be more weakly specified by the inherited constraints on large-scale axonal
structure (e.g., the path of optic nerve signals to visual cortices via the thalamus), where the
functional role of a neuron (or of a locally connected population of neurons) instead emerges
from self-organization in response to the statistics of the signals it receives early in development
(Bienenstock, Cooper, & Munro, 1982; Peters & Yilmaz, 1993; Sin, Haas, Ruthazer, & Cline,
2002; Sur, Garraghty, & Roe, 1988; Sur & Rubenstein, 2005; von der Malsburg, Phillips, &
Singer, 2010; Von Melchner, Pallas, & Sur, 2000; Zeki & Shipp, 1989). This has been most
starkly demonstrated in studies of experimentally manipulated large-scale neuronal pathways,
e.g., studies that redirect visual signals from the optic nerve to the medial geniculate nucleus and
auditory cortices. Remarkably, in these cases, populations of auditory cortex neurons become
sensitive to specific visual properties similar to those normally seen in visual cortex. Other
studies of developmental windows, such as work showing selective blindness to particular visual
features (e.g., vertical contours) not present in the early environment, and associated pruning of
the necessary synaptic connections to implement the inference of such properties, further
illustrates this point (Blakemore & Cooper, 1970; Buonomano & Merzenich, 1998; Huang &
Reichardt, 2001; Muir & Mitchell, 1973; Rice & Barone, 2000; Singer, Freeman, &
Rauschecker, 1981; Thoenen, 1995). Thus, there is a strong sense in which (under broad genetic
constraints on large-scale axonal wiring patterns) neural populations infer what specific
functional role they play based on the early inputs they receive.
2.5. Neural representation in the active inference framework
This paper builds on the technical developments of active inference models of hierarchical self-
assembly and self-organization (Friston et al., 2015; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios et al., 2019;
Palacios et al., 2020). This work has shown that a Markov blanket emerges naturally around a
group of active inference agents that share the right kind of generative model (Friston et al.,
2015; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Kuchling et al., 2019). The strategy deployed in these papers is to
recast the problem of superordinate boundary formation – the emergence of a Markov blanket –
as the consequence of inference conditioned on a shared generative model.
13
Extending this work, our strategy in this paper is to explain the self-organization of neural tissue
into neuronal packets at a superordinate level by modelling coordinated inferences of single
neurons sharing a generative model. The technical novelty in our setup is that each individual
neuron must now infer to which higher-order Markov blanketed system it belongs, in addition to
the role that it plays in that superordinate system. This role in the superordinate ensemble is
implemented by leveraging the partition of the system into different kinds of states, which
follows from the existence of a Markov blanket at the superordinate scale (and beliefs about
membership in that blanketed system): individual neurons must infer whether they play the role
of a sensory state, an active state, or an internal state, where each of these roles is defined in
terms of the conditional independencies that define the Markov blanket.
We model neuronal packet formation as the result of inferences about membership to a higher-
order Markov blanketed ensemble, which can be cast as a form of inference. Each neuron has an
individual response vector; that is, each neuron responds preferentially to some features being
present in their receptive field. When sensory neurons detect their preferred stimulus in their
receptive field, they send signals (i.e., action potentials) to cortical neurons, e.g., neurons in the
primary visual context receiving signals from sensory neurons in the retina (through the lateral
geniculate nucleus). We model the later type of neuron in this work. We hypothesize that cortical
neurons use these signals as evidence for a specific inference: that they are the internal states of
a neuronal packet at the superordinate level. Neurons exchange signals as well, which express
their beliefs about blanket membership at the superordinate scale. This group inference and
communication leads to the formation of a neuronal packet, which encodes a hypothesis about
what might have caused the sensory impressions on visual receptors. Neuronal packet
membership can be seen as a measure of evidence for that hypothesis. Thus, neuronal packet
formation corresponds to the self-organization of neural ensembles enabled by inferences about
membership to a higher-order Markov blanketed system. This provides a generalizable
mechanism for distributed neural representations, premised on a nonequilibrium, Markovian, and
recursively nested architecture.
In short, we hypothesize a specific architecture that links neurons in the sensory epithelia to
neurons in the brain. The response vector of sensory neurons encodes the kinds of target features
in their receptive fields to which they are most sensitive (e.g., orientation and contrast). This
sensitivity means that, in the presence of their preferred stimulus, the rate at which action
potentials are generated increases. Our hypothesis is that, when they detect increases in particular
signalling patterns from sensory neurons, cortical neurons take this as evidence to infer that they
are internal states of a higher-order ensemble. Essentially, on this account, the action potentials
generated by each cortical neuron broadcast to other cortical neurons a signal that conveys its
beliefs about whether it is an internal state of a superordinate ensemble.
3. Methods
To concretely demonstrate our proposed formulation, we simulate 𝑁 = 256 ‘particles’ operating
in a two-dimensional phase space, where the location of a particle is denoted 𝑥 ∈ ℝ2 and the
equations of motion are largely based on those used by Palacios and colleagues (2020). Each
particle – representing an individual neuron – is modelled as an active Bayesian agent,
14
partitioned into sensory 𝑠, active 𝑎 and internal 𝜇 states. The internal states parameterize beliefs
about (i.e., a probability density over) hidden external causes of sensory input and are optimised
using Gaussian filtering (Palacios et al., 2020). In other words, they are updated in order to
minimise variational free-energy. In the current context, the internal states parameterize beliefs
about the identity of the particle 𝜓 ∈ ℝ4, where each identity corresponds to membership in a
superordinate ensemble.
Particles emit signals 𝜓 ∈ ℝ4, where each signal corresponds to a particular identity. In
particular, each particle emits signals 𝛙 as a function of their internal states 𝜇:
𝛙 = 𝜎(𝜇) (eq.1)
Where 𝜎 is the softmax function. The internal states 𝜇 ∈ℝ4 of a particle encode model evidence
(negative free-energy) for their identity, such that the distribution 𝛙 represents the beliefs of a
𝑖
particle about its own identity. Particles thus transmit beliefs about their respective identity.
These transmitted signals are sensed by neighbouring particles. Signals decay exponentially as a
function of distance in their shared phase space (e.g., as in local vs. long-range synaptic
connections within a cortical region or diffuse neuromodulator release), such that the local signal
intensity 𝑚 ∈ℝ4 for particle is given by:
𝑁
1
𝑚 = ∑𝛙 exp(− ∆𝑥⃗2) (eq.2)
𝑗 2 𝑗
𝑗
where the vector between particle locations is given by ∆𝑥⃗ = 𝑥⃗ − 𝑥⃗.
𝑗 𝑗
We introduce two numerical innovations with respect to the simulations reported by Palacios and
colleagues (2020). Rather than particles sensing local signal intensities directly, they sense the
(2D) spatial flow vector of the four signals, 𝑅⃗⃗ ∈ ℝ2 ×ℝ4, the relative rate of change in the signal
as a function of location, or its proportional intensity gradient:
∇ 𝑚
𝑅⃗⃗ = 𝑥 (eq.3)
𝑚
By combining equations (1-3), we can show that the flow vector of any exponentially decaying
variable satisfies:
𝑁
1
𝑅⃗⃗ = ∑∆ 𝑥⃗ 𝜎(𝜇 − ∆𝑥⃗2) (eq.4)
𝑗 𝑗 2 𝑗
𝑗≠ 𝑖
This equation shows that, for any particle, the flow vector 𝑅⃗⃗ points directly to the (intensity-
weighted) signal source. Moreover, the magnitude 𝑅 = |𝑅⃗⃗| of this vector is proportional to the
distance from the signal source. These are remarkable properties for a signal that can always be
15
computed locally, given the reasonable assumption of an exponential decrease of signal intensity
with distance.
As well as sensing the flow vector magnitude 𝑠 , each particle internally senses the signal it
𝑅
transmits 𝑠 , such that the complete sensory state 𝑠 is:
𝜓
𝑠 𝛙+Ω
𝜓 𝜓
𝑠 = ( ) = ( ) (eq.5)
𝑠 𝑅 𝑅 +Ω 𝑅
where Ω and Ω are Gaussian fluctuations.
𝜓 𝑅
To enable self-organising behaviour, we equip the particles with prior beliefs about the
magnitude of flow vectors 𝑅. As Bayesian agents act to realise prior beliefs (i.e., maximise
model evidence), expectations about 𝑅 will promote behaviour (i.e., movement in state space)
that realises the corresponding belief about distance from the intensity-weighted signal source.
We specify a unique prior 𝑃(𝑅|𝜓) for each signal identity 𝜓, meaning that the signals (flow
vector magnitudes) that are expected by each particle depend on their inferred identity:
𝑃(𝑅|𝜓) = 𝒩(𝐑 ,Π ) (eq.6)
𝜓 𝑅
where 𝐑 ∈ ℝ4 is a set of four conditional means for each signal, given a particular identity 𝜓
𝜓
and given the corresponding set of precisions Π (inverse variances). Because 𝑅 is directly
𝑅
proportional to the (intensity-weighted) distance to the signal source, the Markov blanket
structure of the superordinate ensemble can be encoded in these identity-specific expectations
𝐑 :
𝜓
D D 2D 2D
D D D 2D
𝐑 = [ ] (eq.7)
𝜓 2D D D D
2D 2D D D
Where D is a scaling parameter. Effectively, this matrix encodes the compatibility of spatial
proximity between the four identities. Specifically, particles can (infer they) belong to one of two
higher-order ensembles, where these ensembles are themselves superordinate particles consisting
of internal and blanket states. Particles can form beliefs about whether they are an internal state
𝜓 or a blanket state 𝜓 of one superordinate Markov blanket, or alternatively, a blanket state 𝜓
1 2 3
or an internal state 𝜓 of the alternative superordinate Markov blanket. These identities differ
4
only in terms of their associated expectations 𝑃(𝑅|𝜓), where inferring that one is an internal
state 𝜓 of one Markov blanket involves the expectation of being far away (distance of 2D) from
1
particles that are part of the other superordinate particle, 𝜓 , and vice versa. Particles which
3,4
identify as 𝜓 or 𝜓 correspond to the blanket states that separate the internal states of the
2 3
superordinate ensembles. Accordingly, blanket states 𝜓 are compatible with proximity (distance
2
of 1D) to the corresponding internal states 𝜓 as well as the blanket states 𝜓 of the other
1 3
16
ensemble. Reciprocally, blanket states 𝜓 are compatible with proximity to internal states 𝜓 and
3 4
blanket states of the other ensemble 𝜓 .
2
The agents have a categorical belief distribution over identities and their actual expectations are a
Bayesian model average of the expectations corresponding with each identity:
𝐑 = E [𝑅] = 𝛙𝐑 (eq.8)
𝜓 𝜓
We now derive updates for the model evidence for internal states 𝜇. The flow of the internal
states is given by gradient flows on variational free-energy 𝐹:
𝑓 (𝑠̃,𝑎̃,𝑢̃) = (𝑄 −Γ ) ∇ 𝐹 (eq.9)
𝜇 𝜇 𝜇 𝜇
Here, the tilde indicates generalised coordinates, containing both the variable and all its temporal
derivatives. We refer readers to Palacios and colleagues (2020) for a full description. We
consider a first-order approximation for small Gaussian fluctuations; in which case we obtain the
rate of change of model evidence 𝜇:
𝜇̇ = ∇ 𝐑⋅Π 𝜀 +∇ 𝛙⋅Π 𝜀 −Π 𝜇 (eq.10)
𝜇 𝑅 𝑅 𝜇 𝜓 𝜓 𝜇
Here, Π , Π , Π are sensory and internal precisions (inverse variances) that normalise model
𝑅 𝜓 𝜇
evidence 𝜇 and the prediction errors 𝜀 , 𝜀 :
𝑅 𝜓
𝜀 = 𝑠 −𝛙
𝜓 𝜓
𝜀 = 𝑠 −𝐑 (eq.11)
𝑅 𝑅
In other words, the model evidence for each particle identity varies with the normalised
prediction error, where the prediction error quantifies the difference between the (magnitude of
the) sensed flow vector and the prior beliefs about the magnitudes of flow vectors.
Finally, we move on to consider active states, which correspond to a chemical emitter (𝑎 ∈ ℝ4 )
𝜓
and motor actuators (𝑎 ∈ ℝ2) that move the particle through phase space 𝑥. The flow of active
𝑥
states mirrors that of internal states:
𝑓 (𝑠̃,𝑎̃,𝑢̃) = (𝑄 −Γ ) ∇ 𝐹 (eq.12)
𝑎̃ 𝑎 𝑎 𝑎̃
Intracellular self-communication serves as a minimal type of memory that is regulated by a
chemical emitter that communicates identity beliefs with normalised Gaussian fluctuations
(mentioned above):
𝑎 = 𝛙
𝜓
𝑎̇ = −Π 𝜀 (eq.13)
𝜓 𝜓 𝜓
As discussed, motor actuators regulate the spatial location of cells. We still neglect friction for
now (Π = 0), but we increase the realism of cell movement by choosing for a second-order
𝑥
17
𝑥
approximation: 𝑎̃ = ( ), where 𝑥̇ is the velocity. Since we are calculating the flow of both
𝑥 𝑥̇
position and velocity as defined by the free-energy functional, this model also incorporates
acceleration:
𝑥̇ = −∇ 𝑅⃗⃗ ⋅Π 𝜀
𝑥 𝑅 𝑅
𝑥̈ = ∇ 𝑅⃗⃗⋅𝜆Π 𝐑̇ (eq.14)
𝑥 𝑅
where λ parametrises the autocorrelation of fluctuations over time, which sets the smoothness of
fluctuations and regulates the magnitude of second-order effects (see Friston et al., 2010 for its
derivation) and 𝐑̇ is the temporal derivative of expectations about 𝑅:
𝐑̇ = 𝐑𝛙(1−𝛙)𝜇̇ (eq.15)
Collecting all results, we can now integrate over time and use a Taylor series expansion to
simulate trajectories of particles over time in terms of 𝑥, 𝑎 and 𝜇:
𝜓
𝑥 = 𝑥 +𝑥̇ Δ𝑡+ 1 𝑥̈ Δt2
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
2
𝑎 = 𝛙+Π Ω Δ𝑡
𝜓,𝑡+1 𝜓 𝜓
𝜇 = 𝜇 +𝜇̇ Δ𝑡 (eq.16)
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡
In summary, all we have done here is write down a relatively simple generative model of what
any neuron or particle expects to sense, depending upon its identity (e.g., functional selectivity)
and spatial relationship to other particles that share the same generative model. This generative
model means that one can compute variational free-energy gradients and the ensuing flow of
particular states, which can be read as neuronal dynamics or movement. This dynamics will
necessarily show self-organising, self-assembling, and self-evidencing aspects because it
minimises a variational bound on the evidence for a (shared) model of the external milieu.
Crucially, the external milieu is made up of particles that are all trying to do the same thing and
thereby fulfil each other's expectations. Technically, because we are dealing with continuous
states and Gaussian fluctuations, the variational free-energy gradients become prediction errors.
This can be seen in the above equations where the flow of internal and active states is a function
of various prediction errors. Biophysically, these prediction errors would correspond to the
setpoints of electrochemical variables, such that the particles keep moving when prediction
errors are all zero and each particle has found its variational free-energy minimum.
In order to illustrate the concepts outlined in the previous sections, we constructed two sets of
numerical experiments. These will illustrate, respectively:
• The emergence of a two Markov blanketed systems, which results from the application of
an external field that provides evidence of ensemble membership (ψ ) to a small subset
1,2
of particles.
• The transient and dynamic nature of Markov blanket formation in response to changing
external fields.

4. Results
4.1. The emergence of a neuronal packet
The results of the first series of numerical simulations are presented in Figure 4. In these
simulations, a subpopulation of the individual neurons was stimulated to induce the precise
posterior belief that they were states of one Markov blanketed system at the superordinate level
(ψ ). This was achieved by coupling the selected neurons to an external field, which, as
1,2
described as above, is a metaphor for signals received from neurons in the sensory epithelia of
the organism.
We introduce a stimulus function 𝑓 (𝑥) → ℝ1 that specifies the stimulus intensity as a
𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚
function of phase space position. This function determines the evidence a neuron receives for
being a member of the first ensemble ψ while the inverse of this function 1− 𝑓 (𝑥)
1,2, 𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚
determines the evidence a neuron receives for the alternative ensemble ψ .

Figure 4. The emergence of a neuronal packet.
This figure depicts the first series of numerical results, which demonstrate the emergence of a Markov blanket in
response to external stimulation – or coupling with an external field. (A) A visualisation of individual neurons at
different times during the stimulation. The colour of a neuron represents its beliefs about membership in
19
superordinate Markov blankets, while its location denotes its position in phase space. Black and white represent
distinct Markov blankets; while line colour represents role in the Markovian partition (as internal or blanket states of
the respective blanketed ensemble). At the start of the stimulation, neurons are initialised with uniform beliefs about
their identity. At time step 𝑇 =10, an external stimulus is introduced (described in the main text). The external
stimulation causes neurons to divide into two sets of internal and blanket states, organised around the stimulus. Over
time, shared expectations about what each neuron should sense cause the neurons to divide into internal and blanket
states. The internal states of the first ensemble (A) organise around the stimulus centre, while the blanket states of
this ensemble organise around the edges of the stimulus. Of the remaining neurons, those which are in spatial
proximity to the first ensemble (A), or are at the external boundary of the ensemble, form beliefs that they are
blanket states of the second ensemble (B), while the other neurons form beliefs that they are internal states of that
ensemble. The external stimulation thus induces the formation of two Markov blankets, the internal states of which
are conditionally independent of one another, conditioned on the blanket states. (B) A visualisation of the signals
emitted by neurons, averaged over the ensemble, for each location in phase space. In panels (A) and (B), the two
axes represent the two abstract states of a two-dimensional state space. For simplicity, here, we assume this is a
physical space where the agents move, with real values
ℝ2
. (C) The ensemble-average evidence for each type of
identity as a function of time. D) The stimulus function used in this simulation, where the white denotes the stimulus
intensity.
At the start of the simulation, neurons were initialised with uniform beliefs about their identity.
The stimulus field was then introduced at time step 𝑇 = 10, causing the neurons within this field
to quickly form beliefs that were members of the first superordinate ensemble (𝜓 ).
1,2
Conversely, the remaining neurons formed beliefs that they are members of the second
superordinate ensemble (𝜓 ). Over the course of the simulation, the shared expectations about
3,4
proximity relations 𝐑 caused neurons to converge to either internal (𝜓 ) or blanket (𝜓 )
𝜓 1,4 2,3
states. Specifically, neurons which were not in spatial proximity to states of the opposing higher-
level ensemble formed beliefs that they were internal states, whereas neurons which were in
spatial proximity to both ensembles formed beliefs that they were blanket states. This caused the
first Markov blanket to form around the field introduced by the stimulus function, and the second
Markov blanket to envelope the first. The emergence of this structure meant that when
conditioned on their blanket states 𝜓 , the internal states of the first Markov blanket 𝜓 were
2 1
independent of the states of the second Markov blanket 𝜓 , and vice versa.
3,4
These results may also speak to the role of local field potentials in neural synchronization. The
prior belief that they will synchronise with each other in the absence of stimulation lends to the
individual neurons that make up a neuronal system a kind of coherence, which gives it the look
and feel of a fictitious ‘centripetal’ force. Conversely, when neurons are stimulated by
contradictory driving inputs, they will self-organize into distinct and segregated groups, which
will look like a ‘centrifugal’ force. The group inference that realizes population coding
effectively balances these two opposing tendencies in self-organization.

Figure 5. Dynamic and transient packet formulation
This figure depicts the second series of numerical results, which demonstrate the dynamic nature of Markov blanket
formulation in response to transient external stimulation. (A) A visualisation of individual neurons at different times
during the stimulation. As in the first set of simulations, the neurons are initialised with uniform beliefs and at time
step 𝑇 =10 an external stimulus is introduced (described in the main text). Following the results of the first
simulation, the external field induces the formation of two Markov blanketed systems organised around the stimulus.
At time step 𝑇 =200, the location at which the stimulus is applied is changed. This leads a subpopulation of
neurons to receive evidence that is incompatible with their Bayesian beliefs, causing the dissolution of the original
Markov blanket and the emergence of a new Markov blanket around the changed site of stimulation. These results
demonstrate the dynamic and transient nature of Markov blanket formation when coupled to an external field. (B) A
visualisation of the signals emitted by neurons at different times during the stimulation. Again, in panels (A) and
(B), the two axes represent the two abstract states of a two-dimensional state space. For simplicity, here, we assume
this is a physical space where the agents move, with real values

. (C) The ensemble-average evidence for each
type identity as a function of time. D) The stimulus function used in this simulation. As above, white denotes the
stimulus intensity. Here, the stimulus changes location at 200 time steps.
4.2. Splitting ensembles and multiple ensembles: Towards an account of dynamic, transient
Markov boundary formation
We move on to consider dynamic nature of Markov blanket formation in response to changing
external stimulation. Following the first set of simulations, we initialise neurons with uniform
beliefs about their identity and introduce an external stimulus at 𝑇 = 10. However, we now

transform the external stimulus at 𝑇 = 200. This change in stimulation causes a subpopulation
of neurons to form incompatible beliefs and promotes the reorganisation of the superordinate
ensembles.
The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 5 and 6, which differ only in the stimulus
function used. As with the first set of simulations, these results show the emergence of two
Markov blanketed systems around the initial stimulus. However, the results additionally
demonstrate that once the location of the stimulus changes, the entire ensemble self-organizes
anew. Specifically, a new Markov blanket organises around the location of the new stimulus,
which is a direct result of the evidence provided by the stimulus field. The new blanket forms on
a slower time scale to that of the original, due to the fact that members of this new ensemble
originally believed they were members of the alternative ensemble (𝜓 ). Moreover, since the
3,4
original external field has been removed, the corresponding neurons no longer receive evidence
that they are states of the first ensemble (𝜓 ). Instead, they receive evidence that they are
1,2
members of the opposing ensemble (𝜓 ), leading to the gradual dissolution of the first Markov
3,4
blanket. Taken together, these results demonstrate the dynamic nature of Markov blanket
formation when coupled to a dynamic external field.
22
Figure 6. Dynamic and transient packet formulation (B)
This figure depicts the final series of numerical results, which further demonstrates the dynamic nature of Markov
blanket formation in response to external stimuli. These numerical results utilise a different set of set stimuli relative
to Figure 5. (A) A visualisation of individual neurons at different times during the stimulation. As in the previous
simulations, neurons are initialised with uniform beliefs and at time step 𝑇 =10 an external stimulus is introduced.
This again induces the formation of two Markov blanketed systems organised around the induced stimulus. At time
step 𝑇 =200, the location at which the stimulus is applied is changed, and this again causes the location of Markov
blankets to dynamically reorganise. Unlike in Figure 5, the two stimuli overlap, meaning a subset of the population
receives consistent evidence after the stimulus is changed. These beliefs of these neurons do not change, leading to
faster blanket formation, relative to Figure 5. (B) A visualisation of the signals emitted by neurons at different times
during the stimulation. As above, in panels (A) and (B), the two axes represent the two abstract states of a two-
dimensional state space. For simplicity, here, we assume this is a physical space where the agents move, with real

function used in this simulation. As above, white denotes the stimulus intensity. Here, the stimulus changes location
at 200 time steps.

current neural process theory associated with active inference. The current process theory models
single-neuron activity – which can also simply be equated with activity in populations of neurons
– as more or less uniformly encoding posterior beliefs over states; moreover, it assumes that the
synaptic connection patterns giving rise to the selective stimulus sensitivity of a given neuron (or
population) are formally specified as single entries in a likelihood matrix connecting sensory
epithelia to those neurons. Heuristically, learning in these models is Hebbian, in that synaptic
connections in the likelihood matrix are strengthened based on the strength of the activity of a
neuron (or population), coincident with current observations.
The key points are that – in extant models – no distinction is made between the function of a
single neuron versus a population of neurons encoding posterior beliefs over states, or learning
stimulus sensitivity, and that the activation levels that are modelled are single trajectories of
values. Our results in this paper demonstrate that coherent activity in neural populations can arise
in response to environmental perturbation and allow for population-wide tuning of synaptic
connections during development – such that different populations of neurons could learn
differential sensitivities to different stimulus features. This avoids possible concerns about
modelling ‘grandmother cells’ – and may offer a means of redundant coding that allows a system
to be robust to noise or injury.
On a related note, the formalism used to model the emergence of a selective responses and
specialisation (e.g., receptive fields) – as a free energy minimising process – may resolve
arguments about whether probabilistic representations are represented by the sample density of
population responses; i.e., a population code in the sense of Beck et al. (2008); Pouget, Beck,
Ma, and Latham (2013); Zemel, Dayan, and Pouget (1998) – or whether the population response
encodes the parameters or sufficient statistics of a probabilistic representation; i.e., an ensemble
code. On the present account, the two are the same thing. In other words, the quantity that
matters – in terms of a representational or extrinsic information geometry – is the ensemble
average of a population of neurons that constitute the internal states of a larger Markov blanket.
A subtle, technical point here is that the extrinsic information geometry that undergirds neuronal
representation or encoding rests upon the conditional expectation or average of internal states,
e.g., neurons that are internal to a larger Markov blanket. However, mathematically, this
expectation is over time, not over internal states (Friston, 2020). To endow ensemble averages
with a representational attribute, it then becomes necessary to make the ergodic assumption that
the average over a large number of internal states is the same as the time average. This only
works if the internal states are exchangeable or can be treated as equivalent to each other. This
simple observation means that there may be something quintessential about population codes; in
the sense that they can only be attributes of ensembles, e.g., populations of neurons that play the
role of internal states at a superordinate scale.
This work presented here also demonstrates novel Markov blanket dynamics, opening the door to
the modelling of transient boundary formation and reconfiguration – and dynamics in functional
and effective connectivity – consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting neural reuse
(Anderson, 2014). Some systems have permanent boundaries that endure over time. This is the
case, for instance, when the statistical boundaries of a system coincide with its physical ones, as
in the case of a cell, where the statistical boundary is also hardwired into the physical structure of
24
the system, as a literal barrier (a cell membrane). Other living systems, however, have more
malleable boundaries, which dissolve and reform over time. These are systems like social
systems (Veissière, Constant, Ramstead, Friston, & Kirmayer, 2020) and – arguably – neuronal
packets (Yufik & Friston, 2016). When we wake up in our home, we are part of the intimate
living unit; when we go to the office, we are part of another functional unit; and belonging to
these groups constrains possible courses of action. This is also the case for neural ensembles,
which seem to form and reform on the fly to match task requirements (Anderson, 2014). For
systems such as these, the relevant boundaries are functional precisely because they can change,
as when one individual member moves to another group, when a group splits into two, or when
two groups merge. The boundaries of such neural (or social) systems are intrinsically malleable,
which allows for adaptive reconfigurations of groups and group membership. We propose that
one can associate the changing architecture and membership of superordinate ensembles with
inference dynamics that track different perceptual contents.
Note that fluctuating and itinerant Markov blankets are consistent with non-equilibrium steady-
state, due to a separation of temporal scales that emerges with Markov blankets of Markov
blankets (Friston, 2020). In other words, any Markov blanket will change slowly from the point
of view of Markov blankets at the scale below. For example, the Markov blanket of a city does
not change hour by hour, as you commute from work to home. Similarly, the Markov blanket of
your brain does not change second by second, as neuronal ensembles (i.e., packets or assemblies)
split and merge. The key thing – from the perspective of ensemble dynamics – is that various
(attracting) states are revisited after a sufficient period of time. For example, you return home
every evening. And your functionally specialised neuronal ensembles are activated every few
seconds by characteristic patterns of sensory afferents.
The framework that we develop here has implications that transcend neuronal dynamics. Indeed,
the scheme offers a formal, generalizable account of phenomena that involve the formation of
transient boundaries in nested systems. The ensuing formalism provides a generic and general
mechanism by which coordinated movement in living creatures might act as an effective means
to model or represent the causal situations, environments, and predicaments in which living
creatures find themselves.
Group foraging behaviours, for instance, obey similar principles, where the coordinated patterns
of movement in a direction count as accumulated evidence for specific hypotheses about the
structure of the environment. This is the case, for instance, when ants leave and follow
pheromone trails. In this setup, the more ants that follow a given path, the more evidence each
provides to its conspecifics for the belief that there is something salient (a food item or danger) at
the end of the trail (Jackson, Holcombe, & Ratnieks, 2004).
We suggest that it may be possible to extend the modelling strategy developed above to account
for the ways in which social and cultural group membership functions as a form of inference
about relevant causal structure in the human environment. For instance, political affiliation
seems to track one’s beliefs and attitudes regarding some domains, such as the reality of human-
made climate change. One might speculate that for many human agents, the individual inference
problem (namely, to answer for oneself the question, ‘Do I believe that human-made climate
change is real?’) is solved by outsourcing the process of generating a working guess (computing
25
the posterior) to one’s close social circle, often by figuring out and learning those things believed
and valued in one’s social ingroup (Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017; Ramstead, Veissière, &
Kirmayer, 2016; Veissière et al., 2020).
Another, less politically contentious example is the optimal foraging behaviour in ant colonies
discussed above. Indeed, ant foraging behaviour might be modelled as a kind of group inference,
where each foraging ‘arm’ of the ant population (enshrouded behind its own Markov blanket,
here determined by chemical pheromone gradients ) can be cast as representing a distinct
hypothesis that ‘there is food here’, or that ‘there is a dangerous threat here’, and so on. One
advantage of applying this formalism to such animal models -- instead of human systems -- is
that they are comparatively easier to study, since they are simpler to extensively (and ethically)
measure and since their (relatively less complex) behaviour is easier to model. Work on ant
foraging and on other simple foraging systems, such as the multiple search fronts of foraging
slime mould populations, routinely employs modelling strategies amenable to active inference
(Chandrasekhar, Gordon, & Navlakha, 2018; Reid, Latty, Dussutour, & Beekman, 2012).
Behavioural data regarding the decisions made by those simple systems is equally reproducible
in silico.
Finally, one might be able to extend the above population coding strategy to hierarchically
nested representational capacities. In such a scheme, neuronal packets at the superordinate level
would engage in exactly the same kind of coordinated inferential dynamics, inferring their
membership identity in yet a higher level of self-organization. This could lead from a theory of
neural representation to a theory of conceptual- or semantic-level processing (Yufik, 2019; Yufik
& Friston, 2016) – as opposed to the perceptual processing formally modelled here – where
neuronal packet formation at several nested scales in the brain explains the perception and
multimodal integration of the perception of objects. Indeed, current formulations of
understanding and abstraction rest upon deep generative models with relational structure that
necessarily call upon Markov blankets to separate hierarchical levels; e.g., Friston, Lin, et al.
(2017). The time and context sensitive nature of Markov blankets – considered in this work –
may reflect the context sensitive, state dependent, nonlinear generative models that are necessary
for self-evidencing.
6. Conclusion
The aim of this paper was to develop a generic and generalizable model of the representational
capacities of living creatures by using the resources of the free-energy principle and its corollary
process theory, active inference. We developed an account of neuronal and, more broadly,
phenotypic representation. We argued that the representational capacities of living creatures are a
consequence of their Markovian structure and action in nonequilibrium regimes to counter the
dissipating effects of random fluctuations and environmental itinerancy. We demonstrated in
silico that information about external stimuli can be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a
Markov blanket, thereby providing evidence for the neuronal packet hypothesis that inherits
from theories of neuronal groups and assemblies (Buzsaki, 2010; Edelman, 1993; Edelman,
1998; Hebb, 1949; von der Malsburg, 1981). Our numerical proof-of-principle simulations
showed that self-organizing ensembles of particles that share the right kind of probabilistic
26
generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a changing sensorium – and
that they can dynamically evince patterns of functional self-organization that adapt to the
demands of the situation. This model of neuronal packet formation thus entails a modest form of
representational capacity and opens up important directions for future work.
