Keywords: Sodium-ion batteries, lithium-ion batteries, performance, industrial developments
Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries represent an interesting and emerging alternative to the currently prominent 
lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. They operate on the same “rocking chair” principle, in which shuttle ions 
(sodium ions, in this instance) move reversibly between the positive and negative electrodes, inserting 
themselves into one of these and de-inserting themselves from the counter electrode. Historically, Na-ion 
and Li-ion batteries emerged in parallel in the 1970s; however, the spotlight shifted to lithium considerably 
in the 1980s, leading to the commercialization of Li-ion batteries by Sony in 1991 and the subsequent 
emergence of a number of Li-ion battery subclasses [including the lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium 
managanese oxide (LMO), nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA), nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium 
iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries]. Sodium-ion batteries returned to the research community’s 
attention in the 2000s and 2010s decades due to concerns about the limited reserves of lithium and, 
subsequently, cobalt precursors. The research in this area flourished and a significant number of papers 
(hundreds) were published per year[1,2]. The research in this area generated significant excitement, with 
some contributors expecting sodium-ion batteries to be an equal or even superior alternative to Li-ion 
technology.

A significant body of research and a degree of excitement is often followed by commercial efforts. Indeed, a 
number of emerging industry players can be identified at the moment in the sodium-ion battery space, 
including Faradion, Tiamat and Novosis, to name a few. Practical prototypes of the batteries appear, and 
their metrics and the expected performance may be quantified with reasonable certainty levels. Experts in 
the field can then analyze the available information and provide analytical commentaries able to define the 
expected performance envelopes, strengths and limitations of the emerging technology. Two such 
contributions have been recently published in the peer-reviewed literature, in the form of a viewpoint from 
Prof. Abraham[3] and a commentary from Prof. Tarascon[4]. Both contributors are well-known expert 
researchers in the field. Prof. Abraham has contributed to the development of lithium, Li-ion and Li-air 
batteries, and served on the editorial board of Journal of Power Sources and as a Chair of the Battery 
Division of the Electrochemical Society. Prof. Tarascon[4] is a creator of the European Network of Excellence 
ALISTORE-ERI and the French Network on Electrochemical Energy Storage (RS2E), and a strong research 
participant in the field of Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. It is interesting to compare and discuss their two 
opinions in the context of Na-ion batteries, as one of the expert commentators (Prof. Abraham) can be 
regarded as an outsider in the field, while the second expert commentator (Prof. Tarascon) is a clear insider, 
who significantly contributed to the sodium-based technology research and is also a shareholder and 
development committee member in one of the emerging Na-ion battery companies, Faradion.
Both commentators comment on the choice of materials that enable Na-ion batteries. Hard carbon is 
highlighted as the preferred material for negative electrodes (anodes) of these batteries. This type of carbon 
is made up of disordered graphene layers and nanopores and has a typical sloping voltage region followed 
by a plateau. Usually, optimal samples of hard carbon have reversible capacities of ~250 mAh/g, which 
corresponds to the formation of Na0.67C6[3]. The incorporation of sodium into hard carbon is usually 
described in terms of a combination of its insertion between the disordered carbon layers and the filling of 
nanopores present in the carbon host. Other negative electrode materials, such as Na2Ti3O7, Na3Ti2(PO4)3 
and materials that alloy with Na, have also been described; however, hard carbon remains the truly 
dominant negative electrode material and is used in the vast majority of practical prototypes[3,4].
The choice of cathode materials is less singular and well defined. During the research activities on Na-ion 
batteries, three main cathode material types have emerged, including layered sodium transition metal 
oxides, typical for batteries produced by one of the industry pioneers Faradion, sodium vanadium 
fluorophosphate Na3V2(PO4)2F3 used in practical battery prototypes by Tiamat and Prussian blue analogues 
such as Na2-δMnFe(CN)6 •yH2O, adopted in batteries developed by Novosis[3,4]. These positive electrode 
materials have distinctly different capacities and average voltages (up to 150 mAh/g with varied average 
voltages, depending on the materials, for sodium layered oxides; 128-135 mAh/g and 3.8-3.9 V for 
Na3V2(PO4)2F3; 80-160 mAh/g and 3-3.5 V for Prussian blue analogues) and enable three main types of 
commercial cells adopted by the industry.
Electrolytes in Na-ion batteries are a variation of an appropriate salt [NaPF6, NaN(SO2CF3)2 or NaClO4)] 
and mixed organic carbonate solvents chosen from ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), 
propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In order to enable 
better stability in the cell, electrolyte additives may be used, which include, most commonly, fluoroethylene 
carbonate (FEC) and sometimes other additives such as bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE). An 
important point is that an electrolyte formulation cannot be simply copied from somewhat analogous Li-ion 
batteries and need to be tailored for a particular combination of electrodes in a Na-ion cell[3,4].

6An
 important consideration in Na-ion batteries is the possibility of avoiding the use of copper current
collectors in the negative electrodes and aluminium can be used instead as a cheaper alternative. This is
related to the lack of parasitic alloying of sodium with aluminum, which is, unfortunately, a problem that
exists for lithium in Li-ion cells.
In his viewpoint published in ACS Energy Letters, Abraham raises a question on how comparable Na-ion
batteries are to their Li-ion counterparts [3]. This is discussed through the consideration of actual and
hypothetical batteries assembled in the format of 18650 cells and the analysis of their specific energies
(Wh/kg) and energy densities (Wh/L). Li-ion batteries [graphite - LiCoO 2 (3.7 V, 206 Wh/kg, 530 Wh/L),
graphite - LiNi 0.33Mn0.33 Co0.33 O2 (3.6 V, 210 Wh/kg, 530 Wh/L), graphite - LiNi 0.8Co0.15 Al0.05 O2 (3.6 V,
285 Wh/kg, 785 Wh/L), graphite - LiFePO 4 (3.4 V, 126 Wh/kg, 325 Wh/L) and graphite - LiMn 2O4 (3.8 V,
132 Wh/kg, 340 Wh/L)] are used as established benchmarks. In turn, three Na-ion battery prototypes are
considered - a commercial Na-ion battery prototype from CNRS CEA (90 Wh/kg and estimated 250 Wh/L),
a Na-ion battery prototype from the joint work of Washington State University and Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory utilising an O3-type layered oxide NaNi 0.68Mn0.22Co0.10O2 (2.7 V, 150 Wh/kg, 375 Wh/L)
and a Na3V2(PO4)2F3-based Na-ion cell built by European research centre ALISTORE (3.5 V, 75 Wh/kg). It
should be noted that the specific energy of the latter cell is likely underestimated in Abraham’s
consideration, as a value of energy at a high 1C rate is taken into account.
Considering the above values, it is concluded in Abraham’s viewpoint that Na-ion cells are not comparable
to high-energy Li-ion batteries such as those with LiCoO 2 (LCO), LiNi 0.33Mn0.33 Co0.33 O2 (NMC) or
LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode chemistries[3]. However, some of the emerging Na-ion batteries may have
specific energies and energy densities close to those of Li-ion cells with LiFePO 4 (LFP) cathode chemistry. It
may be therefore expected that similar applications (e.g., electric vehicles with short range, power backup or
energy storage systems used with localised renewable energy generators) may be envisaged for Na-ion
batteries. Moderate energy contents per mass or volume in Na-ion batteries may be traced to the behaviour
of many cathode materials; it is commonly observed that Na-containing cathode candidates have a reduced
capacity and a smaller average operating voltage than their lithium counterparts. As an example, the voltage
- capacity profiles for Na 1-xCoO2 and Li1-xCoO2 may be compared [ Figure 1][1]. Concluding his assessment,
Abraham also envisages that some cost reduction may be possible in Na-ion batteries (10%-20% cheaper
than their Li-ion counterparts) in the long term and cites the sustainability (Li- and Co-free nature) as the
major advantage of these new batteries. He also emphasises that their energy densities are much superior to
those offered by old-school battery types in the form of lead-acid, nickel-cadmium and nickel - metal
hydride cells[3].
Similarly, the commentary by Tarascon is concerned with distinguishing between the hype associated with
the earlier development of Na-ion batteries and reality [4]. His discussion is based on the cells publicized by
three start-up companies in this space, Faradion (layered oxide cathode chemistry) Tiamat (Na 3V2(PO4)2F3
cathode chemistry) and Novosis (using Prussian blue analogue as a cathode). These cells are compared with
graphite - LiFePO 4 batteries and, importantly, with Toshiba’s Super Charge Ion Battery (SCIB) cells. The
latter benchmark is new in our discussion (not considered previously in Abraham’s viewpoint [3]) and is very
interesting as these batteries represent another category of Li-ion cells - specialised low energy, high power
batteries. A spider diagram [ Figure 2 ] represents a comparison of various parameters of the cells under
consideration[4]. One minor criticism addressed to Figure 2 may be the specific energy and energy density of
LFP cells, which seems lower than the usually publicized data. In the opinion of the author of this Research
Highlight, higher values should have been used for the LFP cells in the benchmarking exercise.

It is highlighted that polyanionic materials may have a higher importance in Na-ion batteries[4]. In Li-ion 
batteries, the layered oxides are usually dominant, except for the specific cases of LiFePO4 or spinel 
LiMn2O4. Despite a high abundance of sodium layered oxides, their advantages are less pronounced due to 
the typically reduced (lower) potentials of their electrochemical reactivity (an observation similar to that by 
Abraham[3]) with respect to those of similar compounds in lithium-based cells. At the same time, a better 
diffusion of a shuttle ion (Na+ instead of Li+) is expected in polyanionic materials in Na-ion batteries, and air 
processing (instead of dry room processing) may be applied to these materials[4]. Tarascon highlights that 
Tiamat’s 18650 cells (Na3V2(PO4)2F3-based) can deliver a specific energy of 122 Wh/kg at 1C (a higher value 
that quoted by Abraham) vs. 150 Wh/kg for the Faradion’s pouch cells employing an O3 or O3-P2 
intermixed (inter-grown) NaNi(1-x-y-z)MnxMgyTizO2 layered phases at C/3 (much slower) rate. The quoted 
specific energies of these cells are clearly much lower than those of comparable Li-ion cells with layered

6
oxide cathodes (higher than 250 Wh/kg). Thus, Tarascon reaches the same conclusion as in the previous 
viewpoint: Na-ion batteries are clearly inferior in terms of their energy densities (or specific power) to some 
of the more energy-dense Li-ion batteries but may be comparable to some of the more specialised long 
stability or high power Li-ion battery cells such as graphite - LiFePO4 or Toshiba’s SCIB cells[4].
Another possible Na-ion battery chemistry based on the use of Prussian blue analogues (technology trialed 
commercially, for example, by Novosis) is also mentioned briefly in the assessment by Tarascon[4]. However, 
the cell-level metrics are not provided, and the discussion is brief. It is mentioned that the morphology and 
moisture content control may represent challenges for this cathode chemistry, and the energy density (in 
Wh/L) may be on the lower side for such cells due to the low density of the cathode material.
As a researcher with first-hand knowledge of the commercialisation effort in Na-ion batteries, Tarascon 
provides extra remarks on the specific advantages of these new cells not directly considered in the viewpoint 
by Abraham[4]. One of such remarks concerns the extra safety of Na-ion batteries. This characteristic 
originates from the fact that, unlike Li-ion batteries, their sodium counterparts can be shorted by 
connecting the opposite battery terminals without an irreversible consequence for the battery performance. 
As a result of this very practical property, the transportation and storage of Na-ion batteries is much easier. 
In the case of Li-ion batteries, they need to be treated as dangerous goods, with special safety measures 
linked to their inherent flammability and ability to explode. In contrast, for the batteries that can be 
temporarily shorted, the requirements for transportation and storage in the discharged state are much 
softer, favouring the adaptation of Na-ion cells in practice[4].
One of the considerably advantageous attributes of Na-ion cells that Tarascon envisages in his commentary 
is their capability of fast charge and performing as high power cells, particularly in the Tiamat’s cells with 
vanadium fluorophosphate chemistry. Their specific power compares favourably with LFP-type Li-ion 
batteries while offering, according to the author, better cost in terms of €/kWh or €/kW. The fast charge 
ability is also not dissimilar to Toshiba’s SCIB cells. While this property is somewhat inferior in Tiamat’s 
Na-ion cells, they offer an advantage of a higher voltage (3.7 V vs. 2.7 V) and better specific energy and 
energy density parameters than those of SCIB batteries. The commentator envisages that sodium-based cells 
may find applications in “power-hungry functions”, including regenerative braking and fast-charging public 
transport[4].
In conclusion, both expert commentators assessed the expected performance, advantages and applications 
of Na-ion batteries. It is highlighted that Na-ion cells are unlikely to be a true replacement for Li-ion 
batteries in all applications. This is linked to their relatively limited energy density with respect to that 
achievable by Li-ion batteries with layered cathodes (in LCO, NMC and NCA chemistries). Instead, Na-ion 
batteries (pioneered commercially by Faradion and Tiamat and also those assessed by the researchers from 
Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) with specific energies at the level 
of 120-150 Wh/kg are more comparable to LFP Li-ion batteries or specialised fast-charge SCIB batteries 
marketed by Toshiba. Specific advantages of Na-ion batteries include their excellent sustainability (the lack 
of critical elements such as lithium and cobalt), increased safety (an ability to be shorted during storage and 
transportation) and excellent fast charge capabilities and power densities for the Na3V2(PO4)2F3-based cells. 
Possible applications for Na-ion batteries include regenerative breaking and other “power-hungry 
functions” such as fast-charging e-buses, and the uses where LFP Li-ion batteries could have been otherwise 
considered (electric vehicles with short range, power backup or energy storage systems used with localised 
renewable energy generators).

This Research Highlight lags behind the two original commentaries by approximately two years. Therefore, 
it is interesting to reflect on what has changed since those were published. The notable developments 
include a larger number of start-ups and established commercial companies venturing in the space of 
Na-ion batteries. In addition to Faradion[5], Tiamat[6] and Novosis already discussed, Na-ion cells are being 
worked on by HiNa Battery (layered oxide chemistry)[7], Altris and Natron Energy (Prussian blue 
analogues)[8,9]. It is interesting to note that the realisation that Na-ion cells can be subdivided into different 
classes, for example, “higher energy content” cells and “high power cells”, firms up. In particular, Tiamat 
aims to add “higher energy content cells” as a separate product to their more established fast-charge 
batteries under development. Finally, it is newsworthy to highlight the direct participation of a major 
battery company in this space; China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) has 
joined the ranks of emerging Na-ion battery manufacturers in 2021[10]. The commercialisation of Na-ion 
batteries is clearly in full swing, and it will be very interesting to follow up with further developments.
