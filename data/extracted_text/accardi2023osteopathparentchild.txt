Background: Enactivism and active inference are two important concepts in the 
field of osteopathy. While enactivism emphasizes the role of the body and the 
environment in shaping our experiences and understanding of the world, active 
inference emphasizes the role of action and perception in shaping our experiences 
and understanding of the world. Together, these frameworks provide a unique 
perspective on the practice of osteopathy, and how it can be used to facilitate positive 
change in patients. Since the neonatal period is a crucial time for development, 
osteopaths should aim to create a therapeutic relationship. Arguably, through 
participatory sense-making, osteopaths can help the baby build a generative model 
(with positive priors) to deal with stress and needs throughout their life.
Aim: Since the literature considers that interactions with the environment, 
which enact the patients’ experiences, depending on contextual factors and 
communication between patient and caregiver, this research explored whether 
there is a correspondence between the indications in the literature and clinical 
practice in the management of the mother/parent–child dyad during osteopathic 
care on children aged 0 to 2  years old.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive 
sample of nine osteopaths with experience in the field of pediatrics. Interviews 
were transcribed verbatim, and constructivist grounded theory was used to 
conceptualize, collect and analyze data. Codes and categories were actively 
constructed through an interpretive/constructionist paradigm.
Results: The core category was the idea of the pediatric osteopath as a support 
for the family, not only for the child. Four additional categories were identified: (1) 
Preparing a safe environment for both children and parents, (2) Communication, 
(3) Attachment and synchrony, and (4) Synchronization.
Conclusion: Through participatory sense-making, osteopaths manage contextual 
factors to establish an effective therapeutic alliance through the osteopath-
parent–child triad to facilitate the construction of the child’s internal generative 
model to promote healthy development. The therapeutic encounter is considered 
an encounter between embodied subjects, occurring within a field of affordances 
(ecological niche) that allows the interlocutors to actively participate in creating 
new meanings through interpersonal synchronization. Participatory sense-
making and the establishment of a therapeutic alliance through the osteopath-
parent–child triad are crucial to promote healthy development in the child.

1. Introduction
Enactivism challenges the conventional division of mind and 
world, emphasizing the interdependent nature of organisms and their 
environment. As individuals navigate through life, their interactions 
with other people shape their perceptual experiences, which are 
constructed based on prior beliefs or “priors” that form internal 
generative models and minimize prediction errors (Gallagher, 2005; 
Sørvoll et al., 2022). Sense-making, defined as an autonomous system’s 
ability to adaptively regulate its operations and establish a mutually 
influential relationship with the environment, plays a vital role in 
maintaining viability as a form of life (Di Paolo, 2020). Being a sense-
maker entails selectively acting on the affordances offered by the 
environment, crucial for understanding the sense of agency (Segundo-
Ortin, 2020).
Osteopathy is a person-centered healthcare discipline that 
recognizes the intricate interplay between the body’s structure, 
function, and self-regulatory mechanisms. It takes a comprehensive 
approach to health and well-being, considering the entirety of the 
individual (European Standards EN 16686, 2015 ). It is therefore 
important to go beyond perceiving osteopathy solely as a body-
centered intervention based on aetiological models of care (Esteves 
et  al., 2020 ). Human functioning is complex, unique to each 
individual, and unpredictable. In this regard, embracing the ecological 
niche becomes crucial. Within the patient-practitioner dyad, a 
multitude of affordances are provided, allowing for adaptations and 
the restoration of productive agency. This process is facilitated by the 
active engagement of both parties involved (Ramstead et al., 2019).
Enactive theory interprets organisms as co-emerging and 
co-determining entities within their (social) environment. Even at the 
earliest stages of development, basic perception and action emerge, 
fostering active, bidirectional co-regulation referred to as 
“co-embodiment” and “co-homeostasis” between the developing fetus 
and its surrounding womb (Zieber et al., 2015; Ciaunica et al., 2021a).
The fetus interacts with its environment, adapting its generative 
model based on the mother’s own ( Ciaunica et  al., 2021b ). This 
intriguing interplay underscores the dynamic nature of fetal 
development. Moreover, biological self-organization in humans 
encompasses a remarkable array of processes, ranging from 
developmental milestones to metabolic intricacies, immunity 
mechanisms, and the orchestration of endocrine functions (Koban 
et al., 2021 ). Such intricate self-organization reflects the profound 
interconnectedness of our physiological systems.
In light of these insights, the maternal role emerges as a key 
influencer in shaping the developing child’s physiological landscape. 
Maternal behaviors trigger endocrine and metabolic responses in the 
unborn child, potentially contributing to the formation of “priors, ” or 
anticipatory expectations, regarding the external world. Intriguingly, 
maternal engagement practices, such as tactile stimulation of infants’ 
bellies, might establish an environment conducive to heightened 
sensitivity to touch and tactile interactions in newborns ( Ciaunica 
et al., 2023). This maternal influence on sensory predispositions could 
lay the groundwork for how infants perceive and respond to 
their surroundings.
Considering these intriguing foundations, a captivating question 
emerges: Could these “priors” regarding tactile stimuli also render 
newborns more receptive to hands-on osteopathic interventions? The 
notion of “priors” extends beyond the realm of sensory perception and 
has the potential to influence how infants process and respond to 
external stimuli, including therapeutic touch. By delving into the 
intricate interplay among prenatal maternal influences, sensory 
development, and the potential implications for osteopathic 
interventions, we  could open the door to a captivating avenue 
of investigation.
As we delve into the multifaceted connections between maternal 
interactions, sensory sensitivities, and osteopathic interventions, it 
becomes evident that the journey of discovery holds promise for 
enhancing our understanding of both prenatal influences and 
postnatal therapeutic possibilities. The intricate web of interactions, 
as illuminated by recent research, encourages us to envision a holistic 
approach that acknowledges the prenatal origins of sensory 
propensities and their potential implications for osteopathic care.
Arguably, the interplay between maternal behaviors, fetal 
development, and sensory priors represents an exciting frontier of 
investigation. This nexus between prenatal influences and postnatal 
responses underscores the nuanced ways in which early experiences 
shape our perceptual world. By exploring these relationships, we not 
only deepen our appreciation for the complexities of human 
development but also lay the groundwork for innovative approaches 
to healthcare, such as osteopathic interventions.
Bowlby’s attachment theory elucidates the formation of 
attachment between an infant and their caregiver during the initial 
2 years of life, with profound implications for long-term development 
(Zimmermann and Iwanski, 2019). Adverse prenatal and childhood 
environments are causally linked to the risk of chronic illness in 
adulthood (Mauder and Hunter, 2008). Attachment experiences and 
the expression of internal operating patterns contribute to illness 
behavior, somatization, and hypochondria. Infants often exhibit 
comorbidities associated with prematurity, birth complications, 
maternal stress, and perinatal stress (Tribe et al., 2018; Lobmaier et al., 
2020). The early years are marked by high brain plasticity, which 
amplifies vulnerability to stressors but also presents an opportunity 
for resilience when appropriate support and interventions are in place. 
Recent research indicates that maternal care can epigenetically 
influence the offspring by inducing lasting changes in the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, increasing the expression of 
glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, and influencing 
sensitivity to bodily feedback during stressful situations (Meaney and 
Szyf, 2005; Mariani Wigley et al., 2021). Studies involving preterm 
infants in intensive care units reveal that maternal contact and 
breastfeeding contribute to neurological protection and proper brain 
development (Park and Kim, 2019).
The infant and toddler years constitute a critical period for the 
development of the child’s minimal self, feelings of security, self-
esteem, and self-affirmation ( Dieguez and Lopez, 2017 ). The 
concept of the minimal self arises from the dynamic integration of 
various sensory inputs from the body and the environment, 
including visual, tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular, auditory, 
olfactory, and visceral signals. Both spatial and social factors shape 
the interaction between the self and others’ bodies ( Brugger and 
Lenggenhager, 2014 ; Dieguez and Lopez, 2017 ). The sense of 
ownership relates to the state of one’s body, while the sense of 
participation/action involves intention and the execution of actions. 
These interconnected perceptual systems contribute to the infant’s 
consciousness, forming an “embodied self ” rooted in bodily 
experiences that emerges shortly after birth and continues to 
Accardi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253355
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
develop and function throughout childhood and beyond 
(Gallagher, 2005).
When examining the concept of human selfhood, the immediate 
and fundamental environment for a developing self-organizing 
human organism is another biological self-organizing system, 
specifically the mother’s body (Ciaunica et al., 2021b). It can be argued 
that the way in which the mother or father interact with the mother’s 
belly during pregnancy, or whether the mother receives osteopathic 
treatment, can influence the child’s experience of touch. Considering 
the available evidence on touch during early stages of development, 
which indicates its potential to attenuate brain activity evoked by 
noxious stimuli during painful procedures, decrease heart rate (HR), 
increase oxygen saturation (SpO2), promote respiratory sinus 
arrhythmia (an indicator of vagal tone), and reduce crying time 
(Manzotti et al., 2020 ), we can hypothesize that the type of touch 
experienced during the prenatal period may predict how touch is 
perceived after birth and the potential positive effects of osteopathic 
manipulative treatment.
The enactivist paradigm underscores an osteopath’s multifaceted 
role that extends beyond mere treatment to encompass active support 
and profound understanding of the patient’s unique illness 
experiences. This holistic approach involves the cultivation of fresh 
narratives that center on the patient’s altered physical capacities, 
evolving identity, their intricate connection with the internal and 
external milieu, and the acquisition of essential life skills ( Esteves 
et al., 2020, 2022). In this light, therapeutic interventions are urged to 
align with a contemporary multidimensional model of care that 
interweaves insights from both neurophysiology and psychology, all 
while fostering active patient engagement (Esteves et al., 2022).
Clinically speaking, any healthcare intervention is an intricate 
fusion of two pivotal factors: (I) the intervention’s intrinsic biological 
components and (II) its surrounding contextual and psycho-social 
facets (Benedetti, 2013; Rossettini and Testa, 2018). The recognition 
of contextual factors has emerged as a significant discourse, 
characterizing elements that exist external to the treatment itself, such 
as the administered therapy (e.g., osteopathic care). These contextual 
factors wield the power to amplify therapeutic outcomes, particularly 
in the realm of managing musculoskeletal disorders ( Palese 
et al., 2019).
Since the literature considers that interactions with the 
environment enact patients’ experiences, dependent on contextual 
factors and communication between the patient and caregiver, this 
research explores whether there is a correspondence between the 
literature’s indications and clinical practices in managing the mother/
parent–child dyad during osteopathic care for children aged 0 to 
2 years old.
2. Methods
This qualitative study, employing a “grounded theory” approach, 
delved into the realm of clinical practice with a keen focus on social 
processes, actions, and the dynamic interplay of interactions (Thong 
et al., 2007). By adopting an interpretive/constructivist paradigm, the 
study aimed to illuminate the contextual tapestry that envelops the 
subject matter and to intricately decipher the diverse perspectives 
encapsulated within the narratives of the interviewed osteopaths 
(Thomson et  al., 2014). The choice of this research approach was 
meticulously considered, as it resonated as a more fitting avenue for 
this inquiry in comparison to alternative methodologies. This 
selection was predicated on our intention to garner a comprehensive 
understanding of the osteopaths’ viewpoints on the subject, thereby 
discerning whether there exists a harmonious alignment between the 
realm of research and the nuanced realm of clinical practice. Ethical 
approval was obtained from the Malta ICOM Educational Research 
Ethics Committee, ensuring ethical compliance throughout the study.
2.1. Sample selection and recruitment
Strategic sampling, also known as purposeful sampling, was 
employed to ensure a targeted and comprehensive understanding of 
the phenomenon under analysis (Lunghi et al., 2021). The sample size 
was determined based on data saturation, where no new information 
emerged from the interviews (Thomson et al., 2014). Additionally, the 
concept of “information power” was considered, taking into account 
factors such as the study’s aim, sample specificity, established theory, 
quality of dialog during interviews, and analysis strategy (Malterud 
et al., 2016).
Ten experienced osteopaths were contacted via email, providing 
detailed information about the study’s purpose and methodology, as 
well as the participants’ role, and inviting their interest in participating 
in the interviews. They were contacted by one of the researchers (not 
the interviewer) who maintains a professional relationship with some 
of them. Informed consent, including permission for the use of 
personal data and audio recording of the interviews, was obtained and 
signed by all participants before the interviews. Nine osteopaths were 
enrolled in the study, with a balanced gender distribution of five men 
and four women, encompassing a diverse range of nationalities: 
specifically, two Canadians, one German, one Spanish, and five 
Italians. The participants’ ages exhibited a mean value of 47.5 years, 
with a standard deviation of 10.7. Furthermore, the average number 
of years since their graduation was 17.5 years, with a standard 
deviation of 8.8 years. The interviews were conducted in English with 
the first four participants and in Italian with the remaining five.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The recruitment process involved selecting experienced pediatric 
osteopaths who had been practising for a minimum of 5 years and 
held a master’s or postgraduate qualification in pediatrics, specializing 
in working with children aged 0 to 2 years. Exclusion criteria 
comprised pediatric osteopaths with less than 5 years of experience, 
lacking a master’s degree in pediatrics, or not having completed a 
postgraduate course in pediatrics and not English or Italian speakers 
(Thomson et al., 2014). Additionally, participants who possessed a 
personal relationship—neither a friendship nor a work relationship—
with the first author, who conducted the interviews, were also 
excluded from the study.
2.3. Data collection
Data collection involved conducting semi-structured interviews 
that incorporated elements of grounded theory. The researcher 
Accardi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253355
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
endeavored to establish a purposeful and welcoming environment, 
maintaining a neutral and nonjudgmental stance to foster participants’ 
freedom in expressing their perspectives on the topic at hand (Lunghi 
et  al., 2021). The interviews were designed to facilitate inductive, 
in-depth, discursive, and profound conversations with the participants.
To ensure the appropriateness and effectiveness of the interview 
questions and prompts, a rigorous process was followed. Two 
researchers with expertise in osteopathic clinical practice and research 
methodology reviewed the initial interview draft. Throughout the 
project, modifications were made to refine and adapt the questions 
based on the emerging themes raised by the interviewees (Figure 1).
Interviews were carried out via either FaceTime or telephone calls, 
enabling remote communication, and were conducted in either Italian 
or English. The primary researcher took detailed notes on participants’ 
comments during the interviews to aid in subsequent category 
formation and maintain adherence to the data. Additionally, each 
interview was recorded to facilitate transcription and data analysis. To 
ensure credibility, participants were given the opportunity to review 
their transcripts for accuracy and provide comments (member checking).
The interviews were scheduled with participants, with each 
session lasting between 30 and 60 min. Prior to each interview, 
participants were provided with an informed consent form that clearly 
outlined the study’s characteristics and the use of personal data. 
Throughout the study, participants’ anonymity was safeguarded and 
upheld. The transcripts of the interviews can be viewed on the Open 
Science “The osteopath-parent-child triad in osteopathic care” .
2.4. Quality criteria
The methodology and research process of the study were evaluated 
for quality using the criteria established by Thomson et al. (2014) and 
the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) 
checklist proposed by Thong et al. (2007). To ensure trustworthiness in 
the study, a set of quality criteria was employed, which included 
elements of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability 
(Vaismoradi et al., 2013; Cerritelli and Lanaro, 2018). The study was 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2013).
2.5. Data analysis
To ensure the transferability of the data, a comprehensive analysis 
process incorporating both inductive and deductive approaches was 
employed to create a thematic map that captured the context and 
integrated both manifest and latent contents of the data (Vaismoradi 
et al., 2013).
Memo-writing (Figure 2) was utilized as a tool by the researchers 
to compare data, facilitating initial analytical understanding and later 
theoretical exploration, as well as to examine the relationships between 
categories and concepts. These memos also served as reflective tools 
(Thomson et al., 2014). Constant comparison of the data enabled the 
identification of similarities and differences (Lunghi et al., 2021). Initial 
coding was conducted by analyzing the data line by line, followed by 
focused coding to evaluate the most significant codes (Thomson et al., 
2014). Subsequently, a “central category” was selected to encompass and 
explain the entire grounded theory (Thomson et al., 2014). The process 
continued with ongoing comparative analysis of data and categories 
until “theoretical saturation” was reached (Thomson et al., 2014).
To enhance transferability and ensure reliability of the obtained data, 
two interviews were reanalyzed by another qualitative researcher, in 
addition to the first author reanalyzing two interviews. Additionally, two 
participants were re-interviewed at the end of all nine interviews to gain 
a deeper understanding and clarification of their responses. Furthermore, 
an audit logbook, referred to as verification trials or audit trial, was 
maintained to ensure dependability and confirmability by documenting 
the research process, data collection, and theory generation.
3. Results
The nine osteopaths who participated in the research will 
be identified by numbering from N1 to N9 to ensure their privacy. 
FIGURE 1

Data saturation was reached after the first seven interviews. 
Interviews with N8 and N9 were used to confirm data saturation, 
and two re-interviews were conducted with N2 and N3 to enhance 
data reliability.
3.1. Categories
The core concept that encompasses the entire theory put forth 
in this research is the participants’ perception of themselves as not 
only clinicians treating the baby but also as clinicians providing 
support to the entire family ( Figure 3 ). From the interviews, four 
main themes or categories emerged, each consisting of sub-themes 
or subcategories that form the foundation of the theory proposed 
in this research. These four categories represent sequential steps in 
a hypothetical model for conducting a pediatric visit in osteopathy, 
with a particular emphasis on the contextual factors influencing 
the treatment process:
 1. Creating a safe environment for children and parents.
 2. Communicating.
 3. Looking for attachment and synchrony.
 4. Synchronizing.
3.2. Theme 1: creating a safe environment 
for children and parents
The osteopathic visit is a therapeutic interaction that occurs 
within a designated space, influenced by the room and the osteopath. 
According to the interviews, the practitioner’s objective is to create a 
welcoming environment where participants feel comfortable 
expressing themselves, reassured, and free from judgment (Figure 4). 
Interviewees commonly believe that the office should exude warmth 
and hospitality, achieved through elements such as warm colors, soft  
lighting, and soothing sounds. It is important to avoid overstimulating 
children to prevent irritation (Figure 5). Participants also mentioned 
the use of toys on the floor to engage children as active participants in 
the environment (Figure 6).
Osteopaths place great emphasis on self-awareness to establish a 
connection with their patients. Many engage in practices like 
meditation, undergo psychotherapeutic training, and develop 
extensive knowledge and skills in pediatrics and communication 
(Figure 7). Building trust with parents is facilitated by demonstrating 
up-to-date scientific knowledge and confidence in their expertise. 
Being a pediatric osteopath requires not only manual dexterity but 
also a strong understanding of pathophysiology and in-depth 
knowledge of neurobehavioral development (Figure 8).

3.3. Theme 2: communicating
Investing time in creating a therapeutic alliance based on empathy 
and collaboration is essential, with acknowledgement of each 
participant in the therapeutic encounter ( Figure  9 ). Effective 
communication with parents entails demonstrating empathy, 
calmness, and a desire to understand their feelings and experiences 
with their child ( Figures  10, 11). Sharing achievable goals and 
collaborating with other professionals, such as pediatricians and 
midwives, contributes to a strong therapeutic alliance (Figure 12).
Establishing a rapport with the child involves engaging with 
them on an equal level, often by initiating interaction on the floor 
through play or approaching them while in their parents’ arms. Eye 
contact is highlighted as a crucial form of communication, 
considering the child’s abilities and development. The osteopath 
should initiate contact with a gentle touch, starting from less 
sensitive areas and gradually moving toward more central and 
sensitive regions ( Figure 13 ).
3.4. Theme 3: looking for attachment and 
synchrony
Participants universally recognize the significance of the 
parent–child connection and synchronicity, as it provides insights 
into the attachment pattern and its impact on both parties 
(Figure 14 ). During the visit, natural behavior from parents and 
the child is encouraged, as it facilitates the observation of 
attachment and interaction dynamics that may contribute to the 
child’s symptoms. Noticing any mismatched rhythms, hurried 
approaches, or signs of stress or agitation in the parent’s handling 
of the child is crucial ( Figure 15 ).
3.5. Theme 4: synchronizing
Participants value involving parents in the visit, encouraging them 
to sit around the treatment table to maintain eye and touch contact 
with the baby. Parental involvement can include gentle touching, 
movement, or nursing, always in a relaxed manner. If parent 
participation causes concern for the baby, osteopaths prefer to handle 
the baby themselves (Figure 16).
In cases where approaching the child is challenging or when the 
parent’s state strongly influences the symptoms, treating parents and 
children together or suggesting separate treatment sessions may 
be beneficial. Encouraging parents to slow down their breathing and 
connect with their own body signals can aid in understanding the 
child’s cues. Osteopaths can involve parents in their child’s health 
process, highlighting their parenting skills and teaching them 
reproducible techniques for home use, such as gentle touch and skin-
to-skin contact (Figures 17, 18). This approach facilitates a holistic 
adjustment for both parent and child.
4. Discussion
This study explores the contextual factors of osteopathic pediatric 
care, emphasizing the therapeutic ability, intersubjectivity, and 
interactions among osteopaths, children, and parents. The child’s 
development and engagement with the world are deeply intertwined 
with their relationship and attachment to their caregivers. The triad of 
osteopath-caregiver-child creates a therapeutic ecological niche that 
influences the outcomes of care.
Interviewees emphasize the role of embodied mind in actions, 
interactions, meaning-making, and sense-making during the 
therapeutic encounter, shaping the creation of a positive therapeutic 
FIGURE 8

Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
ecological niche. Therapeutic interventions, guided by an enactivist 
perspective, facilitate insight into patients’ feelings and dominant 
patterns of sense-making (Esteves et al., 2020). The clinical encounter 
offers opportunities to identify and modify inflexible or ineffective 
interaction patterns, enabling participatory sense-making (Esteves et al., 
2020). While osteopathic care employs both “hands-on” and “hands-off ” 
approaches, our research specifically examines the “hands-off ” factors 
in pediatric osteopathic care. Figures 19, 20 provide an overview of this 
study’s conceptual framework.
4.1. Theme 1 – create a safe environment 
for parents and children
The interaction between organisms and their environment 
maintains physiological balance and facilitates adaptation (Ciaunica 
et al., 2021a,b). The concept of a “Markov blanket” has emerged as a 
potential framework to understand the system-environment 
boundary (Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios et al., 2020; Ciaunica et al., 
2023). This boundary not only separates the system from its 
environment but also establishes an intrinsic relationship that 
connects the organism to its niche (Sims, 2021). Peripersonal space, 
the area surrounding the body, enables bodily self-awareness, actions, 
and protection during interactions with the external world (Rabellino 
et al., 2020).
The environment in which osteopathic visits occur is crucial, as 
supported by the enactivist interpretation of the therapeutic process 
(Kim et al., 2022 ). According to the enactive model, the body and 
brain are attuned to the interactive environment, shaping one’s sense 
of self, meaning from past experiences, and predictions about the 
future (Stilwell and Harman, 2019). The patient’s (child’s) environment 
is influenced by the physical space and the individuals they interact 
with, such as parents and caregivers. This reciprocal relationship 
between the organism and its environment generates a world of 
meanings based on the organism’s goals, needs, and capabilities 
(Stendera, 2015).
The interviewed osteopaths actively organize the room to 
create a child-friendly environment that encourages exploration 
and active engagement during the visit. They provide toys and 
furnish the space with soft materials, allowing the child to 
experience the tactile qualities of the objects and simultaneously 
learn about their own body.
In the context of the therapeutic process, embodied and embedded 
systems participate through their presence in the world and mutual 
connections. This participatory sense-making, where interactions 
between two individuals generate sense or meaning that goes beyond 
what either individual could produce alone, is a fundamental aspect 
(Stilwell and Harman, 2019). It is important for the practitioner to 
be  aware of their own embodied being, as it influences how they 
perceive themselves and contributes to the co-creation of optimal 
changes in the child’s function, movement, and participation (Sørvoll 
et al., 2022).
The establishment of a safe and secure therapeutic environment is 
crucial for achieving effective therapeutic outcomes. Patients need to 
feel safe in order to fully engage in the therapeutic process. The 
development of a healthy therapeutic relationship relies on the 
therapist’s ability to be  fully present and engaged ( Geller and 
Greenberg, 2012). Geller and Porges (2014)  emphasized that this 
relationship requires the therapist to exhibit qualities such as being 
grounded, focused, stable, open, and receptive to the patient’s 
experience. By maintaining constant presence, osteopaths can assist 
patients in regulating their stress response.

Furthermore, respondents highlighted the importance of creating 
a climate of safety and trust through multidisciplinary collaboration, 
which aims to provide comprehensive care to both parents and 
children. This approach aligns with existing literature (Vaughan et al., 
2017; Lunghi et  al., 2021 ) and the World Health Organization’s 
promotion of “integrated health care. ” Effective collaboration with 
other health professionals necessitates expertise in the pediatric field 
and the availability of scientific evidence to support the osteopathic 
approach (Cerritelli et al., 2021a).
4.2. Theme 2 – communication
The therapeutic alliance serves as a cooperative relationship 
between the clinician and the patient, playing a vital role in person-
centered care. It fosters trust, recognition, and alignment with an 
individual’s unique needs through cooperative communication 
(Miciak et al., 2019; Ryu et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2022). In the context 
of osteopathic care, it is essential to go beyond mere knowledge and 
execution of techniques. It also relies on the practitioner’s ability to 
perceive the intended meaning behind the child’s gestures, postures, 
movements, and expressions, as well as the timing and emotional 
attunement during reciprocal embodied communication ( Sørvoll 
et al., 2022).
In clinical encounters involving caregivers, children, and 
parents, individuals’ lived bodies are mutually coupled through eye 
contact, gaze, facial expressions, voice, gestures, positioning, 
movements, and intentional actions ( Sørvoll et  al., 2022 ). 
Therapeutic interactions are bidirectional and interactive, 
emphasizing the importance of therapeutic presence in enhancing 
the patient’s sense of safety ( Fuchs and De Jaegher, 2009 ; 
Liem, 2019).

4.2.1. Communication with parents
Interlocutors strive to align their mental states for cooperative 
communication (Vasil et al., 2020). In therapy, treatment goals are 
discussed, leading to a transparent and stable therapeutic relationship 
(Liem, 2019). Both patient and therapist acknowledge patient and 
parental needs, including the desire for control and coping strategies 
(Liem and Heede, 2016 ). Empathy involves activating personal 
representations to understand others’ states and relies on interoceptive 
awareness, with empathy and self-awareness linked to the anterior 
insular cortex (Fan et al., 2011; De Waal and Preston, 2017; López-Solà 
et al., 2019; Schaefer et al., 2021). Empathic tendencies contribute to 
robust therapeutic alliances and positive treatment outcomes, 
fostering brain–brain synchrony (Goldstein et al., 2018).
4.2.2. Communication with children
The child’s body engages in continuous interaction with the 
environment, fostering participatory sense-making in clinical 
encounters with osteopaths ( Fuchs and De Jaegher, 2009 ). Upon 
experiencing something new, such as visiting the osteopath’s office, 
children naturally engage in physical exploration, which aligns 
with the goal of inviting them to participate in spontaneous, shared 
exploration ( Ciaunica and Crucianelli, 2019 ). Research shows that 
children derive satisfaction from shared intentions, as it activates 
the reward system and reinforces trust, empathy, and the 
therapeutic relationship ( Green and Hollander, 2010 ; Pauli et al., 
2016; Feldman, 2017 ).
Respondents noted the combination of touch and active visual 
stimulation, such as gaze and eye contact, which elicits muscle and 
hormonal responses in the child’s body, generating interoceptive 
sensations linked to past experiences and guiding ongoing responses 
(Barrett and Bar, 2009). Unlike other senses, touch encompasses the 
entire body surface, developing alongside the nervous system during 
gestation (Montirosso and McGlone, 2020). The ability of osteopaths 
to utilize affective touch, mediated by CT fibers, in initial interactions

activates these fibers, leading to autonomic, neurochemical, and 
behavioral responses that may enhance the child’s receptivity to 
osteopathic manipulative treatment (Pawling et al., 2017; Cerritelli 
et al., 2021b). This process of participatory sense-making fosters a 
“we-space” in which the practitioner and child synchronize bodily 
actions and interactions, co-creating meaning and coordination 
(Sørvoll et al., 2022).
4.3. Theme 3: look for synchrony and 
attachment
The osteopath’s role in interacting with the child and their parents 
involves observing the family dynamics and relationships that shape 
the child’s development. These social encounters between the child 
and their interlocutor rely on the exchange of lived bodily experiences, 
FIGURE 14
Synchrony.
FIGURE 15

Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org
where perception and mutual influence occur simultaneously. Skillful 
observation allows the osteopath to gain insights into the 
communication and mutual influence between the parent and child.
The processing of bodily information begins during the early 
stages of life, possibly even during prenatal development (Zieber et al., 
2015). The infant’s interaction with the mother’s body, mediated by CT 
fibers, precedes their engagement with the mother’s mind (Ciaunica 
et al., 2021a). The fetus establishes meaning and is influenced by its 
interaction with the uterine environment, thereby beginning to 
embody and situate itself within its surroundings (Quintero and De 
Jaegher, 2020).
Within the first year of life, the infant experiences implicit 
synchrony between their bodily activities and those of the mother, as 
evidenced by EEG activity, heart rate, and neuroendocrine responses 
(Van Puyvelde et al., 2019). Research on the mu rhythm suggests that 
infants possess a mirror mechanism enabling them to establish 
sensorimotor correspondences between their own body parts and 
those of others (Meltzoff et al., 2018). From birth, the mother and

infant engage in embodied interactions, encompassing routines such 
as diaper changing, feeding, and playful exchanges. Through these 
multimodal reciprocal exchanges, mother and infant coordinate their 
behaviors and bodies, contributing to rhythmic cycles of co-regulation, 
often referred to as “synchrony, ” “mutual regulation, ” or “attunement” 
(DiCorcia and Tronick, 2011).

Frontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org
Synchrony encompasses the interpersonal coordination of 
behavioral and neurophysiological rhythms, facilitating sensory 
processing, learning, emotion and arousal regulation, self-regulation, 
and the establishment of communicative relationships (Beebe et al., 
2018; Wass et al., 2020; Carozza and Leong, 2021). Caregivers achieve 
biobehavioral synchrony when responding to a helping stimulus by 
activating various subcortical regions, including the hypothalamus, 
amygdala, and dopaminergic reward circuitry (Carozza and Leong, 
2021). Montirosso and McGlone (2020) observed that mother–child 
dyads achieve biobehavioral synchrony through maternal touch and 
interoceptive sensitivity.
4.3.1. Touch
The role of affective touch in fostering interpersonal body 
attunement and supporting the infant’s bodily self-representation 
is a subject of hypothesis ( Bremner and Spence, 2017 ). Tactile 
behaviors, such as skin-to-skin contact and gentle touch, 
employed by the mother during the early stages of the infant’s life, 
have a profound impact. These tactile stimulations positively 
influence various aspects, including sleep patterns, regulation of 
temperature and heart rate, cognitive development, and the 
quality of attachment. Conversely, the absence of tactile 
stimulation has been observed to have negative consequences on 
the infant’s response to stress ( McLaughlin et  al., 2015 ). 
Therapeutic touch has the potential to elicit an affective response 
(Geri et  al., 2019 ) and influence the body schema/perception 
(Viceconti et al., 2020 ).
The close contact between mother and infant during the initial 
months of life allows for the mutual regulation of each other’s 
physiological activities, creating a form of physiological body-to-body 
synchrony known as body tuning or co-regulation (Normann et al., 
2015; Atzil and Gendron, 2017 ; Kim et  al., 2022 ). Through this 
co-regulation, the mother and infant engage in a reciprocal process of 
influencing and aligning their physiological states. This 
synchronization contributes to the establishment of a strong bond 
between them and promotes healthy development.
4.3.2. Interoceptive sensitivity
Mothers need awareness of their own bodily experiences to 
interpret and respond to their child’s body signals (Montirosso and 
McGlone, 2020). Maternal interoceptive sensitivity, striking a balance 
between self-awareness and awareness of the infant, regulates bodily 
sensations to support the infant’s regulatory abilities and restore 
physiological co-regulation (Abraham et al., 2019).
The Reciprocal Regulation Model by Tronick (2004) explains how 
mothers and infants alternate between attuned and asynchronous 
states, using “repair” to recover from asynchronies. Infants 
experiencing more frequent dyadic repairs show increased vagal 
reactivity, reflecting adaptive parasympathetic functioning and 
effective stress regulation (Provenzi et al., 2015).
In summary, maternal interoceptive sensitivity and the repair 
process in mother-infant interactions contribute to regulating 
physiological states, fostering attunement, and enhancing the infant’s 
stress coping abilities.

Frontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org
4.4. Theme 4 – synchronizing
When discrepancies arise between parent and child, subsequent 
repairs that restore synchrony are crucial for building trust, promoting 
development, and fostering a sense of participation and action in 
infants (Fuchs and De Jaegher, 2009).
Based on the aforementioned findings, we  propose that 
osteopaths can play a role in enhancing the success of parent–child 
interactions by providing skills, tools (such as touch and skin-to-skin 
contact), and facilitating a heightened perception of self and the 
relationship. By supporting the sense of participation and action in 
both the child and parent, the osteopath contributes to the 
reconstruction of generative models and alignment of predictive 
models, replacing erroneous or dysfunctional beliefs with new 
meanings through participatory sense-making and achieving 
interpersonal synchrony (McParlin et al., 2022).
Each individual’s mind-brain is an active agent that interacts with 
the environment and is shaped through the sense of participation and 
action, generating meanings and forming the sense of self (Montirosso 
and McGlone, 2020). In the osteopathic clinical encounter, establishing 
synchronicity is vital, as it provides a foundation for shared narratives 
and trust, which are necessary for dispelling erroneous beliefs. 
Aligning mental states to achieve biobehavioral synchrony between 
the patient and practitioner allows for the regulation of allostasis, 
restoration of homeostasis, and effective management of the clinical 
problem (McParlin et al., 2022).
By facilitating eye and touch contact between parents and their 
child during treatment, osteopaths support the child’s allostatic 
regulation and foster secure attachment ( McGlone et  al., 2017 ). 
Dynamic stroking, as demonstrated by Manzotti et al. (2019), activates 
CT fibers and the posterior insular cortex in both mothers and infants, 
promoting the development of regulation, synchronization, and 
anticipation of sensory stimuli. Embodied repair, such as breastfeeding 
and skin-to-skin contact, allows the infant to reduce discrepancies 
within the interoceptive system by utilizing the mother’s body (Sørvoll 
et al., 2022). Therefore, involving parents in the infant’s management 
or treating the infant together with the parents can enhance secure 
attachment, amplifying the parasympathetic response to affective 
touch, similar to how osteopathic care promotes autonomic balance 
through preganglionic cholinergic action (Cerritelli et al., 2020).
4.5. Limitations
The selection of participants was facilitated by a teacher and 
researcher, potentially leading to a polarization of perspectives and 
introducing a potential selection bias. Additionally, although the 
participants were sourced from four different countries, they may not 
adequately represent the entire osteopathic population, and the 
representation across countries is not well-balanced.
Throughout the online meetings, there were instances of 
connection loss, which posed challenges in achieving mutual 
understanding and potentially resulted in misinterpretations. 
However, to address this concern, a member checking strategy was 
implemented to validate the collected data.
Furthermore, the interpretation of the interviews may have been 
influenced by self-confirmation biases, as the author possessed 
pre-existing opinions on certain specific topics. To mitigate this issue, 
a double-checking process and coding by another qualitative 
researcher were employed.
5. Conclusion
This article explores the contextual factors that contribute to 
effective osteopathic pediatric care. It highlights the importance of 
creating a safe and secure therapeutic environment, where both 
parents and children feel comfortable and supported. By being fully 
present and engaged, osteopaths can establish a strong therapeutic 
alliance and foster trust, recognition, and alignment with 
individual needs.
Effective communication is a key aspect of osteopathic care, 
and it is crucial to establish cooperative and empathetic 
communication with both parents and children. Osteopaths 
should be attuned to the child’s nonverbal cues, such as gestures, 
postures, movements, and expressions, and engage in reciprocal 
embodied communication. This level of communication allows 
for a deeper understanding of the child’s needs and facilitates the 
therapeutic process.
The study emphasizes the significance of synchrony and 
attachment in osteopathic care. By observing family dynamics and 
relationships, osteopaths can gain insights into the communication 
and mutual influence between parents and children. Biobehavioral 
synchrony, which involves the coordination of behavioral and 
neurophysiological rhythms, plays a vital role in sensory processing, 
learning, emotion and arousal regulation, self-regulation, and the 
establishment of communicative relationships. Touch and 
interoceptive sensitivity are essential in fostering synchrony and 
attachment, enabling physiological co-regulation and the development 
of a strong bond between parents and children.
Overall, osteopaths can enhance parent–child interactions by 
providing skills, tools, and facilitating heightened self-perception and 
relational awareness. By supporting the sense of participation and 
action in both the child and parent, osteopaths may contribute to the 
reconstruction of generative models and alignment of predictive 
models. This promotes participatory sense-making and achieves 
interpersonal synchrony, which is crucial for building trust, dispelling 
erroneous beliefs, and fostering secure attachment between parents 
and children.
In conclusion, this research illuminates the multifaceted 
dimensions inherent in osteopathic pediatric care, highlighting the 
pivotal role of the therapeutic environment, effective communication, 
synchrony, and attachment. These elements collectively contribute to 
the comprehensive and holistic care provided by osteopaths to parents 
and children. Beyond the realm of osteopathy, these findings hold 
implications that resonate with other health professions where touch 
serves as a vital conduit for communication and care, such as 
physiotherapy and nursing.
As this study elucidates the intricate interplay of contextual 
factors, it prompts osteopaths to recognize their potential in 
optimizing therapeutic outcomes. By nurturing an environment that 
encapsulates safety, security, and connection, practitioners can foster 
not only physical healing but also emotional well-being for both 
parents and children. Moving forward, there is a compelling avenue 
Accardi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253355
Frontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org
for further investigation into the enduring impact of creating such a 
nurturing therapeutic milieu on the overall development and well-
being of children undergoing osteopathic pediatric care.
In addition to the qualitative methodologies employed in this 
study, future research could incorporate quantitative approaches to 
provide further empirical support for these insights. The expansion of 
research endeavors to encompass a broader range of countries would 
amplify the diversity of perspectives and enrich the generalizability of 
the findings.
Ultimately, this research transcends the boundaries of osteopathy, 
resonating across healthcare disciplines where touch serves as a 
pivotal vehicle for effective communication, healing, and 
nurturing care.
