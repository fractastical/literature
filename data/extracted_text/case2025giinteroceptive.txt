2 AnInteroceptiveThreatTheoryofRestrictive
Eating
In the current paper, I borrow from current theories of central
sensitization (amplification of pain processing in the brain) in
chronic pain and active inference (how belief and prediction
shape current experience) in affective neuroscience to propose
a theoretical model of sensitization of fullness-related GI sensa-
tionsinEDsanditsimplicationsforEDetiologyandtreatment.
In so doing, I propose mechanistic links between interoception,
distorted body image, and restrictive eating. I developed these
theories from my background in human neuroscience of pain
and affective touch, with additional experience in ED research.
As I noticed parallels between amplified perceptions, fear, and
avoidance of pain sensations in chronic pain and amplified
perceptions, fear, and avoidance of fatness in EDs, I wondered
towhatextentmodelsofchronicpaincouldinformEDresearch
and treatment. In preparing the current manuscript, I searched
for literature on chronic pain and active inference or central
sensitization, as well as on EDs and active inference, central
sensitization, interoception, distorted body image, perception of
fatness and restrictive eating. The model I present should be
consideredaconceptualframeworkforhypothesisgeneration.It
doesnotseektosupplantexistingrigorous,multileveltheoretical
accounts of EDs but to complement them by highlighting key
somatosensory elements that may improve their explanatory
power.
Bodyimageisamultifacetedconstructthatincludesperceptual,
affective,andcognitivecomponents.IndividualswithANexhibit
both perceptual body distortion (Engel and Keizer2017)a n d
body dissatisfaction—negative attitudes towards the body (Stice
and Shaw 2002). In addition, a “feeling of fatness” explains
unique variance in disordered eating behaviors (Linardon et al.
2018). Body image distortion is often conceptualized from a
cognitive perspective. However, a “feeling of fatness” is a phys-
ically embodied sensation that is rooted in both somatosensory
pathwaysandcognitiveinterpretation(MehakandRacine 2020).
Although “feeling fat” may be characterized clinically as a
misperception of sensations or emotions, I draw upon advances
intheneuroscienceofchronicpaintoproposethatthesefeelings
are rooted in gastrointestinal (GI) interoceptive sensations that
become amplified and distorted, parallel to central sensitization
inchronicpainanditsdistortionofbodyimage(Moseley 2008).
In a fatphobic culture, most individuals seek to avoid fatness to
avoid weight-based discrimination and victimization (Puhl and
Suh2015).Iproposethatsignalsofgastricdistention—aswellas
otherskinordeeptissue-relatedsensationsrelatedtofullnessor

of sensations linked to “fatness” and attach a negative valence
to them. Amplification and fear-avoidance would then lead to

4. Gastric stretch sensations become amplified and persistent
via central sensitization (parallel to chronic pain), altering
bodyimageandbodyrepresentation.
Below,Ielaborateonthismodelframework,discussingevidence,
gaps,andfuturedirectionsforresearchandtreatment.
2.1 FatphobicHyperpriorsDriveaFearof
Fatness
Sensory perception is constantly predicted and modified by
neural circuits that instantiate our expectations, orpriors.T h e
brainusesprobabilisticpredictiontomodelitsneedsandpredict
changes, optimizing metabolic expenditure. In each moment,
sensory data are compared to prediction, and discrepancies are
registered as prediction errors (essentially, surprise). Sensory
data and predictions are each weighted by their precision, with
higher precision data afforded greater ability to modify future
2of9 BrainandBehavior ,2025
predictions (Papadopoulos et al.2009; Sullivan1995;S .B .W a n g
et al. 2021;S t i c ea n dS h a w2002). Applied to internal body
perception (interoception), interoceptive predictions establish
homeostatic setpoints against which new interoceptive data are
compared, with prediction errors driving autonomic responses.
Interoceptivepredictionandperceptionoccurintheinsula,and
its integration with exteroceptive sensory data shapes higher-
levelbodyrepresentation(Keizeretal. 2012;Veissièreetal. 2020;
BeckerandStice 2017;Jarmanetal. 2021;Linetal. 2023).
Unless actively resisted (Becker and Stice2017), a culture of
prescriptivethinnessconfershyperpriorsthatone’sbody should
be thin and that fatness is bad and scary. Internalization of
“ideal” appearances online, for example, has been shown to
increase body dissatisfaction (Jarman et al.2021). Similarly, a
recent study found that external pressure and an internalized
idealtobethin/fitwerecommontriggersforAN(Linetal. 2023).
Across ED models, both preoccupation with weight and shape

dissatisfaction,bodyimagedisturbance,appearanceanxiety,and
bodyshame)andnegativeaffectareconsideredtwoofthemost
prominentriskfactorsthatcontributetothedevelopmentofEDs

painintensity(Kroska 2016)anddisabilityinchronicpain(Zale

2.2 GastricStretchSensationsBecomeSalient
andThreatening
GIsensationsareintuitivelymorerelevanttoEDsymptomatology
than other interoceptive functions and have recently been the
subject of calls for increased focus on clinical ED treatment
(Khalsa et al. 2022). Individuals with AN frequently exhibit
altered GI sensation, including exaggerated fullness after small
meals, early satiety, and abdominal pain (Schalla and Sten-
gel 2019). This exaggerated fullness decreases after treatment
(Salvioli et al.2013), suggesting a potential biomarker of treat-
ment progress. Feelings of gastric distention/fullness arise from
mechanicaldeformationofvagalnerveterminalsinthestomach
that respond rapidly to stretch and tension of the stomach wall
(reviewed in Gautron2021). Parallel to pain processing, central
processing of gastric distention has been linked to the insular
cortex (G.-J. Wang et al.2008; Ladabaum et al.2007; Tataranni
etal. 1999).However,whileGIinteroceptionhasbeendiscussed
in the context of active inference, the cause of interoceptive
differencesinEDshasnotbeenexplained(Khalsaetal. 2022).
I propose that a fear of fatness leads vulnerable individuals to
assignathreatvaluetoanyinteroceptivecuesbelievedtosignal
fatness. Fear and anxiety are commonly directed at the body in
EDs—which has been theorized as representing a threatening
object for individuals with AN (Osler2021)—and also at food,
food intake, weight gain, or becoming fat (Charland et al.2013,
E s p e s e te ta l .2012;A r n a u de ta l .2023). Disgust towards one’s
body is predictive of body image disturbance (Stasik-O’Brien
andSchmidt 2018)andmaymotivatebehaviorstoreducebodily
disgust (Arcelus et al.2011; Anderson et al.2021). In addition,
changes in GI-specific—but not general—physical anxiety sen-
sitivitypredictbothlowerEDsymptomsandlowertraitanxiety
at discharge and 6-month follow-up (Velkoff et al.2024). These
findingspointtotheimportanceofGI-specificanxietysensitivity

A recent application of active inference to EDs has proposed
thatindividualswithANexperiencenoisierinteroceptivesignals,
whichleadthemtorestricttheireatingtoamplifyhungersignals
inanefforttominimizeinteroceptivecertaintyandtheconstruc-
tionofacoherentselfviainteroception(BarcaandPezzulo 2020).
However, this model fails to explain why eating restriction is
the strategy pursued to reduce interoceptive confusion or why
thefeelingoffatnessispervasiveandpersistentinEDs.Indeed,
mistrustinone’sinteroceptivesignalsandnotfeelingsafeinone’s
bodyareassociatedwithEDsymptoms(T.A.Brownetal. 2020).
While such mistrust could reflect interoceptive uncertainty, I
propose that it reflects a perceived threat signal and negative
valenceof specificGIsymptomsassociatedwithfullness/fatness.
If thinness is expected and fatness feared, then interoceptive
signals associated through conditioning with weight gain will
generatepredictionerrorsthatfeellikefatness.Theseprediction
errorswillincreasefocusoninteroceptivesensations.
2.3 DietingLinksGISensationstoNegative
Affect,DrivingAvoidance
Leading neuroscientific theories of emotion stipulate that emo-
tionisconstructedfromsimulationsofphysiologicalneeds(Bar-
rett2017)andthusfrominteroceptivesignalsfromthebody(Craig
2003). Indeed, interoceptive sensations are usually experienced
aslower-dimensionalfeelingsofaffect(Barrett 2017;Barrettand
Bliss-Moreau 2009), implying that negative emotions about the
physical body are inextricably linked to incoming sensations of
thebody.Thismakesithighlyplausiblethatinteroceptivefeelings
offullnessanddistentiondrivenegativeaffectinindividualswith
weight and shape concerns. In this fatphobic context, fear of
fatness would shape the emotional implications of hunger and
fullness. Signals of fullness—interpreted as relating to weight
gain—would increasingly evoke negative emotions such as fear,
disgust, and shame. If this hypothesis is correct, then feelings
of fullness should evoke negative affect and a more negative
body image. Indeed, empirical evidence is consistent with this
hypothesis:ANpatientsreportgreaterincreasesinnegativeaffect
afterdrinkingwatertothepointoffullness(despitelowerintake
3of9
than healthy controls). This supports a direct link between GI
distention and negative affect in EDs (T. A. Brown et al.2022).
Similarresultshavebeenreportedforbulimianervosaandbinge
ED, confirming a general link between fullness sensations and
negativeaffectinEDs,regardlessofweight(vanDycketal. 2021).
Negative affect is highly associated with body image (Pennesi
and Wade2016), providing a causal path between sensations of
fullnessandnegativebodyimage.
Because caloric intake is associated with sensations of fullness
andsatiety,itiseasytoseehowthesesensorycuesbecomeasso-
ciatedwithaffectandultimatelybodyimage.Boswelletal.( 2015)
suggestthatindividualswithhigherinteroceptivesensitivitymay
developarestrictiveEDiftheyviewweightgainnegatively,and
“physicalcuesrelatedtodigestion(e.g.,fullness)areexperienced
acutely as strong signals that have become associated with
weightgain.”Throughinteroceptiveconditioning,thesensation
of fullness becomes perceived as a threat and drives avoidance
behaviors,whicharethennegativelyreinforced.Similarly,Isug-
gest that sensations of emptiness or hunger are associated with
thinness and thus safety and social reward, generating positive
reinforcement. Dieting and weight changes would positively or
negatively reinforce these associations through social rewards
commonlyconferredforweightlossanddietingefforts.Indeed,
interoceptivesensitivityhasbeenlinkedtogreaterinteroceptive
avoidance and body image disturbance (Zucker et al.2013), and
several studies (reviewed in Boswell et al.2015) indicate that
deficitsinperceivingeating-specificinteroceptivesignalspredict

roceptiveawarenesspredictclinicaloutcomesinAN(Matsumoto
etal. 2006),suggestingthatawarenessandacceptanceofhunger
andsatietycuesmaybeimportantEDtreatmenttargets(Herbert
etal. 2012).
Further evidence for the link between GI sensations and body
images comes from studies of GI pain and EDs. Early GI pain
and discomfort may contribute to general aversive conditioning
of GI signals; data suggest that early GI symptoms can increase
the likelihood of later developing AN (Jacobi et al.2004). It has
beenproposedthatGIpain,aswellasmenstrualpain,increases
preoccupation with gut sensations and disrupts their adaptive
interpretation (Zucker and Bulik2020). This could generalize
to innocuous GI events such as fullness and satiety, providing
a complementary variation of the process of amplification and
negativeinteroceptiveconditioningofGIdistention,especiallyin
females.
In chronic pain, nociceptive signals are interpreted as threat-
ening, and patients often avoid certain movements and sensory
experiences to avoid pain. Leading theories and psychological
interventions for pain center on the reinterpretation of noci-
ceptive signals as nonthreatening and movement as safe (Pinto
et al.2023; Ashar et al.2022). Avoidance and dissociation are
also common in both trauma and PTSD, where reduced insula
processing of sensation has been observed; avoidance robs the
patientofnewexperiencesthatcouldupdatepredictivemodelsto
restorefeelingsofsafety(StrigoandSimmons 2024).Asinchronic
pain, I propose that in EDs, relief from avoiding the perceived
threatoffatnesscanreinforceavoidancebehaviors,entrenching
restrictiveeating(Voldersetal. 2015).
IndividualswithEDsandaffectivedisordershavebeenproposed
to have challenges with self-identity (Croce et al.2024)t h a t
may lead to a greater focus on interoceptive input to evaluate
self-worth. It is unclear whether such challenges arise from
internal or external factors, such as the difficulty of integrating
stigmatized identities (e.g., LGBT adults experience a higher
rate of EDs; Parker and Harriger2020). Individuals with EDs
may use starvation strategically to amplify hunger signals and
avoid interoceptive uncertainty, strengthening their sense of
self (Barca and Pezzulo2020). Critically, however, this model
does not explain why starvation is chosen over other intense
sensory experiences. The current model proposes avoidance of
GI fullness-related sensations due to their specific link to fear
of fatness and, consequently, negative affect and body image.
Hunger signals are amplified to maximize interoceptive and
affective processing associated with reward and safety, avoiding
the “error signals” of fatness and aligning self-identity with a
hyperpriorofthedesirabilityandnecessityofthinness.
2.4 GISensationsAreAmplifiedviaCentral
Sensitization
Centralsensitizationmostcommonlyreferstotheamplification
of pain by central nervous system mechanisms (Harte et al.
2018). When a person is injured, nociceptors become sensitized
to subsequent nociceptive stimuli and increase the excitability
of central nociceptive processing (Cervero1995). Attention and
negative emotions further amplify pain processing in the brain
(Apkarianetal. 2011),creatingapositivefeedbackloopwherein
pain,attentiontopain,andfearofpainamplifypainprocessing
andincreaseitslikelihoodofbecomingchronic.Aspainbecomes
chronic, body image is altered, including decreases in tactile
acuity and interoceptive awareness of the body and disruptions
ofbodyimage(Moseley 2008).
I propose a similar process by which gastric stretch sensations
becomeamplifiedandinterpretedasthreatening.InEDs,atten-
tion and negative emotions are directed toward GI sensations
of fullness and satiety, likely increasing their aversive central
processing. I propose that the interpretation of these signals as
threatening leads to central sensitization and increased salience
of GI signals, increasing their intensity and leading to even
greater aversion and avoidance. In the same way that central
sensitization, negative affect, and avoidance create persistent
pain,IproposethatthesamemechanismsapplytoGIsensations
in the context of fear of fatness, leading to persistent feelings of
fatnessandbodyimagedistortion(seeFigure 1).
Central sensitization is plausible to consider in EDs given its
application to visceral symptoms beyond pain. Central sensi-
tization is believed to contribute to many chronic pain and
hypersensitivity disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome,
tension-type headache, myofascial pain syndrome, PTSD, and
more (Yunus 2008, and was recently proposed to contribute
to overactive bladder (Reynolds et al.2016). Indeed, central
sensitizationhasbeenproposedasariskfactorforEDs(Simetal.
2021),citingoverlapintraitsandbehaviorsbetweenchronicpain
andEDpatientsthatmayconferheightenedsensitivitytointernal

with stress, which are also implicated in the development of

GIpathways(X.Wangetal. 2014).
Indeed, individuals with EDs often exhibit higher interoceptive
sensibility(IS)forvisceralsensations,whichareheightenedafter
meal consumption (Jacquemot and Park2020). This suggests
heightenedattentiontothesesensations.AthirdofANpatients
even reported fullness when their stomach was completely
empty(Bluemeletal. 2017),suggestingcentralamplificationand
distortion of fullness perception. Interoceptive accuracy (IAcc),
in contrast, is reduced for hunger and satiety-related cues in
EDs, suggesting distortion in these signals. Since satiation is
subjective,Isuggestthisisevidenceofheightenedsensitivityand
central amplification of fullness sensations, rather than “faulty
interoception.”SlowedgastricmotilityduetoEDbehaviorsmay
furtheramplifysensationsoffullnessanddistention(Schallaand
Stengel2019).
A validated and reliable measure of amplified gastric intero-
ception (Van Dyck et al.2016) has recently been demonstrated
in the two-step Water Load Test (WLT-II), allowing a novel
opportunitytostudyrelationshipsbetweenmodulationofgastric
interoception and body image. To complete the WLT-II, partic-
ipants ingest noncaloric water until perceived satiation (Step 1)
and maximum fullness (Step 2) to determine gastric perception
anddiscomfortthresholds(VanDycketal. 2016).Thefirststepof
thetesthasdemonstratedlowerthresholdsforfullnesssensations
in individuals with AN (T. A. Brown et al.2022), and WLT
performance is correlated with IS, demonstrating convergent
validityofthetask(T.A.Brownetal. 2022).However,associations
betweenWLT-IIanddietingorweightandshapeconcernswere
not found in a nonclinical sample (Ahlich et al.2023). Other
promising tests include the administration of hydrogels and
bioengineered vibrating capsules as probes for GI interoception
(Greenwayetal. 2019;Smithetal. 2021).
Altered gastric perception provides an empirical starting point
from which to develop much-needed mechanistic research on
sensitization/amplification of GI-related interoceptive signals
associated with fullness and skin stretch. Model-based experi-
mental studies of interoception in EDs are needed to formally
test for altered predictive processing (Khalsa et al.2022)a n d
psychological and neurobiological mechanisms by which GI
interoceptionmaybecomeamplified.Itwouldalsobeimportant

etal. 2023).
Acontributortoamplificationmayinvolveneuroimmunemech-
anisms.Preclinically,gliaandastrocytescandetectnerveinjury

of inflammatory mediators, after which touch becomes painful
(Svensson and Brodin2010; Gonçalves dos Santos et al.2020).
Neuroinflammationhasrecentlybeenlinkedtoamplificationof

ated with mood alteration and mental fatigue (Brusaferri et al.
2022) and with persistent depressive and cognitive symptoms
afterSARS-CoV-2infection(Bragaetal. 2023).Researchisneeded
todeterminewhetheranalteredinterpretationofgutdistention
as threatening triggers an inflammatory response to GI signals,
furtheramplifyingandentrenchingtheiraversiveperception.
Itisimportanttonotethattheframeworkproposedinthecurrent
paperdoesnotapplytoallEDsequallybuttocasesofrestrictive
eating. Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge ED often
report a lack of fullness, despite fear of fat. However, even if
satietysignalsaredelayedorweakened,itremainsthecasethat
individualswithafearoffatnessarelikelytointerpretsensations
of fullness—when they do arise—as threatening and indicative
of fatness. Individuals may experience conflicting motivations
to eat while simultaneously feeling the threat and negative
interpretation of the sensation, which may then motivate com-
pensatory behaviors. Indeed, individuals with bulimia nervosa
exhibit worsened mood after binges, which returns to baseline
after purging (Alpers and Tuschen-Caffier2001). In sum, even
if fullness is delayed or not avoided, it may still be feared and
interpreted as fatness and contribute unduly to negative body
imageandmaintenanceofEDbehaviors.

3 ImplicationsandFutureDirections
Many AN patients fear losing self-control (Froreich et al.2016)
and describe their bodies as dangerous and not trustworthy.
(Arnaud et al. 2023) It has been argued that changes in
interoception—specifically changes ininteroceptive sensibility—
aremerelyby-productsofemotionalchanges,andthatemotions
play the central role in producing and maintaining behavioral
symptoms of AN as identified in the DSM (Arnaud et al.2023).
In contrast, I propose that hyperpriors of prescriptive thinness
and the social consequences of fatness drive the construction
of emotions of disgust, danger, and mistrust from GI sensa-
tions of fullness. Thus, emotions are central, but equally so
are the interoceptive sensations that underlie them and the
cultural hyperpriors that link them. In addition, as sensations
of fatness become amplified, larger prediction errors may be
generated, leading to an upward spiral of emotional-sensory
amplification of GI signals, negative emotion, and fear of losing
self-control(astrongpredictorofeatingpathology;Froreichetal.
2016).
If fear-based amplification of GI interoceptive channels is a
key mechanism for feelings of fatness and food restriction,
then we predict that desensitizing GI interoception should be
highly beneficial for reducing distorted body image and restric-
tive eating. Interoceptive exposures are already supported as
a transdiagnostic intervention strategy that can be integrated
into cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for EDs (Boswell et al.
2015). Exposure strategies for food, body, and emotions have
shown preliminary feasibility for residential ED treatment and
supportsignificantimprovementintransdiagnosticoutcomesfor
patients(Thompson-Brenneretal. 2019).Onenovelinteroceptive

to the sensation of fullness/bloating and skills for tolerating

(Hildebrandt et al.2021); Boswell et al. (2015) propose that both
GI and emotion-based somatic cues should be ED treatment
targets, alongside attempts to increase tolerance and decrease
fear, to disrupt the avoidance-driven ED behaviors elicited by
thesesensations.Theauthorsproposeinteroceptiveinterventions

guides them to reinterpret pain sensations as nonthreatening
false-alarm signals that—in the case ofchronic pain—do not
indicateinjuryordamageinthebody.AppliedtoEDs,Ipropose
thatclinicianscouldvalidatethesensationsoffatnessthepatient
is experiencing, provide psychoeducation to explain their origin
inamplifiedsomatosensorypathways,andhelpthepatientview
thesesensationsasamisplacedalarmsignalthatisnotindicative
of either fatness or threat. In the treatment of chronic pain,
Pain Neuroscience Educationis one core component of PRT.
Another core component of PRT is somatic tracking, which
involves nonjudgmental attention to and description of pain
sensations in the body—similar to the GI-focused exposure and
desensitizationdiscussedabove.Critically,thePainNeuroscience
Education occurs first, setting the framework in which patients
canreinterprettheirbodilysensations.
It is also worth emphasizing that despite progress, many ED
providers and programs retain language and beliefs that are
fatphobic, such as adhering to a prescriptive “normal” weight
or BMI range for bodies, which will impede a patient’s progress
in reinterpreting the affective value assigned to fatness (Abel
2020).Forpatientstosuccessfullyreinterprettheaffectivevalueof
bodilysensations,fatphobiamustbeeliminated.Thisisdifficult
butcrucialworkforEDtreatment(Abel 2020;Stolletal. 2022).
Furthermore, sensory strategies may be useful todiminish the
salience of gastric distention and counter the effects of central
sensitization.Indeed,inthetreatmentofpain,exposuretherapies
are used alongside sensory techniques and pain medications
aimed at reducing the pain sensation itself. Deep pressure, for
example, can inhibit visceral fullness sensations and decrease
anxiety.Inhealthyadults,tactilestimulationreducesperception

1994).Inaddition,ourresearchhasshownthatdeeppressureis

Madian,etal. 2021).Deeppressuretouchduringmassageinduces
greatercalmthanlighttouch(Fieldetal. 2010;Diegoetal. 2004).
Deep pressure has also recently been found to increase IAcc
(Edwards et al.2018), a function often impaired in AN (Pollatos
et al. 2008). Of note, a case study observed remission from
AN while wearing a pressured diving suit providing full-body
deep pressure (Grunwald2005). Similarly, weighted blankets
have decreased anxiety in inpatients with AN (Ohene et al.
2020). Research is also needed to test whether other sensory
modalitiescaneffectivelydiminishamplifiedGIinteroceptionin
ED patients. Heat, cold, vibration, and soothing affective touch
therapies can all reduce the experience of chronic pain (Titler
and Rakel2001; McCaffery1992) by gating pain signals in the
spinalcordaswellasengagingdistractionandpositiveaffective
mechanismsinthebrain(VillemureandBushnell 2002).Further-
more, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and
other noninvasive neuromodulation should be explored. These
techniques can moderately reduce acute pain (Johnson et al.
2022), including visceral pain in GI disorders (Alam and Chen
2023).
In sum, I propose that fear and avoidance of fatness parallels
thefearandavoidancethatleadsvulnerableindividualstotreat
pain signals as threatening, leading to central sensitization and
