Many approaches have been proposed to solve missing
data problem, particularly, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks
(ANN) are some of the most studied approaches due to
their characteristics, as being an universal approximator or
their ﬂexibility to a large amount of problems.
In this paper, Introduction section 1 shows chronologi-
cally some works that appear in the literature describing the
use of different artiﬁcial neural networkbased tools to solve
the problem of missing data. In a ﬁrst part it is based on
machine learning techniques and a second part it is based
on fuzzy approach. This allows to contextualize and state
the proposed research work, which presents an unexplored
research.
The main originality of the paper is the novel applica-
tion of CANFIS-based model to predict missing values. In
particular, the CANFIS-ART model [ 4] is applied to pre-
dict missing values, the imputation process is performed
and the obtained estimation of missing data allows to create
a completed data set that improves the database quality.
The well-known CANFIS-ART model ([ 4] is a sophis-
ticated neuro-fuzzy network with powerful capabilities
approach which is enhanced by various algorithms which
supposes the main difference to baseline CANFIS model.
The algorithm Fuzzy-ART is applied to partition the input
space and the training is carried out with three training
algorithms, two to the learning of parameters (Recursive
Least Square and Error Backpropagation) and the third
algorithm to the machine learning structure (Fuzzy-ART).
The core intent to this research is to impute both qual-
itative (dichotomous, ordinal, nominal) and quantitative
data belonging to different ﬁelds using Coactive Neuro-
Fuzzy Inference System-based method. The purpose is to
impute different types of input data to obtain a completed
data set which helps the difﬁcult task of decision making.
Therefore, the model is explored with databases that belong
to different areas, studying its behavior. The CANFIS-
based model is examined and compared with its baseline
model ANN and established models (mean/mode, regres-
sion, Hotdeck), being evaluated with statistical measures
such as mean of squared error or mean absolute percentage
error of estimate, among others. A comparison is also made
between the performance of all the models to measure the
classiﬁcation accuracy, which shows that an effective
imputation increases the accuracy of the classiﬁers.
In section 2, patterns and mechanism of missing data, as
well as imputation methods, are explained.
The experimental process is explained in section 3,
including a brief description of the data sets, procedure
perturbation, evaluation criteria and empirical experiments.
Section 4 describes the automatic procedure to impute
missing values with machine learning-based techniques.
General aspects of artiﬁcial neural networks and the
structure of neuro fuzzy systems are introduced.
In Subsection 4.1 the neural architecture is described: a
three-layer perceptron [ 1]. A study considering different
activations functions is shown and parameters setting in
Table 3 is based on previous experiments [ 6, 7]. Algorithm
1 not only shows the MLP algorithm, it actually shows the
algorithm that describes the steps followed for the impu-
tation process applying MLP model. The source code was
implemented in Matlab R2018a, using Neural Network
Toolbox [2].
In Subsection 4.2 general characteristics of the CANFIS
models are commented [ 3], as well as CANFIS-ART

architecture of the library User’s Manual [ 4], in particular.
Aforementioned, this CANFIS-ART model uses three
training algorithms, two to the learning of parameters (RLS
and Error Backpropagation) and the third algorithm to the
machine learning structure (Fuzzy-ART). Moreover,
CANFIS-ART backpropagation algorithms [ 4] are descri-
bed in this section.
Ad-hoc experiments were designed for the purpose of
determining the values of internal parameters in CANFIS-
ART model. All the parameters associated to membership
function, consequence parameters, etc. are revised for each
epoch during the training. To avoid overﬁtting in the
training data an appropiate CANFIS model was searched in
terms of the best generalization capability, converging to
an optimal solution. The CANFIS model with the best
generalization capability was obtained with the values of
the parameters listed in Table 4. The results presented in
this work correspond to results on the test data. Algorithm
2 not only shows the CANFIS-ART algorithm, it actually
shows the algorithm that describes the steps followed for
the imputation process applying CANFIS-ART model.
Likewise, the source code was implemented in Matlab
R2018a, using ANFIS/CANFIS Library for Simulink,
developed by Konsoulas [ 4].
The results are discussed in section 5. In this section all
imputation models are compared, measuring the models
performance with statistical indexes, and measuring them
in terms of their predictive accuracy using other classiﬁers.
Moreover, this section contains a brief description of the
other classiﬁcation methods that are used to measure the
machine learning approaches precision.
Finally, section 6 presents the main conclusions. Com-
pared with manual process, the machine learningbased
techniques considerably reduce the time and labour cost,
thereby facilitating data imputation tasks. The experiments
show the effectiveness that approaches based on machine
learning achieve in the data cleaning process. Moreover, it
is considered that the machine learning-based methods may
be quite good as a supplement for other methods, being
good proposals as viable alternative to the existing ones
imputation models.
