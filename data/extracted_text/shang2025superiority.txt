In recent years, advancements in the second-generation cognitive science 
have significantly contributed to interdisciplinary progress at the intersection 
of psychopathology and cognitive sciences. This article critically examines 
Kristopher Nielsen’s 3E framework—embodied, embedded, and enactive—which 
challenges traditional conceptual models of mental disorders. By emphasizing 
the dynamic interplay among the brain, body, and environment, the framework 
addresses the limitations of existing approaches, offering a more comprehensive 
and ecologically valid perspective on psychopathology. In addition, the article 
proposes directions for future research, underscoring the significance of pluralism 
in the explanation of mental disorders and exploring the possibility of integrating 
extended cognition into the existing framework. These theoretical developments 
enhance multifaceted understandings of mental disorders, refine classification 
and explanatory methodologies, and inform the development of evidence-based, 
targeted treatment strategies. Collectively, these insights aim to advance the field 
of psychopathology toward a more integrated, inclusive, and practice-oriented 
realm, providing a robust theoretical foundation for innovative clinical approaches 
to mental health.

1 Introduction
Psychopathology examines mental illness and abnormal behavior, increasingly intersecting 
with cognitive science. Cognitive science, as an interdisciplinary field, has undergone two 
major theoretical evolutions. Initially, it focused on symbolic representation and computational 
processing, conceptualizing cognition as an internal, mechanistic operation. Conversely, the 
second generation emphasizes the dynamic interrelation of brain, body, and environment, 
characterizing cognition as embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended (4E cognition)

comprehensive framework, capturing the multidimensional nature of 
the mind.1
When engaging with the concept of mental disorder in everyday 
discourse, individuals often exhibit confidence in defining the term 
and providing examples. Y et, there exists no universally accepted 
classification system or unified theoretical framework, particularly in 
the context of cognitive science. In Embodied, Embedded, and Enactive 
Psychopathology: Reimagining Mental Disorder, Kristopher Nielsen 
critiques conventional approaches to psychopathology and advocates 
for the adoption of a 3E framework—embodied, embedded, and 
enactive cognition. Nielsen argues that the second-generation 
cognitive science provides essential tools for rethinking mental 
disorders by situating them within a dynamic and relational model of 
cognition. This perspective deepens explanatory power while 
enhancing ecological validity by bridging insights from laboratory 
studies with the complexities of real-world clinical practice. By 
foregrounding the lived experience of patients and the intricate causal 
pathways underlying mental illness, Nielsen’s 3E framework lays a 
compelling foundation for the development of innovative and context-
sensitive intervention strategies (Nielsen, 2023).
Nielsen advocates for a 3E cognitive framework rather than a 4E 
framework due to fundamental concerns about extracranial cognition 
associated with extended cognition. He argues that extended cognition 
conflicts with the core principles of embodied, embedded, and 
enactive cognition. By locating aspects of the mind in the external 
environment, extended cognition risks eroding the autonomy and 
self-contained nature of the cognitive subject. Moreover, it may lead 
to an unbounded expansion of normativity, allowing for an 
indeterminate array of values and norms without clear criteria for 
prioritization. Practically, this framework complicates the analysis of 
individual psychopathology by introducing ambiguities regarding 
subject-system boundaries, rendering interpretations both unclear 
and operationally impracticable.
Adopting a comprehensive perspective, we identify a core task of 
psychopathology and examine existing conceptual models of mental 
disorders. We  then introduce the theoretical underpinnings and 
integrative framework of 3E psychopathology. Finally, we trace the 
1 The representational/information-processing approach and the 4E 
approach, these seemingly opposed theoretical frames need not mutually 
exclude each other, and may be complimentary. For example, Piccinini (2024) 
presents a 4EA cognitive framework that meaningfully integrates representation-
based mechanisms with embodiment. He  argues for a synthesis, not a 
dichotomy, between these perspectives. Similarly, de Vignemont (2018) offers 
an in-depth analysis of the body schema, showing how representational and 
embodied aspects of cognition can be reconciled within an integrated model. 
Her work specifically addresses cases such as anxiety, showing how perceptual 
miscalibrations in anxious individuals reflect both representational and 
embodied dynamics. These attempts at integration provide a more nuanced 
view of cognitive theory and underscore the value of considering both 
representationalism and 4E approaches as potentially complementary rather 
than strictly oppositional. Over the past decade, scientists and philosophers, 
such as Friston (2010)  and Clark (2013) , have promoted the predictive 
processing framework, based on free energy principle and active inference, 
to unify the two generations of cognitive science. We thank the reviewer for 
highlighting this significant theoretical nuance.
evolution of psychopathology within cognitive science, elaborate on 
our position, and outline aspirations for advancing psychopathology 
and improving mental health treatment.
2 The core tasks of psychopathology 
research
Within the field of psychopathology, precisely articulating a 
conceptual definition of mental disorders is an urgent and core task 
(Nielsen, 2023). To further explore and develop the concept of mental 
disorders. There are three key questions:
 • Are mental disorders something you get or something you do?
 • Does a mental disorder exist inside someone’s brain, or is it 
dispersed across their brain, body, and environment?
 • The final question to an example of the need for conceptual work 
in psychopathology: are mental disorders defined by brute facts 
or by social norms and values? (pp. 6–7)
Through discussion, we  concluded that these three issues can 
be encapsulated in three succinct statements: mental disorders are 
inherently complex, as they manifest both individual behaviors and 
involuntary elements; although based on factual evidence, mental 
disorders are influenced by normative factors at a functional level; and 
from a systematic perspective, mental disorders represent a complex 
network of interacting causal factors within the brain–body-
environment system.
Definitions of mental disorders, whether explicit or implicit, 
directly influence our understanding and practice of classification, 
explanation, and treatment. These three tasks form the core of 
psychopathological research. The classification task seeks to impose 
order on the diversity of behaviors and experiences ( Berenbaum, 
2013); the explanation task involves formulating and validating 
theoretical hypotheses to enhance our understanding of mental 
disorders (Haig, 2014); and the treatment task focuses on developing 
and validating effective interventions, whether pharmacological, 
psychotherapeutic, or otherwise. A well-considered classification 
system and a valid explanation framework provide a solid foundation 
for treatment efforts. Current research indicates that the traditional 
three-task model is incomplete, and the introduction of a four-task 
model through the inclusion of conceptual tasks demonstrates greater 
strengths. The conceptualization of mental disorders underpins our 
work in classification, explanation, and treatment. In addition, all of 
these tasks make a pluralistic commitment that can provide diverse 
perspectives and insights for understanding and addressing the 
complex entity of mental disorders.
2.1 Nielsen’s current conceptual model
Nielsen’s existing conceptual model can be categorized into two 
primary frameworks: structure-oriented concepts and norm-oriented 
concepts. These frameworks enhance our understanding of the nature 
of mental disorders; however, they do not negate the necessity for 
conceptual refinement and the development of improved models.
Structure-oriented concepts primarily focus on the nature of mental 
disorders and their existence within a physical or causal framework, akin 
Shang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1578600
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
to analyzing the nature and composition of an object. Haslam (2002) 
proposes a conceptual taxonomy that effectively integrates various 
perspectives on the structural nature of psychopathology, ultimately 
advocating for conceptual pluralism—the notion that different mental 
disorders may possess distinct structural characteristics. While this 
taxonomy is valuable for integrating diverse viewpoints, it also 
encounters certain challenges. Specifically, the lack of definitive cut-off 
points in the classification process can lead to the oversimplification of 
mental disorders, thereby neglecting the complexity of individual 
differences and environmental factors. This oversimplification not only 
complicates further research but also poses challenges for the 
implementation of effective treatment.
In contrast, norm-oriented concepts examine why certain 
phenomena should be  regarded as obstacles from an evaluative and 
functional perspective. These concepts aim to establish a framework for 
“conceptual validity, ” which refers to the ability to accurately distinguish 
between normal and dysfunctional functioning (Wakefield, 2014). This 
process can be likened to determining whether a specific behavior is 
abnormal. However, the evaluation of such concepts often lacks clear, 
objective criteria, and the evaluation process is inevitably influenced by 
the invasion of subjectivity. This subjectivity, which can vary according 
to cultural and social contexts, presents challenges for diagnosis and 
treatment, hindering in-depth exploration of the mechanisms and causes 
of mental disorders (Jefferson, 2014).
2.2 The 3E psychopathology approach
Given the urgent need for a conceptualization of mental disorders 
and the limitations of existing conceptual models, the 3E 
psychopathology framework has emerged as a novel approach to 
understanding these disorders through an embodied, embedded, and 
enactive view of human functioning. The fundamental concepts of 3E 
cognition were introduced at the beginning of this article. This section 
focuses on a synopsis of previous research on the 3E framework and 
discusses how it can be  further refined based on this research to 
significantly contribute to the treatment of mental.
Fuchs (2017) presents an embodied perspective in his research, 
introducing the significant concepts of dual orientation and circular 
causality. Dual orientation challenges the traditional binary distinction 
between psychology and physics, positing that conscious experiences 
and the physical states of the brain and body are manifestations of the 
same phenomenon observed from different perspectives. In 
understanding mental disorders, the experience of consciousness 
integrates with the physical state of the brain and body, and the 
interaction between these elements constitutes a comprehensive 
understanding of mental disorders. Circular causality encompasses 
both horizontal and vertical dimensions (Fuchs, 2023). Horizontal 
circular causality reflects the dynamic interactions between an 
individual and his/her environment; while vertical circular causality 
pertains to the interactions among various hierarchies within an 
individual, from molecules to cells to organs to the entire body. This 
dimension emphasizes how smaller-scale structures are constrained 
and influenced by larger-scale organizations, such as gene expression, 
which may be regulated by an individual’s overall physiological and 
psychological state. Fuchs argues that mental disorders disrupt normal 
vertical and horizontal circular causality, resulting in atypical 
perceptual and reaction patterns.
De Haan (2020) posits that mental disorders represent systematic 
deviations in the process of meaning construction across four 
dimensions: physiological, experiential, socio-cultural, and existential. 
For instance, individuals with anxiety disorders may exhibit an 
exaggerated assessment of environmental threats (the experiential 
dimension), which could be closely linked to the physiological stress 
response (the physiological dimension), sociocultural pressures (the 
socio-cultural dimension), and confusion regarding the meaning of 
their existence (the existential dimension). While this framework 
offers a multidimensional perspective and effectively describes the 
characteristics and manifestations of mental disorders, it requires 
enhancement in explaining how these disorders develop and persist, 
as well as in tailoring approaches to individual experiences. Maiese 
(2021) similarly characterizes mental disorders as disruptions in 
meaning construction and introduces the concept of habits to 
elucidate the formation and maintenance of these disorders. But, one 
limit of Maiese’s approach might be the potential overemphasis on 
social expectations. Social expectations are dynamic; a particular 
behavior may be  deemed appropriate in some contexts while 
considered socially inappropriate in others. This variability can result 
in misinterpretations of certain normative behaviors.
Nielsen (2023, p. 97) concludes all three views seem to agree that: 
(1) mental disorders can in some sense be understood as disruptions 
to sense-making; (2) this allows for a holistic and integrated/embodied 
view of mental disorder; (3) this also allows for a middle way between 
naturalist and normative views.
By utilizing the core conceptual tools of 3E cognition, a framework 
for 3E psychopathology can be established. Its specific components are 
presented in Table 1.
Leveraging these tools, 3E cognition emerges as a valuable perspective 
for explaining mental disorders. The original 3E conceptual model was 
developed from earlier structurally oriented and normatively oriented 
classification models. Structurally, the functional model in 3E 
psychopathology serves as a flexible concept that summarizes the intricate 
evolutionary history, cultural adaptation, and learning into a basic 
framework illustrating individuals’ efforts to survive and thrive. Mental 
disorders are viewed as dysfunctional patterns of constructing meaning 
that individuals tend to adopt. These patterns are recognized as intricate, 
multi-layered structures with interrelated causal networks present in 
brain–body-environment systems (Nielsen and Ward, 2018). Different 
from traditional disease models, mental disorders under the 3E 
framework are not simply caused by a single cause, but the result of the 
interaction of multiple factors. For example, in anxiety disorders, multiple 
factors may be involved, such as genetic factors, an individual’s early life 
experiences, current life stress, and abnormal regulation of the brain’s 
neurotransmitter system, which create a vicious cycle in the individual’s 
meaning-making process, leading to the persistence of anxiety symptoms. 
This structural understanding emphasizes the complexity and 
systematicness of mental disorders, which require comprehensive 
consideration of factors at multiple levels. From the normative point of 
view, mental disorders are the result of the serious contradiction between 
the individual’s meaning construction model and its functional norms, 
which will interfere with the normal function and quality of life of the 
individual (Thornton, 2000). In determining whether a behavior or 
mental state is a mental disorder, it is necessary to consider the individual’s 
unique background and functional needs. Normative judgments 
emphasize the importance of individual differences and situational factors 
and avoid simply diagnosing mental disorders based on statistical criteria 
Shang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1578600
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
or societal perceptions. These two aspects are also known as the skeleton 
of the 3E conceptual model.
3 Discussions
In the rapidly evolving field of psychopathology, several key elements 
significantly influence our understanding, exploration, and treatment of 
mental disorders. The development of psychopathology has been lengthy 
and complex, with its gradual integration into cognitive sciences emerging 
as an inevitable trend. This discussion will be structured around three 
primary aspects: First, we will examine the concept of “development” in 
the evolution of psychopathology and analyze how it shapes the current 
research landscape. Second, we  will expand the conceptualizations, 
classifications, explanations, and treatment approaches from a pluralistic 
perspective, thereby invigorating psychopathology through their 
interactions. Third, we will focus on the progressive transformation from 
the 3E model to the 4E model, exploring the profound implications of this 
expansion for deepening the understanding of psychopathology and 
extending the boundaries of practice. Through a detailed analysis of these 
three points, we  aim to illuminate the driving forces and challenges 
behind the vigorous development of psychopathology, providing a more 
robust theoretical foundation for future research and clinical applications.
3.1 The problem of “development” in 
psychopathology
Since the inception of psychopathology, research has shifted from 
mere symptom descriptions to the exploration of underlying 
mechanisms. Early studies primarily focused on external behaviors 
and symptoms, with diagnoses relying on subjective judgment and 
clinical experience. However, with advancements in science and 
technology and the diversification of research methods, there has been 
a deeper exploration of the biological, psychological, and sociological 
factors contributing to mental disorders (Berenbaum, 2013).
Nevertheless, significant challenges remain in the field’s current 
development. First, the heterogeneity of mental disorders is 
exceptionally high; symptomatic manifestations, pathogenesis, and 
treatment responses can vary significantly among individuals with the 
same disorder, complicating the formulation of uniform diagnostic 
criteria and effective treatment programs ( Kendler, 2012 ). 
Additionally, there are gaps in our understanding of complex disorders 
such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, whose etiology and 
pathogenesis are not yet fully elucidated.
In our view, the advancement of psychopathology should 
emphasize interdisciplinary integration. Beyond traditional fields, 
there should be active collaboration with emerging disciplines such 
as computer science and artificial intelligence ( Insel and Cuthbert, 
2015). Furthermore, the implementation of large-scale longitudinal 
studies should be applied to monitor the long-term progression of 
mental disorders, allowing for a deeper understanding of their 
dynamic changes and the formulation of more targeted 
interventions. Additionally, we  emphasize the importance of 
establishing a standardized research framework. This includes 
creating unified data collection standards for mental disorders that 
encompass symptom assessment, genetic testing, and brain function 
imaging to facilitate data integration and comparison across studies. 
Standardizing research design and statistical analysis methods will 
enhance the reliability and reproducibility of research results, 
thereby elucidating the etiology and pathogenesis of mental 
disorders and laying the groundwork for accurate diagnosis and 
treatment. Finally, future development must prioritize the 
experiences and participation of patients. Engaging patients and 
their families in research design and decision-making is essential to 
ensure that research questions align with their needs. In clinical 
practice, establishing a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment 
model that respects patients’ preferences and values, while enabling 
their active participation in treatment planning, is crucial 
(Johnstone, 2018 ). Moreover, feedback and suggestions can 
be gathered through patient organizations and community activities 
to continuously refine the theories and practices of psychopathology.
TABLE 1 The core conceptual tools of the 3E cognition framework.
Conceptual tools Main contents
Organizational causality, 
constitution, and dual 
aspectivity
It is essential to consider the organization and composition of individuals within their broader environment. It should also overcome the 
dualism of psychology and physics by analyzing the phenomenon of mental disorders from multiple levels through a dual orientation.
Naturalized normativity
Drawing from the processes of self-maintenance and adaptation in life, it is posited that norms and values emerge naturally and are closely 
linked to individual survival and development needs (Thompson, 2007).
Cultural embeddedness
It emphasizes the formation and development of individual meaning construction and behavioral patterns within specific cultural contexts. The 
values, beliefs, and social norms of different cultures significantly influence the perception and expression of mental disorders, as evidenced by 
varying cultural attitudes toward emotional expression. Incorporating this factor into research can mitigate cultural bias and facilitate the 
development of culturally adaptive treatment programs.
Thoroughgoing affectivity
Emotion is intricately linked to cognition and serves as a crucial force in meaning construction and behavior motivation (Krueger and 
Colombetti, 2018). In individuals with depression, negative emotions can significantly distort perceptions and interpretations of the world, 
thereby exacerbating symptoms. Understanding the role of emotion in this context could inform the development of treatments, such as training 
in emotional regulation skills.
A developmental 
perspective
Emphasis is placed on the influence of an individual’s history and developmental processes—including evolutionary, sociocultural, and 
individual life cycles—on current psychological states. Consequently, targeted prevention and intervention strategies can be implemented.
Demand for pluralism
A pluralistic approach that encompasses diverse conceptual definitions, classification methods, interpretive models, and therapeutic strategies is 
recommended for both research and treatment. Various mental disorders necessitate distinct strategies, promoting the flexible selection and 
integration of approaches to enhance effectiveness.

Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
3.2 The plurality of conceptualization, 
classification, explanation, and treatment
According to Nielsen, pluralism has become a central pillar in the 
understanding and treatment of mental disorders, permeating every 
level of conceptualization, classification, explanation, and treatment. 
This pluralism reshapes our cognitive framework and practical 
approach to this complex field.
Conceptual pluralism reveals the richness of mental disorders by 
moving beyond a singular perspective. From a biological standpoint, 
certain mental disorders are viewed as manifestations of neurotransmitter 
imbalances or abnormal neural circuitry. The psychological dimension 
emphasizes factors such as cognitive biases, early experiences, and 
psychological defense mechanisms. The socio-cultural aspect 
underscores the significant influence of the social environment, cultural 
values, and family upbringing on individual mental states, such as the 
distinct interpretations and coping mechanisms related to certain 
spiritual phenomena in various cultures. This conceptual diversity 
encourages the integration of multidisciplinary insights, allowing for a 
holistic understanding of mental disorders while avoiding one-sided 
attributions (Haslam, 2002).
In addressing classification issues, the 3E psychopathology 
framework advocates for classification pluralism and humility. 
Although traditional classification systems for mental disorders, such 
as DSM, have standardized the diagnostic process to some extent, they 
also encounter numerous challenges (Lilienfeld and Treadway, 2016; 
Zachar and Kendler, 2017). Classification pluralism posits that, due to 
the complexity of mental disorders as conceptualized by the 3E 
framework, multiple effective classification methods should 
be  explored ( Markon, 2013 ). In clinical practice, we  often face 
ambiguous boundaries and individual differences in patients’ 
symptoms, complicating the application of a singular classification 
standard. Advocacy for diversified classification supports the 
development of multiple models based on varying theoretical 
foundations, clinical characteristics, and research objectives. For 
example, classification could extend beyond symptomatology to 
include etiology, disease progression, or levels of functional 
impairment. This approach facilitates a more nuanced understanding 
of the distinct types of mental disorders, enhances the accuracy and 
specificity of diagnoses, and lays a solid foundation for tailored 
treatment plans that better meet patients’ diverse needs.
An explanation consists of explicit or implicit assumptions, 
typically presented as a series of premises, a model, a theory, a 
narrative, or a classification of causal information, aiming to elucidate 
the origin or perpetual presence of a single phenomenon or a group 
of phenomena (Haig, 2014; Thagard, 2019). There can be multiple 
different ways of interpreting the various changes in human behavior 
and experience. Explanation is also a practical task (Potochnik, 2016). 
Different backgrounds bring different investigative tools, different 
interpretive purposes, and different audiences, which may lead to 
differences in the quality of explanations.
Explanatory pluralism plays a crucial role in connecting various 
approaches within psychopathology. The explanation of mental 
disorders can be  examined from both research and clinical 
perspectives. From a research standpoint, a single-explanation model 
often fails to provide a comprehensive understanding. It is essential to 
explore diverse and integrated viewpoints across different concepts, 
analyze the causes and mechanisms of mental disorders from multiple 
dimensions, and investigate the complex causal relationships that 
form a holistic explanation (Clack and Ward, 2020). This process can 
be likened to assembling a jigsaw puzzle, where a complete picture 
emerges from various pieces.
The interpretative work conducted from a clinical perspective 
signifies the initial steps in therapeutic development and establishes a 
foundation for precision therapy. Patient responses to treatment can 
vary significantly due to their unique characteristics, symptomatology, 
and life backgrounds. Treatment pluralism encompasses various 
modalities, including medication, psychotherapy, physical therapy, 
and social support, emphasizing the need for flexible combinations 
tailored to the specific circumstances of each patient. For serious 
mental disorders, medication may be critical for symptom relief, while 
issues primarily influenced by psychological factors may benefit from 
therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis, or 
humanistic therapy, which help patients reshape their cognition and 
address psychological trauma ( Bruch, 2015; Macneil et  al., 2012). 
Additionally, emerging technologies, such as transcranial magnetic 
stimulation, offer new hope for some patients. Furthermore, the 
involvement of social support systems, including family support and 
community rehabilitation, is vital for the long-term recovery and 
social integration of patients. The diversity of treatment options 
ensures that each patient receives the most suitable treatment plan, 
maximizing therapeutic effectiveness and promoting mental health 
recovery and social functioning.
3.3 From 3E to 4E: a possible expansion of 
Nielsen’s project
In contemporary psychopathology, integrating cognitive sciences 
has become a dynamic and promising trend, driving research and 
practical advancements. This collaboration improves understanding 
of cognitive structures, sensory processing, and behavioral patterns in 
mental disorders. The 3E framework—embodied, embedded, and 
enactive cognition—addresses the limitations of traditional 
approaches by emphasizing the role of physical state, environment, 
and interactions.
Enactivism underscores the constitutive role of interaction between 
individuals and their environments in the formation of meaning, thereby 
foregrounding agency and the patient’s active engagement in treatment. 
This framework fosters self-efficacy and supports recovery, marking a 
departure from passive models of care. In clinical practice, adopting the 
3E perspective enables clinicians to assess patients comprehensively and 
devise individualized treatment strategies that attend to bodily health, 
modify environmental conditions, and facilitate positive processes of 
meaning-making conducive to recovery (Di Paolo, 2005; Nielsen and 
Ward, 2018). The enactivist framework provides a distinctive perspective 
on anxiety disorders by stressing the interconnectedness of symptoms 
with both personal and environmental contexts. Unlike traditional 
models that treat anxiety as the result of internal dysfunction, enactivism 
emphasizes that symptoms arise from ongoing, dynamic interactions 
between individuals and their environments, further shaped by factors 
such as personality, coping styles, and social feedback. This approach 
foregrounds both the contextual embeddedness and the self-referential 
nature of anxiety, acknowledging that anxiety not only reflects situational 
factors but also reveals personal vulnerabilities and concerns. Clinically, 
the enactive paradigm supports recognizing and interpreting nonverbal 
Shang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1578600
Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org
cues—like facial expressions, body posture, and muscle tension—as 
manifestations of anxiety, encouraging patients to notice and articulate 
their bodily sensations for greater self-understanding and improved 
anxiety management. As Glas (2020) argues, by situating anxiety within 
this broader interactive framework, enactivism aligns with clinical 
intuition and fosters a move away from reductionist biomedical models. 
This promotes a richer, more nuanced, and patient-centered 
understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders.2
While the 3E approach to cognition has marked significant 
progress, the extended dimension of 4E cognition stands to yield 
further advances. This extension holds that cognitive processes are not 
confined to the individual or their immediate environment but are 
fundamentally embedded in wider social and cultural contexts 
(Rowlands, 2010). The social dimension involves the integration of 
cognition within social networks—family, peers, and professional 
circles—where relations and shared practices modulate thought and 
action through mechanisms such as support, comparison, and 
prevailing norms. The cultural dimension emphasizes that cognition 
is shaped by traditions, values, and systems of belief, with education, 
media, and social learning playing critical roles in structuring mental 
processes. Finally, the technological dimension recognizes that 
cognition is mediated by an increasingly complex array of tools and 
technologies. These not only alter how information is gathered and 
processed but also reshape patterns of social interaction and the very 
development of cognitive capacities ( Chen et  al., 2024; Dong and 
Chen, 2025; Dong et al., 2025). This conception thus broadens the 
philosophical analysis of cognition, situating it within a social, 
cultural, and technological ecology.
The introduction of these extended dimensions allows the 4E 
cognitive framework to more comprehensively explain the complexities 
of cognition and behavior. Specifically, the 4E cognitive framework offers 
several potential advantages: First, it provides a more comprehensive 
explanation, as it accounts for not only the influence of the individual’s 
body and immediate environment but also social, cultural, and 
technological factors. This holistic approach enhances our understanding 
of individual cognitive and behavioral performance across various 
contexts (Steiner, 2023). Second, it facilitates more effective interventions 
by offering a theoretical foundation for developing personalized and 
comprehensive treatment programs. By incorporating multifaceted 
factors, clinicians can devise interventions that may be more effective, 
such as psychotherapy that integrates social support networks and cultural 
contexts. Finally, the 4E cognitive framework encourages interdisciplinary 
research, fostering collaboration among scholars in psychology, sociology, 
cultural studies, and technical sciences to explore the intricacies of 
cognition and behavior (Lassiter and Vukov, 2021). This multidisciplinary 
approach aids in understanding the causes and mechanisms of 
mental disorders.
4 Conclusion
The integration of psychopathology with cognitive sciences, 
alongside the development of the 3E psychopathology framework, 
2 Thanks to the reviewer for drawing our attention to this point and the 
relevant example.
constitutes a substantial advancement in the field, both 
theoretically and practically. These developments offer new avenues 
for achieving a comprehensive understanding of mental disorders 
and devising effective interventions, while also posing several 
challenges. It is crucial to adopt an open, innovative, and 
interdisciplinary approach to refine and advance the field of 
psychopathology, thereby enhancing its scientific rigor, precision, 
and humane aspects. Such an approach not only improves 
diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for mental disorders 
but also enhances patients’ quality of life and reduces social 
prejudice and discrimination. We  aspire to bring hope and 
rehabilitation to a greater number of individuals with mental
