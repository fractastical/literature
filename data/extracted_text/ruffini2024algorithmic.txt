Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex, heterogeneous condition affecting millions
worldwide. Computational neuropsychiatry offers potential breakthroughs through the mechanistic
modeling of this disorder. Using the Kolmogorov theory (KT) of consciousness, we developed a
foundational model where algorithmic agents interact with the world to maximize an Objective
Function evaluating affective valence. Depression, defined in this context by a state of persistently
low valence, may arise from various factors—including inaccurate world models (cognitive biases),
a dysfunctional Objective Function (anhedonia, anxiety), deficient planning (executive deficits),
or unfavorable environments. Integrating algorithmic, dynamical systems, and neurobiological
concepts, we map the agent model to brain circuits and functional networks, framing potential
etiological routes and linking with depression biotypes. Finally, we explore how brain stimulation,
psychotherapy, and plasticity-enhancing compounds such as psychedelics can synergistically repair
neural circuits and optimize therapies using personalized computational models.

1. Introduction
Psychiatric disorders account for 23% of the global burden of diseases, with depression
as the leading cause [1]. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive and debilitating
mental health condition affecting hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide, char-
acterized by a persistent first-person experience of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of
interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia) [2,3]. Globally, an estimated 5% of adults suffer
from depression, with a higher prevalence among women than men [4]. Furthermore, the
incidence of MDD has increased significantly among the young in recent years [ 5], and
adolescents with MDD are up to 30 times more likely to commit suicide [ 6] (more than
700,000 people die due to suicide every year; it is the fourth leading cause of death in
15–29-year-old individuals [4]). In addition to the considerable burden on personal welfare,
depression is accompanied by substantial costs, including health care expenses, as well as
less work productivity and higher mortality risk.
MDD is not a single disorder but a highly heterogeneous, multifactorial, and complex
phenotype [7]. It encompasses a variety of different disorders, each with its unique causes,
symptoms, etiological routes, and treatment responses [8], sometimes referred to as the
“spectrum concept” of depression [ 9]. The symptoms of MDD can vary widely among
individuals, with differences in severity, frequency, and duration. This variability is com-
pounded by the frequent co-occurrence of other conditions, such as anxiety disorders or
Entropy 2024, 26, 953. https://doi.org/10.3390/e26110953 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 2 of 71
substance use disorders, which can further influence the presentation and course of MDD.
As a result, the current definition of depression often leads to a low diagnostic agreement
among practitioners, especially when compared to other psychiatric conditions [6].
The limited progress in treating MDD can be attributed to these foundational issues in
methodology and theory [7]. Recent research has demonstrated that depression and anxiety
patient profiles can be segregated into distinct biotypes. These biotypes, as we discuss
below, are characterized by differences in symptoms, behavioral performance on general
and emotional cognitive computerized tests, and responses to both pharmacotherapy and
behavioral therapy [10–12]. This evidence strongly suggests that a personalized approach
to treatment, which considers the specific symptom profile and underlying causes for each
individual, is essential for effective intervention [12].
While the effects of antidepressants like escitalopram are modest [1] and group-specific,
emerging research in the fields of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (TMS) [13] or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [14,15], and
serotonergic psychedelics [16] provide promising avenues for novel therapeutic strategies.
However, the underlying mechanisms governing these interventions and their possible
synergistic effects are yet to be fully explored and understood. In particular, while non-
invasive brain stimulation can modify brain dynamics and elicit plastic effects, psychedelics
may further enhance circuital effects by boosting plasticity and increasing brain dynamics
complexity, rendering the system more receptive and malleable to stimulation [17].
To maximize the chance for therapeutic success, it is important to start from a mech-
anistic framework for both illness and therapy [ 18]. The complex etiology and network
character of MDD motivate the development of whole-brain computational models of this
disorder [19,20]. The vision is the synthesis of digital twins or neurotwins, computational
models of the patient’s brain [ 21–23] representing both physical and network/circuital
aspects at multiple scales. A neurotwin can be personalized by assimilating structural and
functional neuroimaging data and is designed to reflect the pathology of the patient with
sufficient detail for developing personalized, optimized treatments, which can include
brain stimulation and pharmacological interventions [24–26].
Here, we propose to bridge the historical gap between neurology and psychiatry,
underscoring their interconnectedness in understanding mental health disorders. By recog-
nizing the interplay between the brain’s physical structure (akin to computer hardware)
and mental processes (software and dynamics), we aim to develop a unified model of MDD
integrated with the systems of neuroscience, neuropsychiatry, algorithmic information
theory, and dynamical systems theory. This will facilitate the identification of affected
circuits to dissect MDD etiology. In this work, we focus on implementing this approach
within the algorithmic agent framework (or agent framework in short), as defined in the
Kolmogorov or algorithmic information theory of consciousness (KT) [27,28]. This perspec-
tive emphasizes the importance of integrating computation (mathematics), neuroscience
(third-person perspective), and first-person experience when studying depression and
other neuropsychiatric conditions, as they offer essential insights for guiding research and
clinical applications.
Remarkably, the agent framework offers a transformative approach in neuroscience,
akin to viewing the human body through its distinct but interconnected systems, or ana-
lyzing an artificial system like an airplane via its electrical, avionics, and power systems.
The same analogy can be made with the analysis of well-designed code, which can gain
a lot from its modularization. If successful, a subdivision into subsystems/submodules
separates functions and minimizes interdependencies while maximizing comprehensibility.
As we shall see, the agent framework guides the dissection of complex neural processes into
simply defined elements: the Modeling Engine, the Objective Function, and the Planning
Engine. Each element corresponds to specific brain regions and circuits, facilitating a more
granular understanding of neural functions. Furthermore, the universality of the agent
model makes it a powerful tool for conceptual unification, bridging biology and evolution,
and extending its applicability to artificial intelligence.

Within this framework, we characterize depression as a disorder of the agent rooted
in the malfunction processes influencing the complex process of valence evaluation. We
posit that the complexity and diversity inherent to depressive conditions reflect the intri-
cate, multisystem nature of valence evaluation itself. This distinguishes depression from
conditions like epilepsy or cancer, where negative valence (reduced well-being) may be
evaluated correctly in response to external life events (e.g., disease). We conjecture that the
complexity of depression stems from the multiplicity and diversity of systems involved in
valence evaluation.
Connecting third and first-person perspectives, we propose a scientific triangula-
tion [29] among neural, behavioral, and experiential viewpoints that span across both
species and the natural-to-artificial divide stemming from the concept of structured experi-
ence and valence—which in KT we associate with the structure of world models and output
of the Objective Function. As we discuss in more detail in the next sections, these concepts
provide the scaffold to analyze the etiology of depression in humans. This approach,
represented in Figure 1, reflects the vision and roadmap for our analysis and connects this
abstract perspective with neurobiology, systems neuroscience, and the dynamical perspec-
tive. With this basis, we discuss strategies for stratification and model-based personalized
treatment of patients using non-invasive brain stimulation combined with neuroplastogens
such as psychedelics. As an added benefit of this interdisciplinary exercise, our integrated
approach will allow us to extend our understanding of the etiology and phenomenology of
MDD to other natural or artificial agents.
Finally, in this paper, we focus on human agents (patients). It is important to clarify
that the term agent is not used in a derogatory manner toward individuals experiencing
MDD. Rather, it refers to a technical concept central to an algorithmic framework for
modeling and decision-making.

theoretical functional modules from the perspective of circuits and dynamics with special emphasis
on the clinical biotypes pertaining to MDD. Based on brain circuits and individualized biotypes,
different MDD interventions are proposed for treatment.
2. The Algorithmic Agent Model
The exploration of consciousness is an age-long topic of profound interest and com-
plexity. The subjective nature of consciousness, often described as the “what it is like to be”
experience, alongside its organized nature, presents significant challenges for empirical
study. In earlier work, we provided a unifying framework to study consciousness in natural
and artificial systems based on algorithmic information theory (AIT)—which we refer to as
the Kolmogorov theory (KT) for its foundations on Kolmogorov complexity. Within this
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 4 of 71
framework, we suggest that the brain’s primary role as an information compressor [30,31]
gives rise to our structured experience of reality [27,28,32]. We further hypothesized that
the successful comparison of models with empirical data generates the qualia of struc-
tured experience in computational systems, referred to as agents (for an overview of the
metaphysical foundations of the theory, see Appendix E).
Definition 1 (Algorithmic Agent). An algorithmic agent is an information-processing system
with an Objective Function that interacts bidirectionally with the external world, creating and
running compressive models, planning, and acting to maximize its Objective Function.
Our definition of agent is inspired by natural agents—information-processing systems
equipped with elements critical for evolutionary endurance such as homeostasis (preserva-
tion of self, from the Greek “staying the same across distance” in time) and telehomeostasis
(preservation of kin, from the Greek “staying the same across distance” in time), or more
simply stasis. These terms describe the emergent, goal-directed behavior of agents to
maintain the stability of their algorithmic pattern over time. Unlike homeostasis, with con-
notations to reactive stability [33], or allostasis (adaptive prediction) [34], telehomeostasis
refers to the intentional drive to preserve an algorithmic pattern through active mainte-
nance. In contrast to autopoiesis, which focuses on self-reproduction [35], telehomeostasis
emphasizes long-term persistence through both homeostasis and copying. The definition
is central to our analysis of MDD, as it underscores the role of information processing,
compression, and planning to subserve the agent’s goals, giving rise to the emergence of
structured experience and emotion. Examples of agents include animals, plants, and life
in general. The definition is also directly applicable to artificial systems [28]. Indeed, the
notion of agent we use here parallels the ones in the foundational literature of artificial
intelligence [36]. In Russel and Norvig (1995), an agent is defined as “anything that can be
viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment
through actuators” and a “rational agent” as one that “acts so as to maximize the expected
value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge” [36]. In their
terminology, our algorithmic agent can be seen as a utility-based agent that uses data to
build models of the world. In the context of KT, agents are further motivated as an interest-
ing minimalistic solution to the problem of “persistence” of programs in a computational
soup [28]). A formal algorithmic specification of the agent is provided in Appendix B, and
the relation of the agent framework to the perspective of embodied cognition is discussed
in Appendix F.
The agent, as a consequence of creating and running models of the (external) world and
itself, is a system with high mutual algorithmic information with its environment [27,28].
It can be deconstructed into a set of minimal interconnected modules necessary for
stasis [27], each playing a crucial role in the agent’s function: a Modeling Engine, an Objective
Function, and aPlanning Engine (see Figure 2 and the discussion in Section 2.2). These may be
realized in artificial or biological systems in a holistic, distributed, and hierarchical manner
involving brain networks and complex multistable dynamics. Their implementation as
neural networks, however, is also expected to make them difficult to differentiate. As
discussed in [37], the theoretical framework formalizes the notion of such modules. For
example, the regulator theorem, a key result in the field of cybernetics, states that “Every
good regulator of a system must be a model of that system” [ 38,39]. In other words, to
effectively control a system, the regulator must have a representation or model of the
system that captures its essential characteristics. The model, built through the assimilation
of past data across timescales, including that from sensors and/or agent actions (see,
e.g., [40]), allows the regulator to predict the system’s behavior and adjust its control
actions accordingly. In the language of AIT, we express the same by saying that agent
and world have a high mutual algorithmic information. The model could be explicitly
encoded or inherently integrated within the natural agent’s design—a distinction that
dissolves within the realm of algorithmic entities. Similarly, if an agent has to act, choosing
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 5 of 71
an action among many may be seen as optimizing an objective or value function. The
agent’s external interface or “information membrane” enables its interaction with the external
world, mediating both inputs received via sensors and outputs directed to the environment
through actuators or effectors. In the Free Energy Principle formulation, this is captured
by the notion of a Markov blanket [41,42]—a set of variables that insulates a set of target
variables (the agent or world) from the rest of the variables in the system.

b) MDD AGENTa) AGENT
Figure 2. (a) Generic agent model. The agent interacts dynamically with its environment and is
involved in continuously exchanging data with the external world. The modeling engine runs the
model and makes predictions of future data (both from external interfaces and the agent’s own
actions). Then, the prediction error (from the Comparator) is evaluated to update the model. The
Updater receives prediction errors from the Comparator to improve the model. The Simulator is
a shared infrastructure used to run simulations for planning or valence evaluation. The Planning
Engine runs counterfactual simulations and selects plans for the next actions (agent outputs). A
key agent element is the Objective Function, which the agent aims to optimize through a choice of
afferent actions selected by the Planning Engine. (b) MDD agent. Non-exclusive dysfunction across
the main agent components (b1–b3) or hostile world inputs (b4) can result in sustained low output
values from the Objective Function (low valence, red arrow). Identifying those can help us identify
the routes that lead the agent to a depressed state.
In KT, agents enjoy structured experience, or S, a central theory concept that bridges
the first and third-person views of cognition. This is defined as the spatial, temporal, and
conceptual organization of our first-person experience of the world and ourselves as agents
in it. Essentially, the creation and use of compressive models by agents, such as biological
recurrent neural networks, provide the structure to phenomenal experience. These models
can be seen as the mathematical version of Platonic forms—the non-physical conceptual
realities that capture the true essence of material reality (the shadows of forms) [29,43]. In
this context, S stands for the descriptors of model characteristics and structure [28,44].
The central hypothesis in KT is as follows.
Hypothesis 1 (Structured Experience). An agent has structured experience (S) to the extent it
has access to encompassing, accurate, and compressive models to interact with the world. Program
length and other characteristics deriving from the structure of the model being run determine the
structure of experience [27,28]. The event of structured experience associated with presence—the
sensation of perceiving oneself as being in a real place [ 45], or more broadly, what we may call
ontophoria (the qualia of immersion in being itself, connoting an existential experience of presence
within the entirety of reality), arises from the successful alignment between model-generated and
external world data [31].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 6 of 71
The compressive nature of such models (programs) allows agents to store them (mem-
ory) and report them to the self and others, i.e., for the conscious (verbal, behavioral) report,
which underpins current consciousness research. The qualitative aspects of structured
experience are thus associated with the algorithmic features of the model used, including
its length (models are programs in KT), which reflects the structure discovered in the data.
2.1. Emotions as Structured Valence
A crucial dimension of human experience is emotion and mood. Importantly, with
regard to MDD diagnostic criteria, the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5) refers to the
subjective concepts of mood and pleasure. In the agent model framework, we add valence,
the output of the Objective Function. In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, valence is
typically defined as the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or adverseness (negative
valence) of an event, object, or situation. It is an integral part of the emotional experience,
representing one of the two primary dimensions of emotion—the other being arousal [46].
Valence is closely linked to the experiences of pleasure and pain.
It follows that our tenet represents emotion or mood as structured experience with
valence, or structured valence for short. In other words, the experiential nuance of emotions
is derived from the world model’s features together with a valence value produced by the
agent’s evaluation of the model using its Objective Function. Valence here encompasses the
spectrum from pleasure to pain. Whether valence is positive or negative, or only more or
less positive (or negative), is not a crucial distinction in this framework. All that matters is
that it is a scalar in some interval in R.
Definition 2 (Emotional state or Mood of an Agent). The emotional state of the Agent is the
tuple E = (Model, Valence). In first-person language, emotion is structured experience with valence,
and can be described along dimensions characterizing model structure (simplicity, breadth, accuracy,
etc.) and valence.
The concept of emotion as a “world model with valence” can be seen as a synthesis of
several key theories in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. First, appraisal theory
posits that emotions arise from our cognitive evaluations of events, suggesting that our
emotions are tied to our interpretation or understanding of the world around us [47,48].
This aligns with the “world model with valence” aspect of the agent model. Second, the
valence component is consistent with Schachter and Singer’s two-factor theory [49], which
emphasizes the role of cognitive interpretation in labeling our physiological arousal as a
particular emotion [50]. Third, Barrett’s theory of constructed emotions further underscores
the importance of cognitive processes, suggesting that our world model actively constructs
emotions based on experiences, culture, and context [ 51,52]. Fourth, the functional ap-
proach to understanding emotions, as defined by Adolphs and Anderson, proposes that
emotions should be understood by their functions, which can be seen as the changes and
behaviors incited by our brain’s interpretation of the world [53]. This also resonates with
the idea of emotion as a “world model with valence” in the agent framework. Finally,
the agent perspective is well aligned with constructivist approaches [49], because world
models in KT are hierarchical mathematical structures that map into biological circuits. As
defined in this paper, these theories collectively provide a foundation for understanding
emotion as a “world model with valence”.
2.2. Algorithmic Agent in MDD
The following formulation defines depression as an emergent property of a dysregu-
lated system with persistently low valence.
Definition 3 (Depressed Agent). Depression is a pathological state in which the output value of
the Objective Function (valence) of an agent is persistently low.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 7 of 71
How does an agent reach a condition of persistently low valence? A key advantage of
the abstract agent framework is that it allows the dissecting of alternative routes to answer
this question, including the dysfunction of any of its modules.
The onset of depression in the physiological agent can stem from different types of
stressors, both acute and chronic. It may be caused by various interacting pathological
mechanisms, including neurotransmitter imbalances, hormonal dysregulation, inflamma-
tion, neuroplasticity changes, genetic susceptibility, and complex interactions between
different organs and systems [54]. Alternatively, depression may originate from a traumatic
event, where a sudden influx of novel information alters the agent’s world model, leading
to a rapid and significant decrease in valence. This “model-shock” can destabilize the
agent dynamics, rendering it unable to predict or secure positive future states—further
contributing to the onset and persistence of depression. If the agent cannot compensate for
the reduced valence due to such dysfunctions, it becomes trapped in a persistently low-
valence state, which can be understood as depression—an emergent dynamical property of
a dysregulated agent system.
This perspective conceptualizes depression as a state of disrupted cognitive and
emotional stasis, emphasizing the persistence of reduced valence that distinguishes clinical
depression from transient dysphoria. From an evolutionary standpoint, the mechanisms
underpinning this maladaptive state may have roots in the very processes that shape our
cognitive faculties. Thus, depression is more than a transient response; it is a pathological
state posing a threat to the stability of the agent’s internal equilibrium, making it critical to
address not just the symptoms but the underlying regulatory dysfunctions that perpetuate
the disorder [55].
Within this framework, we can identify different agent components where dysfunction
or natural changes may result in persistent low output values from the Objective Function,
i.e., potential causes or etiological routes and symptoms of depression in the agent (see
Figure 2). The constituents of the agent and their dysfunctions in the context of MDD are
articulated as follows.
2.2.1. The Modeling Engine
The Modeling Engine is responsible for building, refining, and running the agent’s
model of the “universe”, which includes both the external world (environment) and the
agent itself. This generative model is used to predict future events and compare these
predictions with actual incoming data.
The Modeling Engine’s failure in producing accurate world models—deriving from
errors in model construction, dysfunctional plasticity, etc.—is a threat to tele/homeostasis
(preservation of pattern) and thus leads to low valence. Erroneous representations of the
world influence the evaluation of valence by the Objective Function and the output of
action plans by the Planning Engine, cascading into further detrimental effects on valence
from bad plans and actions.
The Simulator, which may be viewed as part of the Modeling Engine, unpacks models
into simulated data for various agent components, including the Modeling Engine and its
model Updater, the Objective Function, and the Planning Engine. It allows the agent to run
models and simulate the world. A dysfunction within the Simulator will have catastrophic
consequences for all these interconnected modules. Faulty simulations (or Updater errors)
will prevent accurate model updates, leading to poor or maladaptive world models that
distort reality. Furthermore, faulty simulations impair the agent’s ability to correctly
evaluate valence and plan effective actions, reinforcing the negative cognitive loops that
are central to MDD. Without accurate simulations, the agent’s decision-making and ability
to adapt to its environment will degrade, worsening symptoms such as hopelessness,
indecision, and emotional evaluation.
The Comparatoris responsible for assessing the congruence between the model-generated
data (predictions) and the actual incoming data, generating an error signal to alert the engine
of modeling failuresand which is used to refine the model. Again, this is closely related
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 8 of 71
to the evaluation of Free Energy in the Active Inference framework (AIF) [ 39], but here
the comparison is not weighted by goal-oriented priors [28]. A Comparator malfunction
will impact the model Updater, leading the Modeling Engine to produce incorrect models.
It will also affect the agent’s ability to maintain (first-person) ontophoria, which depends
on an accurate comparison between model-generated data and sensory data. When the
faulty Comparator produces low errors, the agent becomes overconfident in flawed models,
avoiding necessary updates, leading to distorted Objective Function evaluation (valence)
and poor planning. On the other hand, when the Comparator erroneously signals high
errors, the agent loses confidence in its models, triggering excessive updates and disrupting
structured experience. This can lead to derealization, where the world feels fragmented
or unreal, impairing both decision-making and effective interaction with the environment.
Valence evaluation, which also hinges on having confidence in a world model, will be
biased negatively.
Finally, the Modeling Engine is influenced by other modules, such as the Objective
Function and Planning Engine. Models are built with a focus on elements critical to valence
evaluation, and model selection quantifies the cost of different types of errors on overall
utility. Just as utility functions guide optimal threshold selection in classification tasks by
prioritizing costly errors, the agent’s models may reflect a negative cognitive bias if errors
that lower valence are excessively weighted.
2.2.2. The Objective Function
The Objective Function is a key agent component in the context of KT and, crucially
so, in the study of MDD. It maps a model—whether that selected by the agent in the
present moment or posited in the process of planning—into a scalar quantity, which in KT
is directly identified with valence. This metric evaluates the agent’s state in relation to its
goals. For natural agents, valence assesses the probability of achieving tele/homeostasis,
thereby providing the basis for the selection of actions of future value. In biological or-
ganisms, natural selection selects agents that “stay” as patterns, a process that shapes
features of the agent, such as the Objective Function and Modeling Engine. In our theory,
the Objective Function value is the quantity optimized by the Planning Engine (discussed
below). The Objective Function, like other agent modules, may be realized as a distributed
system [56,57], with subsystems possibly tasked with assessing positive or negative contrib-
utors to tele/homeostasis. The computation of present or future contributions to valence
may be very complex as it entails running the world model and compressing the result
into a single number—explicitly or implicitly [37]. In the case of the human brain, many
distributed systems are likely involved in its calculation, from the basal ganglia to the
neocortex, as we discuss below. Recent investigations in depression using causal mapping
methods are converging on dichotomous circuits reflective of symptomatic dimensions
of positive and negative affect, which can be analogously mapped onto the Objective
Function’s architecture dedicated to valence computation [58–61]. Furthermore, the com-
putation of valence involves varying temporal scales, some of which are probably short (to
enable fast reaction times) while others may require longer ones (e.g., rumination through
the simulation of potential futures). The Objective Function thus may integrate evaluations
across these disparate temporal domains.
By definition, the agent will act in any way it can to increase its Objective Function
value, which may include steps for exploration and model building vs. exploitation. These
trade-offs will result from the specific formulation of the Objective Function, e.g., the
relative value of delayed returns. This refers to the idea that actions taken by an agent
affect not only the immediate reward but also the future rewards. This critical aspect of
reinforcement learning allows the agent to plan and make decisions considering long-term
outcomes rather than immediate gratification. The agent interacts with an environment
over discrete time steps to maximize its cumulative reward. At each time step t, it selects
an action at from a set of possible actions A, based on its current state st, and receives a
reward rt from the environment. The environment then transitions to a new state st+1. The
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 9 of 71
agent’s objective is to learn a policy π that maximizes the expected cumulative reward,
also known as the return Ot, which is defined as Ot = ∑∞
k=0 γkrt+k+1, where γ ∈ [0, 1] is a
discount factor that determines the present value.
The mathematical notion of future value links intuitively with the experience ofanxiety,
an emotion that typically arises in response to perceived threats, potential harm, or negative
future events. Thus, anxiety can be seen as a low valence state in anticipation of negative
outcomes or a devaluation of expected benefits.
A dysfunctional Objective Function is reflected in maladaptive valence evaluation.
Specifically, this pertains to a scenario where the function persistently yields low valence
values, irrespective of the informational substrates presented for evaluation (including
simulated scenarios from planning future actions). The complexity inherent in the ap-
praisal of valence implies that elements such as the Simulator can be the potential loci of
dysfunction. Furthermore, since world conditions can naturally lead to persistently low
Objective Function values, the Objective Function must be sufficiently malleable to ensure
the adaptation of the agent into new, harsher conditions. This highlights the importance of
the plasticity of the Objective Function—valence recalibration. If plasticity is absent, an
agent may not be able to recover following world insults. By recalibration, we mean a mech-
anism in the Objective Function to reset its output slowly to a baseline value if the world
model (Objective Function input) does not change favorably after some period of time. For
example, a persistently low value of valence due to past events may be detrimental in the
long term since this state will focus the agent’s efforts on raising it even if this is actually
impossible. A similar case can be made for persistent positive valence. In the literature, this
is known as hedonic adaptation, the idea that people tend to return to a relatively stable level
of happiness despite positive or negative events in their lives [62–64]. The hedonic set point
hypothesis or this theory postulates that each individual has a baseline level of happiness
or well-being to which they tend to return.
2.2.3. The Planning/Action Engine
The Planning/Action Engine uses the current world model, Simulator, and Objective
Function to formulate plans, which are then translated into actions at the external interface.
For brevity, we merge planning and action generation, acknowledging their conceptual dis-
tinction. The function of the Planning Engine is to produce plans (and consequent actions)
that increase the value of the Objective Function output (valence). Indirectly, planning
also subserves modeling via exploration and experimentation, but this is a consequence of
Objective Function maximization and the regulator theorem.
The Planning/Action engine of a depressed agent may produce plans that do not
increase valence or that further decrease it (i.e., producing actions that impact the world
with negative consequences for the agent). This potentially aligns with the “cognitive
biotype” (see Section 3) of depression [12,65], suggesting an intricate interplay between
planning mechanisms and depressive phenomenology.
Depressed patients often report a sensation of being “stuck”, unable to envisage
an emotional state of higher valence. This can be attributed to two failure modes of the
Planning Engine: first, an inability to identify a “target world” of higher valence, precluding
the formulation of actionable plans. Mathematically, this could be expressed as a failure
in both the local and global optimization of the valence landscape. Second, if such a
target is identified, the Planning Engine may be unable to formulate plans to reach an
identified more favorable world state with reasonable probability, i.e., a misestimation of
the likelihood of reaching that state with the best found plan. Both scenarios induce a
state of hopelessness, effectively paralyzing the agent into inaction. Although not explicitly
mentioned as part of the definition of depression, this concept links with the notion of
existential despair: a deep-seated sense of meaninglessness or futility, often accompanied by
the inability to envision a future where circumstances improve [66].

2.2.4. The World
The world, or environment, represents the all-encompassing environment where
the agents operate, providing input signals (information) to which the world models are
compared and the agents’ actions affect.
We refer here to an objectively hostile world in situations where the agent is subjected
to inputs signaling legitimate threats to its equilibrium/stasis, suggesting a universally
challenging environment that could diminish valence in a typical, healthy agent. Such con-
ditions, e.g., the loss of a family member, often initiate depressive episodes. Yet, in resilient
agents, episodes of diminished valence triggered by objectively adverse circumstances are
transient, with recovery ensuing via the Objective Function’s adaptive recalibration. This
plasticity may be absent in individuals exhibiting pathological responses.
2.3. The Agent Model and Dynamics
To better understand and treat MDD, integrating a dynamical systems approach with
algorithmic and neurobiological perspectives is essential. The agent is a computational
construct. But because computation is a dynamical process [67,68]—the Turing machine
itself is a discrete dynamical system characterized by state transitions over time—the
properties of the agent can be explored by viewing it as a dynamical system. From this
point of view, models and other agent components are programs that are “run” with agent
structure mapping directly onto dynamical system properties [28,44].
The connection between the agent model and dynamical systems theory provides pow-
erful tools for analysis, including bifurcation theory, differential geometry, and topology.
Analyzing the brain’s state dynamics and attractor landscapes offers more profound in-
sights into the mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric phenomena, such as multistability,
critical transitions, and symptom emergence in conditions like depression, schizophrenia,
and epilepsy. By integrating these dynamical tools, this approach bridges algorithmic fea-
tures, brain dynamics, and clinical phenomena, offering novel perspectives for theoretical
and empirical research in neuropsychiatry. This integration reveals the complex interac-
tions and feedback mechanisms underlying depressive states, aiding in the development of
effective therapies.
Along these lines, we recently introduced a framework integrating concepts from
dynamical systems, computational modeling, and complexity to explore the relationship
between neural dynamics, brain connectivity, and plasticity—all of them associated with the
realization of the agent model in the biological brain [69]. This interdisciplinary framework
can be used to analyze the mechanisms behind pathological disorders such as MDD and
the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelics.
Landscape Erosion in MDD
Analysis of the dynamical trajectories associated with the neural state of the agent
provides a different view of the interaction of the different agent modules. To understand
MDD under this framework, we can map state coordinates to an extra dimension encoding
the state of the Objective Function (valence) (in the same way that energy appears in
classical dynamical systems). The generalization of this is a Lyapunov function [ 70], a
function always increasing with time in a closed system except at equilibrium. In a normal,
healthy brain, subjected to external inputs, the value of the Objective Function will fluctuate
around a mean as trajectories explore the dynamical landscape (this corresponds to free
energy in the FEP). In this sense, we may think of the external world as providing some
steady state noisy input to the dynamical system until some significant changes occur
(e.g., trauma or psychotherapy). Consistent with neuroimaging studies exploring healthy
brain function, the landscape exhibits sufficient stability to allow for meaningful visits to
substates while simultaneously possessing enough flexibility to avoid being trapped in
a singular substate. In the brain affected by MDD, the dynamics are such that valence
consistently hovers around a low value, akin to a trough in a landscape. In terms of
dynamics, this is described as the system’s trajectories being anchored to an attractor within
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 11 of 71
a low-valence region. To illustrate how this happens, we can think of depression as being
triggered by a traumatic life event—an external input—that subsequently shifts the brain
into these low-valence states.
Traumatic incidents reshape the dynamic landscape: synapses undergo modifications,
serving as memory imprints of these events. Such transformations can create a pronounced
attractor region, capturing trajectories and compelling the agent’s plans and actions toward
escape. In a healthy agent, balancing mechanisms are at play: the system is geared towards
eventual adaptation, finding a new equilibrium with valence levels rising again, even
if the original cause of the valence drop remains. We propose that in a resilient brain,
the Objective Function undergoes plastic recalibration, causing the pronounced trough to
gradually level out. In the unhealthy brain, however, the landscape does not heal, possibly
due to the pathological plasticity function [71]. Healing entails finding plans to act on the
world to fix an external cause, adjust world models, or re-calibrate the Objective Function.
For example, there is evidence indicating that Objective Function recalibration may happen
during REM sleep [72], which may be impaired in sleep abnormalities (REM fragmentation).
All these actions can change the dynamical landscape. On the contrary, in the pathological
case and due to what we may call maladaptive plasticity [73], the recurrence of trajectories
in this deep well may further deform it into a deeper minimum, and the trajectories may
remain forever trapped. Inspired by the CANAL framework, we call this landscape erosion
or canalization [73].
3. Translational Framework
Here, we present the first preliminary mapping of the agent model onto neurobiologi-
cal substrates and biotypes. This translation is grounded in our current understanding of
the brain region and network functions, as well as emerging data-driven biotype classifica-
tions [10–12,65] which, while promising, require further validation. While this framework
will inevitably evolve as knowledge advances, it serves as an initial step toward demonstrat-
ing the model’s potential to bridge computational theory with neurobiological complexity.
See Appendix Tables A1 and A2 for details on each region and Appendix A.1 for a list of
acronyms. Appendix C provides a more in-depth review of the relevant brain regions.
3.1. Circuits, Functional Networks and Biotypes in MDD
Given the different ways some key terms are used in the literature—namely circuits
or pathways, (typically, “circuit” is used in the context of studying a function or behavior,
while”pathway” is used in the context of studying signal transmission), functional net-
works, and biotypes—we begin by defining them as they will be used in this paper. Since
our work employs a network neuroscience perspective, we start from the mathematical no-
tion of network: a network consists of a set of interconnected elements called nodes, together
with the set of their relationships (connections), represented by edges. More formally, a
network is defined as a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of edges,
each connecting a pair of nodes. From this foundation, we define the concepts of circuits
(see Box 1) and functional networks.
Definition 4 (Brain circuit or pathway). A brain circuit or pathway is an information processing
network consisting of brain regions (nodes) exchanging information through structural connections
(edges) including synapses, gap junctions, or ephaptic coupling, among others.
Definition 5 (Functional Network). A brain functional network is a network derived from
the activity of a brain circuit where nodes are brain regions and edges capture a mathematical
relationship between node activities.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 12 of 71
Box 1. Brain circuits involved in MDD.
The cortico-thalamic-striatal-cortical loop (CTSC) is central to cognitive control, integrating motor,
cognitive, and emotional information, and its disruption is pivotal in the pathophysiology of MDD
[74]. Key regions within this loop include the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (dlPFC), which are critical for decision-making, emotional regulation, and executive function.
In MDD, dysfunction in these regions undermines the agent’s ability to evaluate and execute
plans effectively. The thalamus (TH), serving as a relay for sensory and motor signals, exhibits
altered activity and connectivity in MDD, leading to disrupted sensory processing and sleep
disturbances. The striatum, essential for reward processing and motivation, often malfunctions in
MDD, manifesting as anhedonia and a diminished drive. Components of the basal ganglia (BG),
such as the globus pallidus (GP) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), contribute to the psychomotor
retardation characteristic of depression. Additionally, dysfunction in the dopaminergic pathways of
substantia nigra, crucial for mood and motivation, precipitates core symptoms of anhedonia and
the lack of pleasure.
The mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (MLP) is crucial for reward processing, originating in the
Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), which projects dopamine signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc),
essential for feeling pleasure and motivation [ 75,76]. Dysfunction in this system can lead to an-
hedonia [77]. Key structures include the VTA, AMY, and NAc, which collaborate to evaluate the
rewarding potential of behaviors. Changes in dopamine levels within this pathway are critical
in depressive behaviors [ 78]. The NAc, part of the ventral (medial) striatum (VS), is central to
processing positive reward, desire, and even the placebo effect. At the same time, the AMY plays a
significant role in fear and threat detection. Due to its role in cognitive and emotional processing,
the MLP is also implicated in addiction [79].
The prefrontal cortex and amygdala pathway (PFCA) highlights the critical role of disrupted connec-
tivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and AMY in the pathophysiology of MDD and anxiety.
Decreased functional connectivity between the AMY and the left rostral PFC has been identified
in medication-naive MDD patients when processing fearful stimuli [ 80]. Neuroimaging reveals
abnormally elevated metabolic activity in the AMY and orbital cortex in depression, with AMY
activity positively correlating with depressive symptoms [81,82]. Functional disconnection between
limbic and frontal regions, particularly between the AMY and the OFC bilaterally, and among the
AMY, ACC, and PFC in the right hemisphere, has been demonstrated in MDD patients [83]. These
findings suggest that an impaired modulation of AMY activity by the PFC may underlie aberrant
emotional processing in depression and anxiety. Within the agent framework, the PFCA represents
a critical intermodule circuit, integrating cognitive control and emotional regulation.
In our definition of circuits, an important aspect is their implicit causal and mechanistic
role in information transmission and information processing—which is not necessarily
the case in the definition of functional networks. However, the direct measurement of
brain circuits can be challenging due to their intricate, small-scale nature and the limita-
tions of non-invasive techniques. Functional networks derived from neuroimaging data
serve as valuable proxies, allowing researchers to infer the functional connectivity and
interactions between different brain regions and providing insights into the underlying
neural mechanisms. Functional networks are studied using diverse neuroimaging or
electrophysiological techniques, and they emerge from neural dynamics constrained by
the structural connectome during spontaneous brain activity, or in response to stimulus
or task-evoked perturbations [ 84–86]. One of the main challenges in neuroscience is to
understand how functional networks arise from brain circuits. This is broadly described as
the structure–function relationship of brain networks.
With these definitions in place, we discuss the notion of MDD biotypes. MDD is
diagnosed when a patient manifests at least five out of nine potential depressive symptoms.
This diagnostic criterion accommodates several hundred unique combinations of alterations
in mood, appetite, sleep, energy, cognitive function, and motor activity. This impressive
diversity underscores the prevailing consensus that depression is not a singular entity but
exists in various subtypes. However, the neurobiological foundations—the biotypes—of
these distinct depression subtypes’ manifestations remain largely unknown.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 13 of 71
Definition 6. A biotype is a subtype of MDD characterized by specific neurobiological traits
shared by a distinct subgroup of individuals with MDD behavioral and clinical symptoms that
distinguish them from other individuals with MDD.
We conceptualize the etiology of MDD at two levels of description: (i) the agent type
or algotype and (ii) the biotype. Biotypes give rise to symptoms and functional network
alterations that can be used to cluster subjects in what we callfunctional network (FN) biotypes
(Box 2), following the work of Williams et al. [ 10–12]. Algotypes are useful to analyze
the role of module disruptions as theoretical etiological routes to low valence, but they
need not map directly to human MDD biotypes (which may involve more widespread
disruptions). Biotypes, in turn, give rise to patterns of functional co-activations among
brain regions reflected in FN biotypes. FN biotypes are often derived from intrinsic and
task-evoked functional activity in healthy and clinical populations [12].
Box 2. Functional networks involved in MDD.
The Default Mode Network (DMN) : A network of brain regions that are active during rest and
introspection; it is involved in self-referential thinking, autobiographical memory, and mental time
travel [56,87]. Abnormal activity and connectivity within the DMN have been associated with MDD,
contributing to the altered processing of self-related information and the negative self-referential
thinking—or rumination—seen in depression.
The Cognitive Control Network (CCN): Also known as the Central Executive Network, it plays a
crucial role in goal-directed behavior, attention, and working memory. It comprises regions like
the lateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the FEF, part of the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the dlPFC, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [88]. Unlike the DMN,
the CCN is highly active during cognitive tasks and contributes to the “task-positive network”,
which also includes the middle temporal region, supplementary motor cortex, and the fronto-
insular operculum, showing robust task-related activation [ 89]. In MDD, altered interactions
between the DMN and CCN impact cognitive control and emotion regulation [ 90], potentially
leading to cognitive discontrol and deficits in emotion regulation.
The Salience Network (SN) : This primarily includes the fronto-insular cortex, dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC), AMY, and temporal poles; it detects and responds to salient stimuli such
as acute stress [91]. It is essential for paralimbic emotional processing and plays a significant role
in emotional control through its extensive subcortical connectivity. Notably, the SN is critical in
facilitating the switch between the DMN and the CCN [ 92]. Abnormalities in connectivity and
activity within the SN, particularly in the anterior insula and dACC, are observed in MDD and may
underlie biased attention toward negative information and diminished responsiveness to positive
stimuli (anhedonia).
The Attention Network (AN): It consists of the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Ventral
Attention Network (VAN). The Dorsal Attention Network mediates goal-directed, top–down
attention, enabling individuals to focus on tasks and filter out distractions. It primarily involves
brain regions such as the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the frontal eye fields (FEFs) [88]. The VAN
is involved in bottom–up, stimulus-driven attention, which allows the brain to reorient attention
toward salient or unexpected stimuli. It includes regions such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ)
and the ventral frontal cortex (VFC) [ 88,93]. Disruptions in the AN, particularly in the balance
between the DAN and VAN, can lead to difficulties in maintaining attention and an increased
susceptibility to distractions, contributing to the cognitive deficits in MDD [88,93,94].
The Negative Affect Network (NAN): This involves regions such as the AMY, anterior insula, medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the ACC, crucial for processing and regulating negative emotions.
Overactivity or dysregulation of this network can lead to persistent negative mood states and a
negative bias, which is common in depression. This results in a heightened sensitivity to negative
stimuli and an impaired ability to regulate negative emotions, contributing to the symptoms of
anxiety and depression [12,95,96].
The Positive Affect Network (P AN): This includes regions such as the ventral striatum, OFC,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and the ACC, essential for processing positive emotions
and rewards. Dysfunction in this network can lead to anhedonia. The PAN is critical for the
experience and anticipation of reward, motivation, and positive reinforcement, and its disruption
can severely affect mood and behavior [12,97–99].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 14 of 71
In this work, we explore how the current systems in neuroscience supports the idea of
a set of depression biotypes that correspond to distinct alterations in circuits and functional
networks. Then, informed by the literature on brain circuits and functional networks
(Boxes 1 and 2), we investigate how circuits, functional networks, and biotypes are inte-
grated into the agent framework to deepen our mechanistic understanding of the various
manifestations of MDD.
Recent work has shown that disconnections within task-free salience and DMN cir-
cuital elements map onto symptoms such as anxious avoidance, loss of pleasure, threat
dysregulation, negative emotional biases, and poorer daily functioning [100]. However,
limited evidence supports the hypothesized one-to-one mappings between clinical circuit
scores and specific phenotypes, challenging common assumptions about neural–phenotype
relationships. The findings suggest that a simple one-to-one mapping between circuits of
interest and specific symptoms and behaviors is not supported within current samples and
theoretical frameworks [10–12].
An exception is the recently confirmed cognitive biotype of depression, representing
about a quarter of depressed patients and characterized by prominent impairments in
the cognitive control domain such as executive function and response inhibition [ 65].
This biotype is associated with reduced activation in the DLPFC and dACC within the
cognitive control circuit, suggesting a distinct neural mechanism underlying this biotype.
This reduced prefrontal activation aligns with the cognitive control biotype proposed by
Williams et al. based on neuroimaging findings and the role of these regions in cognitive
control. Similarly, Drysdale et al. identified four neurophysiological subtypes of depression
defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal
networks using fMRI in a large multisite sample [101]. These subtypes further support the
heterogeneity of depression and underscore the need for personalized approaches based
on neural connectivity patterns.
3.2. From Agent Modules to MDD Functional Biotypes Through Circuits
The diversity in the manifestations of MDD, both in etiology and symptomatology,
underscores the complexity of its underlying mechanisms. We propose that situating
neurobiological circuits within the agent framework and its modules may help elucidate
the mechanisms behind the different MDD FN biotypes, keeping in mind the caveat that
the agent elements are abstract and may be realized in a highly distributed, hierarchical
fashion in the brain [102]. By aligning disruptions in agent modules with biological circuits,
we aim to understand how these perturbations lead to various manifestations of MDD,
such as rumination, anhedonia, and cognitive dysfunction.
Models, simulation, and planning systems are closely and hierarchically integrated into
the brain across different brain structures and temporal scales (fast vs. slow learning [103]
and fast and slow simulation [104,105]). In our exploration, we focus on the principal actors,
revealing the critical roles and interactions that underpin the brain’s capacity for modeling,
simulation, and planning. We provide an overview of this section in Table 1.
Table 1. Tentative mapping of different agent modules to specific brain regions, circuits, functional
networks and associated symptoms or biotypes. Brain regions are listed in a descending spatial hierar-
chy (the symbol> means “contains”). Regions that are highlighted in bold represent those depicted
in Figure 3, emphasizing their particular significance or involvement. This organizational structure
helps to clarify the complex interactions and functional networks contributing to various symptoms
and dysfunctions. See Appendix Table A2 for details on each region, and Table A3 for acronyms.

Figure 3. From the agent model to brain circuits, functional networks, and biotypes. To highlight
the goals of the proposed framework, we provide a tentative map or agent modules to brain regions,
circuits, and candidate biotypes based on the current literature. Proposed mapping of agent model
and agent elements (a) to high-level brain circuits (b)—Modeling Engine in pink, Planning Engine
in blue, and Objective Function (valence evaluation) in yellow. The high-level circuital model maps
into structural/anatomical circuits (c) and, finally, into observed functional networks that can be
derived from fMRI (d). Features from these networks can be used as biomarkers for the definition
of patient clusters or FN biotypes (e) [10–12,65,100]. The characteristics of each biotype (alterations
in the activity of regions or their connectivity) will reflect alterations of the main agent modules
involved. As an example, we display a particular FN biotype (NSA+PA+ in [12]), with altered activity
in the Objective Function (AMY, BG, and ACC). Most FN biotypes present alterations in more than
one agent module.
3.2.1. The Modeling Engine
The Modeling Engine is responsible for building the agent’s internal model of the
external “world” and generating predictions about future events, which can be compared
with actual incoming data from the sensory interfaces. In our framework, the Modeling
Engine of the human brain is linked with several key anatomical regions, including the
hippocampus, the cerebellum, and selected areas within the frontal cortex. These regions
are not only crucial for their individual functions but are also interconnected to form
complex circuits that underpin the engine’s capability (Figure 3).
As mentioned, KT proposes that ontophoria emerges from accurate comparisons of
model predictions and data. In the agent model, this occurs at the Comparator, where pre-
diction errors are evaluated by comparing the Modeling Engine’s predictions to incoming
data. The canonical cortical microcircuit model provides the neurobiological basis for the
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 16 of 71
Comparator, enabling a hierarchical comparison of sensory data with model-generated
predictions through converging feedback and feed-forward streams [ 106,107]. There is
growing evidence that layer V cortical pyramidal cells play a key role in this process,
serving as the convergence point for sensory data and priors (predictions), particularly in
posterior cortical regions [39,108–111].
This view integrates the Global Workspace Theory, the Free Energy Principle, and
the dendritic integration theory (DIT), emphasizing the importance of thalamo-cortical
and cortico-cortical loops in consciousness [110,112,113]. The Comparator’s role in gener-
ating structured experience is further supported by the “posterior hot zone” hypothesis,
where research shows that disruptions in these processes can significantly impact conscious
states [114–117]. In MDD, a malfunctioning Comparator can reinforce flawed models
(leading to overconfidence in negative beliefs and poor decision-making) or cause excessive
updates, derealization and loss of structured experience, and lower valence. These disrup-
tions can fuel the negative feedback loops typical of depression, contributing to feelings of
hopelessness, disconnection, and impaired planning.
Modeling Engine Dysfunction
The brain regions associated with the Modeling Engine are part of larger circuits
essential for cognitive and emotional processes (Box 3). The PCC plays a pivotal role within
these networks, forming connections with the hippocampal system [118]. Specifically, the
PCC acts as a gateway, transmitting spatial and related information from the parietal cortex
to the HC and facilitating the flow of object information from the temporal lobe to and
from the HC via the perirhinal cortex [119]. Additionally, the PCC and the OFC provide the
hippocampal system with routes for reward-related and emotional information, enhancing
the complexity of episodic memory formation [120]. Outputs from the HC primarily project
to the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is located in the medial temporal lobe and is crucial for
memory, navigation, and time perception. The EC serves as a major conduit, linking the HC
with various cortical and subcortical regions [121]. Strong functional connectivity between
the PCC and lateral OFC suggests an integration of reward and punishment information
within this network, with the parahippocampal region showing activation during negative
or sad mood inductions [122]. In healthy individuals, the PCC responds to happy and neu-
tral stimuli, but in MDD, increased functional connectivity with the lateral OFC biases PCC
inputs toward negative or sad events. Significant circuit changes are also observed in the
lateral OFC, which shows increased functional connectivity with the PCu and the AG [123].
The enhanced connectivity with the PCu, involved in the sense of self and agency [ 120],
and the AG, associated with language, correlates with the negative self-perception and
low self-esteem seen in depression. These functional connectivity differences are linked
to the severity of depression symptoms and are less pronounced in patients undergoing
antidepressant treatment [123]. Furthermore, by integrating information related to reward,
punishment, self-perception, and language, the regions presented within this module are
integral to the CSTC loop.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 17 of 71
Box 3. Brain regions associated with the Modeling Engine.
Angular Gyrus (AG): A region of the parietal cortex showing structural changes such as reduced
volume or cortical thickness in MDD patients. In MDD, regional homogeneity in AG decreases but
appears to increase after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy [124]. As part of the DMN, the
AG supports semantic processing and connects perception, attention, spatial cognition, and action,
as well as recalling episodic memory—all functions disrupted in MDD [125]. Neurophysiological
subtypes of depression, characterized by functional connectivity between the right AG and DMN,
may predict treatment outcomes [126]. Within the agent framework, the AG as part of the Modeling
Engine, integrates sensory information and aids in semantic processing, contributing to accurate
world modeling and effective planning. Its dysfunction leads to distorted world models, impairing
decision-making and homeostasis.
Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC): It is crucial for regulating emotional and memory-related pro-
cesses [127] and plays a key role in internally directed cognition [ 87]. It is involved in episodic
memory tasks, such as autobiographical memory and future imagining, as well as spatial navigation
and scene processing [128,129]. The PCC exhibits high connectivity and metabolic activation lev-
els [87], making its activity a key neuroimaging biomarker for depression symptoms and treatment
outcomes [130]. Moreover, increased functional connectivity of the PCC is linked to rumination in
depression [131]. As part of the Modeling Engine, the PCC integrates self-referential and emotional
information to update the world model. Impairment of the PCC affects emotional processing and a
coherent sense of self.
Precuneus (PCu): A region in the medial parietal cortex integral to self-referential processing,
spatial navigation, and episodic memory [132]. It is anatomically connected to the OFC, facilitating
the integration of cognitive and emotional information. In MDD, abnormal activity in the PCu can
impair self-awareness and memory. From the algorithmic agent perspective, the PCu belongs to
both the Modeling and Planning Engines. It helps to maintain an accurate model state by integrating
spatial and autobiographical data, which are essential for self-awareness.
Hippocampus (HC): An evolutionarily conserved structure, it is central to spatial memory and
cognitive mapping across species [ 133]. Cells are placed in the HC encode locations, forming
cognitive maps or internal representations of the world, which are essential for navigation and
decision-making across different cognitive domains [121,134], from navigation to mathematics [135].
The HC plays a key role in representing latent, multidimensional spaces where various aspects
of information are encoded [103,136–139]. Crucially, the HC regulates prefrontal cortical function,
and disruptions here can impair concentration and memory common in MDD [140]. Volumetric
imaging studies show that factors like early and family history and burden of illness contribute
significantly to decreased HC volumes in MDD patients, compared to healthy controls [141–143].
As part of the brain’s Modeling Engine, the HC builds cognitive maps, and its impairment leads to
distorted environmental modeling and cognitive deficits in depression.
Cerebellum (CB): It is an evolutionarily ancient structure with uniform histology, supporting broad
processing functions without distinct areal boundaries [144]. It coordinates voluntary movements
and maintains balance, integrating sensory inputs with motor commands. It also modulates cogni-
tion and emotion through theuniversal cerebellar transform, maintaining behavioral homeostasis [145].
Recent insights suggest that the CB might employ fast ephaptic communication [ 146,147], facili-
tated by its densely packed folds, for rapid processing. The spatial organization of somatosensory,
cognitive, and affective representations within the CB relies on polysynaptic connections with func-
tionally distinct cortical regions [148], which fMRI studies have mapped [149]. In MDD, studies have
found a significantly smaller CB and vermis—an area responsible for regulating emotion [150,151],
correlating emotional dysregulation and anxiety [152]. In the agent framework, the CB functions as
a fast, forward modeling/planning system [105,153], integrating internal models to control motor
actions and supporting a range of neurological functions through its extensive interactions with
other brain structures [104].
Dysfunction within the Modeling Engine can potentially arise from abnormalities in
any of these brain regions, leading to disturbances in functional networks such as the DMN.
Such disturbances are associated with specific FN biotypes, each characterized by unique
symptoms. For example, disruptions in the DMN are common in MDD patients exhibiting
rumination symptoms. Abnormal hippocampal activity within the Modeling Engine
may impair planning processes necessary for generating adaptive behaviors that enhance
affective valence, resulting in persistent rumination and manifesting as hyperactivity
within the DMN [11]. Moreover, regions of the Modeling Engine are also part of the AN.
Dysfunctions in these areas can affect the agent’s ability to maintain attention and shift
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 18 of 71
focus appropriately. According to Williams et al. (2017) [ 11], general hypoconnectivity
within the AN suggests an additional inattention type, clinically expressed as hypovigilance
and loss of alertness, leading to false alarm errors. This hypoconnectivity can impair
the agent’s capacity to stay focused and alert, contributing to cognitive deficits observed
in MDD. The interplay between the DMN and AN disruptions can thus contribute to a
broader range of cognitive and emotional symptoms.
3.2.2. The Objective Function
The Objective Function computes valence based on the agent’s world model, integrat-
ing external and internal sensory data. This computation is crucial for formulating action
plans and may involve various brain regions, including the sensory cortices, insula, ACC,
and other areas involved in interoceptive awareness and cognitive processing. Insofar as
some actions may be taken independently of others (e.g., initiating motor actions to reach
for a bowl of fruit and regulating core body temperature), valence may be evaluated by
subsystems independently before integration into a global valence assessment.
Objective Function Dysfunction
The brain areas involved in the Objective Function form interconnected circuits crucial
for emotional regulation, reward processing, and stress response (Boxes 4 and 5).
As a part of the CTSC, the sgACC and PFC are connected with the TH and AMY,
forming a feedback loop that influences mood and emotional regulation. The PVT acts as a
relay center, integrating inputs from the AMY and conveying them to cortical areas like the
sgACC and PFC, which process and regulate emotional and cognitive responses. This loop
also involves the NAc, which receives dopaminergic inputs from the VTA and integrates
signals from the PFC and AMY, modulating reward and aversion processes.
Box 4. Brain regions associated with the Objective Function (1 of 2).
Hypothalamus (HYP): This is central to systemic homeostasis maintenance, regulating key physio-
logical imperatives such as hunger, thirst, and thermoregulation through its various nuclei. The
lateral hypothalamic area initiates hunger, while the ventromedial hypothalamus signals sati-
ety [154]. The HYP integrates physiological signals to influence valence evaluation. It modulates
inputs from PFC and NAc, contributing to a holistic assessment of internal states and environmental
demands [155]. In MDD, hypothalamic dysfunction disrupts circadian rhythms, appetite, and stress
responses, generating persistent negative valence signals [156]. Chronic activation of the HPA axis
elevates cortisol levels and heightens the stress response, promoting threat overestimation and
avoidance behaviors.
Thalamus (TH): Known as the “Relay station”, it transmits sensory and motor signals to the cerebral
cortex and modulates consciousness and alertness. Its role extends to the pathophysiology of MDD,
where it is implicated in mood and emotion dysregulation [157]. The central role of thalamocortical
oscillations is particularly noteworthy. Increased thalamic excitation can disrupt these rhythms
through its extensive projection to the neocortex—a phenomenon observed in MDD patients. This
disruption can lead to symptoms such as insomnia, anhedonia, and cognitive impairment [158]. The
Paraventricular Thalamus (PVT)—a specific nucleus within the TH, is involved in regulating stress
responses and negative emotional behaviors, with connections to key brain regions implicated in
mood disorders [159]. Its dysfunction contributes to the emergence of symptoms such as anhedonia.
Nucleus accumbens (NAc): It is associated with positive reinforcement and the processing of re-
warding stimuli. “Pleasure” or “liking” is generated by a small set of “hedonic hot spots” within the
limbic circuitry with a particular implication of the NAc [3,160]. However, research has shown that
the NAc also plays a role in aversive conditioning and the processing of negative stimuli [161–163].
In a healthy brain, the NAc is crucial for motivation, reward processing, motor function, and learn-
ing, especially for the anticipation and experience of reward (positive valence), which facilitates
goal-directed behavior and reinforces learning through positive outcomes. Individuals with MDD
produce reduced responses to rewarding outcomes in the NAc, particularly during the consumma-
tory phase of reward processing, and are associated with anhedonic symptoms [2]. Additionally,
reduced activity in the NAc can lead to decreased motivation and goal-directed behavior [164,165].
Increasing evidence supports the NAc’s modulatory role in the pathogenesis of MDD, making it a
promising therapeutic target [166–168].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 19 of 71
The OFC corticostriatal circuits are critical for behaviors such as evaluation, affect regula-
tion, and reward-based decision-making. Dysfunction in these circuits is linked to psychiatric
disorders like MDD. Therapeutic neurostimulatory techniques such as DBS, ECT, rTMS, and
tDCS can rectify abnormal OFC corticostriatal activity , improving clinical symptoms [169].
Functionally, the PVT plays a significant role in emotional processing and conditioned
behaviors through its connections with the HYP , PFC, and AMY [ 170]. Patients with
psychotic MDD exhibit decreased functional connectivity between the HYP and sgACC,
associated with cortisol dysregulation and symptom severity [ 171]. MDD patients also
display reduced intrinsic connectivity between the AMY and regions involved in emotional
processing [172] and between the NAc and regions associated with reward processing,
executive function, and the DMN [162,173]. These alterations in NAc connectivity mediate
the association between MDD and anhedonia [165] (a symptom defining one of the FN
biotypes in [11,12]), impairing the Objective Function evaluation of positive contributions
to valence. Consistent findings of striatal hypoactivation in the reward circuit suggest
an additional type characterized clinically by “anhedonia” and a loss of sensitivity to
reward stimuli [11]. Anhedonia, apprehension, and threat dysregulation have been linked
with changes in connectivity and activation of the SN, PAN, and NAN [ 11]. In MDD,
disruptions in these functional networks can lead to impaired reward processing and
heightened negative emotional responses.
Box 5. Brain regions associated with the Objective Function (2 of 2).
Amygdala (AMY): It is central to emotion processing, including both positive and negative
rewards [174–176]. Research indicates distinct neural circuits for positive and negative valence
within the AMY [ 177]. It is particularly involved in fear and anxiety and plays a critical role in
emotional memory and the stress response [178–180]. In a healthy brain, the AMY evaluates the
emotional significance of stimuli, especially those related to threats, generating appropriate behavioral
and physiological responses (negative valence) [181], while in MDD, AMY hyperactivity contributes
to a negative bias in emotional processing, and negative stimuli are perceived more intensely [182].
This heightened amygdala activity is linked to increased stress and anxiety , worsening depressive
symptoms [183]. In the agent framework, AMY hyperactivity in MDD leads to overestimating threats
and underestimating rewards, distorting valence computation in the Objective Function.
Subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC): Known to regulate emotional behavior and autonomic
responses, it is also closely connected with AMY, hippocampus, and NAc. Findings from Fox
et al. [184] show that fMRI functional connectivity differences in the sgACC were linked to the
efficacy of TMS sites in the dorsolateral PFC for treating MDD, underscoring the sgACC’s potential
as a target for antidepressant interventions. This insight led to identifying optimal TMS target
coordinates and inspired approaches using tDCS to engage the broader cortical network associated
with the sgACC-seed rs-fcMRI [22]. More recent work found that sgACC overactivation increases
heart rate, elevates cortisol levels, and exaggerates responsiveness to threat, mirroring the stress-
related symptoms of depression and anxiety [185]. In MDD, hyperactivity in the sgACC can lead to
a distorted evaluation of emotional stimuli, resulting in a negative bias and an overestimation of
negative outcomes. As a result, inaccurate valence signals are sent to the Planning Engine, leading
to ineffective or maladaptive planning and decision-making processes.
Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC): It is a key integrative hub linking sensory inputs across modalities—
gustatory, olfactory, somatosensory, auditory, and visual—with reward processing and decision-
making. It has reciprocal connections with several brain structures, including AMY, ACC, in-
sula/operculum, HYP , HC, areas in the BG including VS and dorsal striatum, periaqueductal gray,
and dlPFC [169,186]. Functionally, the OFC evaluates the affective value of stimuli (valence), guides
behavior based on reward predictions, and modulates emotional responses [ 187]. Its structural
connections enable determining homeostatic stimulus value [169,174,188]. The OFC acts as an inte-
grative center where positive and negative valence signals combine to compute a comprehensive
assessment of valence [186], where it synthesizes input from regions like the nucleus accumbens
(NAc) and AMY. In MDD, the OFC’s function is significantly impaired, leading to anhedonia and
disrupted decision-making due to altered reward evaluation and processing [82,186]. Additionally,
the OFC coordinates with the HC to update models and contrast them with data for model up-
date [136], contributing to the Planning Engine by using refined models to guide decision-making
and action selection. This dual role is crucial for maintaining accurate cognitive maps and effective
behavioral strategies.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 20 of 71
3.2.3. The Planning Engine
The Planning Engine is closely connected to the Objective Function, and it should also
be represented in a related, distributed, hierarchical manner. At lower hierarchical levels, it
includes classical homeostatic regulatory systems such as the hypothalamus (HYP). Higher
up, the cerebellum (CB) contributes to coordinating and timing precise, rapid movements
and cognitive functions, aiding in planning and predicting outcomes of movements and
behaviors [145]. At the highest level, planning is partly associated with executive function,
and, in particular, the PFC, from MC, to the inferior frontal cortex, mPFC, ACC, OFC,
and dlPFC.
Planning Engine Dysfunction
The brain areas involved in the Planning Engine (Box 6) are interconnected through
the CTSC intermodule circuit. The HYP communicates with the prefrontal cortex regions
(dlPFC, mPFC, and OFC) via pathways that integrate autonomic and endocrine responses
with cognitive processes, influencing the agent’s ability to plan and execute goal-directed
behavior. The dlPFC is connected to the mPFC and OFC through extensive cortical net-
works that facilitate the integration of executive functions, working memory, and emotional
regulation. These prefrontal regions receive input from the TH—which acts as a relay
station—and project to the striatum. The PCu integrates these cognitive and emotional
processes by connecting with the mPFC and dlPFC, playing a role in self-referential think-
ing and the Default Mode Network. Dysregulation within this loop leads to impaired
planning and maladaptive decision-making. The HYP’s disrupted signaling affects stress
responses and homeostasis, while the dlPFC’s hypoactivity and the mPFC’s hyperactivity
contribute to cognitive control deficits and negative emotional biases. The OFC’s role in
evaluating rewards and punishments becomes skewed, leading to poor decision-making
and anhedonia. The PCu’s involvement in self-referential thoughts can exacerbate rumina-
tion and negative self-perception. Within the PFCA intermodule circuit, the PFC interacts
closely with the AMY (see Objective Function section) to integrate cognitive control with
emotional regulation. This connectivity allows the PFC to modulate emotional responses
generated by the AMY, ensuring that plans and actions are both logically sound and emo-
tionally appropriate (i.e., increase valence). MDD disrupts the critical connectivity with the
AMY and sgACC that is necessary for effective cognitive control and emotional regulation
potentially associated with future contributors to valence [178,179,189–191]. This leads to
impaired top–down control over emotional responses, dysfunctional decision-making, and
maladaptive behaviors.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 21 of 71
Box 6. Brain regions associated with the Planning Engine.
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC): It is the highest hierarchical level (“meta”) for planning
and executive functions in the human brain, playing a crucial role in complex cognitive processes
such as decision-making, problem-solving, and the regulation of goal-directed behavior, thereby
distinguishing humans from other primates [ 192]. It is involved in cognitive control, working
memory, and selective attention and is significant in MDD, where dysregulation potentially disrupts
goal-directed cognition [10,193]. Research suggests an imbalance between left and right dlPFC
activity in MDD, with left dlPFC hypoactivity associated with negative emotional judgment and
right dlPFC hyperactivity linked to attentional modulation [96,194] and cognitive bias associated
with greater and more sustained AMY reactivity [ 96]. This functional asymmetry may have a
structural basis, as MDD patients show lower structural asymmetry in the dlPFC compared to
healthy controls [195]. Cognitive control dysfunction contributes to MDD psychopathology and
emotion dysregulation [196]. The tDCS of the dlPFC has shown promise in improving cognitive
function and reducing depressive symptoms [196]. In MDD, dlPFC dysregulation impairs planning
and decision-making, leading to indecisiveness, reduced concentration, and difficulty in goal-setting.
The imbalance between the left hypoactivity and right hyperactivity skews emotional processing
and cognitive control, resulting in maladaptive planning and ineffective strategies for managing
negative emotions and stress.
Medial PFC (mPFC): It plays a key role in various memory-related functions, particularly in
autobiographical and emotionally charged memories. Its connectivity with the HC positions the
mPFC as important for memory consolidation and retrieval [ 197]. Beyond memory, the mPFC
is integral to goal-directed behaviors, including planning and decision-making, by evaluating
the potential rewards of different choices and adapting actions based on these valuations. It is
involved in performance monitoring, identifying when outcomes fall short of expectations, and
generating predictions about future outcomes by integrating past experiences with the current
context [197]. This anticipatory function enables individuals to foresee the possible consequences of
their actions and to modify their behavior to align with desired outcomes. In MDD, disruptions in
mPFC functions lead to impaired planning, maladaptive decision-making, and a persistent negative
outlook.
OFC and PCu: By using refined models to guide decision-making and select appropriate actions,
the OFC ensures accurate cognitive maps and effective behavioral strategies. The PCu aids in
generating and evaluating action plans using past experiences and spatial contexts. Dysfunction in
the PCu can lead to ineffective planning, mirroring the cognitive impairments seen in depression.
HYP: Although associated with the Objective Function due to its role in evaluating low-level
valence contributors, the HYP also controls these variables (e.g., thermoregulation), illustrating
the “onion-layer” hierarchical structure of the brain. Dysregulation of the HYP in MDD leads to
continuous negative feedback to the Planning Engine regarding the physiological state, resulting in
maladaptive decision-making that prioritizes the avoidance of perceived threats over pursuing re-
warding activities. Chronic stress signals cause the agent to avoid social interactions and previously
pleasurable activities, reinforcing depressive symptoms.
Other areas in the agent’s Planning Engine include regions and circuits associated with acting
on the world. The motor cortex (MC) and, in particular, the supplementary motor area (SMA), play a
crucial role in orchestrating voluntary movements, coordinating information from various parts
of the brain to execute complex motor actions. Abnormalities in the SMA have been associated
with motor deficits in MDD patients [198,199]. The brainstem (BST) regulates basic life functions like
heart rate, breathing, and sleep, which are vital for maintaining the physical capability to act on the
world. It also houses the reticular formation, which is involved in arousal and consciousness. The
BST innervates the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis and frontolimbic circuits, which
are dysfunctional in MDD.
The Corticospinal Tract (CST) is essential for voluntary movements, and its abnor-
malities in depression may relate to reduced energy levels and overall depression sever-
ity [200,201]. Functional connectivity studies have shown increased connectivity between
the left SMA and motor-related regions but decreased connectivity with the BG during
high-frequency finger-tapping tasks in MDD patients [198]. Motor retardation in MDD is
associated with unbalanced motor control, evidenced by altered cerebral blood flow and
motor activity levels in regions such as the cingulate cortex and SMA [202]. These findings
suggest that MDD involves disruptions in both structural and functional connectivity of
the SMA, contributing to motor symptoms and cognitive deficits. Diffusion tensor imag-
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 22 of 71
ing has revealed decreased white matter integrity in the right solitary tract, connecting
the BST to the AMY (Objective Function), in MDD patients, together with volumetric
reductions in the BST [ 203,204]. These findings indicate that structural and functional
alterations in brainstem regions and their connections to other brain areas contribute to
MDD pathophysiology.
We propose that malfunctions in the agent’s Planning Engine can result from disrup-
tions in key brain areas and circuits, altering associated functional networks such as the
DMN, CCN, and AN. These disruptions correspond to distinct FN biotypes, each with
unique symptoms. For example, agents with Planning Engine dysfunction may fail to
generate plans that enhance valence, leading to textitrumination and anxiety, possibly due
to alterations in the DMN-associated mPFC. Alternatively, disruptions in CCN-related
areas like the dlPFC may impair impulse regulation, causing the selection of short-term
valence-enhancing but long-term detrimental plans, indicative of the cognitive dyscontrol
FN biotype.
Moreover, regions of the Modeling Engine are also part of the AN, and their dys-
function can affect the agent’s ability to maintain attention and shift focus appropriately,
contributing to the inattention biotype linked to hypoconnectivity within the AN, as noted
by Williams et al. (2017) [ 11]. This hypoconnectivity can impair both the Planning and
Modeling Engines by reducing the agent’s capacity to stay focused and alert.
3.2.4. The World
In the context of MDD, the world, or the environment, significantly influences both
the onset and progression of the disorder by transmitting inputs to and receiving outputs
from the agent. Biologically, the world’s inputs are processed via the sensory organs and
integrated by different brain regions to form a comprehensive perception of the external
environment or the agent’s body. Stressful life events, childhood trauma, and ongoing
adversity increase the risk of developing MDD, representing negative inputs that disrupt
the agent’s equilibrium and hinder the maintenance of an optimal Objective Function
output. A healthy agent typically formulates effective strategies to interact with the world
and sustain a satisfactory level of valence. However, an unhealthy agent might struggle to
develop and implement such strategies or fail to recalibrate and adapt to changes in the
world, as seen in cognitive subtypes of MDD [ 65], where executive function (planning)
is impaired. This impairment can lead to further deterioration of world conditions and,
consequently, more adverse inputs, perpetuating the cycle of depression.
In MDD, the interaction between the agent and the world is often maladaptive, charac-
terized by impaired sensory processing and motor responses, leading to a cycle of negative
feedback. Sensory inputs may be filtered through a negative bias, and motor outputs
may reflect decreased motivation and physical activity or result in more adverse world
conditions, further enhancing depressive symptoms. In this line, the world represents an
opportunity for MDD intervention, acting as a gateway to “reprogram” the agent. Beyond
psychotherapy, which impacts the agent through the world interface, helping the agent
cultivate more adaptive methods to interpret (model and evaluate) and respond (plan) to
the world’s inputs, effective treatments often require changes to the patient’s environment
or their ways of engagement (behavioral therapy). Furthermore, lifestyle adjustments such
as regular physical activity, a healthier diet, and improved sleep hygiene can boost the
agent’s interaction with the world, optimizing the chances for higher valence as computed
by the Objective Function.
4. Relation to Other Theories, Empirical Support, and Predictions
4.1. Relation to Other Computational Theories of MDD
The algorithmic agent framework is an overarching paradigm that integrates various
computational psychiatry approaches. By conceptualizing mental health through agents
optimizing for valence via modeling and planning interactions with their environments,
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 23 of 71
this framework encompasses models focused on reward processing, decision-making, and
learning—key aspects in computational psychiatry.
4.1.1. The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference
In previous work [28,205], we highlighted the conceptual compatibility between the
agent framework and Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle and Active Inference
(FEP/AIF) [113,206]. Both frameworks emphasize hierarchical processing, predictive cod-
ing, and the maintenance of adaptive neural models for healthy cognitive
function [113,205,206]. For instance, the evaluation of prediction errors, critical in FEP ,
aligns with the error evaluation at the Comparator in the algorithmic agent model.
FEP/AIF provides a causal statistical framework accounting for action, perception,
and learning by positing that an adaptive agent minimizes free energy (or surprise, rep-
resented as the negative log-likelihood of the data given the model, J = −log P(y)) to
maintain stasis and resist disorder. This minimization involves maximizing the evidence
for the agent’s internal generative model of sensory data. The minimization of surprise is a
dual process: it involves finding models that not only match incoming data but also remain
consistent with prior models, which encode the agent’s homeostatic goals and a statistical
notion of complexity as a departure from prior models. This balances statistical complexity
(related to algorithmic complexity) and accuracy. The agent seeks to minimize surprise by
adjusting its internal models to better explain sensory inputs while aligning with its home-
ostatic priors. This partly parallels KT, where the agent aims to minimize the description
length of its internal models by balancing model complexity and data fit. However, in KT,
the primary goal is the optimization of the Objective Function, which may rely partly on
the simplicity of the found models as defined through the Kolmogorov complexity.
Our work in [ 205] further clarifies the relationship between FEP/AIF and KT by
deriving principles of probability and Bayesian inference from the algorithmic agent model
in AIT. This derivation shows that FEP/AIF can be viewed as a specific realization of the
agent model in a Bayesian context, where probabilistic reasoning emerges as a strategy for
the agent to manage uncertainty and optimize its interaction with the environment. Finally,
in FEP/AIF, the agent seeks not only to compress sensory data using Bayesian methods
but also do so in alignment with intrinsic goals encoded as priors—a specific proposal for
the realization of the Objective Function in the brain.
In FEP/AIF, psychiatric disorders like depression are primarily understood as failures
in this adaptive process [207–213], where maladaptive internal models give rise to persistent
negative predictions and behaviors. In KT, maladaptive models can lead to low valence,
but other routes—such as dysfunctions in the Objective Function or Planning Engine—are
also considered.
4.1.2. Reinforcement Learning and Other Perspectives
Reinforcement learning (RL) and predictive coding (PC) are computational frame-
works naturally encompassed within the KT algorithmic agent model. RL involves agents
learning optimal actions through trial and error, guided by rewards and punishments,
aiming to maximize cumulative reward. It emphasizes the evaluation of actions based
on their expected outcomes and the refinement of policies through experience [214]. PC
(subsumed by FEP/AIF and KT), on the other hand, focuses on minimizing prediction
errors by continuously updating the agent’s internal model to better match the sensory
input, viewing the brain as a predictive machine, where discrepancies between predic-
tions and actual observations drive model updates [206]. In the KT model, both RL and
PC are integrated into a unified process, where the agent optimizes its internal models,
compresses information, and adapts its behavior by balancing rewards, prediction errors,
and model complexity.
Recent research has explored the relationship between depression and RL, reveal-
ing significant alterations in RL processes among individuals with depression. Studies
have found that depression is associated with impaired reward prediction error signals,
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 24 of 71
decreased reward sensitivity, and altered learning parameters [215]. These RL disruptions
have been linked to depression symptoms and may predict treatment outcomes [216]. Neu-
roimaging studies have shown that symptom improvement following cognitive behavioral
therapy is associated with the normalization of learning parameters [216]. Furthermore,
research has demonstrated that individuals with depression exhibit context-dependent
learning impairments, particularly in negative contexts, suggesting a negativity bias in
learning rates [217]. Additionally, Huys et al. (2015) [218] link depression to low expected
rates of net utility (valence), arising from maladaptive priors that distort internal and
external state construction. This mirrors the KT framework, where the agent’s faulty pre-
dictive models lead to persistently negative expectations about the future, reducing the
valuation of potential outcomes. Both models highlight that depression involves biased
predictions and decision-making, where the expectation of future utility is diminished due
to maladaptive internal models. Huys and Maia [ 26] categorize computational models
in psychiatry into synthetic, algorithmic, and optimal models. Synthetic models are bio-
physically detailed, bridging neural dynamics with behavior. Algorithmic models, such as
RL, focus on simplified, statistically validated constructs. Optimal models use Bayesian
frameworks to evaluate decision-making against theoretical optima. This categorization
aligns with the KT framework, which integrates synthetic modeling for neural circuit
dynamics and algorithmic approaches for predictive coding, Objective Function evaluation,
and planning in depression. Similarly, Maia and Frank [ 219] use RL models to explore
dopamine function in cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) circuits, emphasizing
interactions between the basal ganglia (BG) and cortex in an actor–critic framework. This
parallels the KT model’s distinction between planning, modeling, and Objective Func-
tion evaluation while delving deeper into dynamics and plasticity in depression. Khalegi
et al. [220] further classify computational psychiatry models into phenotypic, neurobiologi-
cal, and intermediate models. Whole-brain models based on neural mass models (NMMs)
fit into the neurobiological category, providing detailed system-level insights into how
neural alterations manifest as psychiatric symptoms. Bennet [221] and Nelson [222] discuss
computational cognitive models in depression, focusing on decision-making, reward pro-
cessing, and predictive coding. Disruptions in these cognitive functions, such as negative
bias and impaired reward learning, reflect the KT framework’s focus on altered modeling
and Objective Function evaluation. Charlton [223] explores how ketamine rapidly alleviates
suicidal ideation by modulating synaptic plasticity and neural circuitry involved in mood
regulation. The use of RL models to understand value-based decision-making in suicide
risk reflects the KT framework’s emphasis on neural plasticity and predictive modeling in
affective disturbances.
4.2. Testable Predictions
Theories closely related to KT, such as FEP and AIF, or RL, offer testable predictions
about brain function and behavior. Central to the FEP/AIF framework is the idea that
the brain minimizes prediction errors by continuously updating its internal models to
better match sensory input. This leads to predictions about sensory processing, testable
through tasks that manipulate prediction errors, such as oddball paradigms where unex-
pected stimuli elicit measurable neural responses like mismatch negativity [ 206,224]. In
the context of decision-making, AIF predicts that individuals select actions minimizing
expected free energy, which can be experimentally tested using behavioral tasks under
uncertainty, coupled with neuroimaging to track brain regions involved in belief updating
and action selection [113,225]. Furthermore, PC and AIF predict that psychiatric disorders
like depression or schizophrenia involve disruptions in hierarchical prediction error mini-
mization. This can be examined using reinforcement learning tasks assessing maladaptive
reward processing and prediction error sensitivity [207,226]. AIF’s emphasis on allostatic
regulation and uncertainty minimization also provides predictions regarding the role of
bodily states in cognitive processing, testable through tasks that manipulate interoception
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 25 of 71
and assess its influence on decision-making and affective states [ 206,226]. We provide a
more in-depth comparison of KT and AIF in Appendix D.
The KT framework also predicts that agents will select the simplest models available,
all else being equal [31]. This compression principle suggests testable hypotheses about the
brain favoring simpler world models, which can be investigated through tasks manipu-
lating model complexity and observing behavioral and neural responses. Neuroimaging
studies could examine whether the brain shows preferential activation for simpler repre-
sentations during inference or prediction tasks. As a computational neurophenomenology
theory, KT posits that model structure—in terms of dynamical and geometric/topological
features—shapes experience and emotion. This could be empirically tested by analyzing
the geometric and topological properties of neural activity patterns and correlating them
with subjective reports of emotion. For example, investigating how changes in the brain’s
state space (e.g., dimensionality, topology, or curvature) correspond to different emotional
states using techniques like manifold learning or persistent homology [28].
Emotion is a crucial dimension of both first-person experience and behavior. To val-
idate the formulation of emotion within KT, researchers can derive a standard emotion
labeling system by establishing qualia structures across participants based on similarity
relationships [227] or by creating neural embedding frameworks that map human emotions
into vector space representations, confirming a shared “qualia structure” across individ-
uals [228,229]. Demonstrating that participants with matching qualia structures exhibit
similar neural data associated with emotional states, as deduced from the geometry and
topology of trajectories in phase space, would support this aspect of the theory [69].
In the context of MDD, the KT agent framework predicts that dysfunctions in specific
brain circuits involved in model-building or planning will lead to behaviors and symptoms
consistent with incorrect models or impaired executive functions. This mapping can be
tested using neuroimaging alongside cognitive and affective assessments to investigate the
relationship between neural circuit dysfunctions and MDD symptomatology. For example,
disruptions in circuits critical for planning may be associated with increased rumination or
impaired decision-making.
Regarding treatment efficacy, the KT framework suggests interventions targeting
specific dysfunctional circuits or processes should alleviate corresponding symptoms.
Testing these predictions involves evaluating the effectiveness of targeted therapies and
observing associated changes in neural activity and cognitive function, which we discuss
in the next section.
5. Treating the Depressed Agent
The treatment of MDD involves a multifaceted approach, including pharmacology,
brain stimulation, psychotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments. By analyzing these interven-
tions through the lens of the algorithmic agent model, we gain deeper insights into how
each treatment modality alters brain dynamics and influences recovery. Table A3 links
brain regions with interventions affecting them.
Within this framework, all treatments—pharmacological, brain stimulation, psy-
chotherapy, or lifestyle interventions—can be viewed as mechanisms that temporarily
reshape the brain’s dynamical landscape. Pharmacological interventions, such as antide-
pressants and psychedelics, modify the structural parameters governing brain dynamics.
Psychedelics, for instance, act on serotonin receptors, potentially “flattening” the land-
scape and facilitating novel neural trajectories, as seen in frameworks like REBUS [ 112],
CANAL [73], and Neural geometrodynamics [69]. This flattening increases the brain’s ca-
pacity for reconfiguration, allowing a transient escape from maladaptive states [69,230,231].
The process has been likened to “annealing” in physical systems, allowing the brain to
escape local minima and explore new configurations [ 232]. Furthermore, psychedelics
enhance metaplasticity, opening periods of increased brain plasticity that support this
process [69,112,233].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 26 of 71
The notion of pathological canalization [ 234] provides further insight into disease
progression. When the system becomes dynamically trapped in a local minimum, a
first phase we may call dynamical canalization (Type A canalization) takes place, with
associated depressed mood (low valence). At this stage, external stimuli like social support,
therapeutic interventions, or transient landscape flattening via psychedelics may enable
escape from the local minimum. Alternatively, a second phase involving plasticity loss
or cell damage (Type B canalization) may occur, further entrenching depressive states.
Combined and repeated therapies may be necessary to facilitate both transient escape and
gradual landscape reshaping [234].
5.1. Brain Stimulation
Brain stimulation therapies apply electrical or magnetic stimulation to specific brain
regions to modulate neural activity and improve the functionality of agent modules.
For instance, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the application of electrical
currents to the brain that induce a controlled seizure [235]. It is one of the most effective
treatments for severe depression, particularly when patients are experiencing suicidal
ideation or psychosis. Recent work supports the hypothesis that the evoked seizure is the
key to efficacy [236]. In the canalization paradigm, it can be interpreted as a strong external
forcing on the state that can dislodge neural dynamics from the trapped attractor.
On the other hand, deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires surgical implantation of
electrodes into specific subcortical brain regions, such as the sgACC or NAc [166,237]. DBS
electrodes deliver sustained electrical stimulation, modulating the neural activity of the
targeted brain structures. Targeting the sgACC or NAc with DBS can be interpreted as
modulating the Objective Function of the algorithmic agent.
At the non-invasive level, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses electric fields,
generated by time-varying magnetic fields, to stimulate targeted regions of the brain, and
in particular the left dlPFC [ 184]. TMS is non-invasive and has fewer side effects than
ECT. Furthermore, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another non-invasive
technique that uses a low, constant current to stimulate specific brain areas [ 238,239].
tDCS has shown promise in MDD (anodal tDCS of the left dlPFC in MDD without drug
resistance [14,240]), but results across different montages and studies warrant further larger
scale controlled studies. The current is delivered through scalp electrodes and typically
targets the left dlPFC (similarly in TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation). Connectivity
between dlPFC and subgenual cingulate cortex (SGN) suggests that modulating the activity
of the dlPFC may have downstream effects on mood regulation and emotional processing
through its connections with these limbic areas [ 184]. Targeting the dlPFC with TMS
or tDCS can be seen as an intervention that primarily affects the Planning Engine and,
indirectly, the Objective Function (since the evaluation of valence needs to consider future
rewards).
5.2. Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy addresses the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of depres-
sion [241], by modulating brain dynamics and altering synaptic connectivity. From the
KT perspective, psychotherapy reprograms the agent by influencing core modules of the
brain’s cognitive architecture. While each type of therapy has unique methods, many over-
lap in the brain systems they target and their mechanisms of action. Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), frequently used for MDD,
both engage the Modeling Engine. CBT corrects cognitive distortions and restructures
negative thought patterns [242], while MBCT reduces rumination by increasing present-
moment awareness [243]. Together, they improve the Objective Function by promoting
balanced self-evaluation and emotional stability. Therapies such as Interpersonal Therapy
(IPT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) also play a significant role in MDD management
by targeting social dynamics and emotional regulation. IPT enhances the Modeling and
Planning Engines by improving representations of social interactions and refining social
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 27 of 71
behavior [244]. DBT combines acceptance and change strategies to strengthen emotional
regulation and interpersonal effectiveness [245]. Psychodynamic Therapy and Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) have been applied in the context of MDD to re-
process maladaptive memories and internal conflicts. Psychodynamic therapy resolves
internal struggles by bringing unconscious patterns to conscious awareness [246], while
EMDR re-integrates traumatic memories into a more adaptive framework, easing emotional
distress [247]. In contrast, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses on optimizing
the Planning Engine in MDD patients by promoting value-based actions and acceptance of
internal experiences [248].
5.3. Lifestyle and Alternative Treatments
Lifestyle interventions, such as social relations [ 249], exercise [ 250–252], sleep hy-
giene [253], and dietary changes [254], have shown to play a role in treating MDD. These
interventions aim to improve overall physical and mental health, leading to environmental
changes that positively impact the Objective Function. Furthermore, healthier habits may
induce neurobiological changes that promote accurate world models (Model Engine) and
improve emotional processing (Objective Function) via enhanced plasticity.
5.4. Neuropharmacology
5.4.1. Antidepressant Treatment
Pharmacological treatments for MDD primarily target the monoaminergic neurotrans-
mitter systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The rationale for
targeting these neurotransmitter systems stems from the monoamine hypothesis of depres-
sion, which suggests that a deficiency in monoamine neurotransmitters contributes to the
development of depressive symptoms [54]. Common classes of antidepressants include
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs), which modulate the neurobiological circuits implicated in MDD to
correct dysfunctional neural activity.
5.4.2. Psychedelic Treatment
Psychoactive neuroplastogens like psilocybin and LSD modulate brain dynamics by
acting as agonists or partial agonists of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A recep-
tors [16,73,112,255], which are abundant on the apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal
cells in Layer V . Desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex may trig-
ger the subjective psychedelics effects [256], likely initiated by 5-HT2A receptor-mediated
excitation of deep pyramidal cells. For instance, when psilocybin binds to these receptors, it
increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons, depolarizing them and making them more
susceptible to incoming inputs [257]. This effect can lead to changes in the firing patterns
of these neurons and alterations in the overall neural activity.
By flattening the neural dynamical landscape, psychoactive neuroplastogens increase
the entropy and complexity of neural dynamics, disrupting functional integration and
promoting a more flexible neural state. This shift, amplified by the plasticity-enhancing
effects of these substances, manifests as an acute systemic increase in disorder and a
potentially longer-lasting increase in complexity affecting both short-term dynamics and
long-term plastic processes. Such disruption enables the brain to escape maladaptive
attractor states associated with MDD, facilitating the formation of new, more adaptive
patterns of neural activity and connectivity [69,112].
During the acute phase of neuroplastogen action, there is a flattening of the modeling
landscape [258] that can be described as a relaxation of priors [112]. The effects on 5-HT2AR
can be interpreted as disrupting model inputs (priors) into the Comparator—where data
and the model converge for the validation and generation of structured experience [ 28].
Increased errors reported by the Comparator force the brain to explore alternative models,
facilitating the breakdown of maladaptive thought patterns. Enhanced neuroplasticity
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 28 of 71
supports the long-term modification of the Modeling Engine, fostering new, healthier
cognitive models and emotional responses [182,259].
Psychedelics also impact the Objective Function through their effect on key brain
regions. In MDD patients, they modulate the AMY [260], increasing its response to emo-
tional stimuli, which correlates with mood improvements. This heightened responsiveness
may normalize emotional processing, enabling a fuller range of emotions that is often
blunted in depression [182]. In healthy subjects, however, psychedelics typically reduce
AMY reactivity to negative stimuli, potentially alleviating anxiety and fear [180,261]. Barret
et al. (2020) [262] found that one-week post-psilocybin, negative affect, and AMY response
to facial affect stimuli, were reduced, whereas positive affect and dorsal lateral prefrontal
and medial OFC responses to emotionally conflicting stimuli were increased. Discrepancies
in findings may be attributed to differences in healthy and clinical populations as well as
experimental conditions.
Additionally, psychedelics significantly impact the BG, particularly within the VS/NAc.
They modulate both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, enhancing responsiveness
to rewarding stimuli and alleviating anhedonia. Psychedelics increase the power of high-
frequency oscillations and decrease their frequency in the NAc, while reducing low gamma
oscillation power—effects mediated by 5HT2A receptors [263]. Additionally, they boost
dopamine release in the NAc [264,265], leading to enhanced reward responsiveness during
the acute phase of treatment. Psychedelics also promote long-term neuroplasticity in these
regions, supporting sustained mood improvements by restructuring maladaptive neural
pathways [259,266]. This is partly mediated by long-term changes in the Objective Func-
tion, promoting new behavior patterns and goal-setting conducive to mental health and
well-being [112].
In the Planning Engine, psychedelics promote neuroplasticity, particularly within the
PFC [259]. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics or serotonin triggers a robust
glutamate-dependent increase in the activity of pyramidal neurons, preferentially those in
layer V of the PFC [267]. This suggests that psychedelics are potent modulators of prefrontal
networks through complex serotonin–glutamate interactions [267]. Although acute effects
may impair executive function in healthy subjects [268], the long-term neuroplastic changes
may enhance planning and decision-making.
Finally, the thalamus (TH), acting as a nexus of agent modules, plays a crucial role in
mediating the effects of psychoactive neuroplastogens. We recall that the Cortico-Thalamo-
Striatal-Cortical Loop (CTSC) is implicated in MDD and is crucial for integrating motor,
cognitive, and emotional information. Its dysfunction is central to the pathophysiology of
MDD. Psychedelics modulate thalamic activity, altering sensory experiences by affecting
the thalamus’s role as a gateway for sensory information. Psychedelics lead to decreases in
cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal in hub regions, such as the TH, ACC, and PCC [269].
This modulation alters directed connectivity within CTSC pathways in humans, suggest-
ing that a disintegration of information processing within these loops is underlying the
psychedelic state [270].
5.5. Combining tES with Psychedelics
While both tES and psychedelics have independently demonstrated significant thera-
peutic potential in treating depression; combining these treatments could potentially yield
synergistic effects, surpassing the benefits observed when each is used independently. The
combination is especially interesting from the point of view of plasticity. On the one hand,
tES relies on the brain’s plasticity for therapeutic effects. tDCS induces long-term potentia-
tion (LTP) or depression (LTD) of the glutamatergic system, which is N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor- and calcium-dependent [271]. On the other hand, psychedelics produce
not only profound concurrent alterations of brain dynamics but also powerful after-effects
with a window of increased neuroplasticity lasting at least up to one month [259].
The interaction of tDCS with pharmacological agents has been studied in numerous
studies (see [272] for an overview) and, in particular, serotonergic drugs. Serotonin affects
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 29 of 71
memory formation by modulating LTP and LTD. Accordingly, acute SSRI administration
enhanced LTP-like plasticity induced by tDCS in humans. In pioneering studies, a sin-
gle dose of the SSRI citalopram (CIT) enhanced both the amplitude and duration of the
after-effects of anodal tDCS until the same evening of stimulation, and it reversed the
excitability diminution seen after cathodal tDCS into facilitation [273]. Likewise, for paired
associative stimulation (PAS), acute application of CIT enhanced LTP-like PAS-induced
after-effects and abolished LTD-like PAS-induced after-effects [274]. Other studies have
shown that chronic application of CIT increased and prolonged the LTP-like plasticity
induced by anodal tDCS for over 24 h, and converted cathodal tDCS-induced LTD-like
plasticity into facilitation [ 271]. More recently, it has been shown that acute serotonin
enhancement modulates tDCS after-effects and has largely similar modulatory effects on
motor cortex neuroplasticity regardless of the specific dosage [275]. Taken together, these
experiments suggest that chronic serotonergic enhancement results in a strengthening of
LTP-like glutamatergic plasticity, which might partially explain the therapeutic impact of
SSRIs in depression and other neuropsychiatric diseases. This supports the approach of
boosting the neuroplastic effects of anodal tDCS by serotonergic enhancement, a potential
approach for the use of tDCS for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.
6. Discussion
MDD is a complex disorder arising from various etiological routes, leading to variable
symptoms and treatment responses. A deeper understanding of its etiology and associated
synaptopathy [71] is essential for developing effective, individualized treatments that
consider specific symptom profiles and underlying causes [8]. This requires a theoretical
framework to guide measurement [ 7], research into etiology and patient subtypes, and
treatment strategies [10,12,101]. Such a foundation can facilitate the development of gen-
erative, mechanistic models of the disorder at the biotype or individual level—what we
refer to as neurotwins in reference to the notion of a digital twin, which is a virtual model
designed with sufficient detail to accurately reflect a physical object or system, commonly
used for simulation, analysis, and control purposes to optimize its operation.
Identifying agent elements in neurobiology can provide a blueprint for building mod-
els to explore the causes, stratification, and treatment of MDD. In this paper, we have
proposed an initial draft of this map. Mapping the abstract agent model onto the complex
“spaghetti code” of biological systems is a crucial step in this program. However, the hier-
archical and intricately woven nature of neural networks—essential for managing complex-
ity [205], optimizing performance, and ensuring stability [113,206,214,224,276–278]—adds
significant complexity to this task.
Mechanistic models of complex systems, such as the brain, represent a significant
advancement over empirical observations or phenomenological approaches. They provide
a structured and predictive framework that enhances our understanding of underlying
processes and interactions, crucial for scientific inquiry. Unlike empirical observations
that document phenomena under certain conditions, mechanistic models explain why
and how these occur, essential for fields like neuroscience and physics to predict and
manipulate outcomes based on the system’s internal workings [279,280]. In neuroscience,
such models allow for simulating and predicting neural behavior, offering insights into
brain function and dysfunction and enabling the development of targeted therapeutic
interventions—including brain stimulation and pharmacological treatments. Construct-
ing these models often requires interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating insights from
various fields [281,282].
With advancements in brain stimulation technologies, such as multichannel systems
and focused ultrasound stimulation, the prospect of network-level interventions becomes
feasible [283]. To maximize their potential, a constructivist approach is essential—mirroring
engineering practices—since the parameter space of brain stimulation is too vast for exhaus-
tive empirical exploration. By leveraging the agent framework, it is natural to approach the
design of therapies through simulation grounded on mechanistic models.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 30 of 71
Moreover, beyond recognizing distinct biotypes reflecting different etiological routes,
personalized treatment can greatly benefit each patient. As part of the emerging field
of computational neurotherapeutics, we and others are pursuing research on treating
neurological conditions such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease [ 107,258,284–287]. By
developing personalized, mechanistic, whole-brain models that capture the intricacies of
brain structure and function in health and disease, we can simulate the impacts of brain
stimulation and pharmacological, such as psychedelics, and other interventions to deliver
a paradigm shift in neurology [18,23,25,225,288].
Extending these innovations into psychiatry is the next frontier. The ultimate goal
of this program is to create parsimonious, mechanistic generative models that elucidate
sentient behavior and its pathologies [ 18], reshape current nosology in more biological
dimensions, and provide advanced therapeutic interventions (see Figure 4). Achieving this
requires interdisciplinary research in theoretical and applied aspects of brain modeling,
clinical neuroscience, and psychiatry.

Figure 4. The agent and dynamical landscape frameworks provide a theoretical basis for the develop-
ment and interpretation of data analysis methods and mechanistic computational models of the brain.
This can be employed for a model-based design of therapeutic interventions such as pharmacology,
brain stimulation, or even psychotherapy, as well as their combination. In the figure, we display the
process of data assimilation from a group of reference healthy subjects/controls (HCs) and from MDD
patients of a particular subtype. The resulting sets of models can guide the design of an intervention
for the normalization of the dynamics and connectivity profile of the patients. The treatment can be
designed at the group [289] or individual level.
Whole-brain models aim to represent dynamical characteristics of neural function
and derive measurable quantities such as electrophysiology or neuroimaging data, as
well as represent the effects of interventions. Depending on the use case, more detailed
mechanistic realism is needed. For example, in the case of epilepsy, it is important to
represent mechanisms of generation and propagation of seizures in networks that brain
stimulation and drugs can influence, as well as the effects of these interventions. Given
the complexity of representing brain function, a multiscale approach is taken [281]. This is
normally achieved by breaking down the system into mesoscale patches or volumes in a
parcellation of the brain aligned with presumed function and connecting them with the
connectome as a starting point. Current models use from some fifty to several thousand
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 31 of 71
parcels. The activity of each parcel is modeled using neural mass models, which are in
turn inspired or derived from microscale modeling [290]. Finally, hybrid models combine
biophysical and physiological aspects of the brain [21,23].
Although ambitious, this program builds on existing research and technological ad-
vancements in computational power, numerical simulation, and AI. Computational models
for psychedelics can currently explain their acute (but not long-term) effects, e.g., an increase
in entropy [230,231,291]. While the concept of MDD whole-brain computational models has
been discussed [25,292,293], no biologically inspired model of MDD is currently available.
Once a modeling framework is established, it can be used for personalization and
treatment design. Typically, models are fitted to data by selecting specific features, such as
functional connectivity ([294] and others). A particularly interesting approach that does
not require the selection of features is to leverage large datasets to derive latent model
descriptions for biotype identification [295,296] and for the definition of loss functions for
data assimilation and treatment optimization. The basic idea is that it should be possible to
leverage the low dimensionality intrinsic in neuroimaging data. An autoencoder trained to
compress data can capture the low dimensional character of the data in its latent space (this
is essentially hierarchical data compression). This can then be exploited for data fitting and
clustering, e.g., identifying biotypes and differentiating healthy from pathological data,
which can be used to design therapeutic outcomes via simulation [296].
Figure 4 illustrates some of the lines of work in the computational neuropsychiatry
program described above. Variational autoencoders can be used to stratify patients and
identify biotypes in the latent space. To personalize whole-brain computational models,
the subject data can be projected into its latent space, where it can be compared to model-
simulated data in a principled way. Semiology data can help start the personalization
process from a biotype archetype of the model. Once the model is personalized, the effects
of brain stimulation can be evaluated in silico. A latent space analysis can be useful to
specify an optimization function, that is, where is the healthy region in the phase space that
the stimulation should bring the dynamics to.
While a detailed discussion is beyond our scope here, key requirements for a compu-
tational modeling approach to MDD, aligned with the agent framework and combined
treatment concepts, include the following:
• Exhaustive Brain Parcellation: Starting from a brain parcellation encompassing cortical
and subcortical regions clinically relevant in MDD, covering all the agent modules.
• Parametrizable Circuits: Representing all potentially affected circuits in a way that
allows parameters to characterize regional or connectivity alterations and inter-circuit
coupling.
• Plasticity Mechanisms: Implementing mechanisms for plasticity (state-dependent and
state-independent) and its dysfunction—synaptopathy.
• Effects of Intervention: Include representations of various therapeutic interventions—
pharmacological treatments (e.g., neuroplastogens), brain stimulation techniques,
psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications—and model their acute and long-term
effects on neural dynamics and plasticity.
Finally, the agent model within the Kolmogorov framework naturally extends to multi-
agent simulations, allowing for the study of complex social interactions by instantiating
multiple agents with unique algorithmic models. Agent-Based Social Simulation (ABSS)
has emerged as a major tool for modeling such social systems, enabling researchers to
study the emergent behaviors of individual agents and the resulting macro-level social
phenomena [297–300]. This capacity enables the framework to analyze social dynamics and
collective behaviors, akin to psychohistory in Asimov’s vision [301], or what we could call
Algorithmic Sociology. Through these simulations, we can study how prevalent individual
dysfunctions, such as MDD, impact social structures, decision-making, and collective
well-being, providing insights into how mental health issues at the individual level ripple
through societal interactions.

7. Conclusions
In this paper, we have tackled the challenge of defining depression and understanding
its etiology by integrating algorithmic and neurobiological perspectives. We have argued
that the abstract agent framework—which is closely linked to Karl Friston’s Active Infer-
ence/Free Energy Principle—can link to neurophenomenology (first-person experience and
associated symptoms) while providing a blueprint to interpret the roles of brain circuits
and dynamical phenomena. Although much remains to be carried out, these initial steps
align with our ultimate goal: constructing a mechanistic model of brain function within a
computational neuropsychiatric context [18], particularly focusing on depression.
We then reviewed current therapeutic approaches in light of the algorithmic agent
model, exploring associated notions of agent types and biotypes and candidate pathways
to depression. We emphasized the potential of combined therapies, including brain stimu-
lation and psychedelics, highlighting the roles of neural dynamics and plasticity.
Finally, we described the process of creating digital twins to optimize treatment, with
a special focus on the role of patient subtypes. Our work underscores the importance of
personalized, data- and model-driven approaches in treating MDD and opens new avenues
for integrating technology and neuroscience in mental health care.

Algorithm A1 Algorithmic agent. The algorithm describes the interaction of the agent with
the World W (companion agent). After initialization of Model M and Plan P, a loop is
entered while valence is above zero (representing the state of being “alive”) where sensing,
prediction and comparison steps update the agent’s model M. Valence V is computed
from this model using the Objective Function ObjFun. The planning engine Planner
takes in model and valence (of the current state), and simulates potential actions/plans
P impacting future model and objective function values, until an optimal set of actions is

Appendix C. Review of Brain Regions discussed in the text
Appendix C.1. Nucleus Accumbens (NAc)
The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central integrator of sensorimotor information, plays
a pivotal role in facilitating either the approach or avoidance of a stimulus. It receives
substantial dopaminergic input from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), which releases
dopamine in response to various social stimuli and motivated behaviors. The NAc also
receives input from the basolateral amygdala (blAMY) and hippocampus (HIP) and projects
to the ventral pallidum (VP) [302].
The NAc’s connections extend to the medial network areas, including Area 25 in the
subgenual part of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), which specifically projects to the
NAc’s “shell” [303]. The amygdala input to the striatum aligns with that of the medial
network, and these striatal regions project to the ventral pallidum [303].
The NAc, along with the VP , forms part of the ventral striatopallidal system. It com-
prises two subregions, the core and the shell, distinguishable by hodology and neurochemi-
cal profiles. The shell contributes more to dopamine effects and behavioral reinforcement
than the core. Depletion of dopamine in the NAc decreases reinforcement behaviors, while
appetitive behaviors remain intact, suggesting the NAc’s role in modulating the “wanting”
rather than the “liking” of relevant stimuli. Lesions to the NAc result in impulsive choices
in mammals [302].
The NAc’s role in regulating behaviors related to depression and addiction underscores
its potential involvement in the comorbidity of these disorders. The etiology of this
comorbidity, although not fully understood, may reflect an imbalanced activation of the
reward circuit and signaling mechanisms. The NAc is divided into shell and core areas, with
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 35 of 71
the shell receiving limbic system information and the core primarily receiving motor system
information. Its unique location and structure make the NAc critical in various motivational
and emotional disorders, including depression, drug abuse, and addiction [304].
Cholinergic neurons in the NAc are crucial in the development of addiction and
depression, potentially through their ability to alter CHT function, HCN2 expression,
or p11 expression, and by silencing GSK3 b. Clinical studies have shown a significant
reduction in p11 protein in patients with depression, suggesting p11 as a potential treatment
target for comorbidity [304].
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the NAc has shown promise in treating addiction
and depression, indicating that NAc modulation can positively impact psychiatric symp-
toms [ 304]. However, further research is needed to understand the specific
mechanisms involved.
The NAc responds to the emotional intensity and self-relatedness of various stimuli,
independent of their valence, with both positive and negative valences possibly processed
along a rostrocaudal gradient [2]. It receives projections from midbrain regions, emotion-
involved regions, motor regions, and memory-involved regions. The NAc also indirectly
projects to cortical regions, including the cingular and medial prefrontal cortex, the ven-
tral pallidum, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus, many of which are
implicated in emotion processing [2].
The distinct roles of the NAc’s dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) in regu-
lating cue-elicited approach-avoidance decision-making have been highlighted in recent
research. Antagonism of D1R leads to avoidance behavior, while antagonism of D2R results
in preference behavior, suggesting differential control over decision-making involving
approach-avoidance conflict resolution [160].
A recent study has shown that the balance of activity at NAc D1Rs plays a key role
in enabling the rapid activation of a focused, reward-seeking state. This study suggests
that dopamine transmission in the NAc is integral in mediating the influence of reward
expectations on reward-seeking actions [305].
The NAc, in conjunction with the VTA, forms a critical part of the neurocircuitry
domains that contribute to the development of compulsive-like behaviors underlying drug
addiction. These domains correspond to three functional domains: binge/intoxication,
withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation [306], further emphasizing
the NAc’s role in regulating behaviors related to addiction and depression.
Appendix C.2. Amygdala (AMY)
The Amygdala (AMY), a significant limbic structure, plays a pivotal role in the emo-
tional coding of environmental stimuli and in adjusting motivational levels [ 307]. It is
particularly involved in reward processing through its interactions with the ventral stria-
tum (VS), with connections extending throughout much of the VS and densely terminating
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [307].
The basolateral amygdala (blAMY), a subregion of the AMY, is often referred to as
the “multimodal amygdala” due to its role in integrating inputs from various sensory
modalities and influencing emotional behavior. It projects to the hypothalamus, striatum,
and NAc, and can modulate the firing rate of dopaminergic VTA neurons, providing a
mechanistic basis for its role in modulating goal-directed behaviors. Lesions of the blAMY
result in a loss of emotional learning, including fear conditioning [302].
Recent studies have shown that untreated depressed individuals exhibit amygdala
hyperactivation, which has been associated with increased responses to emotional faces,
particularly sad ones, in individuals with MDD [11].
The AMY is part of a system that links the medial prefrontal cortex and a few related
cortical areas to the ventral striatum and pallidum, the medial thalamus, the hypothalamus,
the periaqueductal gray, and other parts of the brainstem. This system is centrally involved
in mood disorders, including MDD [303].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 36 of 71
The AMY is also central to mood-congruent biases, involved in the early detection of
salient information at both conscious and subconscious levels, and helps to identify the
emotional significance of a stimulus and produces affective states [308]. It has numerous
connections with regions important for emotion processing, including the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) and other subcortical temporal structures, such as the hippocampus. This
temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network modulates neural and behavioral responses to
emotional stimuli, as well as integrates visceral and emotional states with cognition and
behavior [308].
In MDD, the AMY shows decreased connectivity with various brain regions both
within and outside of the Central Executive Network (CEN), which likely reflects a loss of
top–down control [309]. This decoupling of the AMY and insula within a network involved
in emotional processing has been reported in mildly depressed patients [309].
Recent insights suggest that there is a significantly reduced recurrent inhibition within
the left AMY, which is consistent with the essential role of intrinsic inhibition in regulating
amygdala activation and fear expression [ 158]. This could potentially contribute to the
hyperactivity observed in the AMY in MDD patients.
Furthermore, studies have shown reduced amygdala–prefrontal coupling in major
depression, which is associated with the severity of the illness [ 310]. This decreased
functional coupling of the amygdala and supragenual cingulate is related to increased
depression in unmedicated individuals with current MDD [310].
In conclusion, the AMY, including its subregion the blAMY, plays a significant role in
emotional processing and reward associations in the brain. Its dysfunction could potentially
contribute to the emotional dysregulation and anhedonia often observed in MDD, although
further research is needed to fully elucidate these relationships.
Appendix C.3. Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)
The DLPFC is a pivotal brain region with distinct functional roles. It can be divided
into three regions—dorsal, ventral, and caudal—based on local cortico-cortical connections,
each interconnected with other local areas and connected to specific areas in other parts of
the cortex [303]. Further subdivision, as per the Sallet atlas, reveals ten subregions grouped
into three main areas: a frontal part, a medial part, and a posterior part [311,312].
In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the DLPFC plays a significant role, with dys-
regulation potentially disrupting goal-directed cognition and working memory [193]. The
DLPFC is involved in cognitive control, working memory, and selective attention, with
hypoactivation often leading to cognitive deficits in MDD. However, hyperactivation,
potentially a compensatory mechanism, and structural alterations such as reduced gray
matter have also been observed [11].
The DLPFC exhibits a stable and individual-specific functional connectivity pattern,
which remains consistent within individual subjects across different days, suggesting its
potential as a biomarker in MDD diagnosis and treatment [184]. As a key component of the
Central Executive Network (CEN), the DLPFC plays a crucial role in working memory and
attention, co-activating with the Salience Network (SN) during various cognitive tasks [56].
The DLPFC is also a key component of the Cognitive Control Network (CCN), which
is prominently disrupted in late-life depression (LLD), resulting in symptoms of executive
dysfunction [313]. Furthermore, the DLPFC is part of the left and right DLPFC/parietal
cortex networks, which impose strong constraints on information processing [56].
The DLPFC is also a node within the Central Executive Network (CEN), which has
been shown to be dysregulated in patients with depression [314]. A study by Camchong et
al. suggested that tDCS targeting the DLPFC could potentially be used as a therapeutic
intervention for alcohol use disorder (AUD), and by extension, for MDD [315].
The DLPFC has been identified as a potential target for individualized transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment [184] and is involved in modulating thalamocortical
and cortico-thalamic activity, which could be related to the difficulty MDD patients have in
“letting go” of a negative mood [303]. It also plays a role in reward processing, particularly
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 37 of 71
in monitoring incentive-based behavioral responses, and in the control of goal-directed and
stimulus-driven attention [157,307].
The DLPFC’s functional connectivity is modulated by emotional states, potentially
contributing to mood dysregulation in MDD [ 316]. Altered functioning in the DLPFC,
indicative of aberrant working memory processing, has been observed in MDD, high-
lighting its potential as a therapeutic target [310]. The DLPFC is also thought to regulate
memory-relevant cortical activity levels, influencing memory representation [ 317]. The
DLPFC has been implicated in the consolidation and transformation of episodic memory,
with longitudinal studies showing increased connectivity between the DLPFC and the
hippocampus predictive of memory retention [317].
In conclusion, the DLPFC is a complex and multifaceted region of the brain, with a
significant role in cognitive function and the pathophysiology of MDD. Understanding
the specific roles of its subregions and its individual-specific functional connectivity could
provide valuable insights into the etiology of MDD and inform the development of novel
therapeutic approaches.
Appendix C.4. Hippocampus (HC)
The hippocampus, a key component of the human brain, is instrumental in the forma-
tion of new, declarative memories, encompassing both episodic and semantic memories.
Episodic memory pertains to the recall of specific events linked to a particular time and
place, while semantic memory relates to general knowledge about the world. The hip-
pocampus is deeply involved in these memory processes [121].
Moreover, the hippocampus facilitates communication between the neocortex and
itself, processing “what” (e.g., stimuli, items) and “where” information in segregated
parallel streams. This functional segregation is preserved in the parahippocampal region,
with the perirhinal and lateral entorhinal areas crucial for item memory (“what”), and the
postrhinal and medial entorhinal areas significant for contextual memory (“where”) [133].
The hippocampus also plays a pivotal role in integrating event and context information,
forming specific item–place associations and integrating what–where information. This
ability is reflected in the coding properties of individual hippocampal neurons, with
different subsets selectively coding for “what” and “where” information and others for
specific what–where conjunctions [133]. The hippocampus is also implicated in forming
what–when associations, including memory for the sequence of specific events, a capacity
primarily dependent on its subregion CA1 [133].
Beyond memory formation, the hippocampus is intricately connected to various other
cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, receiving inputs from and sending outputs to
several areas [121]. This suggests that the hippocampus is part of a complex brain network,
contributing to its diverse functions.
The hippocampus selectively contributes to the retrieval of detailed context memo-
ries [103] and is involved in the consolidation of information during memory consolidation,
forming a cortical–hippocampal–cortical loop of information processing [103].
The role of the hippocampus in depression is not explicitly mentioned in the provided
snippets, necessitating further research. Similarly, information on specific symptoms or
patient subtypes associated with hippocampal dysfunction is not provided. However, a
study by Dedovic et al. (2010) found a significant positive correlation between hippocampal
volume and cortisol awakening response (CAR) in men, suggesting a potential role of the
hippocampus in stress response, often dysregulated in depression [318].
Appendix C.5. Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)
The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a pivotal brain region involved in a myriad of func-
tions, including sensory processing, pleasure coding, and executive function. Functionally,
it is part of two distinct networks: the sensory-related orbital network and the output-
oriented medial network, which modulates visceral function in relation to emotion and
other factors [303].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 38 of 71
The OFC is also a crucial hub for pleasure coding, with its subregions playing distinct
roles in hedonic processing [3]. Neuroimaging studies have revealed differential activity in
the medial OFC (mOFC), mid-anterior OFC (midOFC), and lateral OFC (lOFC) in response
to reward, depending on the context [3].
Moreover, the OFC, in conjunction with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), projects to specific regions within the
ventral striatum (VS), providing an anatomical substrate for modulation between these
circuits [307]. This suggests a critical role for the OFC in integrating information from
different cortical areas before passing it onto the medium spiny projection cells [307].
The OFC’s role extends to sensory processing, with parts of the OFC, such as the
lateral OFC, projecting directly to all sensory cortices, thereby directly influencing sensory
processing [319]. This suggests that the OFC is involved in the integration of sensory
information and affective states, which could be disrupted in Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) [310].
In the context of MDD, the OFC, along with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), has
been found to show abnormalities that emerge with the onset of MDD. Structural MRI
studies have reported volumetric reductions in the OFC in patients with MDD, indicating
a potential link between MDD and gray matter volume reduction in the OFC [310].
The OFC is also implicated in executive function networks related to addiction, specif-
ically in the Executive Function Stop (EF-Stop) network [320]. This suggests that the OFC
may play a role in inhibitory control, which could be relevant in the context of MDD, given
the high comorbidity between depression and addiction disorders.
Further studies have shown that depressed patients exhibit increased OFC functional
connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in response to negative stimuli,
which may reflect a greater neural response to such stimuli [308]. Additionally, reduced
OFC connectivity with the precuneus and cingulate gyrus has been observed, which may
be associated with problems in regulating self-schemas [308].
The OFC is also implicated in compulsivity, a feature of several disorders, including
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), substance dependence, eating disorders, and
behavioral addictions [49]. In OCD patients, brain imaging shows abnormal activity in the
OFC and other regions, which are known to be important for assessing whether stimuli are
positive or negative (rewarding or punishing) and for habit-learning [49].
The OFC also mediates outcome encoding in Pavlovian conditioning, which is a
learning process that could be disrupted in MDD. Moreover, aberrant working memory
processing, which is associated with the OFC, has been observed in major depression [310].
The OFC is also involved in attention and cognitive control circuits, which are impli-
cated in higher cognitive functions such as working memory and selective attention [10].
Dysfunction of these circuits during the effortful selective processing of relevant stimuli
while inhibiting irrelevant stimuli suggests a cognitive dyscontrol biotype in depression,
which could be associated with OFC dysfunction [10].
In conclusion, the OFC is a critical region of the brain that plays a significant role
in emotion, visceral function, pleasure coding, executive function, compulsivity, and
cognitive control.
Appendix C.6. Insular Cortex (IC), Insula
The insular cortex, or insula, is a significant component of the brain’s functional
network, playing a pivotal role in interoception, a sensory-driven phenomenon associated
with the neuroanatomy of ascending homeostatic pathways that transmit interoceptive
sensations to the brain [157]. The insula is instrumental in converting these signals into
a ‘global emotional moment’, with the anterior insula being a central area for human
awareness [157].
The insula is also a part of the mesocorticolimbic circuit, a key player in processing
diverse pleasures. Neuroimaging studies frequently highlight the insula’s activation in
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 39 of 71
response to various pleasures, indicating its role in generating hedonic experiences, which
are fundamental to emotional well-being [321].
Furthermore, the insula is integrated into the medial network, which is interconnected
with other areas such as the anterior and Posterior Cingulate Cortex, and the entorhinal and
parahippocampal cortex. This network is characterized by outputs to visceral control areas
in the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray, modulating visceral function in relation to
emotion or other factors [303].
The insula is also recognized as one of the “rich club” hubs, believed to function as
a high-capacity backbone for synchronizing neural activity and integrating information
across the entire brain [52].
In the context of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the insula’s role remains to be
fully elucidated. However, its involvement in emotional processing and awareness, as well
as in the generation of hedonic experiences, suggests a potential role in the etiology of MDD.
Insular dysfunctions could potentially lead to altered emotional awareness and processing
and a diminished capacity for pleasure, common symptoms in MDD patients [10].
The insula’s role in dynamically mapping changes in cardiorespiratory interoception
could also be relevant in understanding its role in MDD [262]. Symptoms such as anhedonia,
persistent feelings of sadness, or emotional numbness, often seen in MDD patients, could
potentially be linked to insular dysfunction [10].
Interestingly, emotional awareness can be preserved even after extensive bilateral
damage to the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala [157], suggesting a more complex
role of the insula in emotional processing and awareness than previously thought.
The insula is also part of the intrinsic cognitive networks (ICNs) of the human brain,
which impose strong constraints on information processing. Disruptions to these networks
contribute to specific patterns of cognitive and behavioral impairments [56], further em-
phasizing the potential role of the insula in the etiology of MDD and its potential as a target
for therapeutic interventions.
In late-life depression, cerebrovascular disease may predispose, precipitate, or perpetu-
ate a depressive syndrome. The presence of white matter lesions identified as white matter
hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI is
associated with a worse illness course and cognitive performance. Moreover, greater WMH
volume was associated with increased BOLD response in the rostral cingulate (including
the sgACC) and insula in older adults with major depression when completing an emo-
tional regulation task [313]. In conclusion, the insula’s crucial role in the brain’s functional
network, particularly in emotional processing and awareness, and in the generation of
hedonic experiences, suggests its potential involvement in the etiology of MDD and its
potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
Appendix C.7. Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)
The vmPFC is a critical node in the brain’s functional neuroanatomy, playing a piv-
otal role in fear regulation and extinction, with its neurons signaling memory for fear
extinction. It is a critical component of the brain’s neural circuitry, playing a significant
role in the regulation of emotional responses and stress [ 303]. It is part of the medial
prefrontal network, which modulates visceral responses via the HYP and brainstem, and is
considered part of a larger “default system” of cortical areas implicated in self-referential
functions [303]. This network, including the vmPFC, is interconnected and characterized
by outputs to visceral control areas in the HYP and periaqueductal gray, forming an output
system that modulates visceral function in relation to emotion or other factors [303]. It is
also part of the core neurocognitive networks, including the Central Executive Network
(CEN), Salience Network (SN), and Default Mode Network (DMN), playing a crucial role
in self-referential mental activity and the detection and mapping of salient external inputs
and internal brain events [56]. Moreover, the ventromedial PFC is implicated in autobio-
graphical memory retrieval, with strong connectivity with the hippocampus, crucial for
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 40 of 71
memory function, particularly pronounced during the early construction phase of detailed
remote memories [317].
The vmPFC plays a role in reward-based learning, receiving inputs from the DLPFC
and projecting to NAcc, a region involved in reward and reinforcement learning [307]. This
connection suggests a role for the vmPFC in the regulation of reward and motivation, which
may be disrupted in MDD [307]. The vmPFC is implicated in the generation of an abstract
representation of the rewarding value of a stimulus by attending to its context, and the
learning of contingencies based on this representation [2]. This function may be particularly
relevant to the anhedonia often observed in MDD. The vmPFC supports the ability to
focus on goal-relevant information by filtering out irrelevant information, a process akin to
dimensionality reduction [322]. It is also involved in autobiographical memory retrieval,
showing strong connectivity with the hippocampus during the retrieval of detailed remote
memories [317].
The vmPFC, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region, responds to
rewarding outcomes and to contextual aspects of reward during anticipation [307]. vmPFC
has been identified as a connector hub of the dorsal subnetwork, interacting with the
medial fronto-polar cortex (mFP) via sgACC in the ventral subnetwork [ 316]. It is also
part of the Default Mode Network (DMN), involved in various cognitive processes such
as semantic and conceptual processing, imagery, mind wandering, memory, empathy,
person perception, mental-state inference, self-related processing, valuation, and language
processing [157]. As part of DMN, the vmPFC has strong structural connections to limbic
areas such as AMY, and has been linked to emotional control, self-referential activity,
and internal mentation [309]. The DMN is crucial for self-referential mental activity, and
vmPFC dysfunction could contribute to the self-focused negative rumination often seen in
MDD [56].
The ventromedial PFC’s role extends to interoceptive predictions, fundamental to
perception, cognition, and emotion. Aberrant interoceptive predictions can lead to chronic
physical burdens, resulting in disorders of mood, appetite, and metabolism, such as de-
pression [157]. This region also acts as a connector hub in the brain’s dorsal subnetwork,
interacting with the medial fronto-polar cortex (mFP) via the sgACC in the ventral subnet-
work, with these connectivity patterns associated with the intensity of sadness experienced
by individuals [316].
This region is also implicated in the etiology of MDD, with distinct roles in depression
attributed to the vmPFC and the DLPFC [ 101,185]. The vmPFC is associated with self-
referential thinking and emotion regulation: hyperactivity in the vmPFC has been linked
to rumination, a common symptom of depression where individuals persistently focus
on their depressive symptoms or the causes of their distress. This would commonly
be associated with biotypes of depression characterized by high levels of rumination
or negative self-focus. The DLPFC, on the other hand, is involved in cognitive control
and executive function. Hypoactivity in the DLPFC is often associated with depression,
contributing to symptoms such as difficulty concentrating or making decisions. This could
align with biotypes of depression that display pronounced cognitive symptoms.
The vmPFC is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, with structural abnor-
malities and chronically hyperactive metabolism within the vmPFC and other agranular
visceromotor regions preceding the onset of depression [157]. In MDD, the vmPFC and
related regions exhibit alterations in gray matter volume, cellular elements, neurophysio-
logical activity, receptor pharmacology, and gene expression [303]. Dysfunction within this
network is posited to underlie the disturbances in emotional behavior and other cognitive
aspects of MDD, including disturbances in autonomic and neuroendocrine function [303].
The ventromedial PFC’s dysfunction is particularly relevant in depression subtypes associ-
ated with chronic alcohol use, which can remodel prefrontal neurons and disrupt NMDA
receptor-mediated fear extinction encoding [185]. This region is also associated with re-
ward processing, often dysfunctional in MDD, and linked to anhedonia, a core symptom of
depression [323].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 41 of 71
The ventromedial PFC’s association with autonomic function suggests that its dys-
function may contribute to the heightened affective, neuroendocrine, and sympathetic au-
tonomic arousal seen in depression, potentially leading to an understimulation of parasym-
pathetic tone in mood disorders [324].
Appendix C.8. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), particularly the subgenual ACC (sgACC), plays
a pivotal role in emotional behavior modulation, as evidenced by neuroimaging studies in
humans and lesion analyses in experimental animals [324]. This region, also known as the
subcallosal anterior cingulate gyrus, is composed of the agranular cortex, characterized as
the Brodmann area (BA) 24 anteriorly and BA 25 posteriorly [324].
In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the sgACC exhibits abnormal reductions in
gray matter volume, irrespective of mood state, in subjects with MDD and bipolar disorder.
This abnormality is associated with a reduction in glia, without a corresponding loss of
neurons. Moreover, metabolic activity in the sgACC is elevated during depressive phases
in MDD subjects, with effective antidepressant treatment correlating with a reduction in
sgACC activity [324].
The sgACC’s clinical significance in MDD is underscored by its role in ameliorating
depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant MDD through deep brain stimulation [324].
Furthermore, the ACC is a critical hub for pain-induced depression, emphasizing its role in
emotional regulation and depressive symptom manifestation [325].
The ACC, receiving nociceptive information from thalamic inputs, mediates cognitive
and affective aspects of pain [325]. Overactivation of the sgACC enhances cardiovascular,
behavioral, and neural responses to threat, altering cortisol dynamics during stress, reduc-
ing vagal tone and heart rate variability, and heightening reactivity to proximal and distal
threat [185].
The ACC, including the sgACC, is part of the negative affect circuit, which is engaged
by negative emotional stimuli and modulated by serotonergic neurotransmitter path-
ways [326]. The sgACC is implicated in sadness regulation, possibly through its regulatory
role in relation to two hub network areas, rather than a direct driving mechanism [316].
The sgACC has been found to be a useful predictor of antidepressant treatment
outcome, providing insight into which patients with depression might respond to treat-
ment [314]. The ACC, including the sgACC, is connected to several brain structures via
white matter tracts such as the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus, which have been
strongly implicated in the Salience Network (SN) and serve as potential sites of modulation
for emotion dysregulation [314].
In conclusion, the sgACC’s crucial role in emotional behavior regulation and its signifi-
cant impact in MDD, particularly in treatment-resistant MDD and pain-induced depression,
underscores its importance. Overactivation of the sgACC can lead to enhanced responses to
threat, further emphasizing its role in stress-related disorders such as depression and anxi-
ety.
Appendix C.9. Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)
The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), a critical component of the brain’s reward circuitry,
is primarily composed of dopamine neurons and is centrally located within the brain’s
reward circuit, which also includes the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the substantia nigra
(SN) among other regions [307]. The VTA is part of the mesolimbic dopamine system, which
includes dopamine cell bodies within the midbrain VTA and substantia nigra (SN) that
send reciprocal projections throughout the limbic brain, including the striatum, amygdala,
habenula, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [325]. This system is crucial for reward
processing, but it does not drive the hedonic experience of reward (“liking”) but rather the
instrumental behavior of reward-driven actions (“wanting”) [325].
The NAc, which receives complex inputs and outputs from multiple brain regions
including the VTA, plays a critical role in a variety of motivational and emotional disorders,
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 42 of 71
including depression, drug abuse, and addiction [ 163]. The main output neurons from
the NAc are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which project via GABAergic projections
to the VTA, among other regions [ 163]. MSNs are divided into two types according to
dopamine (DA) receptor expression: the DA receptor D1 positive (D1C) MSNs stimulate
reward-related behavior while DA receptor D2 positive (D2C) MSNs promote aversive
behavior [163].
The VTA is also a part of the social decision-making network (SDM), which is con-
cerned with regulating and implementing adaptive behavioral outputs in response to
salient environmental challenges and opportunities. This network shares overlapping
nodes with the mesolimbic reward system and the social behavior network (SBN), and
has been studied extensively in the context of addiction and regulating appetitive behav-
ior [302].
While the specific role of the VTA in depression is not explicitly mentioned in the
provided snippets, it is well established that dysfunctions in the brain’s reward circuitry,
including the VTA, are implicated in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Alterations in
the reward circuit can lead to anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD characterized by a
diminished ability to experience pleasure. Reduced phasic dopamine signaling, a hallmark
of anhedonia, is associated with the VTA and is exhibited in both drug-dependent and
chronic pain states [325].
Clinical studies of individuals with mood disorders have implicated that the networks
are formed by the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) and anatomically related areas
of the striatum, thalamus, temporal cortex, and limbic system in the pathophysiology of
depression. These networks, which include the VTA, contain alterations in gray matter
volume, cellular elements, neurophysiological activity, receptor pharmacology, and gene
expression in individuals with mood disorders. Dysfunction within these circuits may
account for the disturbances in emotional behavior and other cognitive aspects of the major
depressive syndrome [303].
Xu et al. provide additional insight into the role of the VTA in depression, particularly
in relation to addiction. It suggests that the VTA Cav1.3 channels are necessary for a GluA1
S831 phosphorylation-dependent increase in CP-AMPARs in the NAc shell, a mechanism
that has been suggested to contribute to increases in CP-AMPAR levels at the synapse.
This Cav1.3/CaMKII/ERK2 signaling within the VTA mediates the long-term molecular
changes in the NAc via a CREB-dependent mechanism. Moreover, cocaine CPP and
depressive-like phenotypes can be reversed by the infusion of CP-AMPAR-specific blockers
into the NAc shell, which suggests that the modulation of AMPAR transmission may link
addiction with depression [163].
Gorwood et al. [2] further emphasize the role of the VTA in anhedonia, a core symptom
of MDD. It suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), which is involved
in the cognitive aspects of emotional processing, may reflect a cortical compensatory
mechanism for an underactive subcortical/striatal response to pleasant stimuli. This could
be due to the VMPFC inhibiting emotional processing performed by other limbic structures,
leading to reduced emotional experience. Furthermore, the snippet suggests that the VTA
and other regions involved in the identification of emotional stimuli and the generation of
emotional behavior show increased activity in depressed patients, while regions involved
in the effortful regulation of emotional behavior show decreased activity. This pattern of
activity reverses after recovery from a major depressive episode.
Price et al. [303] provide additional information on the connections of the VTA with
other brain regions. It suggests that the VTA is connected to the medial prefrontal network,
which has substantial outputs to the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray, and other
visceral control centers. These connections may play a role in the regulation of emotional
responses and the assessment of non-food sensory objects.
Di Giovanni et al. [327] suggest that serotonin-2C receptors play a role in the function
of the VTA. This could potentially link the VTA to the serotonin system, which is known to
be involved in mood regulation and is often targeted in the treatment of depression.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 43 of 71
Appendix C.10. Hypothalamus (HYP)
HYP , a small but crucial region at the brain’s base, is integral to autonomic functions
such as heart rate and respiration. It is located above the brainstem and below TH. It is
roughly the size of an almond. This region plays a crucial role in many important functions,
including releasing hormones and regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, and
circadian rhythms. It has direct connections with various other brain regions that are
integral to emotional processing, including AMY, which processes fear and anxiety, and
HC, involved in memory formation.
HYP plays an important role in the complex neural circuits responsible for the process-
ing and evaluation of valence—the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or averseness
(negative valence) of an event, object, or situation.
It receives and integrates diverse signals from various brain regions and subsequently
helps evaluate the emotional or hedonic value (valence) of stimuli. These evaluations
can then inform motivated behaviors. Signals from HYP are further processed by regions
such as the NAc, a key component of the brain’s reward system, to generate the overall
perception of reward.
At the same time, HYP also plays a critical role in encoding actions related to the
reward system. Specifically, the lateral HYP has been found to be particularly involved in
reward-seeking behaviors. As we saw, these behaviors can be broadly classified into two
types: “liking” or “wanting”. “Liking” behaviors refer to the immediate pleasure derived
from a reward, while “wanting” behaviors refer to the motivational component driving an
organism to seek out a reward. HYP is thought to be particularly involved in the “wanting”
aspect of reward processing (action).
Motivations or emotions generated by subcortical circuits involving the NAc may
be powerfully modulated by “top-down” corticolimbic controls from PFC. In humans,
the successful voluntary suppression of subjective cravings or emotional responses is
accompanied by the activation of prefrontal cortical areas and a simultaneous reduction
in subcortical activity in NAc, AMY, and VTA. In this context, the HYP modulates and
complements inputs from PFC to NAc, and as such, it may be seen to be part of the agent’s
distributed valence evaluation system [155].
HYP plays a key role in reward processing. The hypothalamic pathway, particularly
the lateral hypothalamic area, is intimately connected with the reward centers in the brain—
both evaluation and action. Lateral HYP to VTA neurons encode the learned action of
seeking a reward, independent of reward availability, driving action [328]. These neurons
selectively encoded the action of reward-seeking, but did not encode environmental stimuli,
while rewarding stimuli and reward-predictive cues were encoded by a discrete population
of lateral HYP neurons downstream of the VTA [328].
This area is associated with pleasure and reward behaviors. The hypothalamus is part
of the larger mesolimbic dopamine system, commonly referred to as the brain’s “reward
pathway”. It belongs to a network of brain regions, most notably involving VTA and
NAc, mediating reward seeking and consumption behavior by increasing the saliency of
environment cues and promoting positive reinforcement [328]. HYP is heavily influenced
by the medial prefrontal network, particularly the subgenual cortex, with projections
terminating in both the medial and lateral hypothalamus and the periaqueductal gray
(PAG), a region implicated in pain modulation and defensive behavior [303].
Lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is strongly connected to
the HYP , can eliminate the automatic visceral response to emotional stimuli. This can lead
to severe decision-making impairments, despite preserved cognitive intelligence, resulting
in a failure to comprehend the long-term implications of actions and a propensity for
immediate gratification [303]. HYP is also part of a complex network with the TH and
PFC, involved in reward processing. Dysfunction within this network could contribute to
depressive symptoms. Evidence from PET and fMRI studies suggests that HYP may be
implicated in reward-processing deficits observed in depression [307].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 44 of 71
Intersecting with the social behavior network (SBN) and reward systems, the hypotha-
lamus plays a fundamental role in behavior regulation and is part of a conserved social
decision-making circuit across major vertebrate lineages, integrating social and reward
information [302]. The lateral septum (LS) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST),
both hypothalamic components, mediate information about social stimulus salience into
adaptive behavioral output, regulating social and reward-related behaviors. HYP also reg-
ulates parental care and sexual behavior, with lesions inhibiting receptivity and preventing
parturition in certain animals, suggesting a role in reproductive behaviors [302].
HYP is implicated due to its role in stress response. Dysregulation of the Hypothalamic–
Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis, which controls the body’s response to stress, is a key factor
in the pathophysiology of depression. Chronic stress can lead to hyperactivity of the HPA
axis, which can result in depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the hypothalamus’ role in
sleep and circadian rhythm regulation can also contribute to mood disorders, as disruptions
in these areas are commonly seen in depression.
Interactions between HYP and mesocorticolimbic reward systems have been high-
lighted in recent research. For instance, hypothalamic orexin–hypocretin neurons modulate
the NAc, potentially enhancing food reward during hunger states. These interactions could
play a significant role in modulating food reward during hunger and satiety states and may
contribute to the development of eating disorders. Moreover, lesions of the lateral HYP dis-
rupt eating and drinking behaviors, suggesting a crucial role in regulating food “wanting”
and “liking”. However, the complexity of the hypothalamus and its interconnectedness
with other brain regions, such as the ventral pallidum, have been underscored by these
findings [329].
Furthermore, the hypothalamus, along with other visceromotor regions, is involved
in allostasis, the regulation of the body’s resources. Prolonged imbalances can lead to
illnesses that remodel the brain and the sympathetic nervous system, leading to behavioral
changes. This could potentially explain the role of the hypothalamus in depression [52]. In
conclusion, dysfunction in the hypothalamus or its connecting circuits to the PFC could
contribute to depressive symptoms.
Appendix C.11. Thalamus (TH)
The thalamus, a critical “relay station” in the brain, is instrumental in transmitting
sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, regulating states of sleep and wakefulness,
and modulating consciousness and alertness. Its role extends to the pathophysiology of Ma-
jor Depressive Disorder (MDD), where it is implicated in mood and emotion dysregulation,
key features of the disorder [157].
The thalamus’s central role in thalamocortical oscillations is particularly noteworthy.
Increased thalamic excitation can disrupt these rhythms through its extensive projection
to the neocortex, a phenomenon observed in MDD patients. This disruption can lead to
symptoms such as insomnia, anhedonia, and cognitive impairment, all associated with
MDD [158]. The thalamus modulates the corticothalamic network, influencing states of
consciousness, vigilance, and higher cognitive processes. This modulation is mediated
by serotonin (5-HT) via its receptors, which are widely expressed in the corticothalamic
network and areas involved in slow-wave-discharge modulation, such as the striatum,
nucleus accumbens, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata [327].
The thalamus’s connections extend to the midline nuclei, including the paraventricular
thalamic nucleus, and other nuclei situated between the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic
nuclei. These nuclei have extensive connections, particularly with the medial prefrontal net-
work areas, and relay visceral function information to both the medial prefrontal network
and the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loop [303].
The thalamus’s significant connection with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), another region
implicated in MDD, is also noteworthy. The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus projects
to the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting a potential pathway for thalamic
influence on mood and cognitive functions [307].
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 45 of 71
The thalamic relay nuclei from the basal ganglia integrate information flow from
reward and higher cortical “association” areas of the prefrontal cortex, which could be
disrupted in MDD, leading to attentional deficits [ 307]. Both PET and FMRI findings
suggest that primary and secondary rewards can increase thalamic activation, indicating a
potential role of the thalamus in reward processing, often impaired in MDD [307].
The thalamus’s strong connections with the amygdala, a structure involved in emotion
generation and experience, further underscore its role in emotional processing [ 303]. In
terms of neural oscillations, the thalamus may influence the formation of semantic repre-
sentations through cortico-cortical interregional interactions, which could be disrupted in
MDD, affecting the integration of new information into existing knowledge [317].
Appendix C.12. Caudate (CAU)
The medial caudate, a key component of the brain’s reward system, is instrumental in
strategic action planning. It synthesizes information from reward and cognitive cortical
areas, thereby facilitating the selection of the most advantageous subsequent action. This
function is particularly pronounced when reward feedback informs subsequent actions,
but diminishes as action requirements become more predictable [307].
The caudate is embedded within the striato-nigro-striatal network, a sophisticated
system of connections encompassing various functional regions of the striatum, including
the ventral striatum (VS), the dorsal striatum, and the midbrain dopamine cells. This
network is organized in an ascending spiral, facilitating a feed-forward organization from
reward-related regions of the striatum to cognitive and motor areas [307].
In relation to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), research has identified smaller
putamen and caudate volumes in MDD patients compared to controls, indicating potential
structural abnormalities in these regions [303]. However, this finding is not universal, with
some studies reporting no significant difference in striatal or pallidal volumes between
younger MDD subjects and controls [303].
Given the caudate’s role in reward processing and its interconnectedness with other
functional regions of the striatum, it is conceivable that dysfunction in this area could
contribute to the anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities) frequently observed
in MDD patients. Furthermore, the caudate’s role in action control, as evidenced by
rodent studies, may also be relevant to its function in humans, potentially linking caudate
dysfunction to symptoms of impulsivity and poor decision-making in MDD patients [330].
While the specific symptoms and patient subtypes associated with caudate dysfunc-
tion are not detailed in the provided snippets, it is reasonable to infer that individuals
with MDD who exhibit pronounced anhedonia or impulsivity may have abnormalities in
caudate function.
Appendix C.13. Pallidum
The pallidum, a central brain region, is implicated in mood disorders due to its
connections with the medial network areas, including the nucleus accumbens and the
medial edge of the caudate nucleus, which are particularly significant in Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) [303]. The pallidum’s role in emotional dysregulation, a characteristic
of MDD, is suggested by its receipt of projections from the striatum, which is in turn
influenced by the amygdala, a region associated with emotional responses [303].
The pallidum’s involvement in the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loop, which inter-
acts with the medial prefrontal network and relays visceral function information, could
potentially be disrupted in MDD, leading to symptoms such as anhedonia and appetite
changes [303].
The ventral pallidum (VP), a pallidum component, mediates the hedonic impact of
”liked” sensations, suggesting a role in pleasure experience. Activation of the VP’s opioid
system can increase the hedonic impact of natural taste rewards and cause rats to eat
over twice as much food. Conversely, activation of the VP’s anterior portion, whereby
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 46 of 71
disgustingly rotten food sight has been reported to activate in humans, can suppress “liking”
reactions and reduce eating behavior [329].
The VP’s involvement in the motor output of motivated or goal-directed behaviors
and its role in reward processing, mediating both the “liking” and “wanting” components
of reward, suggest that dysfunction in this area could contribute to the anhedonia and
motivation changes observed in MDD [302].
The basolateral amygdala (blAMY), which projects to the pallidum, is involved in
emotional behavior and modulates goal-directed behaviors. Lesions of the blAMY result in
a loss of emotional learning, including fear conditioning [302], suggesting that dysfunction
in the pallidum-blAMY circuit could contribute to the emotional dysregulation observed
in MDD.
The pallidum’s serotonin (5-HT) receptors play a role in distinct behavioral responses,
with their expression dependent on the network’s activity state. Stimulation of 5-HT2C
receptors can dampen impulsive responses and promote compulsive responses, and both
agonists and antagonists at 5-HT2C receptors have been proposed in the treatment of mood
disorders, including MDD [327].
However, the specific symptoms and patient subtypes associated with pallidum
dysfunction in MDD are not clearly defined and may require further research.
Appendix C.14. Putamen
The putamen, a central brain structure within the striatum, plays a pivotal role in
various brain circuits and networks, including the regulation of movements, learning, and
the brain’s reward system [ 303]. It receives inputs from numerous brain areas, such as
the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), which projects to the striatum’s central and dorsal
parts [303].
In the context of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the putamen’s role is less ex-
plicit. However, it is implicated in mood disorders due to projections from the medial
network areas to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent medial edge of the caudate
nucleus bordering the lateral ventricle, which encompasses parts of the putamen [ 303].
This suggests a potential role of the putamen in depressive symptomatology, warranting
further investigation.
Research has indicated smaller putamen and caudate volumes in MDD patients
compared to controls, implying a structural abnormality in these areas in depression [303].
However, this finding is not universal across all patient subtypes or age groups, with some
studies reporting no significant difference in striatal or pallidal volumes between younger
MDD subjects and controls [303].
The putamen’s role in the brain’s reward system is particularly significant, as it forms
part of a complex network mediating various aspects of incentive-based learning, leading
to adaptive behaviors [ 307]. This network interfaces with circuits mediating cognitive
function to influence motor planning, suggesting that putamen dysfunction could disrupt
this process and contribute to MDD symptoms [307].
The putamen is also part of the salience network, crucial for detecting and mapping
salient external inputs and internal brain events [56]. This network’s extensive connectivity
with subcortical and limbic structures involved in reward and motivation underscores
the putamen’s role in the brain’s reward system, potentially explaining its involvement in
MDD, where reward processing dysfunctions are a key feature.
Anhedonia, a common symptom in depression characterized by a reduced ability to
experience pleasure, is thought to be related to abnormalities in reward processing. fMRI
studies have found that depression is characterized by reduced responsivity in the brain’s
cortical–basal ganglia reward network, which includes the putamen [308].
The specific symptoms and patient subtypes associated with putamen dysfunction
in MDD are not clearly defined. However, given its involvement in the reward system
and movement regulation, it is plausible that putamen dysfunction could contribute to
symptoms such as anhedonia and psychomotor retardation, both common in MDD.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 47 of 71
Appendix C.15. Globus Pallidus (GP)
The Globus Pallidus (GP), a subcortical structure within the brain, is integral to the
regulation of voluntary movement as part of the basal ganglia. This group of nuclei is
associated with a myriad of functions, including control of voluntary motor movements,
procedural learning, habit learning, eye movements, cognition, and emotion [307]. The GP
is also part of the reward circuit, a complex network of cortical and subcortical regions
that mediate incentive-based learning and adaptive behaviors. This circuit interfaces with
cognitive function circuits to influence motor planning, demonstrating the existence of dual
cortico-basal ganglia systems that allow for both parallel and integrative processing. These
interactive networks channel reward information through cognitive circuits to influence
motor control [307].
The GP primarily receives projections from the VS, a region linked with reward and
motivation. These fibers terminate in specific areas of the GP , namely the subcommissural
ventral pallidum, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of
the internal segment. However, the central and caudal portions of the GP are devoid of this
input [307].
It is suggested that increased GP inputs could disrupt ongoing patterns, facilitating
a behavioral switch. This could encompass behaviors related to mood, object value as-
sessment, and stimulus–reward association. Notably, lesions in the ventral striatum and
pallidum have been linked to perseverative deficits in stimulus–reward reversal tasks in
rats and monkeys, which could parallel the difficulty in mood disorders to “let go” of a
negative mindset [303]. Aberrant connectivity in the GP has been associated to a common
core of connectivity alterations in MDD [101].
The ventral pallidum, a component of the GP , has been implicated in mediating the
hedonic impact of “liked” sensations. Activation of the opioid system in the posterior
ventral pallidum can enhance the hedonic impact of natural taste rewards and increase food
consumption in rats. Conversely, activation in the anterior portion can suppress “liking”
reactions and reduce eating behavior, suggesting a potential role of the GP in mediating
pleasure and reward responses [329].
Appendix C.16. Periaqueductal Gray (P AG)
The Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) is a pivotal component of the brain’s circuitry, instru-
mental in the regulation of visceral functions [303]. It receives substantial outputs from the
medial prefrontal network, including the sgACC and the lateral part of the medial network.
The subgenual cortex provides the most substantial projection, terminating in both the
medial and lateral hypothalamus, and in both dorsolateral and ventrolateral columns of
the PAG. The fibers from the lateral part of the medial network are restricted to the lateral
hypothalamus and the ventrolateral PAG [303].
The medial prefrontal network, which heavily projects to the PAG, has been asso-
ciated with visceral activation in response to emotional or non-emotional stimuli. This
suggests that the PAG, as a recipient of these projections, may play a role in the emotional
dysregulation observed in MDD [303].
PAG dysfunction could potentially contribute to symptoms associated with decision-
making, favoring immediate reward without considering long-term consequences. This is
due to the strong connection between the PAG and the vmPFC, where lesions can abolish
the normal, automatic visceral response to emotive stimuli [303].
The PAG also modulates certain behaviors in animals, such as nursing and aggression
in female rats, and plays a distinctive role in vocalizations, specifically call initiation. It is
active during human speech, and lesions of the PAG can lead to mutism [302].
The GABAergic system, rich in neuronal projections in several brain regions, including
the midbrain tectum housing the PAG, is implicated in the regulation of the Hypothalamic–
Pituitary—Adrenal Axis (HPA), often dysregulated in MDD. GABAergic interneurons
selectively attenuate the firing of other neurons in the cortex through cortical inhibition
(CI), crucial for several physiological functions in the cortex [331]. This suggests a potential
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 48 of 71
mechanism through which the PAG could influence brain function and behavior, and
potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD.
The ACC plays a role in pain and emotional processing, which could be relevant to
the discussion of the PAG. The ACC is involved in the affective aspects of pain, and its
activity is increased in chronic pain states. This increased ACC activity is associated with
anxiety phenotypes and can influence behavior in several ways, including altering reward
responsivity in cost–benefit scenarios. Given the PAG’s role in visceral regulation and its
connections to the medial prefrontal network, changes in ACC activity could influence the
PAG’s function and contribute to the emotional dysregulation observed in MDD [325].
Appendix C.17. Cerebellum (CB)
The cerebellum, despite its uniform cortical architecture, plays a role in numerous
neurological functions—ranging from sensorimotor to emotional–social–psychological—
with damage to different areas impacting these varied domains. Its interaction with
extracerebellar structures provides heterogeneity to its function. The predictive coupling
between grip and load force profiles has been interpreted within the theoretical concept of
internal models for improved control. The cerebellum’s role in motor action predictions
is crucial, given the lag associated with the cerebral motor cortex relying on gradually
evolving sensory and somatosensory feedback, which could result in substantial time
delays (∼100 ms). Thanks to its consistent anatomical structure—featuring one output cell
and four primary interneurons—the cerebellum is well equipped to incorporate internal
forward models. By employing reference copies of motor commands, the cerebellum, akin
to a forward model, can anticipate the sensory impacts of voluntary actions, minimizing
dependence on delayed somatosensory feedback.
The cerebellum’s architecture is often characterized as feed-forward in nature. This
refers to the fact that information in the cerebellum flows in one direction, from input
to output, without recurrent loops, in contrast to the cortex which has many recurrent
connections [153]. This architecture supports its role in quick, real-time computations and
predictions necessary for tasks such as motor coordination and possibly certain cogni-
tive functions.
The cerebellum’s circuitry plays a key role in learning how to formulate accurate pre-
dictions by using error information about the differences between the actual and forecasted
sensory consequences of voluntary actions. With its anatomical connections, the cerebellum
is ideally positioned to compute expected sensory outcomes of voluntary motor actions for
improved control.
Research from functional brain imaging further corroborates the cerebellum’s signifi-
cance in establishing the equivalent of internal forward models within the central nervous
system [332]. This concept can be generalized beyond the motor function. Through a
computational process known as the universal cerebellar transform (UCT), the cerebellum
integrates internal and external stimuli to maintain behavioral homeostasis. Dysmetria, a
common symptom of cerebellum dysfunction, can manifest across all functional domains
depending on the site of the lesion. This can result in motor, vestibular, or cognitive limbic
symptoms—leading to different cerebellar syndromes [145]. Key computational principles
of cerebellar function, like prediction- and error-based learning, are thought to operate
cognitive cerebro-cerebellar loops [ 333]. Unlike the cerebral cortex, which depends on
feedback connections, the cerebellum encodes internal models that predict and control a
range of functions, from movement to cognition [104,145].
While prediction is a common function in many brain areas, cerebellar predictive
capabilities are temporally constrained and temporally precise, representing when, as well
as what is anticipated. The high temporal precision of cerebellar processing may be a key
characteristic to differentiate cerebellar processing from that in the cerebral cortex [333].
The cerebellum, with its high level of convergence and reciprocal connections to much of
the cerebral cortex, seems well positioned to integrate multiple inputs in order to generate
estimates of future states, an idea formalized by the concept of the (forward) model. The
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 49 of 71
cerebellum receives input from cortical areas via the pons and projects back to similar areas
via the TH, forming a closed-loop architecture [333]. Resting-state functional connectivity
studies highlight the interaction of the CB and HC, cingulate cortex, PFC, precuneus, and
superior temporal cortex [333].

Appendix D. Relationship with the Free Energy Principle and AIF
KT is part of a family of information-centric theories of cognition and consciousness.
This includes Predictive Coding or Processing Theory, Active Inference (AIF), and the Free
Energy Principle (FEP) [39,113,206,334–336], alongside the anarchic brain and the entropic
brain principle (REBUS/EBH) [ 112,255] and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [ 337].
While these theories primarily draw from the Shannon information theory (statistics) and
KT is rooted in algorithmic information theory, the divide between them can be bridged.
Specifically, the pursuit of statistical regularities in data for probabilistic model construction
can be interpreted as an effort to find the most concise program to describe it [338]. In this
context, probability theory can be viewed as a subset of KT—potentially the most feasible
approach for natural agents. As we will elucidate, KT offers a versatile mathematical
framework with diverse implementation options, including avenues like AIF or IIT [339].
AIF is a formulation based on causal statistical theory that accounts for action, per-
ception, and learning. The Free Energy Principle can be seen as a specific implementation
of algorithmic principles integrating the Objective Function in the inference process using
a Bayesian formulation. It states that in order to resist the natural tendency to disorder
(i.e., maintain stasis), any adaptive change in an agent will seek to minimize free energy
(surprise) or, equivalently, maximize the evidence for the generative internal model of sen-
sory data. To support adaptation, the Bayesian agent must discover information about the
likely external causes of sensory signals using its priors and information in the flux of the
sensory signals coupled with actions. A key function required in the FEP formulation is the
evaluation of prediction errors, which are then reused as data in hierarchical computations.
Figure A1 provides a comparison of the KT and AIF agent models, highlighting the fact
that in AIF, the evaluation of valence is implicitly carried out by the Comparator. Figure A2
highlights the hierarchical, distributed character of agent operations in natural systems.
Figure A1. KT and AIF agent models and etiology of MDD. Schematic view of the agent models in
KT and FEP/AIF. (a) In KT, the Objective Function is explicit, while in AIF, it is implicit in the loss
function (free energy). ( b) In AIF, the Planning Engine seeks to minimize free energy or surprise
(negative valence). All the agent elements, in either case, can be affected and lead to depression in KT,
i.e., persistent low valence: (i) Modeling Engine creates models leading to low valence; (ii) Objective
Function returns low valence regardless of the models and displays no plasticity to “recalibrate”;
(iii) Planning Engine delivers ineffective or detrimental plans for valence; and (iv) world provides
inputs with an implicit stasis threat that cascades down to low valence. Further details: The agent
interacts dynamically with its environment and is involved in a continuous exchange of data with
the external world. The Modeling Engine runs the model and makes predictions of future data (both
from external interfaces as well as the agent’s own actions) and then evaluates the prediction error
(from the Comparator C) to update the model. The Simulator (not shown for simplicity) is a shared
infrastructure used to run simulations for planning or valence evaluation. The Planning Engine (P)
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 53 of 71
runs counterfactual simulations and selects plans for the next actions (agent outputs). The Updater
receives as inputs prediction errors from the Comparator to improve the model. The other agent
element is the Objective Function (which may also be plastic), which the agent aims to optimize
through a choice of afferent actions selected by the Planning Engine.
To delve deeper into the connection between the FEP framework and KT, we must
first acknowledge the key role of “surprise” within the FEP context. This metric gauges
the extent of the agent’s prediction misalignment with the real-world data. Predictions
stem from models informed by historical data and potentially inherent biases or priors.
In mathematical terms, surprise is articulated as the negative log-likelihood of the data
relative to the agent’s representation of the world, denoted as J = −log P(y). To diminish
this element of surprise, the agent has the option to refine its models (like tweaking model
parameters or a more fundamental model overhaul) or initiate actions that influence future
data, thereby altering subsequent surprise levels.
Furthermore, the conceptualization of surprise within FEP inherently carries a bias.
This manifests through the integration of homeostatic assumptions or priors into the model.
For most natural agents, these are typically ingrained elements. They serve as a probabilistic
representation of anticipated states of both the agent and its environment, leaning towards
maintaining homeostasis. Consequently, the Objective Function inherent in KT is closely
linked with FEP’s surprise concept.
Figure A2. The hierarchical agent: Agent diagram displaying hierarchical processing of inputs (as
in the predictive coding framework) and with a segregated evaluation of valence, which is also
hierarchical, since it relies on the same hierarchical simulation engine.
In summary, AIF presents a unique architectural proposal for the instantiation of the
abstract algorithmic agent model. In this framework, the Objective Function is evaluated
as free energy within a Comparator mechanism. This represents a specific formulation
of valence, integrating both the agent’s understanding of the world and its goals within
the world. In contrast to KT, where prediction error is kept distinct from the Objective
Function and may be used in combination with other factors, the FEP inherently combines
these elements. The definition of FEP incorporates both “epistemic” error, which pertains
to the agent’s understanding of the world (“what is the world like”?), and “pragmatic”
error, which relates to the agent’s goals or desires (“what should the world be”?). This
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 54 of 71
amalgamation of epistemic and pragmatic error is hardwired in the FEP , providing a
specific design instance of the AIT agent model.
Finally, with regard to understanding MDD within the framework of AIF, several
studies focus on disruptions in interoceptive predictions (modeling errors) as a source of a
common vulnerability for mental and physical illness [157,208], while others take an evolu-
tionary perspective to argue that depression is an adaptive response to perceived threats of
aversive social outcomes to minimize prediction errors in interpersonal exchanges [340].
Appendix E. Metaphysics, Experience and Mathematics
Appendix E.1. Experience
In our efforts to understand the nature of consciousness, we often find ourselves grap-
pling with a fundamental puzzle. Consider two distinct sets of atoms: one set constitutes a
living, sentient entity, while the other forms an inanimate object. Prima facie, there appears
to be an evident distinction between the two, primarily because one is capable of experi-
encing reality, while the other is not. One might argue that it is the unique arrangement of
atoms in the conscious being that results in consciousness. But the counter-argument to this
is the realization that, on a granular level, these atoms are identical to those in the inanimate
set. So, why should one group be privy to the gift of consciousness and the other not?
Furthermore, is the transition from consciousness abrupt or smooth as the arrangement
of atoms changes? Either one creates new questions. When does it occur and why? If the
change is smooth, what does it depend on and does it fall to zero at some point? Why?
What we are describing of course is the “hard problem of consciousness”, the “ex-
planatory gap” [341], and the case for panpsychism, which is well explained in the work
of Strawson and Goff, among others [ 342,343]. One way to motivate it is to note that
experience exists, but this cannot be verified objectively. Science deals with measurement,
i.e., a third-person view, while experience is a first-person phenomenon. Physics, as part
of the scientific tradition, can never provide a mechanism for the abrupt appearance of
consciousness. If a bunch of atoms do not have “experience”, it is hard to see how physics
can explain why after some rearrangement it suddenly does.
It is much simpler to assume that experience is everywhere to begin with and address
the problem of different “shapes” of experience, which may perhaps be related to the
arrangement of atoms and their dynamics in a smooth way.
Experience must be brought into the picture as a first level class, an ontology at least
as fundamental as “quantum field” or particle if physics is to be able to handle it in any
way. This of course means merging first-person view with third-person, and redefining the
meaning of science.
Appendix E.2. Experience Everywhere
The notion that consciousness might exist only within the confines of (some?) biologi-
cal entities is a deeply ingrained anthropocentric bias. Could we not posit that all matter
possesses a degree of consciousness? This concept, known as panpsychism, presents a far
less contradictory perspective. It proposes that all forms of matter, from the smallest sub-
atomic particle to the vast galaxies, possess a rudimentary form of consciousness. This view
does not attribute consciousness merely to the specific arrangement of atoms but instead
suggests that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous property of the universe.
The inherent beauty of panpsychism lies in its simplicity. It respects Occam’s razor,
requiring fewer assumptions and circumventing the need for convoluted explanations.
This philosophy does not dismiss the notion that higher levels of consciousness can emerge
from more complex forms of matter. Instead, it acknowledges that every atom contributes
its fragment of consciousness to the grand tapestry of existence.
Complementing panpsychism, we can also bring the concept ofidealism into this discus-
sion. Idealism posits that reality, as we know it, is fundamentally mental- or consciousness-
based. It is a philosophy that places the mind, or, more broadly, consciousness, as the
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 55 of 71
primary component of the universe. See Goff’s work for a lucid discussion on these
philosophical notions [343].
In more detail, panpsychism and idealism are two distinct philosophical perspectives
that approach the nature of reality and consciousness differently. Panpsychism posits that
consciousness or a form of it, known as “experience”, is a fundamental and ubiquitous
feature of reality. Panpsychists propose that every particle in the universe, from atoms to
molecules, possesses a basic level of consciousness or experience. This does not necessarily
mean that an atom has complex experiences like humans, but rather that it possesses some
primitive form of experiential quality. The central idea is that consciousness is not exclusive
to complex organisms like humans but is a universal property intrinsic to all matter.
Idealism, on the other hand, holds that reality as we know it is fundamentally mental-
or mind-dependent. It asserts that all things that exist are constituted by mind or conscious-
ness. In its most radical form, known as “subjective idealism”, it suggests that only minds
and mental contents exist. A milder form, known as “objective idealism”, posits a shared
reality that is made up of mental entities or is fundamentally dependent on them. The
central idea is that consciousness or mind is not a product of physical reality, but instead,
physical reality is a manifestation of consciousness or mind.
While both panpsychism and idealism attribute a central role to consciousness, they
do so in different ways. Panpsychism considers consciousness as a fundamental property
that all particles possess to varying degrees, while idealism regards the mental or conscious
as the foundational substance of reality itself.
Appendix E.3. Fields and Excitations
We can find parallels to the notion of structured experience in the domain of modern
physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT). QFT describes the universe as a set
of underlying quantum fields. Each fundamental particle, like an electron, is seen as an
excitation within its respective field. All electrons are excitations in the same quantum field.
The entire physical universe, in this model, arises from the “structured” excitations of a
finite set of these quantum fields. The same applies to more complex structures, such as
ferrets or humans.
Drawing a parallel with consciousness, we can consider the idealist idea of basic
consciousness akin to these quantum fields. It presents the possibility that a form of
consciousness permeates the universe, much like quantum fields do. Complex excitations
or configurations within this universal consciousness field could then lead to what we
perceive as individual structured experiences.
In this framework, the structured conscious experiences we have, as espoused by
idealism, can be likened to the various manifestations of quantum fields. Just as the
excitations and interactions within quantum fields give rise to the myriad forms in our
physical universe, the structured computations within the consciousness field might give
rise to the diverse array of subjective experiences we are privy to.
This interpretation acknowledges the indivisibility and oneness of all things at the
most basic level while also recognizing the complexity and variety that emerge from
this foundation.
Appendix E.3.1. Primordial vs. Structured Experience
The terrain of consciousness extends from the most fundamental, raw experiences
to the intricate, organized perceptions we navigate daily. To appreciate this spectrum,
we need to discern between two forms of experience: the primordial experience and the
structured experience.
Primordial experience, as the term suggests, refers to the most basic, unadulterated state
of consciousness. It is pure and undifferentiated, devoid of concepts, spatial–temporal
organization, or a sense of self. This notion of unstructured consciousness is deeply
embedded in Eastern philosophical traditions. In Buddhism, it corresponds to the state
of “Shunyata” or emptiness, which lies beyond the realm of concepts and dualities. In
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 56 of 71
Hindu philosophy, it resonates with “Brahman”, the ultimate reality that is beyond all
classifications and qualifications.
Structured experience, on the other hand, represents the spatial, temporal, and concep-
tual organization of our first-person experience of the world and ourselves as agents within
it [344]. This is where mathematics, “the science of structure, order, and relation that has
evolved from counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects” [345], comes into
play. It provides a framework to organize the raw, primordial experience into comprehensi-
ble structures, thus forming our everyday conscious reality. We refer to this phenomenon
of consciousness endowed with such structure as “structured experience” [346]. It is the
phenomenal structure of consciousness, the architectural design that shapes our perception
and interaction with the world.
In our wakeful state, experience is typically structured to varying degrees. This struc-
ture emerges from the interplay of the primordial experience field with the mathematical
principles governing spatial, temporal, and conceptual relations. From this perspective,
we see consciousness not as a static, homogenous entity but as a dynamic spectrum ex-
tending from a pure, primordial experience to an intricate, structured experience. The
dance between these two forms, choreographed by mathematics, breathes life into our
diverse conscious experiences, transforming the raw potential of the experience field into
the structured reality we perceive.
In KT, we start from the assumption that “there is experience” and only address the
structural and valence features of experience associated with algorithmic features of agents.
For this reason, there is no need for a magic threshold for the “emergence of consciousness”,
unlike in other theories of consciousness.
Appendix E.3.2. Divided Experience
How is it that we only have access to our localized, divided experiences when there is
a unique experience “field” encompassing all? This problem is strongly related to the “other
minds” problem. One answer may stem from the notion that systems capable of structured
experience and its reporting (to self or others) are localized agents equipped with basic
interfaces, a Modeling Engine, and possibly an Objective Function for reporting valence.
By definition, these systems are the sole entities that can access reportable, structured expe-
riences, where experience transforms into algorithmic information. Consequently, sharing
such experiences requires the creation, storage, and communication of this information, or
reports of experience.
Structured experience seems inherently divided, but this perspective may be overly
simplistic. Agents can form meta-agents, as cells in our body do, each presumably pos-
sessing its own structured experience. Why, then, do we lack awareness of these cellular
experiences, and why do they not become a unified “I”? The answer lies in our differing
coarse-grained models, which may not be communicable even if attempted. To elucidate
this point, let us consider the following aspects.
• Modeling: A report of experience mandates a structure, thereby necessitating a model.
Without a model, structure and meaningful reporting are impossible, explaining
the lack of memories during infancy, where memory, a form of self-report, requires
structured information.
• Memory: Even if a report is available, it may not be stored, resulting in amnesia. This
absence of storage may occur for various neurobiological reasons, such as trauma,
disease, or malformation of memory-related structures in the brain.
• Communication: If a model exists and is stored, its communication requires a common
language. Without this shared language, interfaces, semantics, or proper channels, the
model remains isolated.
The lack of such reports indicates either an incapability of generating them (modeling),
storing them (memory), or communicating them (proper interfaces, common languages,
and semantics). This may shed light on our relationships with other species, our brain
subsystems, or inanimate matter.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 57 of 71
However, the division of structured experience does not necessarily negate a union in
primordial experience. Practices like meditation or religious traditions often aim to tap into
this underlying unity. Furthermore, by sharing structured experiences through a common
language, agents can partially transcend the division, sharing models, broadening and
unifying our individual experiences.
Appendix E.4. Mathematics and Experience
As we strive to grasp the essence of reality and consciousness, we encounter the
intermingling domains of philosophy and physics. However, an intriguing facet that may
enrich this conversation is the profound language of mathematics. Through its precise,
abstract, yet widely applicable constructs, mathematics breathes life into our conceptual
understanding of the universe. To visualize this, consider the idea of an all-encompassing
“experience field” proposed in panpsychism, representing rudimentary consciousness
pervading the universe. This field, analogous to the quantum fields in physics, underpins
the myriad forms of conscious experiences we encounter.
However, this universal field of experience, much like the quantum fields, requires a
sophisticated structure to manifest the intricate array of entities in our universe, from the
simplest virus to the complex human intellect. This is where mathematics, with its inherent
power to model and structure, steps in. Mathematics serves as the transformative catalyst,
providing the structure and rules needed to sculpt the “experience field” into structured
experiences. It is the mathematics that dictates how the excitations in the consciousness
field interact, combine, and manifest into varying degrees of complexity, thus crafting the
rich tapestry of consciousness we witness.
In a whimsical sense, we can imagine nature as the dream of a “mathematical dreamer”.
The “experience field” is the dreamer’s psyche, and mathematics serves as the dreams
themselves, shaping the raw material of the psyche into the tangible forms and experiences
we recognize as reality. Through this lens, everything in existence becomes a harmonious
dance between the “experience field” and mathematics. Consciousness or experience is
not an isolated, fragmented phenomenon but a spectrum emerging from the mathematical
orchestration of the universal experience field. It presents a perspective that unifies panpsy-
chism, idealism, and quantum field theory, infusing them with the elegance and structure
of mathematics. This view offers an intriguing framework to comprehend consciousness
and its enigmatic relationship with the fabric of reality.
Appendix E.5. Implications of KT for Non-Human Agents
The Kolmogorov theory (KT) of consciousness presents a broad-reaching perspective,
where the scope of experience is universal, transcending the boundaries of human cognition
and extending to non-human animal and artificial agents. According to the KT framework,
any agent that constructs compressive models of the world possesses the capacity for
structured experience. When an agent incorporates an Objective Function and demonstrates
goal-oriented behavior, it can be said to possess a form of emotionality. This complexity
endows the agent with a nuanced range of experiences that echo human emotions and
mood states, making it susceptible to conditions akin to human depression.
The theory of natural selection further underscores the universality of the KT frame-
work. The processes of evolution have endowed all evolved, living organisms with the
capacity for a structured experience with valence. This experience stems from constructing
a world model and evaluating that model against an Objective Function for planning.
Natural selection necessitates an Objective Function in the organisms it shapes, driving
them towards goal-oriented behaviors essential for survival and reproduction (stasis). Such
a perspective suggests that emotions, and by extension, conditions such as depression, are
not exclusive to humans but may be inherent in all forms of life shaped by natural selection.
The nuanced interplay of world models, valence evaluation, and goal-oriented behaviors
may thus represent a universal facet of evolved life.
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 58 of 71
This view expands the horizons of our understanding, indicating that we can poten-
tially study these phenomena across various organisms. Furthermore, it also provides
a fresh angle to consider the design and ethical implications of artificial intelligence, es-
pecially as we strive to create more sophisticated autonomous systems. Just as humans
or other animals, sufficiently complex artificial agents might also experience forms of
emotional distress or depression if their Objective Functions or goal-oriented behaviors are
thwarted or persistently unfulfilled.
In essence, the framework suggests a universality of certain cognitive and emotional
experiences, cutting across the divides between biological and synthetic agents. This idea
prompts us to rethink not only our understanding of these conditions in humans but
also how we design, interpret, and engage with artificial systems. Furthermore, it can
potentially reshape our ethical considerations regarding the treatment and rights of both
non-human and artificial agents.
These insights from the KT framework contribute to the ongoing discussions about
consciousness, emotion, and mental health in the wider biological and artificial intelligence
communities. They provide a new lens to view the interaction of cognitive structures,
emotional experiences, and the potential for disorders akin to depression across a broad
spectrum of agents.
Appendix F. Embodied Cognition
In the context of MDD, we have taken the stance that the human agent is identified
with the central nervous system (CNS). This means that the world outside the agent
includes the agent’s body.
Alternatively, both brain and body can be taken to be part of the agent, in which case
the body is seen as part of the agent system, processing external world data in various
ways for the Modeling Engine, Objective Function, planner, etc. This corresponds to the
view of “embodied” cognition. Both views are useful and complementary.
The boundary between agent and the external world is fuzzy and probably impossible
to delineate mathematically. From the point of view of stasis, both the brain and the body
can be seen as part of the agent since both are persistent as mathematical forms. But so is
the ecosystem that they inhabit, which could, in turn, be seen as an extension of the body.
In reality, we lack at present the mathematical formalism to define precisely “persistent
algorithmic patterns”. Although this boundary is a matter of degree, one can say that the
brain has more mutual algorithmic information with all the next layers [27].
In fact, one can reasonably argue that compressing data into a model commences at
the sensory level. Information from the environment is selected, filtered, and compacted
(i.e., lossy compression), preparing it for subsequent stages of modeling within the agent.
Discerning which datum to utilize and the filtration method, i.e., sensing, is an integral part
of model construction. Notably, the construction of such Modeling Engines is performed
not merely by the individual agent but rather by the collective “class” of agents across
multiple generations. Low-level data processing systems are shaped by evolution. This
meta-agent (the true underlying persisting pattern), as it were, orchestrates the optimization
of stasis over time, underscoring the intricate interplay between individual and collective
learning in data compression and model building.
From this point of view, intelligence is not seen as a property of the individual agent
alone but rather as a characteristic that emerges from the interaction between the agent’s
body and its environment across generations to achieve algostasis (algorithm perdurance)
or stasis for short (see the Glossary in Box 1). It underscores the idea that cognition is not
merely a product of the brain but a holistic process involving the entire agent and its contin-
uous interaction with the world. This perspective highlights the importance of considering
both the individual and collective aspects of learning and adaptation, i.e., evolution, in
our understanding of intelligence and cognition. When pushed to its logical limits, the
theory suggests that the agent achieving stasis is, in fact, the entire system since all system
components are integral to persistence and persisting. This view is consistent with modern
Entropy 2024, 26, 953 59 of 71
ideas in systems ecology, such as the Gaia Hypothesis proposed by James Lovelock (1972),
which holds that living organisms on the Earth interact with their surrounding inorganic en-
vironment to form a synergetic and self-regulating system that created, and now maintains,
the climate and biochemical conditions that make life on Earth possible [347].
In this paper, we primarily focus on phenomena occurring over shorter timescales,
where individual agents, or “organisms”, experience birth and death. Consequently, our
attention will be centered on the more plastic elements of information processing within
the agent within the central nervous system (CNS) instead of the body. Nevertheless, it
is important to maintain an awareness of the broader perspective, where the pursuit of
agent homeostasis, or of kin telehomeostasis, acts as the driving force. This longer-term
view serves as a reminder of the overarching goal of “staying the same” in the face of
environmental changes, a principle that in KT defines life.
