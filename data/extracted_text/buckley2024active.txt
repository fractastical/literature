Rationale
The CCIS series is devoted to the publication of proceedings of computer science con-
ferences. Its aim is to efﬁciently disseminate original research results in informatics
in printed and electronic form. While the focus is on publication of peer-reviewed full
papers presenting mature work, inclusion of reviewed short papers reporting on work in
progress is welcome, too. Besides globally relevant meetings with internationally repre-
sentative program committees guaranteeing a strict peer-reviewing and paper selection
process, conferences run by societies or of high regional or national relevance are also
considered for publication.
T opics
The topical scope of CCIS spans the entire spectrum of informatics ranging from foun-
dational topics in the theory of computing to information and communications science
and technology and a broad variety of interdisciplinary application ﬁelds.
Information for V olume Editors and Authors
Publication in CCIS is free of charge. No royalties are paid, however, we offer registered
conference participants temporary free access to the online version of the conference
proceedings on SpringerLink ( http://link.springer.com) by means of an http referrer from
the conference website and/or a number of complimentary printed copies, as speciﬁed
in the ofﬁcial acceptance email of the event.
CCIS proceedings can be published in time for distribution at conferences or as post-
proceedings, and delivered in the form of printed books and/or electronically as USBs
and/or e-content licenses for accessing proceedings at SpringerLink. Furthermore, CCIS
proceedings are included in the CCIS electronic book series hosted in the SpringerLink
digital library at http://link.springer.com/bookseries/7899. Conferences publishing in
CCIS are allowed to use Online Conference Service (OCS) for managing the whole
proceedings lifecycle (from submission and reviewing to preparing for publication) free
of charge.
Publication process
The language of publication is exclusively English. Authors publishing in CCIS have
to sign the Springer CCIS copyright transfer form, however, they are free to use their
material published in CCIS for substantially changed, more elaborate subsequent publi-
cations elsewhere. For the preparation of the camera-ready papers/ﬁles, authors have to
strictly adhere to the Springer CCIS Authors’ Instructions and are strongly encouraged
to use the CCIS LaTeX style ﬁles or templates.
Abstracting/Indexing
CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP , Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical
Reviews, SCImago, Scopus. CCIS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI
Proceedings.

Preface
The 4th International Workshop on Active Inference (IW AI) took place in Ghent, Bel-
gium on September 13–15, 2023. In contrast to the previous editions (2020–2022),
which were held in conjunction with the European Conference on Machine Learning
and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD), this
was the ﬁrst standalone edition. We gathered around 70 active inference researchers
from academia and industry in the beautiful scenery of the Saint Peter’s Abbey, with a
three-day program packed with two tutorials, three keynotes, a poster session, and six
sessions of paper presentations.
This volume presents the 17 full papers that were accepted and presented at the
workshop. Out of 34 submissions, 17 full papers were selected through a double-blind
review process. The papers are clustered in the six sections as presented at the workshop.
These sections cover a wide range of domains that ﬁnd applications of active inference,
ranging from robotics, decision-making and control, psychology, representation learn-
ing, to theoretical advancements of learning and inference as well as active inference
implementations.
The IW AI 2023 organizers would like to thank the Program Committee for their
valuable review work, all authors for their contributions, Noor Sajid and Ajith Anil
Meera for their excellent tutorials, Tetsuya Ogata, Antonella Maselli and Karl Friston
for their inspiring keynotes, and of course all the attendees. We would also like to thank
our sponsors VERSES AI, Ghent University (IDLab), imec and the AI Flanders Research
Program, which made this event possible.
