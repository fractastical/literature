Abstract 
A major debate in the field of consciousness pertains to whether neuronal activity or 
rather the causal structure of neural circuits underlie the generation of conscious experi-
ence. The former position is held by theoretical accounts of consciousness based on the 
predictive processing framework (such as neurorepresentationalism and active inference), 
while the latter is posited by the integrated information theory. This protocol describes an 
experiment, part of a larger adversarial collaboration, that was designed to address this 
question through a combination of behavioral tests in mice, functional imaging, patterned 
optogenetics and electrophysiology. The experiment will directly test if optogenetic inacti-
vation of a portion of the visual cortex not responding to behaviorally relevant stimuli will 
affect the perception of the spatial distribution of these stimuli, even when the neurons 
being inactivated display no or very low spiking activity, so low that it does not induce a 
significant effect on other cortical areas. The results of the experiment will be compared 
against theoretical predictions, and will provide a major contribution towards understand-
ing what the neuronal substrate of consciousness is.
Introduction
In the past couple of decades several theories have emerged to explain how the brain can 
generate consciousness [1], also often defined as what it feels like to experience sensory 
stimuli, memories, etc. [2]. Currently, most data either supporting or challenging theories of 
consciousness comes from a combination of sensory stimulation paradigms, behavioral tasks 
and neural recordings [3]. All this has greatly advanced our understanding of which brain 
areas and patterns of activity correlate with consciousness – and in particular with percep-
tual awareness [4,5]. However, the inability to perturb neural activity in a precise fashion 
in human experiments precludes the possibility to go from the level of correlation between

brain activity and consciousness to that of causation [6]. Techniques such as optogenetics now 
allow unprecedented possibilities to manipulate neuronal activity in animal models [7–9]. 
Nevertheless, even in the case of animal experiments designed to test the neural origins of key 
aspects of consciousness such as conscious access, mostly correlative data has been collected 
so far [10]. One reason underlying this fact pertains to the lack of precise, circuit-level mech-
anistic explanations that most theories of consciousness provide about how the brain would 
be able to generate consciousness. In fact, while optogenetics and similar approaches allow to 
precisely manipulate neuronal circuits, theories often fail to discuss exactly how such manipu-
lations should take place [1].
To address this, we designed a set of experiments capable of testing the mechanistic link 
hypothesized to exist between neuronal activity and consciousness according to three theories 
of consciousness: Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) 
and Active Inference (AI-C). Such a link will be here briefly discussed for each theory, after 
which we will describe the experiment that we will perform to address these theoretical 
predictions.
The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) posits that a fundamental relationship exists 
between the quality and quantity of consciousness, and the causal structure engendered by a sys-
tem’s constituent mechanisms (neural or otherwise) [11,12]. This causal power, intrinsic to the 
system, arises from the interplay between a system’s components. IIT predicts that modifications 
to the causal structure at a relevant spatiotemporal scale, independent of constituent changes 
in activity state, should manifest as changes in perceptual correlates, or alterations in conscious 
experience. Recent elaborations of the IIT framework have yielded predictions concerning 
the physical substrate of spatial experiences [13]. Specifically, IIT predicts that the perception 
of spatial extension corresponds to particular types of causal structures generated by grid-like 
networks, such as those observed in retinotopic cortices. IIT postulates that even inactivating (or 
physically removing) a substantial number of currently inactive neurons within these grid-like 
structures would modify the causal edifice they specify, thereby altering the experience of spatial 
extendedness. Thus, in the context of this proposal, IIT offers a counterintuitive prediction: the 
(externally induced) inactivation of a large population of presently inactive (i.e., silent) neurons 
in retinotopic cortices would lead to a corresponding reduction in perceived space.
Set within the overarching framework of predictive processing (PP) [14–17], NREP posits 
that perception emerges from the construction of inferential representations at both high and 
low levels of brain organization. These representations can be construed as perceptual hypoth-
eses that are continuously refined through interaction with bottom-up sensory inputs. This 
interaction serves to update generative models representing the underlying causes of these 
sensory changes [18,19]. The link to consciousness arises when high-level, multi-area repre-
sentations are generated, encompassing a spatially extensive and multimodally rich portrayal 
of the subject’s current environment, whilst these high-level representations simultaneously 
correspond to low-level neural representations concerned with small-scale, unisensory details 
of percepts [18,19]. To account for the qualitative richness of these high-level representations, 
NREP emphasizes the significance of not only bottom-up and top-down cortical connectivity 
but also lateral (intermodal) connectivity. This perspective leads to the postulate that, next to 
stimulus-induced changes in firing rate, background activity in neuronal networks is neces-
sary for the generation of consciousness, even within brain regions and neuronal groups not 
directly involved in processing specific object features [18–20]. For instance, background 
activity in non-visual sensory cortical systems is important for visual perception. This back-
ground activity extends to brain areas mediating modality- and sensory-specific identification 
of the perceived feature, encompassing not only other sensory cortices but also higher associa-
tive areas (e.g., parietal cortex) and potentially even motor cortex [21].

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
Finally, AI-C, a theory also grounded in predictive processing, emphasizes the role of infer-
ence of action policies aimed at minimizing expected, rather than current, prediction error  
[22–27]. In simpler terms, active inference involves covert or overt sampling of sensory infor-
mation to reduce uncertainty regarding the source of sensations. Overt sampling in the visual 
domain primarily manifests through eye movements or other physical movements. Covert active 
inference, on the other hand, refers to the act of attending to (or ignoring) specific features of an 
object or its location. This framework encompasses attentional capture, such as the involuntary 
shift of spatial attention towards a salient stimulus. Notably, AI-C refrains from making specific 
hypotheses regarding neuronal activity beyond those encompassed by the broader predictive 
processing framework [15]. However, AI-C diverges from NREP by focusing on action and 
action policies as being necessary for consciousness (whereas NREP does not), whereby expected 
prediction errors are minimized through action policy inference. In contrast, NREP emphasizes 
minimizing current prediction errors via inference on present sensory inputs.
The experiment described here will test the different predictions that IIT, NREP and AI-C 
make with respect to the role in the generation of consciousness played by background neural 
activity (NREP , AI-C) or lack thereof (IIT), meant as the spontaneous level of activity dis-
played by neurons not directly activated by the sensory features that constitute the object of 
perception. Consciousness will be operationalized by studying the experience of visuospatial 
extendedness. Briefly, IIT postulates that not only active, but also inactive (i.e., silent) neurons 
contribute to conscious experience [11,13]; specifically, neurons in retinotopic areas would 
contribute to visual perception not only when displaying visually evoked responses, but also 
when not firing action potentials at all. Therefore, inactivating both active as well as inac-
tive neurons (i.e., making them non-activatable; e.g., by cooling, reversible lesions, or other 
methods such as optogenetics and optochemistry) should disrupt the cause-effect structure 
of a neural system, and consequently modify the quality of consciousness. In particular, the 
inactivation of a large number of inactive neurons in retinotopic cortex (ideally all inactive 
neurons located in primary visual cortex V1 and higher order visual areas; HV As) [28] during 
the ~200 ms time window following stimulus onset that is required for the neural processes 
underlying the perception of a visual object to emerge [29–31] (but before any report of such 
perception is made [5,32]), is expected to induce a collapse in experienced visual space – 
similar to hemineglect or hemianopia. In contrast to IIT, NREP and AI-C postulate that only 
active neurons contribute to conscious experience. Inactive neurons do not contribute to 
perception because they exert no effect (i.e., cause no activity changes) on the rest of the sys-
tem, and thus inactivating an already inactive neuron should not affect perception. The belief 
updating in PP is mediated by active neurons. However, a differential prediction is made in 
this respect by the two forms of PP under scrutiny here. NREP assumes that, in addition to 
stimulus-responsive neurons, background activity in the network of brain areas mediating 
visual perception [21] is necessary for conscious experience, as long as spontaneous levels of 
activity are strong enough to exert causal influences on connected neurons [18,19]. Thus, only 
inactivating those neurons that are truly inactive (i.e., do not send spikes to other neurons), or 
whose spiking activity is so weak that it does not significantly modulate the activity of other 
neurons (i.e., virtually inactive), will not have an effect on perception [18,19]; inactivating a 
sufficient amount of neurons firing at baseline level should instead disrupt perception if this 
baseline activity affects other areas. In AI-C, instead, neurons with a low background level of 
activity may or may not contribute to conscious experience; they might be detrimental to it, 
by decreasing confidence in a precise sensory input [22] or paradoxically improve discrimina-
tion (by evincing a form of representational sharpening). Thus, AI-C predicts that inactivating 
background activity in the visual system would lead to a change in perception (in terms of 
psychometrics), but is non-specific about how perception would change [22,23,33].

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
Current study
The differential predictions of the three theories are here worked out in the setting of spatial 
experience, quantified by studying distance estimations at the psychophysical level in mice, 
that we will then attempt to modify via specific optogenetic distortions of the neuronally con-
structed map of visual space.
Briefly, head-fixed mice will be trained to report whether the spatial center of mass of a 
pair of visual patches falls in the left or right hemifield of view (Fig 1A) by licking towards a 
reward spout either on the left or right side; correct actions will be rewarded by a drop of milk 
or juice. This task requires mice to estimate the relative (and not just the absolute) position of 
the presented visual stimuli, and has been designed to specifically test the theories’ different 
predictions about the neuronal mechanisms enabling visuospatial perception. Patterned opto-
genetics via inhibitory opsins will then be used to hyperpolarize (and thus inactivate) neurons 
in portions of V1 (left hemisphere only) not displaying sensory-evoked responses during the 
first 200 ms after stimulus onset (before any widespread motion and report-related activity is 
observed in V1 [31]) – Fig 1B-D. The main experimental readout will be a change in behav-
ioral response (reflecting a functional hemineglect) upon the inactivation of already inactive 
(or sensory unresponsive) V1 neurons in one cortical hemisphere showing a background 
level of activity (i.e., no direct sensory-evoked responses). IIT predicts that, even if portions 
of the visual cortex responsible for processing visual stimuli were active and fully functional, 
inactivation of the inactive parts of V1 (i.e., all portions of the visual cortex not involved in 
stimulus processing) would prevent spatial experience. This means that mice would not be 
able to assign a spatial location, and consequently assess the relative position, of visual patches 
presented in the hemifield of view contralateral to the optogenetically inactivated hemisphere. 
This would correspond to a functional hemineglect: visual information presented in the 
“neglected” hemifield will no longer be usable to solve the center-of-mass task, although a 
residual form of perception about the presence of visual stimuli may remain (but this cannot 
be tested in the current protocol). For NREP , such functional hemineglect would only occur 
when inactivating neurons with a sufficient level of background activity, while the optogenetic 
inactivation of inactive or virtually inactive neurons should not induce a behavioral change. 
Finally, AI-C predicts no functional hemineglect, but rather changes in behavioral responses, 
such as faster reaction times and/ or either enhanced or worsened psychometrics as measured 
by threshold, slope, etc.
The proposed experiment is based on the premise that spontaneous, not sensory-evoked 
activity in visual cortex can be modulated or titrated to different levels, that are required to 
test the different predictions of the three theories under scrutiny. Specifically, we have defined 
the following three activity levels:
-Minimally active (MA): This is to be understood as the lowest level of activity that can 
be observed in visual cortex. This will be quantified as the average number of action poten-
tials observed in the ~200 ms time window after stimulus onset during which perception is 
expected to take place according to the three theories (and before the emergence of wide-
spread report-related activity in V1 and HV As [31]) in neurons not directly activated by visual 
stimuli, and as the proportion of neurons – out of all neurons not directly activated by visual 
stimuli – not firing any action potential during any given trial in the same temporal window. 
More precisely, the MA level will be defined as a condition during which spontaneous neuro-
nal activity is statistically indistinguishable from zero firing rate.
-Virtually inactive (VI): the highest level of spontaneous firing activity that does not result 
in a significant change in the activity of downstream regions (i.e., cortical areas monosynap-
tically targeted by V1. The VI level would ultimately correspond to a condition in which neu-
rons not activated by sensory stimuli are not silent, but still their activity is so low that it does

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
Fig 1 . Experimental outline. A. Two Gabor patches will be simultaneously displayed in the left and right monocular fields of view. Mice will have to determine 
whether the center of mass between the two Gabor patches falls in either the left or right hemifield of view and lick towards the corresponding reward spout to 
receive a reward. In this figure it is assumed that both recordings and optogenetic manipulations will be performed in the left cortical hemisphere. Hence, the left 
visual field will be the ipsilateral one, while the right visual field will be contralateral. Gabor patches will never be displayed in the binocular field of view (red- 
textured area). Note that the stimulus presentation time is shorter than the onset of saccades in mice, therefore we do not expect the borders between monocular 
and binocular cortex to change significantly during stimulus presentation. B. Patterned illumination will be used to achieve the optogenetic inactivation of the 
portion of V1 that does not respond to the visual stimulus (blue areas outside the circles), as demonstrated through imaging experiments. White circles correspond 
to the cortical locations showing stimulus-evoked responses in both V1 and HV As. The region of V1 being illuminated will comprise a ring of ~250 μm of tolerance, 
in order to account for dendritic arborizations of neurons in the non-inactivated portions of V1, and prevent the risk of reducing any input such regions might 
receive from surrounding regions in VI and NB conditions [60]. We will not inactivate HV As in view of the high spatial resolution that would be required to selec-
tively target non-responsive patches of each individual HV A.Areas P , LI, LM and AL are HV As that are considered to be part of the mouse ventral stream. Areas RL, 
A, AM and PM are HV As that are considered to be part of the mouse dorsal stream [61]. For all areas indicated in the panel, standard acronyms are used [54,61]. 
C. Schematic representation of the expected time course of neuronal activity during hit (solid lines) and miss (dashed lines) trials for neurons responding to the

Timeline of the behavioral task. After a variable inter-trial interval, sensory stimuli will be displayed for 200 ms. In a fraction of trials, inactive portions of V1 will be 
optogenetically inactivated. Mice will be rewarded in case of a correct response, if licking is recorded during the response window, lasting from 100 ms to 1000 ms 
after stimulus onset.

not drive, at the population level, other monosynaptically connected regions. This level will be 
determined via measuring the variation in the activity of areas downstream to V1 following 
optogenetic inactivation of V1. Values of spontaneous V1 activity for which no statistically 
significant change in downstream activity can be observed after optogenetic V1 inactivation 
will therefore be classified as VI.
-Normal background (NB): This corresponds to a level of spontaneous activity that is pres-
ent in neurons not directly activated by visual stimuli (in the already mentioned ~200 ms win-
dow after stimulus onset), and that is higher than the threshold for the VI condition. Values of 
spontaneous V1 activity for which a statistically significant change in downstream activity can 
be observed will be classified as NB.
These three different conditions will be achieved by modifying the visual background 
shown to mice (e.g., black, gray or white noise background), and by monitoring spontaneous 
fluctuations in baseline activity, for instance as a consequence of arousal, as measured in 
terms of pupil size [34,35]. Based on these aspects, we aim to subdivide experimental epochs 
into one of the three activity levels. The subdivision was carried out a priori relative to the 
displayed visual background, and a posteriori with respect to the arousal level. Fig 2 shows the 
results of pilot experiments meant to verify the feasibility of achieving all three different levels.
By performing optogenetic inactivation of portions of V1 not displaying sensory-evoked 
responses in mice performing the center-of-mass task, and by comparing the results obtained 
across the three levels of spontaneous activity, we expect to be able to provide sufficient 
evidence in support of one out of the three theories under scrutiny. Details about the specific 
prediction of the three theories for each activity level can be found in the section “Operational 
Hypotheses” .
Timeline, status and pilot experiments
The experiment described here is part of a larger adversarial collaboration in which IIT, NREP 
and AI-C will be compared via a series of experiments. Following a successful set of pilot 
experiments that demonstrated the possibility of obtaining all three planned levels of sponta-
neous activity (Fig 2), a consortium led by one of the authors (CMAP , University of Amster-
dam) was awarded a grant funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF 
number: 0646; https://doi.org/10.54224/20646). The peer-reviewed grant application was 
pre-registered on OSF (https://osf.io/35rhx) and later updated to reflect the results obtained in 
a further set of pilot and preliminary experiments (https://osf.io/4rn85). For each of the exper-
iments composing the larger adversarial collaboration, a protocol paper is to be published, 
based on the latest version of the pre-registration and on the most recent results from prepa-
ratory experiments. The experiments described here thus faithfully reflect the pre-registered 
project. Experiments are to be performed in parallel at two sites: the lab of Umberto Olcese at 
the University of Amsterdam (herein referred to as experimental lead) and the lab of Rafael 
Yuste at Columbia University (herein referred to as replication lead). All details about the 
replication efforts are described in the following sections. Currently, following an extensive set 
of preliminary experiments, data collection is at an early stage.
Materials and methods
Participants
Experiments will be done in mice (C57BL/6J background) expressing the GCaMP6 calcium 
indicator in a subset of cortical neurons. In the experimental lab, we will use the Rasgrf2-dCre 
x Ai148D line, in which GCaMP6f is expressed mainly in layer 2–3 cortical neurons following 
exposure to the antibiotic doxycycline (Jax #030328; Jax #022864) [36]. These experiments

have already been approved by the Dutch Commission for Animal Experiments and by the 
Animal Welfare Body of the University of Amsterdam, under license AVD11100202215932. 
Experiments conducted in the replication lab will use the mouse line Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre x 
Ai162 (Jax #023527; Jax # 031562), which constitutively expresses GCaMP6s in excitatory 
neurons. All the animal procedures at the replication lab were approved by the Columbia 
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), in compliance with the 
relevant National Institutes of Health guidelines, under protocol AC-AABN3562. Mice will 
be 6–8 weeks of age at the beginning of handling and training procedures. Training will take 
place over a period of max 12 months. Both male and female mice may be used. Mice will be 
group housed and kept on a reverse day-night schedule; in case this is not possible, all exper-
imental procedures will be done in the dark period or as close as possible to it. Mice will have 
ad libitum access to food, even though a water restriction regime will be implemented to moti-
vate animals for the behavioral task. Mice will receive at least 25 ml/kg/day of liquid, and will 
be monitored so that, on every given week, their weight does not decrease below 90% of the 
weight measured during the previous week. All experiments have been designed in a way that 
minimizes animal suffering. First of all, data collection will stop as soon as a sufficient amount 
of data will be collected (see the next section). Second, we will take all possible measures to 
alleviate animal suffering, as long as these are compatible with experimental objectives. First 
of all, analgesia and anesthesia will be employed when necessary (see the section on “Surgical 
procedures”). Second, animals will be group housed and cage enrichment will be provided. 
Finally, we will make sure that any consequence of water restriction will be limited (see earlier 
in this section for details).
Sample size and exclusion criteria
Based on the level of background activity in the patches of visual cortices (primary visual 
cortex V1) not directly activated by visual stimuli, we will subdivide experimental sessions 
in 3 distinct types: minimally active (MA), virtually inactive (VI) and normal background 
activity (NB). In order to compute sample size, we have estimated that mice will achieve a 
performance corresponding to 70% correct responses, and that these should drop below 
30% to establish that optogenetic inactivation was effective in significantly changing behav-
ioral responses. This is a level in line with the highest false alarm rate typically observed, 
which would correspond to the expected response rate in case of hemineglect. For hit rates, 
we estimate a standard deviation of 20% across sessions. This corresponds to a large effect 
size (which we conservatively set to 0.8). Whether a sufficient sample size is reached will be 
estimated in the course of the experiments via a Bayesian sequential stopping rule [37,38]. 
gray background, to which they became habituated. Total number of identified single neurons following spike sorting with Kilosort 2.0 [56]: 137 neurons in V1 
and 95 neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Mice expressed the inhibitory opsin iC++ [62] in pyramidal neurons in ACC. This was achieved via viral 
injection of an AAV vector mediating the expression of iC++ under the CaMKII promoter. A. The activity of V1 units was quantified as a function of which visual 
background was presented (black screen, grey screen or static white noise pattern – grey-valued bins – shown for periods of several minutes). Recordings were sub-
divided into non-overlapping windows of 200 ms, during which we computed the average firing rates of detected neurons (left), and the fraction of neurons not dis-
playing any action potential during each 200 ms window (right). We found that, only when displaying a grey visual background activity in V1 was not significantly 
higher than 0 for both metrics. Asterisks indicate values significantly different from either 0 (firing rates) or 1 (fraction of inactive neurons) (p < 0.05, one-sided 
t-test). B. The effect of optogenetic inactivation of V1 (over 200 ms windows) was compared for both V1 and ACC as a function of visual background. Optogenetic 
inactivation of V1 was effective in reducing V1 activity across all visual backgrounds. However, a signification reduction was observed in ACC, a downstream area 
to V1, only when displaying a static white noise. Asterisks indicate significant differences between baseline firing rates and epochs with optogenetic illumination 
(p < 0.05, paired t-test); note that a smaller dataset was used in panel B compared to panel A. Taken together, these results indicate that the use of a grey background 
induces a level of spontaneous activity in V1 compatible with the MA level, i.e., statistically indistinguishable from 0; the use of a black background instead elicits 
some spontaneous activity, but at a level that is not high enough to make a difference to downstream areas – and thus in line with the definition of the VI level. 
Finally, the use of a random pattern as a visual background further increases spontaneous V1 activity to a level compatible with the NB level.

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
Setting the Bayes factor BF10 to larger than 3 (moderate evidence), we estimate that we will 
have to collect data from 11 experimental sessions (median value) for each of the three session 
types with different levels of background activity (MA, VI and NB) in order to have sufficient 
data to assess the hypothesis that inactivating inactive neurons impairs spatial experience 
(H1). Analogously, the stopping criterion for the null hypothesis (H0: no effect of inactivat-
ing inactive neurons) has been set to BF10 < ⅓; this corresponds to a median sample size of 12 
sessions. Experiments will stop when, a value BF10 > 3 or BF10 < ⅓ is obtained, separately for 
each of the three levels of background activity (MA, VI and NB). Alternatively, experiments 
will terminate after the collection of 21 experimental sessions, for each of the three levels of 
background activity, which corresponds to a chance greater than 75% of obtaining BF10 > 3 or 
BF10 < ⅓. Moreover, we include an additional condition holding that the experimental sessions 
need to be acquired in at least 4 distinct mice, to prevent excessive statistical dependencies 
between sessions. Importantly, this is a minimum number of mice that we plan to use in 
recording sessions, and we aim to perform experiments in more than 4 mice (at least 6), both 
in the experimental as well as in the replication lab. Nevertheless, more mice are expected to 
successfully undergo all experimental procedures (training, surgeries, etc.) before reaching the 
final experimental stage.
No analysis meant to assess experimental outcomes will be conducted on the data prior 
to completing all data collection, except for those analyses aimed at: a) ensuring animals do 
not meet the exclusion criteria (see below), b) verifying that collected data (electrophysiology, 
imaging) is of sufficient quality, c) verifying that opsin expression and optogenetic inactiva-
tion have been successful, and d) enabling experiments to be correctly performed. We will 
stop collecting the data upon reaching the stopping criterion or, alternatively, the predefined 
maximum sample size, when taking into account experiments not meeting any of the exclu-
sion criteria.
Exclusion criteria. 
A mouse will be excluded if:
• It fails to learn the center of mass task (see the later section “Behavioral procedure”) suffi-
ciently well (hit rate <  60% – i.e., proportion of licks to the correct side, left or right – for 
stimuli with center of mass falling in all tested locations) or it shows an excessive false alarm 
rate ( > 20–30%, defined as the proportion of probe trials without visual stimuli during 
which mice lick towards one of the two reward spouts);
• Post-mortem histological analyses show that opsin expression was not covering the full 
monocular portion of V1.
An experimental session will be excluded if:
• Widefield calcium imaging is of insufficient quality to allow optogenetic targeting;
• Task performance during trials without optogenetic inactivation is of insufficient quality (hit rate 
<  60% for stimuli with center of mass falling in the tested locations, or false alarm rate >  30%);
• Electrophysiological recordings (if performed) and arousal monitoring indicate that opto-
genetic inactivation was not able to reduce spiking activity in the illuminated regions below 
the threshold identified as maximum activity for MA neurons, or that a specific level of 
background activity (MA, VI or NB) could not be achieved.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) transparent window (Fig 3A) [39], which will enable to per-
form both neuronal imaging as well as optogenetics. About 3 weeks before the planned start 
of experimental sessions (i.e., when training will be completed), we will inject a combination 
of viral strains mediating the pan-neuronal expression of the red-shifted inhibitory (chloride- 
dependent) opsin Jaws (ssAAV-8/2-hSyn1-Jaws_KGC_tdTomato_ER2-WPRE-bGHp(A) [40] 
– Fig 3B-C; see also later sections for alternative strategies). Injections will target V1. Based 
on previous experiments, an injection volume of about 0.5 μl should be sufficient to cover all 
required cortical surfaces. At the end of the experiment, small openings will be made in the 
PDMS window to enable electrophysiological recordings [41]. All surgical procedures will be 
done under isoflurane anesthesia (induction at 3%, maintenance at 1.5%–2%). The analgesic 
agent Carprofen (5 mg/kg) will be provided on the day of the surgery and for two subsequent 
days.
Visual stimuli
Visual stimuli will consist of Gabor patches (about 10 ± 2 deg diameter, displaying static 
gratings at 0.04 cycles per degree, 100% contrast). Two patches will be shown, one in the 
contralateral and one in the ipsilateral field of view (Fig 1A). Stimuli will only be shown in the 
portions of the monocular visual fields covered by the screen ( > 25 deg and <  109 deg from 
the midline (Fig 1A and Fig 5B). The precise locations of the visual stimuli will be discussed in 
the next sections. For the purposes of considering whether the center of mass of the presented 
stimuli falls in the contralateral or ipsilateral half of the hemifield – something that is import-
ant when considering the predictions of the various theories – the midline of the partial field 
of view encompassing the binocular and one monocular field (i.e., the portion of the visual

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
field being accessible by one cortical hemisphere via direct thalamocortical projections) will 
be considered (approximately 57.5 deg from the midline, Fig 1A – see also Fig 5B for further 
details about the actual locations of Gabor patches. The elevation of the Gabor patches will not 
be behaviorally relevant and will be kept at the level of the animals’ eyes. In a subset of control 
trials, we will only display one Gabor patch, to measure baseline localization accuracy.
Background stimuli. The visual background on which the Gabor patches are shown will 
be varied in a way that allows to titrate the baseline activity of neurons in V1 according to one 
of the three levels: MA, VI and NB. Based on the results obtained in pilot experiments, we will 
use a grey background for the MA condition, a black background for the VI condition, and 
a static white noise background for the NB condition (Fig 2). Based on electrophysiological 
recordings performed during actual experiments, we may however have to change the use 
of visual backgrounds to reach a particular level of background activity, if for example we 
observe that the association between visual background and the level of spontaneous baseline 
activity varies between animals or recording sessions.
Behavioral procedure
Animals will be trained to discriminate whether the center of mass of the displayed Gabor 
patches lies in the left or right hemifield of view (left or right of the midline). Details about 
the training procedure have been devised in the course of pilot experiments. Animals will 
respond by performing licks towards either a left or right lick spout. Correct responses will be 
rewarded by a drop of milk. Licks will be monitored starting from 100 ms after stimulus onset, 
to account for physiological reaction times (lick latencies). Stimuli will be shown for 200 ms, 
based on the shortest temporal presentation window that pilot mice needed to perform the 
center of mass task. Based on recent studies, this window is expected to last from stimulus 
onset until at most the estimated onset of report-related activity in V1 [31]. Rewards will be 
delivered immediately after a correct lick is detected. Inter-trial intervals will be randomly 
taken from an exponential distribution with a mean of six seconds (minimum 3 and maxi-
mum 10 to 20 seconds; the exact values will be chosen on a per-mouse basis to maximize the 
number of trials performed in every experimental session). Inter-trial intervals will not differ 
based on trial outcome (correct, incorrect response or miss). In a subset of probe trials, we will 
not show any stimulus (to enable the assessment of the false alarm rate).
Training procedure and location of visual stimuli. Mice will first be habituated to 
experimenters and training setups. A drop of milk will be initially awarded from lick spouts 
at any moment when mice lick in front of the grey screen. Once mice learn the association 
between lick spout and reward, we will unilaterally present a Gabor patch (size: ~30 deg, 
spatial frequency: 0.04 Hz) on the right side of screen (location: 90 deg vergence angle) for ~4 
seconds in each trial. Mice will have to lick during stimulus presentation to receive a reward. 
We will continue this step until the hit rate becomes higher than 70% in one session. We will 
compute the hit rate based on the first lick after the stimulus onset after the100 ms grace 
period. Then, we will start showing a smaller Gabor patch (size: ~25 deg) unilaterally either 
on the left or right side of the screens until the hit rate exceeds 70% in one session. Once 
mice can reliably maintain this hit rate (approximately 3–4 sessions), we will start displaying 
a smaller Gabor patch (size: ~15 deg) randomly in one of six different unilateral locations 
(approximately −106, −70, −34, 34, 70, and 106 deg vergence angles). These locations were 
chosen as representative of three locations spanning the full monocular field of view (to make 
sure mice pay attention to the full field of view and do not develop a behavioral strategy based 
on focusing on a single spot on the screen): the outermost part and innermost part of the 
screen, as well as the in-between middle point (Fig 5B). In order to prevent the innermost 
Gabor patches from falling into the binocular field of view, they will be placed at the middle

point between the edge of the monocular zone and contra/ipsilateral half-hemifield. A 
depiction of the chosen locations is presented in Fig 5B. We aim to obtain >70% hit rate 
overall but minimum >60% hit rate in each condition to ensure comparable performance 
among different locations.
Following the unilateral configurations, the center of mass task will be introduced, starting 
from easy bilateral configurations. One Gabor patch (expected size: ~10 ± 2 deg) will be pre-
sented in the monocular visual field (location: approximately −106 or 106 deg vergence angle) 
and the other (expected size: ~10 ± 2 deg) in the binocular visual field (Location: approxi-
mately −8 or 8 deg vergence angle). Each session will consist in principle of approximately 
64% of trials with the center of mass configurations (32% on each side) and 36% of trials with 
the unilateral configurations (6% each on the six different locations); different proportions 
of trials may be chosen based on the performance of individual mice. We aim to obtain >70% 
hit rate overall, but minimum >60% hit rate in each condition. Once mice learn these easy 
binocular configurations, more difficult binocular configurations will be introduced, such as 
the combination between −106 and 25 deg or −25 and 106 deg. In the end, the final configura-
tions (left center of mass: approximately −106 and 34 deg; right center of mass: approximately 
−34 and 106 deg) will be introduced. Upon >70% hit rate for the binocular configurations 
as well as > 60% hit rate in each condition, the stimulus presentation time will be reduced 
from 2.5 s to 200 ms. Pilot experiments have been performed to verify that mice can learn to 
perform the center of mass task. Mice were able to report with > 60% accuracy the location 
(left vs. right) of Gabor patches, both when a single patch was presented in one of the planned 
locations along the horizontal axis, as well as in a simple center of mass configuration (one 
peripheral and one central location).
Data collection procedures
Retinotopic mapping and widefield imaging. In order to locate the visual cortical 
areas that are active/inactive during the task, we will initially perform retinotopic mapping 
to determine the boundaries of V1, followed by test presentations of the task stimulus to 
pinpoint areas within the global visual cortical map that are activated by the Gabor patches 
that will be used in the final experiment (Fig 5). Briefly, we will show a flickering black and 
white checkerboard stimulus drifting in different directions (for parameter details, see [42]) 
on a screen (width =  36 cm, height =  21 cm), placed at the distance of 11 cm from the eye 
to the closest point of the screen in the right visual field. Concurrently, cortical responses to 
violet (405 nm, used to monitor hemodynamic responses) and blue (470 nm, used to elicit 
GCaMP6 fluorescence) LED stimulation will be recorded using a custom made widefield 
microscope at sampling frequency of 30 Hz with twofold pixel binning [43]. The mapping 
procedure will be performed after training and prior to the experimental period. The borders 
of V1 will be identified by computing the sign map derived from the altitude and azimuth 
maps indicating retinotopic responsiveness in the visual cortex [42]. V1 will be identified 
based on the reversal in the sign map that occurs at the border between V1 and HV As [42].
Presentation of the task relevant stimuli will be performed with the exact same parameters 
as the experimental sessions (size, locations, background activity) and recorded similarly. The 
obtained maps and active areas will be registered to the vascular landmarks of the cortical 
surface to correct for differences in mouse position between experimental sessions.
Multi-area ensemble recordings. Multi-area ensemble recordings will be done by 
performing small openings in the PDMS window over the area of interest, via which multi-
channel silicon probes (Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes [44,45]) will be inserted. Detailed 
methods can be found in [31,41,46,47]. Briefly, the PDMS window covering the cortex will 
be punctured over the cortical areas of interest, after which one of more laminar probes will

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
be inserted. After the experimental session has been completed, the probe will be retracted 
and the craniotomy closed with a silicon-based sealant. Multiple recordings will be acquired 
in the same mouse across subsequent days. A maximum of three recording probes will be 
simultaneously used. Data will be recorded with a 30 kHz sampling frequency.
Two-photon calcium imaging . Within the control experiments performed at the 
replication lab, two-photon calcium imaging will be used instead of multi-area ensemble 
recordings to monitor neuronal activity. Importantly, two-photon calcium imaging 
allows to identify both active and inactive neurons, and is thus complementary to 
electrophysiology (that only enables researchers to detect spiking neurons). Two photon 
imaging and either holographic 2-photon stimulation or LED single-photon stimulation 
will be performed. The optical system consists on a customized two photon laser 
scanning imaging microscope equipped with a spatial light modulator (SLM) to perform 
simultaneous population photostimulation as described before [ 9,48,49]. For imaging the 
GCaMP6f sensors, a Ti:sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser tuned at 940nm will be used. The 
scanned laser at the sample will produce a 300 x 300 μm FOV using a 25x objective. For 
holographic photostimulation, a low repetition (200 kHz ~  1 MHz) pulse-amplified laser, 
working at 1040 nm will be used. The beam will be expanded by two telescopes (1:1.75, f =   
100 mm and f =  175 mm; 1:4, f =  50 mm and f =  200 mm) to fill the active area of the SLM 
(HSP512-1064, Meadowlark Optics). The typical imaging power will be less than 50 mW , 
and typical average power used for each illuminated spot will be 2–5 mW . Simultaneous 
imaging and photostimulation will be controlled by Prairie View software and a custom-
made MATLAB application. For single photon stimulation experiments an optic fiber 
equipped with a cannula will be roughly positioned over the cortex at shallow an angle to 
avoid touching the objective. The fiber will be coupled to a 617 nm LED and typically a 2–5 
mW power will be used.
Behavioural monitoring. Licking actions will be monitored via piezoelectric detectors, 
connected to a custom-made electronic board (Arduino-based). An infrared camera will 
be used to monitor pupil size and orofacial movements throughout experimental sessions 
[31,50]. All timestamps will be synchronized.
Optogenetic inactivation
Patterned illumination and optogenetic inactivation of the portion of V1 – in the left hemi-
sphere only – not directly activated by visual stimuli will be achieved through the integration 
of a digital micromirror (DMD), scanned laser projector (Sony MP-CL1A laser projector) into 
the widefield imaging system used above for retinotopic mapping.
Following retinotopic mapping, we will compute a set of configurations for the DMD for 
each of the visual stimuli that we will show in a given experimental session. We will project 
light only on selected portions of V1 – see Fig 1. The portions of V1 to be inactivated will 
determine a mask (black in the areas not to be perturbed and red elsewhere in line with Jaws’ 
excitation spectrum [40] (Fig 4B-C), that will be sent to the DMD projector and displayed on 
the cortex. The scanned image will be conjugated to the backfocal plane of the objective lens 
through a 4f double lens relay system (Fig 4A). To determine the mapping between the pro-
jected image and the imaged widefield field of view (FOV), an affine transformation matrix 
will first be calculated based on linear regression with a set of defined locations projected to 
the FOV . This transformation will be applied to any image provided to the projector. Opto-
genetic inactivation will be performed during the presentation of visual stimuli, i.e., from 
stimulus onset to ~200 ms afterwards. The efficacy of optogenetic inactivation will be tested in 
control experiments, in which laminar probe recordings and optogenetics will be simultane-
ously done. This will allow to verify the experimental parameters (e.g., laser power) necessary

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
to effectively inactivate neurons across both the surface and depth of V1. An average power 
calibration will be taken by measuring radiant flux at the sample of a homogeneous full-screen 
projection with varying red pixel values. Independent tests will be performed to estimate the 
range of laser power required for significant photo activation of the opsin and adjusted as 
necessary for each experimental mouse (Fig 2C).
Based on the preliminary experiments that we have performed, it appears that Jaws- 
mediated inhibition is effective in significantly reducing neuronal activity. However, if this 
proves to be insufficiently strong or if Jaws expression is not widespread enough, we will 
employ, as a back-up plan, stGtACR2, a blue-sensitive anion-conducting channelrhodopsin

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
[51] that we have successfully employed in previous experiments. In this case, retinotopic 
mapping and the identification of the portions of V1 responsive to the Gabor patches will be 
done before the injection of the viral vector mediating the expression of stGtACR2, to prevent 
that the opsin-mediated inactivation will mask calcium signals (in view of the similar absorp-
tion spectrum of stGtACR2 and GCaMP6).
Control experiments
Control experiment 1: Optogenetic controls. In a subset of recording sessions we will 
perform experiments while illuminating a non-visual area (e.g., primary somatosensory 
cortex) in which no opsin expression is expected. All experimental conditions will be 
replicated to control for any confounding effect of photo-illumination. Analogously, in 
a subset of recording sessions (n >= 3) we will perform experiments while completely 
inactivating V1 – rather just the non-visually-responsive portion of V1. This will be important 
to verify the necessary role of V1 for performing the center of mass task.
Control experiment 2: Optogenetic controls. Additional control experiments will be 
done to examine the possible role of the superior colliculus in the center of mass task. In this 
set of experiments, an injection of fluorescent muscimol will be done targeting the superior 
colliculus (max 200 nl), and a behavioral session will then be acquired. Animals will be 
sacrificed immediately afterwards for histological inspection. A negative result would indicate 
that the center of mass task is most likely solved by cortical areas. Conversely, if this control 
experiment reveals a functional role for the superior colliculus in solving the center of mass 
task (as indicated by a change in the psychometric response curves), we will revise the task in 
a way that limits the role of this subcortical structure. For instance, this can be achieved by 
replacing Gabor patches with more complex types of images whose processing is known to 
require cortical areas [52].
Sequence of experimental activities
Following the completion of training, we will run experiments during a period of time when 
opsin expression should be optimal (between 3 and 8 weeks after viral injections). We plan to 
collect multiple sessions from each animal, so that at least one good session per activity level 
can be collected from each animal. As some exclusion criteria can only be assessed a posteri-
ori, we will collect as many sessions as feasible from each animal. Furthermore, in this phase 
we will also test that mice can correctly respond to Gabor patches presented anywhere in the 
visual field. This will be done by presenting single Gabor patches; in this configuration, the 
center of mass corresponds to the individually presented patch.
At the start of the recording period in each mouse, we will perform a retinotopic mapping 
that will be used to calibrate patterned photo-illumination. This procedure will be repeated at 
least once – typically at the end of the recording period (but before the start of electrophysi-
ological recordings, that may damage the PDMS cranial window) to verify the stability of the 
retinotopic mapping.
Following retinotopic mapping, each subsequent behavioral session will be done with a 
single visual background, and will be assigned a priori to the corresponding activity level. 
The order in which backgrounds are used will be counterbalanced across mice. Pupil-size 
monitoring and the results obtained during both pilot experiments and recording sessions 
involving electrophysiological recordings will be used to group individual trials into the three 
different levels of background activity (MA, VI and NB conditions). In particular, we expect 
that trials will be mainly grouped based on which visual background is shown and on the level 
of arousal, as quantified by pupil diameter.

PLOS ONE
The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
During each session, Gabor patches will be pseudo-randomly presented in a way yielding 
an equal number of trials with the center of mass of the two simultaneously-presented patches 
falling in one of 4 experimentally relevant locations (Fig 5A). These will always be displayed 
in the same position on the y axis (at eye level), and on a set of predetermined locations along 
the x axis (Fig 5B). These locations have been selected as they represent the stimulus configu-
rations for which the predictions of the theories diverge the most (cf. Fig 6), can be discrimi-
nated by animals, and are balanced in terms of where Gabor patches are shown and especially 
of the side to which the animals must respond. A fraction of the trials (randomly selected) will 
include optogenetic inactivation of the retinotopic locations not directly activated by visual 
stimuli (see Fig 1). In the absence of optogenetic inactivation, only correct responses will be 
rewarded. Instead, in order to prevent biasing mice towards a response strategy, all responses 
(i.e., both left and right licks) will be rewarded in trials with optogenetic inactivation. For this 
reason, only a fraction of trials can be coupled to optogenetic inactivation (max 1/3 of all tri-
als), to prevent animals from incorporating this new rule into their repertoire. Finally, we will 
include a set of unilateral control conditions, in which we will only display one Gabor patch, 
as well as probe trials (Fig 5A). These conditions are required to verify the effect of optoge-
netic inactivation during the presentation of visual stimuli and not only during the center of 
mass task, and therefore determine to which extent optogenetic manipulations specifically 
affect performance during the center-of-mass task.
After at least two successful behavioral sessions per activity level have been completed, three 
control sessions involving either multi-area ensemble recordings (experimental lab) or two- photon 
calcium imaging (replication lab) will be done. These post-sessions will be performed to verify that, 
in each animal, the assumptions underlying the three different activity levels are satisfied.
Multi-area ensemble recordings – post-sessions. 
1) In a first recording session (post-session #1), probes will be located in V1 and in cortical 
areas receiving direct monosynaptic projections from V1 such as HV As, the premotor 
region ALM [53] – an area that receives strong projections from dorsomedial HV As [54] 
– and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We will then perform a behavioral session 
without optogenetics, while varying both stimulus location as well as visual background. 
This recording session will allow us to verify that, in each animal, the different types of 
visual background elicit a level of baseline activity compatible with MA, VI and NB levels, 
as well as how baseline activity varies in each mouse as a function of arousal. Importantly, 
different levels of background and sensory-evoked activity will be elicited in each recording 
session in the same recording locations: the three levels of spontaneous activity (MA, VI 
and NB), in the presence or absence of stimuli impinging on the receptive field of recorded 
neurons. For this reason, we will not determine the presence of inactive neurons only 
based on the absence of spikes, but also on the changes in activity across conditions. This 
will exclude that we may characterize a state as being MA not because neurons are not 
spiking, but because we are not recording activity (e.g., because of a probe malfunction).
2) In a second session (post-session #2), we will place one silicon probe in V1 and verify that 
targeted photoillumination (via a colocalized optic fiber) is effective in reducing base-
line activity levels for neurons not directly activated by visual stimuli in MA, VI and NB 
conditions. To achieve this, we will show only background visual stimuli while performing 
recordings and optogenetic inactivation.
3) In a third recording session, a probe will target a downstream cortical area receiving direct 
monosynaptic projections from V1 such as ACC, and we will perform optogenetic inac-
tivation of V1 as a function of background activity level (MA, VI and NB). Also, in this 
session we will only display background stimuli. This last session (post-session #3) will be

 necessary to maintain a proper balance between stimuli rewarded with left vs. right licks – to prevent the insurgence of a response bias to either side. Two bilateral

done to verify that inactivation of neurons firing at MA and VI baseline levels does not 
modulate downstream activity.
Two-photon calcium imaging – post sessions. In the replication lab, the three sessions 
planned to be done after behavioral acquisition will be done using instead two-photon 
imaging. This will allow to exploit and combine the features of both electrophysiological 
recordings and calcium imaging (single-spike resolution in electrophysiology vs. ability to 
identify non-spiking neurons with two-photon calcium imaging). Post-session #1 will be 
done via performing two-photon imaging in V1 during a regular behavioral session; this will 
allow us to study the spatial architecture of V1 responses around the areas retinotopically 
corresponding to the presented Gabor patches. Specifically, imaging will be performed 
through the PDMS window on visual cortices while the animals are shown visual stimuli 
with different background levels, to confirm that each level elicits the expected background 
activity – when also taking into account neurons not spiking or with a very low firing rate, 
that cannot be detected with electrophysiological recordings. For post session #2, V1 neurons 
determined to be not responsive to the Gabor patches will be inactivated via two-photon 
targeted optogenetics [9]. In detail, imaging will be performed in visual cortices while the 
mouse is shown the same Gabor patches used in the experimental conditions. Recorded 
data will be immediately analyzed to determine whether single neurons are tuned to the 
presented visual stimuli. Non-tuned cells will be selected in random sets of up to 80 cells 
and selectively inactivated during a subsequent presentation of the Gabor patches. This will 
allow us to determine the effect inhibition of non-tuned cells on the tuned cells. Finally, post 
session #3 will involve widefield optogenetic inactivation of V1 and two-photon imaging of a 
downstream cortical area (e.g., ACC). Thus, we will opto-inhibit visual areas at the different 
levels of background activity to confirm that inactivation of spontaneous activity at the MA 
and VI levels does not affect downstream activity. Furthermore, this form of replication will 
ensure that the results that will be obtained will not depend on the acquisition modality being 
used (electrophysiology vs. two-photon calcium imaging).
Histology
At the end of experiments, mice will be anesthetized with pentobarbital and sacrificed by transcar-
dial perfusion (4% PFA in PBS). Brains will be sliced and imaging will be done to verify expression 
patterns of the opsins, probe location, and – if applicable – extent of muscimol diffusion.
Planned analyses
The main outcome parameter of this experiment will be the analysis of behavioral perfor-
mance as a function of position of the displayed Gabor patches and presence/absence of 
false alarm rates and any effect of optogenetic illumination on it. Finally, unilateral configurations will be used to test if optogenetic inactivation induces any bias 
in response side, in the absence of a stimulus being presented in the inactivated hemifield of view. Fractions and number of trials for each category are only an esti-
mate that will depend on animals’ performance and on the actual number of trials in each experimental session. B. Diagram indicating the positions of the Gabor 
patches that will be used in the actual experimental sessions. Compared to the outline shown in Fig 1, we will have to adjust the locations where the Gabor patches 
are shown based on the actual coverage of the visual field by the screen where visual stimuli are displayed within the experimental setup. Specifically, while the 
visual field extends up to 140 deg beyond the midline, the screens only reach 110 deg. This introduces a possible confounding factor. Specifically, the line splitting 
each hemifield of view in half (dashed line) does not overlap with the line splitting the portion of the screen visible within each hemifield of view in two (dotted 
line). Under the assumption that optogenetic inactivation will induce a hemineglect-like deficit, we cannot predict if mice will respond based on the position of the 
still-perceived Gabor patch with respect to either the dashed or dotted line, i.e., based on the position of the Gabor on the screen or on the field of view. For this rea-
son, to avoid possible confounding factors, we will avoid displaying Gabor patches in the portion of the visual field (shaded in blue) between these two lines, where 
no prediction can be made about the behavioral responses of mice.

optogenetic inactivation. Specifically, the proportion of left vs. right licks, as well as misses, 
will be computed as a function of the horizontal position in the field of view of the center 
of mass of the presented Gabor patches. A d’ index will also be computed, based on a signal 
detection framework for multi-alternative behavioral tasks [55]. For trials with optogenetic 
inactivation, the same analysis will be done also considering the center of mass of stimuli 
presented in the ipsilateral field of view.
Widefield imaging data will be initially processed to extract the relevant neuronal 
activity [43]. Briefly, raw calcium responses will be motion corrected and denoised, and 
relative changes in fluorescence (dF/F) will be calculated with respect to the baseline 
period 2s before the presentation of visual stimuli. This dF/F will finally be corrected for 
overlapping hemodynamic signals by a linear regression procedure. Corrected responses 
to the mapping stimulus will be then used to generate azimuth and altitude position maps 
[42] and combined to generate a visual sign map that allows for the determination of V1 
boundaries. Corrected responses to task stimuli will be used to determine the smallest task 
responsive area. The boundary between responsive/non-responsive areas is not expected to 
show a sharp transition ( Fig 4B), so a thresholding procedure will be used to define it. The 
registered maps will be used to define the areas to be illuminated by the calibrated DMD 
projector in the inactivation experiment ( Fig 4C-D). As discussed earlier, for the purpose 
of inactivation experiments, responsive areas will be extended with a closed border region 
with a width of about 250 μm to avoid inactivating the dendritic arborizations of stimulus-  
responsive neurons.
Analysis of multi-area ensemble recordings will focus on spiking activity. After spike 
sorting, the collected data using the Kilosort package [56], we will compute peri-stimulus time 
histograms (PSTHs) of single neurons as a function of stimulus location, to identify which 
neurons are directly activated by the presented Gabor patches (as described earlier [46]), and 
as a function of optogenetic onset, to investigate the effect of photo-stimulation.
of view (with respect to the inactivated hemisphere), as well as on the position of the CM for the patches shown in 
the ipsilateral hemifield (i.e., based on whether this falls in the contralateral or ipsilateral half-hemifield - see also 
Fig 1A). Overall, four different configurations of stimuli will be tested (four panels in the figure). The same graphic 
conventions are used as in Figs 1 and 5. The area in the right hemifield with a striped background indicates the region 
of the visual field corresponding to the optogenetically manipulated portion of V1. Note that the regions where Gabor 
patches are shown correspond to portions of V1 that will not be optogenetically inactivated (see also Fig 1B). In this 
figure we assume that the left hemisphere is the inactivated one (hence: right is contralateral and left is ipsilateral). 
The “Control” label below each table indicates the expected behavior in the absence of optogenetic inactivation. MA: 
minimally active; VI: virtually inactive; NB: normal background; CM: center of mass; orange triangle: location of the 
CM for all shown patches; green: location of the phenomenologically experienced CM if optogenetic inactivation 
leads to functional hemineglect of the contralateral hemifield of view. The consequence of functional hemineglect 
(as predicted by either IIT or PP-NREP) is that mice will not experience visual space in the hemifield contralateral to 
the optogenetically inactivated hemisphere. Thus, the residual hemifield will be split into two half-hemifields, which 
will subjectively be experienced as the left and right hemifields. Therefore, in the presence of functional hemineglect, 
mice are expected to respond not based on the physical location of the center of mass but based on whether the 
ipsilaterally-presented Gabor patch (overlapping with the phenomenogically experienced CM) falls in either the left 
or right half-hemifield. Basically, IIT and NREP predict that, under some circumstances (different between IIT and 
NREP) that the total experienced space will shrink relative to the absolute space of the external visual field, and that 
mice will only respond based on the perceived location of the ipsilateral Gabor patch. Note that not all configurations 
are equally informative. For example, the predictions of IIT and PP-NREP for configuration 4 are similar and do not 
generally predict a major effect of optogenetic inactivation. In contrast, all theories have very different predictions 
on configuration 3. Therefore, only the most informative configurations will be used in the final experiments (cf. Fig 
5A). Finally, while predictions are different for configuration 2, this configuration entails showing Gabor patches very 
close to the midline. We expect this configuration to be difficult for animals, hence we will not include it in the final 
experiment (cf. Fig 5A).

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
Two-photon imaging data will be processed with a custom pipeline based on the CaImAn 
python library [57]. Briefly, raw data will be motion corrected and neuronal sources will be 
extracted, demixed and deconvolved using constrained non-negative matrix factorization 
(CNMF) and the OASIS deconvolution algorithm. Deconvolved activity will then be used 
to estimate neuronal firing rates by extracting the discrete first derivative, smoothed with a 
Gaussian kernel of 100–200 ms. Trial-averaged responses to visual or optogenetic stimuli will 
then be analyzed by calculating, on a cell-by-cell basis, the mean and standard deviation of the 
baseline activity during the 500 ms pre-stimulus window across conditions, and these parame-
ters will be used to z-score the firing rates to compare activity across cells. Cell responsiveness 
will then be assessed to be present if evoked mean activity will be higher than a threshold of 
1.67 standard deviations over baseline (equivalent to one tailed p-value of 0.05).
Replication plan
Experiments will be simultaneously performed in two laboratories (Olcese lab, University 
of Amsterdam; Yuste lab, Columbia University). Experimental procedures have been jointly 
developed and implemented. Electrophysiological control recordings to verify that different 
visual backgrounds induce separate levels of background activity will only be performed in 
the Olcese lab. In the Yuste lab, the three sessions planned to be done after behavioral acqui-
sition will be instead performed using two-photon imaging. Thus control sessions will reach 
the same objectives in the two labs, but will leverage the different properties of large-scale 
electrophysiology and imaging approaches [58]. This form of replication will allow us to test 
whether the results that will be obtained will not depend on the acquisition modality being 
used (electrophysiology vs. two-photon calcium imaging). Once data collection is completed, 
datasets will be separately analyzed, and results will only be compared at the end of the anal-
ysis procedure. Research personnel affiliated with the theory leads responsible for each of the 
three theories will also contribute to data analysis. A replication committee and personnel 
affiliated with the laboratories of the theory leads will verify that all data collection and analyt-
ical procedures have been correctly implemented and applied.
Operational hypotheses and expected outcomes
The main outcome of the experiment will be reflected by measuring the effect of behavioral 
performance during the center of mass task following optogenetic inactivation of neurons not 
displaying sensory-evoked activity (cf. Fig 1B). Predictions will differ based on a) the positions 
of the Gabor patches with respect to the midline of the (hemi)fields of view (see also Fig 5) 
and b) the level of spontaneous activity (MA, VI and NB) displayed by neurons being inacti-
vated. The relationship between the possible locations in which Gabor stimuli are presented, 
the level of spontaneous activity, and the predictions of the three theories under scrutiny as 
regards the potential effects of optogenetic inactivation of background activity are summa-
rized in Fig 6
Specifically, Fig 6 discusses the outcomes expected by the different theories for all possible 
configurations of Gabor patches (when presenting one Gabor patch per hemifield of view). 
These configurations can all be produced with a fixed number of Gabor locations (Fig 5B). 
However, not all configurations lead to different predictions by the three theories, hence we 
only selected a subset in our experimental paradigm (Fig 5A).
Furthermore, in order to comprehend the different experimental outcomes predicted by 
IIT, NREP and AI-C, we point out that these theories have different predictions concern-
ing the impact of optogenetic inactivation on perception. For both IIT and NREP , inacti-
vating a certain fraction of V1 will lead to the disappearance of the portion of visual space 
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318863 February 27 , 2025 22 / 28
PLOS ONE
The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
retinotopically represented by the inactivated fraction of V1 (provided, in the case of NREP , 
that the inactivated neurons were sufficiently active before being inactivated) [11,13,18]. This 
would behaviorally correspond to a neglect of the corresponding portion of visual space. For 
AI-C, on the other hand, inactivating a fraction of V1 will not make the corresponding por-
tion of visual space disappear from perception [33]. Instead, the confidence in the perceived 
visual information will vary, and consequently features of behavioral performance such as 
reaction time will be affected.
Importantly, the expected effect of optogenetic inactivation is not a complete change 
in behavioral strategy, but rather a shift in the psychometric response curve. For instance, 
in the condition depicted in configuration 3 of Fig 6, in the absence of optogenetic inacti -
vation mice would show (for example) 70% licks towards the right spout (hits), 20% licks 
towards the left spout (errors) and 10% misses. Following optogenetic inactivation, under 
the assumption of a contralateral neglect (as predicted, e.g., by IIT), mice would shift 
to (for instance) 50% licks towards the left spout, 35% licks towards the right spout and 
15% misses. Statistical comparisons will be done to assess whether a significant change in 
behavioral strategy has occurred. Specifically, we will compare (using either parametric or 
non-parametric tests (to be determined based on the distributions of the collected data) the 
d’ , left-lick rate and right-lick rate in each of the relevant spatial configurations of visual 
stimuli (see Fig 5A).
Finally, each of the three theories not only makes a prediction about the effect of optoge-
netic inactivation of background activity on behavioral performance for the center-of-mass 
task, but also associates such prediction with a given level of confidence. For example, the 
prediction of IIT about the consequence of inactivating inactive neurons is a core prediction 
of the theory, and hence this is also a high-confidence prediction. Conversely, AI-C makes 
no specific, hard assumption about the role of background activity in perceptual experience. 
Consequently, the predictions of AI-C have a low confidence. Details are presented in Table 1 
as regards experimental configuration 3 (Fig 6), which is the configuration with the highest 
power in discriminating between the three theories and the one on which we will focus our 
experiments (Fig 5A). Confidence will be used when determining to what extent experimental 
results either support or challenge each theory.
Discussion
The study presented in this protocol aims to test incompatible predictions made by three 
theories of consciousness (IIT, NREP and AI-C) about the role of spontaneous cortical activity 
in the generation of conscious experience. Specifically, we expect that the results will provide 
evidence supporting only one of the theories, thus challenging the other two. The experiment 
has been designed in close association between experimentalists and theoreticians, and the 
latter have openly committed to accepting the outcome of the experiment. Nevertheless, some 
possible confounding factors and limitations need to be taken into account.
First, we might not be able to reliably modulate spontaneous cortical activity such that all 
three different levels (MI, VI and NB) will be obtained. This might limit the extent to which 
the experiment will be able to provide evidence only supporting a theory but not the others. 
For example, IIT and NREP have different predictions for the MA and VI levels, but not for 
the NB level.
Second, the behavioral effect of optogenetic inactivation of the inactive portions of V1 
might be less clear than expected, as a consequence of, for example, an incomplete inacti-
vation of the area being illuminated. Control experiments have been planned to assess the 
effectiveness of optogenetics, but the possibility of obtaining null results cannot be completely 
discounted. Conversely, even an effective optogenetically induced hyperpolarization might

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
also lead to confounding effects, as a consequence of the loss of lateral excitation to the por-
tions of V1 still processing the visual stimuli (at least in the NB condition). We will control for 
this possibility through the unilateral stimulus configurations, for which we expect no effect of 
background inactivation on detection performance.
Finally, based on preliminary experiments, we considered it unfeasible to reliably identify 
and inactivate the inactive portions of both V1 and all HV As at the same time. The latter, in 
fact, are much smaller than V1 and show coarser receptive fields that are not always clearly 
identifiable – in contrast to V1. It is thus possible that inactivating only the inactive portions 
of V1 might still allow HV As, under IIT’s framework, to create a spatial experience for the 
portions of the visual field whose V1 representation is being inactivated. In fact, HV As would 
still receive inputs from the non-inactivated and sensory-responsive portions of V1. Mice 
could therefore still experience the portion of the visual field contralateral to the inactivated 
hemisphere, albeit possibly at a coarser spatial scale [13]. To limit this potential issue, we will 
present mice with the smallest possible Gabor patches they can reliably perceive, i.e., at a spa-
tial scale for which V1 is likely necessary, but HV As are likely not.
The above mentioned factors indicate the importance of carefully assessing any null results 
we might obtain. These should not be taken as evidence either supporting or challenging a 
theory in the absence of additional (positive) evidence. Specifically, to address this issue, as 
well to provide an experimental framework capable of fully comparing key predictions of all 
three theories, this experimental protocol forms, together with three other protocols being 
separately published, a single unitary adversarial collaboration. The results of all experiments 
forming the collaboration will need to be jointly evaluated in order to be able to draw conclu-
sions about the validity of the predictions of the three theories under scrutiny.

The role of spontaneous activity in visuospatial perception
The adversarial collaboration setting for this study
This study protocol forms part of a consortium project engaged in adversarial collaboration 
among three theories of consciousness: IIT, NREP and AI-C (https://doi.org/10.54224/20646). 
The results for the predictions described above, as well as the results from the other experi-
ments in this adversarial collaboration, will be subject to discussion and comparative inter-
pretation by the consortium, taking into account the overall set of predictions registered in 
protocols and at the website of the Open Science Foundation (OSF). Furthermore, we plan an 
integrative analysis according to the scheme set out in [59].
Dissemination Plans
The outcomes of this experiment will likely be published as a stand-alone article in the first 
instance, or might be published as one paper combined with the outcome of the other exper-
iments involved in the adversarial collaboration. Each of these experiments and their compo-
nents may or may not be presented through posters and talks at conferences.
Following the completion and publication of the experiments described in each of the 
protocols published by the respective theory groups, an integrative analysis along the lines of 
ref. [59] may follow.
Finally, the INTREPID consortium will deliver at least one public talk or symposium to 
present and discuss the outcomes of the entire adversarial collaboration.
Data management and sharing plan
All experimental protocols, metadata and data will be made available upon the completion of 
the project and publication of the related manuscripts via the EBRAINS open-access reposi-
tory (https://ebrains.eu/). We will adhere to FAIR data principles and, whenever possible, we 
will use standard data formats such as Neuroscience Without Borders (NWB).
All code (Python, R and Matlab scripts) will be shared via GitLab or GitHub repositories.
Dealing with Amendments
In the present experiment (as in the other protocols that form part of the INTREPID con-
sortium), amendments will be considered and agreed upon between the experimental and rep-
lication teams, and the three theory leads (Karl Friston, Cyriel Pennartz, and Giulio Tononi). 
Upon the agreement of any reasonable amendments to the protocol, the amendment will 
be timestamped and added to the existing OSF preregistration documentation (https://osf.
io/35rhx).
