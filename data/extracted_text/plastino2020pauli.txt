Abstract 
We study the dependence of the of microstates number (for free fermions - 
bosons) as a function of the volume -size in quantum statistics and fermions, 
and show then that fermions can not be accommod ated in arbitrarily small 
volumes V. A minimum minVV=  for that purpose is determined. Fermions 
can not exist for minVV< . This fact might have something to do with infl a-
tion. More precisely, in order to accommodate N fermions in a Slater dete r-
minant, we need a minimum radius, which is a consequence of the Pauli 
principle. This does not happen for bosons. As a consequence, extrapolating 
this statistical feature to a cosmological setting, we are able to “ predict” a 
temperature-value for the final -stage of the inflationary period. This value 
agrees with current estimates.

1. Introduction 
Cosmic inflation is a widely accepted phenomenon. The detailed particle physics 
mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. The basic inflationary par a-
digm is accepted by most physicists, as a number of inflation model predictions 
have been confirmed by observation. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10
−36 
seconds after the conjectured Big Bang singularity till about 10 −32 seconds after 
the singularity [1]  [2] [3]. Here we will develop a statistical micro -canonical ar-
gument that seems to indicate that the Pauli principle might perhaps have played

some kind of role in the inflation process. Our protagonist is the number of mi-
cro-states (multiplicity) Ω for N particles of energy E enclosed in a volume V. 
We will see that, i n the case of fermions, V can not be arbitrarily small. This o b-
servation motivates a hopefully attractive interpretation of cosmic inflation. 
2. Multiplicities Ω 
2.1. Classical 
The multiplicity ( ),,EV NΩ  of an N-particle, mono -atomic, ideal gas with 
energy E and volume V is the product of the number of cells of volume 3sδ  
available in position space (that equals 3Vs δ ) and the number of cells avail a-
ble in momentum space [4]. The volume of momentum space through which the 
system may move is the p -volume ( )

shell of radius 2R mE= . As a consequence, the number of permissible m o-

2.2. Fermions 
It has been known since at least 1925 that quantum mechanics includes, among 
its tenets, the following tree conditions: 1 ) phase space cells have a size dete r-
mined by Planck ’s constant 
h, 2) the energy, momenta, and other dynamical 
properties of an isolate d system are quantized, and 3 ) for the purpose of dete r-
mining multiplicity, identical particles are, indistinguishable from one another. 
Thus, (3) gives the multiplicity 
Ω of an ideal gas composed of N distinguisha-
ble particles that occupy volume V and share an energy E. 
If ( ),,EV NΩ  is the multiplicity of an ideal gas composed of N distinguisha-
ble particles with total energy E and placed in a volume V, it follows that 
( ), ,1ENVΩ  should be the multiplicity of just a single particle of ideal gas, 
characterized by E/N and, and occupying volume V. This particle composes a 
larger system of N distinguishable particles. A single particle of an ideal gas o c-
cupies ( ), ,1ENVΩ  equally probable microstates. Accordingly,

A crucial insight is here gotten:  the number of cells that can be occupied by a 
single particle of ideal gas must be independent of whether that particle is itself

gas system and if indistinguishable whether fermion or boson . A system of N

Focus attention now upon an ideal Fermi gas. Let us call n the number of cells 
that can be occupied by a single fer mion E/N. We have 1nN ≥ . According to 
(3) we have

We face the problem of filling n cells with Nn≤  identical fermions. Thus

This multiplicity derived above is the result of the so -called average energy 
approximation. According to thi s approximation, each gas particle possesses the 
same energy E/N for all fermions in the system. That the average energy ap-
proximation produces the exact multiplicity when identical particles are cons i-
dered distinguishable. The average energy approximation has been extensively 
used and produces quite reasonable results [4]. 
We approximate the Gamma function using the Stirling recipe

and we ask for a possible vanishing of ( )ln Ω . This is the critical novel issue that 
we address in this paper. 
Since 1N   we are led to answer with the relation

that has two possible solutions, namely, 
0, 1.ss= =                         (15) 
Figure 1  shows that the multiplicity Ω would be negative for 01 s≤≤ , 
which is absurd. We gather that the system is subjected to a kind of “phase tra n-
sition” at 0s =  and forced to “jump” to 1s = . One could putatively associate 
this jump to a sort of inflation- phenomenon motivated by the Pauli principle 
that would forbid  N fermions to be accommodated in a too small volume V. A 
critical “accommodating” volume is reached at 1s = . Emphasize that this ha p-
pens for free fermions micro-canonically described. Equilibrium prevails. 
The paper could well finish here. However, it is too tempting to extrapolate a 
bit further. We do this below, after discussing Bosons. 
2.3. Bosons 
The multiplicity is, for n microstates and N bosons [4],

den size-increase at the origin, which one might be willing to associate to inflation, that in turn would be motivated by the Pauli 
principle.

The counting performed above is structurally identical to counting the nu m-
ber of distinct manners of ordering a set of N identical balls and 1n −  identical 
white dividers. If placed in a row, these 1n −  dividers separate our N balls into 
n ordered (distinct) groups [4]. 
Thus, things are quite different for bosons, not subjected to the exclusion 
principle. The above Ω, for N bosons of mass m contained in V with total 
energy E will yield [4]

A tiny fraction of a second after the singularity, some fermions began to 
emerge, out of a quark -gluon plasma [5] , N of them, at a tiny region of size V, 
whose total fermion -energy was E (this variables determine a microcanonical 
ensemble). This region had to “ explode” in order to accommodate them (transi-
tion from 0s =  to 1s =  above). 
If we accept Siegel’s estimate for the Universe’s radius at the end of the infl a-
tion period of 0 17 cmrr= =  [5], then, from Eq uation (11), one gathers that 
one has for N, when 1s = ,

If we set 2E mcN =  (lower bound for E), with 271.6 10 kgm −= ×  the baryon  
mass, then the fermion number becomes 481.15 10N = ×  at the critical volume 
referred to above, a very small number compared to today’s estimate of 1079. Of 
course, radiation, neutrinos and plasma predominate at this stage [5]. 
2.5. Temperature at the End of the Inflationary Period 
The entropy at the end of the inflationary period ( 1s = ) reads 
11 ln ,BssSk = == Ω                       (22) 
with Bk  the Boltzmann constant. For the temperature T we have

Using the appropriate values for Bk , h, etc., we obtain 183.9 10T = ×  Kelvin 
degrees, which agrees with the value estimated in reference [6] . Note that in our 
case we are advancing a statistical prediction. 
3. Conclusion 
We have here introduced a simple, micro -canonical statistical argumentation 
purporting to show that, on account of Pauli’s principle, N fermions can not be 
accommodated in an arbitrarily small volume V, as bosons can. We statistically 
determined a minimum critical volume -value for N fermions. One is then 
tempted to extrapolate the above findings to a cosmological se tting and predict a 
numerical value for the temperature prevailing at the end of the inflationary p e-
