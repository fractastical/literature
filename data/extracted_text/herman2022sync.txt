PERCEPTION
In sync with the heart
People actively adjust how they acquire sensory information, such as 
tactile cues, based on how their bodily functions alter their senses.

it back and relax. Close your eyes. Can you 
feel your heart beating in your chest? What 
you are experiencing is your heart working 
in a cyclic manner. During the systolic phase, the 
heart contracts, ejecting blood into the vessels 
that lead out of it, and increasing the activity of 
pressure sensors called baroreceptors. During 
the diastolic phase, the heart expands, allowing 
blood to flow into it, while the baroreceptors 
remain quiescent.
Even though the whole cycle usually takes just 
under a second, a lot is happening during that 
time. With every heartbeat, the brain receives 
input about the strength and precise timing of 
each cardiac contraction – information that needs 
to be promptly processed and acted upon if 
necessary. In recent years, a lot of studies have 
focused on the internal state of our body and 
the way we process its subtle signals; and in how 
physiological fluctuations in our bodies (such as 
the cardiac cycle) can impact our cognition and 
behaviour.
Certain behaviours have been shown to occur 
in sync with internal bodily oscillations (Kunzen-
dorf et al., 2019; Ohl et al., 2016). For example, 
when we look for something, we fixate our eyes 
more (i.e., sample new information) during dias-
tole, and move our eyes more (to search new 
areas) during systole (Galvez- Pol et  al., 2020). 
Moreover, the sensitivity of touch also varies 
between the two phases: people are less percep-
tive to touch during systole than during diastole 
(Al et  al., 2020; Motyka et  al., 2019). So far, 
it was unclear what behavioural benefits such 
synchronicity brings (Herman and Tsakiris, 2021). 
Now, in eLife, Alejandro Galvez- Pol, Pavandeep 
Virdee, Javier Villacampa and James Kilner of 
University College London and the University of 
the Balearic Islands report new insights on this 
matter (Galvez- Pol et al., 2022).
In a cleverly designed experiment, Galvez- Pol 
et al. used electrocardiography to record 
the cardiac activity of participants while they 
performed a simple tactile discrimination task. 
Without looking, the participants had to figure 
out whether the objects they touched had vertical 
or horizontal grooves. They found that touches 
initiated during systole were held for longer than 
touches initiated during diastole (Figure 1). This 
was particularly pronounced when it was diffi-
cult to discriminate the objects, indicating that 
people use prolonged touch to compensate for 
the reduced sensitivity during systole.
Moreover, Galvez- Pol et al. found that the 
timing of touch also affected the duration of a 
cardiac cycle. When touch was initiated during 
systole, it increased the proportion of the cycle 
in diastole, which had previously been associated 
with the greatest tactile sensitivity. Thus, people 
adapt their behaviour in line with their perceptual 
needs; but their internal bodily cycles also adjust 
according to external demands to ensure a stable 
perception of the world around us.
Our bodies work in a rhythmic fashion – a 
fact that we typically pay little attention to in our 
daily lives. However, these internal rhythms have 
a much greater influence on our cognition than 
previously thought and can modulate how we 
perceive the environment around us. But there is

still a lot to discover. Bodily signals may impact 
our perception in a relatively simple tactile 
discrimination task, but do they also affect more 
complex cognitive processes, such as decision- 
making? And are individuals, who are more 
attuned to subtle changes in their physiology, 
better able to adjust their behaviours to over -
come cardiac- related effects? Answering these 
questions will allow us to better understand the 
complex interplay between the brain and the rest 
of the body and, ultimately, better understand 
ourselves.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the interplay between cardiac cycles and perception. The heart beats in 
a cyclic manner. It contracts to actively push blood around the body (systolic phase, red, top centre) and relaxes 
to refill again (diastolic phase, blue, bottom centre). Using a tactile discrimination task, Galvez- Pol et al. show that 
the sensitivity of touch decreases during systole: therefore, to compensate, people hold their fingers longer over 
an object (red clock), especially when the task was more difficult. Conversely, people will hold their fingers on an 
object for a shorter time if they start touching it during diastole (blue clock).
