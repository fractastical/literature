Abstract
Background: Interoception, the multifaceted perception of internal bodily signals, is crucial
for homeostasis, emotional regulation, and overall well-being. Physical exercise signif-
icantly influences interoceptive mechanisms through its varied physiological, neurobio-
logical, and psychological impacts. Despite its potential to enhance this internal sensing
across its dimensions and foster adaptive behaviors like self-regulation, exercise remains
an underutilized therapeutic approach. Objective: This narrative review explores the
current understanding of the interplay between exercise and interoception, examining its
resulting impact on both mental and physical health. Method: A comprehensive literature
search was conducted on PubMed using keywords such as “interoception,” “exercise,”
and “well-being.” Article selection prioritized empirical studies, reviews, and influential
theoretical papers. The synthesis of the literature was performed through a thematic analy-
sis, structured around three primary mechanisms: physiological changes, neurobiological
adaptations, and psychological benefits. Key Findings: Engaging in exercise improves
interoceptive function by inducing physiological changes, fostering neurobiological adapta-
tions, and yielding psychological advantages such as reduced stress. This enhancement in
internal bodily sensing, encompassing its various dimensions, and promotion of adaptive
behaviors has notable consequences for well-being. Conclusions and Future Directions: Ex-
ercise presents a valuable and readily available means to enhance interoceptive processing
and encourage adaptive behaviors, with substantial positive implications for well-being
throughout life. Future studies should focus on identifying the most effective exercise
approaches tailored to individual requirements and exploring their specific impact on
different interoceptive dimensions. Integrating exercise into clinical treatment plans and
public health strategies offers a promising path to substantially boost well-being.

1. Introduction
Human well-being is a multifaceted construct, profoundly influenced by both external
circumstances and internal states. In today’s fast-paced and increasingly complex world,
marked by rising rates of chronic stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges (e.g., as
widely observed during global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic [1–3]), the search for
sustainable well-being strategies has become paramount. There is a growing recognition
that solely addressing external factors is insufficient; true resilience and health are rooted in
our capacity for self-awareness and the perception of our internal physiological landscape.
This internal journey of self-discovery and regulation, which we refer to as the “inner road,”
is the focus of this article’s exploration into how it can be positively impacted.

At the core of this concept liesinteroception, defined as the perception of internal bodily
signals, such as heart rate, respiration, and gut sensations. Beyond merely physiological
monitoring, interoceptive processes are increasingly recognized as fundamental for crucial
processes like homeostasis [4], emotional regulation, and the broader experience of well-
being [5]. Contemporary models, such as those proposed by Garfinkel and colleagues [6],
offer a nuanced understanding of interoception by outlining various dimensions (e.g., inte-
roceptive accuracy, awareness, or sensibility). Interoceptive accuracy refers to the precision
with which an individual detects and discriminates internal physiological signals (e.g.,
heartbeats). This dimension is often objectively measured using tasks that involve counting
one’s own heartbeats or perceiving one’s breathing patterns. Interoceptive awareness pertains
to the metacognitive ability to recognize, interpret, and reflect upon one’s own internal
bodily sensations. It involves the subjective perception and conscious knowledge of these
signals. Interoceptive sensibility denotes an individual’s general tendency or propensity to
pay attention to and notice their internal bodily sensations, regardless of their objective
accuracy. It is often assessed via self-report questionnaires (see [7]). Maintaining a clear
distinction among these dimensions is crucial for fully understanding how different facets
of interoception contribute to well-being and how they can be influenced by interventions
such as physical exercise. Where appropriate throughout this review, we will specify the
particular dimension of interoception being referred to.
Departing from the traditional view of interoception as mere sensory input, the frame-
work of Active Inference [8,9] highlights its dynamic role in shaping our interactions with
the world. By integrating interoceptive signals with exteroceptive (vision, touch, hearing,
taste, and olfaction) and proprioceptive information within a hierarchical brain architecture,
we construct a rich and nuanced representation of our internal and external states [10]. This
process is underpinned by predictive coding [ 11], where the brain constantly generates
and updates predictions about its internal and external states. Consequently, interoceptive
signals play a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions, emotions, and decision-making
processes. In essence, our internal bodily states are not merely passive recipients of sensory
information, but active participants in shaping our conscious experience. This perspective
is increasingly utilized to model subjective well-being and resilience, suggesting that main-
taining well-being involves minimizing prediction errors about one’s internal state and
actively engaging with the world to reduce interoceptive uncertainty, thus fostering stable
and desirable internal physiological states [12–14].
This active interplay between the various dimensions of interoception and other
sensory modalities has profound implications for our overall well-being. A deeper under-
standing of these interoceptive processes reveals that they play a key role in shaping not
only our immediate perceptions but also our broader mental and emotional states. For
example, the ability to accurately perceive and be aware of our internal bodily states can
significantly influence mental health outcomes, decision-making, and stress management.
However, this process can be disrupted. Individuals with anxiety disorders, for example,
often experience heightened interoceptive sensibility to bodily sensations that may be
perceived as threatening [15]. Dysregulations can also arise from noisy or poorly differ-
entiated interoceptive signals, which makes it difficult to distinguish bodily and affective
states. This altered interoception might be implicated in the development of maladaptive
coping strategies for managing uncertain bodily states, such as restrictive eating [ 16] or
self-injury [17]. These self-directed actions, while seemingly maladaptive, can be viewed
as attempts to achieve a more coherent sense of self within the context of an uncertain
internal milieu. This perspective underscores the pivotal role of interoception not only
in shaping our experience of the world but also in driving our behaviors, both adaptive
and maladaptive.
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 3 of 15
Despite extensive research on the link between altered interoceptive processes and
maladaptive behaviors, the idea of fostering these processes to promote positive well-being
has received comparatively less attention. Exploring this aspect is crucial, as it under-
scores the potential for individuals to cultivate a positive relationship with their bodies
by consciously engaging with and utilizing bodily sensations. More refined interoceptive
processing—such as a greater attunement to internal bodily signals—can serve as a protec-
tive factor against negative mental health outcomes by improving emotional regulation [18],
social functioning [19], and emotional connectivity [ 20]. The systematic review by [ 21]
further highlights that greater interoceptive awareness is associated with better vagal tone,
which in turn facilitates improved emotional regulation and psychological flexibility.
While a growing body of research investigates practices such as mindfulness train-
ing [22] or interoceptive technologies [23,24], this narrative review aims to consolidate this
understanding by examining the specific influence of physical exercise on these diverse
interoceptive dimensions. We propose that, as a particularly cost-effective and accessible
intervention, the interplay between exercise and interoceptive processes offers a powerful
pathway along the “inner road to happiness,” leading to a richer awareness of internal
bodily signals and the cultivation of a range of adaptive behaviors, ultimately contributing
to improved self-regulation and overall well-being. Indeed, this enhanced awareness can
manifest in recognizing early signs of stress and responding proactively, making informed
nutritional choices based on bodily cues, and utilizing exercise itself as a powerful tool
for emotional regulation. This approach is supported by the existing literature, which is
synthesized in this review.
Methodology
This narrative review aims to synthesize the existing literature on the interplay be-
tween physical exercise and interoception, and its resultant impact on well-being. To this
end, a comprehensive literature search was conducted primarily on PubMed using combi-
nations of keywords such as “interoception,” “exercise,” “physical activity,” “well-being,”
“mental health,” “emotional regulation,” and “self-regulation.” The selection of articles for
inclusion was guided by their relevance to the review’s objectives, focusing on empirical
studies, reviews, and influential theoretical papers. While no strict date limitations were
applied to ensure the inclusion of foundational works, particular attention was given to
recent advancements in the field. The selected literature was then synthesized through a
thematic analysis, structured around three primary mechanisms through which exercise
influences interoception: physiological changes, neurobiological adaptations, and psycho-
logical benefits. This approach allowed for a broad and insightful exploration, highlighting
key findings and identifying directions for future research.
2. Interoceptive Responses to Exercise
Physical activity encompasses any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles
that results in energy expenditure; thus, we all engage in some level of physical activity
for survival [25]. Walking or household tasks, for example, are forms of physical activity.
However, the extent of physical activity we engage in is largely a matter of personal
choice and can vary widely from person to person, as well as within an individual’s
own routine over time, and during their lifetime. Exercise is a subset of physical activity,
characterized by its planned, structured, and repetitive nature, and its goal of improving or
maintaining physical fitness [25]. Exercise directly influences the afferent signals received
by the interoceptive system through various mechanisms, including the induction of
cardiovascular activation [26] and the initiation of a cascade of hormonal and metabolic
responses [27,28]. Conversely, the regulation of physical exertion is under the constant
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 4 of 15
oversight of the central nervous system, so that interoceptive mechanisms continuously
monitor the physiological state of the body to maintain allostasis and guide goal-directed
behavior [4,29].
Wallman-Jones and colleagues [30] highlight the intricate, bidirectional relationship be-
tween exercise and interoceptive processing. They emphasize that interoceptive feedback—
particularly signals related to fatigue and effort—is key in regulating exercise intensity
and duration, thus underscoring the dynamic interplay between physical activity and the
body’s internal sensing.
To visually represent the multifaceted relationship between physical exercise and
interoception, we propose a conceptual model in Figure 1 that illustrates the key pathways
through which exercise impacts the various dimensions of interoceptive processes.
Figure 1. Integrated model of exercise influence on interoception and well-being.
As depicted in Figure 1, physical exercise exerts influence through three primary mech-
anisms: physiological changes, neurobiological adaptations, and psychological benefits.
These mechanisms converge to enhance interoception, which, in turn, contributes to im-
proved overall well-being. Specifically, the figure details how physiological changes, such
as increased heart rate and improved lung capacity, enhance the accuracy and awareness of
inner-bodily signals; how neurobiological changes, including insula activation and BDNF
increase, improve the central processing of interoceptive signals; and how psychological
benefits, like reduced stress and enhanced mood, positively influence the interpretation of
these signals. Ultimately, enhanced interoception fosters better emotional regulation and
homeostatic balance, promoting overall mental and physical health.
A more detailed examination of these mechanisms will be presented in the subsequent
sections.
3. The Physiological Effects of Exercise
Exercise elicits a wide range of physiological adaptations across multiple systems,
including cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, muscular, hormonal, neurological, ther-
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 5 of 15
moregulatory, and stress response systems. These adaptations collectively contribute to
improved health outcomes, enhanced physical fitness, and an elevated quality of life.
The most evident benefit of exercise is improved cardiorespiratory fitness, which can
prevent cardiovascular disease [31]. Exercise, for example, improves the functionality of the
endothelium (a layer of cells lining blood vessels), which plays a vital role in maintaining
vascular homeostasis [32,33]. The endothelium regulates vascular tone, blood flow, and
inflammatory responses. Exercise enhances its functionality by promoting the production
of “nitric oxide”, a vasodilator that relaxes the smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall,
leading to the widening of blood vessels (a process known as “vasodilation”). Improved
vasodilation facilitates increased blood flow to various tissues, enhancing oxygen and nutri-
ent delivery while promoting the removal of metabolic waste products. The ability of blood
vessels to dilate in response to increased demand is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular
health and function. The greatest benefit to this process is derived from regular moderate
exercise, which promotes antioxidant status and preserves endothelial functionality [34].
A core component of these cardiovascular adaptations is the acute increase in heart rate
during exercise, which has been shown to directly enhance interoceptive ability, suggesting
that higher exertion levels lead to enhanced awareness of physiological signals [35]. This
finding often stems from interventional studies where participants engage in acute exercise
bouts while their interoceptive accuracy is measured [35]. This enhancement was observed
across varying intensities of exercise, indicating a robust connection between heart rate
increases and interoceptive sensibility.
Respiratory efficiency is also enhanced as regular exercise has been shown to signifi-
cantly improve lung capacity [36]. Regular exercise habits can increase lung vital capacity,
as the respiratory muscles become stronger and more efficient, allowing for greater lung
expansion during inhalation. This increase in lung capacity is crucial for enhancing the
overall efficiency of the respiratory system, as it allows for a greater volume of air to be
inhaled and exhaled, facilitating better oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. While the
direct link between exercise and respiratory interoception requires further investigation,
observational studies have shown that awareness of respiratory signals is crucial for inte-
roceptive accuracy. A study by [37], for example, found that individuals with heightened
awareness of their breath exhibited differences in their ability to detect and discriminate
respiratory resistive loads and maintain accurate perception of respiratory tidal volume,
suggesting that training methods that enhance respiratory awareness, such as meditation,
can improve interoceptive abilities. Therefore, it is plausible that the improved respiratory
function from regular exercise, coupled with training focused on respiratory awareness,
might lead to a greater sensibility and accuracy in perceiving internal respiratory changes.
The effects of exercise on metabolic functions are multifaceted, encompassing improve-
ments in insulin sensitivity [38], alterations in adipose tissue metabolism [39], enhanced
muscle substrate utilization, and favorable changes in energy balance. These adaptations
collectively contribute to the prevention and management of metabolic disorders [ 40],
highlighting the critical role of exercise in promoting overall health. Muscular adapta-
tions include hypertrophy and increased strength, particularly through resistance training,
which also enhances bone density, crucial for preventing osteoporosis [ 41]. Hormonal
influences include the release of endorphins, improving mood and reducing pain percep-
tion. Exercise also modulates stress hormones like cortisol and enhances the balance of
anabolic hormones, such as testosterone and growth hormone, vital for muscle repair and
growth [42,43]. Critically, these metabolic changes are not merely physiological adaptations;
they also significantly impact interoceptive processes, as the brain constantly monitors and
interprets metabolic signals to maintain homeostasis and guide behavior [4,8,44].
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 6 of 15
Autonomic thermoregulation plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis during ex-
ercise, especially in response to the increased metabolic heat production. As core body
temperature rises, physiological responses such as sweating and increased skin blood
flow are triggered to dissipate heat and maintain thermal balance [ 45]. Following these
responses, behavioral thermoregulation allows for conscious adjustments to further regu-
late body temperature. This involves seeking cooler environments or employing cooling
strategies, such as drinking cold beverages. The heightened awareness of these autonomic
and behavioral thermoregulatory processes during exercise, including the onset of sweat-
ing and changes in skin temperature, can significantly enhance interoceptive sensibility.
This understanding often stems from both theoretical models and empirical observations
in controlled laboratory settings. Enhanced interoceptive sensibility, particularly during
heightened physiological states such as those experienced during physical exertion, can
significantly refine one’s awareness of bodily sensations and improve self-regulation.
Thus, exercise elicits a wide range of physiological adaptations. These changes provide
the brain with more precise and less noisy interoceptive signals. From an Active Inference
perspective, this enhanced clarity in afferent information can reduce interoceptive predic-
tion errors, allowing the brain to maintain more accurate internal models of the body’s state
and better anticipate its needs. For instance, improved cardiovascular efficiency means
the brain’s predictions about heart rate during exertion become more reliable, minimizing
surprise and fostering a greater sense of bodily control.
4. Neurobiological Underpinnings of Exercise-Induced Interoception
At the neurobiological level, exercise provides a range of benefits that support brain
health and cognitive function, including improved cerebral blood flow, reduced inflamma-
tion, and enhanced neuroplasticity [46]. Exercise stimulates the circulatory system, leading
to a greater flow of blood to the brain and triggers the release of various neurochemi-
cals, including neurotrophic factors that support the growth, survival, and differentiation
of neurons, such as the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Critically, a rise in
exercise-induced levels of BDNF has been found not only in structures primarily associated
with motor functions, as the cerebellum, but also in other key brain areas, including the
hippocampus [47], which is crucial for memory and cognitive functions [48]. The increase
in BDNF levels in the hippocampus is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that exercise
may facilitate neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement beyond mere motor coordination.
This relationship underscores the potential of exercise to serve as a therapeutic strategy for
cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions [49].
Various forms of exercise can influence interoceptive abilities, potentially through
changes in brain regions involved in interoceptive processes, particularly the insula. For
instance, an interventional study [ 50] reported enhanced functional connectivity in the
bilateral anterior insula following an exercise intervention in older adults with Mild Cog-
nitive Impairment. This increased connectivity was associated with improvements in
subjective well-being, suggesting a potential neural mechanism through which exercise
may promote psychological benefits. In addition, exercise training programs also induce
increased connectivity within key brain networks, including the default mode network
(DMN) and fronto-parietal cortex, which is coupled with enhanced executive functions
and memory performance [51]. This enhanced connectivity throughout these networks
facilitates a better integration of interoceptive information with emotional and cognitive
processes, ultimately leading to improved self-awareness and emotional regulation [52].
Exercise has been demonstrated to have significant effects on theneuroendocrine system,
particularly impacting the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. It can increase the
availability of serotonin, a key regulator of mood and anxiety; dopamine, associated with
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 7 of 15
motivation, reward, and pleasure; and norepinephrine, which plays a role in alertness, focus,
and attention. These neurochemical changes are thought to underlie some of the positive
effects of exercise on mood and cognitive function. For example, increased serotonin
levels from exercise may enhance mood and reduce anxiety, facilitating a more accurate
interpretation of bodily sensations [53,54]. Evidence for these neurochemical changes often
comes from controlled experimental studies (e.g., involving acute exercise bouts) in both
animal models and human participants.
Finally, exercise promotesneuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize
itself [55], through various biological mechanisms, including the upregulation of neu-
rotrophic factors such as the BDNF (as noted above) and insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1), which play significant roles in neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation. Such
plasticity enhances the brain’s capacity to process incoming signals, including the intero-
ceptive ones, leading to improved emotional regulation and resilience to stress. Individuals
with higher interoceptive awareness may exhibit greater adaptability in their emotional
responses, which is highly beneficial for mental health.
From an Active Inference perspective, these neurobiological adaptations, such as
enhanced connectivity and neuroplasticity, contribute to more precise internal models and
optimized processing of interoceptive prediction errors, thereby improving the brain’s
ability to accurately infer the body’s state and reduce uncertainty.
5. The Psychological Benefits of Exercise
In addition to its profound physiological and neurobiological effects, exercise also
provides a wide range of psychological benefits that are key to promoting well-being.
5.1. Exercise and Stress Management
Regular physical activity is recognized as a significant enhancer of psychological
resilience, empowering individuals to better manage stress and adversity [ 1,3,56]. This
enhancement is supported by evidence demonstrating that exercise mitigates the physio-
logical impact of stress. For instance, a review paper [2] highlighted the role of physical
exercise in reducing COVID-19-related allostatic overload through neuroendocrine and
immunological mechanisms, showcasing its benefits for both mental and physical well-
being. Similarly, [57], an empirical study, found that higher aerobic fitness levels attenuate
cardiovascular and salivary alpha amylase responses to acute psychosocial stress, further
suggesting that regular aerobic exercise promotes physiological resilience to stress.
5.2. Exercise and Subjective Well-Being
The research study by Lin and colleagues [ 58] showed that the positive impact of
exercise on subjective well-being is not direct, but rather mediated by two critical factors:
the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and improved sleep quality. Specifically,
exercise was found to foster a greater sense of autonomy (the feeling of control), competence
(the perception of being effective), and relatedness (meaningful connections with others)
among undergraduate students. These fulfilled needs, in turn, contribute significantly
to increased subjective well-being. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that exercise
promotes better sleep quality, which independently enhances feelings of well-being.
5.3. Exercise, Body Perception, and Self-Esteem
In their theoretical paper, Wallman-Jones et al. [59] present a compelling somatic-based
model that elucidates the mechanisms through which physical activity can influence self-
esteem via alterations in body perceptions. This framework is particularly significant as
it moves beyond traditional psychological models, which often overlook the key role of
bodily experiences in shaping self-concept. The authors propose that physical activity,
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 8 of 15
by enhancing body awareness and fostering positive changes in body perceptions, directly
contributes to increased self-esteem. Their model highlights the importance of interoceptive
and proprioceptive feedback, suggesting that engaging in movement and experiencing
physical competence can lead to a more positive evaluation of one’s body. Notably, this
perspective offers a novel approach to understanding the psychological benefits of exercise,
emphasizing the embodied nature of self-esteem.
5.4. Social Aspects of Exercise and Well-Being
Crucially, participating in physical activities often involvessocial interaction, which can
enhance feelings of belonging and support, and further reinforce the embodied self-esteem
discussed previously. This social aspect of exercise highlights how the act of moving and
engaging with others can contribute to a stronger sense of self and connection. Group
exercises or team sports provide opportunities for social engagement, fostering connections
that contribute to improved mental health and emotional well-being. Structured physical
activities have proven particularly beneficial for children with autism spectrum disorders,
by increasing physical activity levels and also social interaction skills, providing a platform
for practicing communication and social skills in a supportive environment [60].
5.5. Exercise and Cognitive Enhancement: Supporting Interoception and Well-Being
Enhanced cognitive capabilities, facilitated by physical activity, can indirectly influence
interoceptive awareness and processing, serving a supportive role in overall psychological
well-being. A key aspect of enhanced cognitive function is improved attentional control,
which allows individuals to more effectively focus on and interpret internal bodily signals.
Wallman-Jones et al. [35] investigated whether increases in interoceptive ability, which
may occur following acute physical activity conditions, could be further enhanced by
directing attention towards interoceptive signals during the activity. The study, employing
incremental cycling intensities, found that engaging in acute physical activity led to an
increase in interoceptive accuracy. However, the anticipated enhancement in interoceptive
accuracy through directed attention was not observed, suggesting that simply directing
focus may not offer additional benefits to exercise’s influence on interoception.
Better executive functions, such as cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control, contribute
to the ability to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant interoceptive cues, reducing
noise and enhancing signal detection. For example, individuals with improved cognitive
flexibility might be better able to adapt their interoceptive interpretations in response to
changing contexts, such as distinguishing between exercise-induced heart rate elevation
and anxiety-related tachycardia [61,62].
The relationship between regular physical activity and cognitive performance has gar-
nered considerable attention within the field of sports science. Numerous studies support
the premise that engaging in structured exercise not only enhances physical capabilities
but also contributes to cognitive enhancements, particularly in areas such as executive
functioning, memory, and overall cognitive resilience. Athletes, especially those in disciplines
demanding high levels of skill and concentration, often demonstrate advantageous cogni-
tive capabilities compared to non-athletes or novices in their respective sports. For example,
expert climbers—who must navigate complex environments, assess distances, and plan
movements—exhibit enhanced visuospatial memory compared to novices [ 63]. This is
typically observed in comparative observational studies. Critically, these benefits are not
limited to athletic populations; appreciable effects are also observed in non-athletes, high-
lighting the universal relevance of exercise for cognitive processes. For example, [ 64], a
quasi-experimental study, investigated the benefits of exercise on cognitive and motor func-
tions in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors utilizing a dual-task walking paradigm
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 9 of 15
and fNIRS. Their findings suggest that exercise may play an essential role in maintaining
cognitive and motor functions and potentially contribute to the prevention of cognitive
decline. A comprehensive meta-analysis assessed the impact of exercise interventions
on cognitive function in older adults, revealing significant positive effects on memory,
attention, and executive functions [65].
In the context of children [66], a rigorous six-month randomized controlled trial in
overweight children revealed significant enhancements in executive functions (working
memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) following sustained aerobic exercise
(see also [67]).
Overall, this body of research indicates that regular exercise serves as a crucial compo-
nent not only for physical health but also for mental and cognitive well-being, fostering
improved decision-making abilities across various populations. From an Active Inference
perspective, these psychological benefits—such as reduced stress, improved mood, and
enhanced self-esteem—contribute to a reduction in the “noise” or uncertainty of interocep-
tive signals. This, in turn, allows for a more accurate and less threatening interpretation of
internal bodily states, minimizing prediction errors related to internal distress and fostering
a more coherent and adaptive internal model of the self.
6. General Discussion
Our analysis highlights that physical exercise is a powerful and multifaceted tool for
enhancing interoception and, consequently, promoting well-being. Through its physiologi-
cal, neurobiological, and psychological effects, exercise emerges as a crucial intervention
to improve interoceptive functions and foster adaptive behaviors. This relationship can
be understood through the lens of Active Inference [ 8,9,68,69], which proposes that the
brain actively predicts and updates its internal states. In this perspective, we suggest that
exercise can influence this process in several key ways. Improved physiological signaling
may provide more precise data for the brain’s internal models, neurobiological adaptations
may enhance the computational capacity for prediction and error processing (e.g., through
insula connectivity and BDNF-mediated plasticity), and psychological benefits may re-
duce the “noise” of distress, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of interoceptive
cues [70,71]. Together, these mechanisms may contribute to a more optimized and adaptive
interoceptive inference, reducing uncertainty about internal bodily states and fostering a
more coherent sense of self and well-being.
6.1. Broader Implications and Future Directions
The therapeutic potential of exercise training to mitigate aging’s effects and promote
health is gaining significant attention [46]. Exercise’s ability to modulate endocrine function
towards a more youthful state and attenuate biological aging biomarkers further under-
scores its importance. Given this, cultivating an active lifestyle from childhood to old age
represents a potent strategy for fostering lifelong well-being, promoting a positive body
image, and establishing a foundation for sustained health.
A crucial area for future inquiry lies in understanding how to optimize exercise
benefits for different populations [72]. Investigating the synergistic effects of combined
cognitive and physical training, or the integration of mindfulness into physical activity,
could offer valuable insights for interoceptive enhancement [73]. Crucially, understanding
and delineating optimal types and amounts of exercise tailored to individual needs remains
essential. Developing personalized exercise prescriptions that consider age, health status,
and personal preferences will be pivotal in maximizing the benefits of physical activity on
interoceptive processes and overall well-being [74].
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 10 of 15
Recognizing these profound cognitive and interoceptive benefits, a critical question
becomes how to most effectively facilitate the widespread adoption of exercise across
diverse populations. Modifying urban environments to make exercise more accessible
and enjoyable presents a compelling strategy. For instance, specific urban design inter-
ventions, such as creating green spaces and pedestrian-friendly areas, can significantly
increase exercise levels among urban residents, leading to measurable improvements in
physical and mental health outcomes [75,76]. This highlights the crucial interplay between
environmental design and the promotion of a more active lifestyle.
6.2. Exercise as a Cost-Effective and Synergistic Therapeutic Strategy
Despite accumulating evidence supporting the multifaceted benefits of exercise, it
remains underutilized as a cost-effective intervention for enhancing mental and physical
health. This is particularly concerning given its potential as an adjunctive or alternative
treatment for various conditions, such as addiction recovery [77].
The role of exercise as a potent interoceptive intervention becomes even clearer when
compared with other practices like mindfulness and biofeedback. Recent research pro-
vides valuable insights, suggesting that all three approaches can be similarly effective
in promoting well-being [78–80]. While these modalities engage distinct mechanisms, a
growing body of evidence suggests a synergistic relationship between mindfulness and
exercise [81]. Mindfulness, for example, can positively impact physical health by promoting
healthier lifestyle choices and facilitating more consistent engagement in physical activi-
ties [82]. Contextual factors significantly influence the efficacy of these interventions; for
individuals with sedentary lifestyles, mindfulness strategies can be a guide to increase
overall enjoyment of exercise, thereby improving adherence [83,84]. A study even showed
that participants who engaged in mindfulness-based physical activity experienced greater
overall satisfaction than those who undertook traditional programs [ 85]. In conclusion,
while both exercise and mindfulness possess intrinsic value, integrating the two holds great
promise for enhancing overall effectiveness.
6.3. Limitations and Open Questions
While our analysis highlights the significant potential of physical exercise as an intero-
ceptive intervention, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations inherent in the current
body of research. A primary constraint is that much of the cited evidence, particularly
concerning the intricate neurobiological pathways linking exercise to interoception, remains
largely correlational or stems from early-phase studies, thus posing challenges for inferring
direct causality [86].
Furthermore, the relationship between exercise and interoception—particularly re-
garding the effects on interoceptive accuracy—has been a subject of investigation with
complex and sometimes inconsistent findings. While some studies have explored whether
regular exercise leads to improvements in cardiac interoceptive processing, the evidence
remains mixed. For instance, Yoris et al. [87] and Amaya et al. [88] found no definitive evi-
dence that habitual physical activity significantly enhances cardiac interoceptive accuracy
or provides conclusive benefits to cognitive functions during exercise. The inconsistencies
in these outcomes can stem from varying methodologies, types of interoceptive tasks used,
and participant characteristics [89,90]. This suggests that while there is theoretical support
for the benefits of exercise on interoception, the practical evidence depicts a more nuanced
landscape, where effects may not be as universally applicable as previously assumed [52,87].
Another important limitation is the broad conceptualization of interoception in this review,
which did not delve into the specific and differential effects of exercise on its various
dimensions (e.g., interoceptive accuracy, sensibility, or awareness). Additionally, many
Healthcare 2025, 13, 1960 11 of 15
widely used interoception measures, such as heartbeat detection tasks, can sometimes lack
ecological validity, failing to fully capture the dynamic, multimodal, and context-dependent
nature of interoceptive experiences in real-world scenarios [91,92].
Therefore, future research must strive to clarify these mixed results by standardiz-
ing methodologies, broadening participant demographics, and utilizing more rigorous
experimental designs and ecologically valid measures. Such efforts will be essential for
translating research findings into more effective, evidence-based interventions and for truly
understanding the dynamic interplay between exercise and interoception.
7. Conclusions
This narrative review highlights the pivotal role of physical exercise as a catalyst
for enhancing interoceptive functions and promoting overall well-being. By influencing
physiological, neurobiological, and psychological processes, exercise effectively fosters a
richer understanding of internal bodily states and supports adaptive behaviors. To unlock
its full therapeutic potential, it is essential to adopt personalized and integrated strategies.
Recommendations
Based on the evidence analyzed, targeted recommendations emerge for advancing
both research and practice in leveraging exercise for interoceptive enhancement and general
well-being. Future research must prioritize the development and validation of person-
alized exercise interventions, not only for populations with interoceptive dysfunctions,
but also to improve the well-being of the general population. This requires systematically
investigating optimal modalities, intensities, and durations, as well as the precise neu-
robiological mechanisms involved. At a practical and professional level, figures such as
coaches, personal trainers, and therapists should integrate personalized exercise prescrip-
tions, informed by an individual’s interoceptive profile, to improve the effectiveness of their
interventions. This can include incorporating mindfulness-based movement practices or
biofeedback techniques. On a broader public health and policy level, it is crucial to promote
exercise not only for physical fitness, but also for its profound cognitive and interoceptive
benefits. This entails advocating for funding in urban planning, launching public health
campaigns that emphasize the mental well-being aspects of exercise, and implementing
school-based programs that combine physical education with elements of interoceptive
awareness and self-regulation.
