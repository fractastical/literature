self-referential genomic

AGI from the genomic

The security of code-based digital records is a major concern of the 21st century.
AI and artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be hacked to pieces by digital
adversaries, and some AI objectives can lead to existential threats. The former
arises from sitting duck problems that all software systems are vulnerable to, and
the latter include control and misalignment problems. Blockchain technology,
circa 2009, can address these problems: hashing algorithms rely on a consensus
mechanism in manmade software systems to keep early blocks of software
immutable and tamper-proof from digital malware, while new blocks can be
added only if consistently aligned with original blocks. There is evidence that
the ancient precedent of the genomic blockchain, underpinning the unbroken
chain of life, uses a self-referential rather than a consensus-based hashing
algorithm. Knowledge of self-codes permits biotic elements to achieve a hack-
free agenda by self-reporting that they have been “negated,” or hacked, exactly
implementing the Gödel sentence from foundational mathematics of Gödel,
T uring, and Post (G–T–P). This results in an arms race in open-ended novelty to
secure the primacy of original self-codes. Selfhood and autonomy are staples
of neuroscience on complex self–other social cognition and increasingly of
autonomous AGI agents capable of end-to-end programmed self-assembly. My
perspective is that self-referential G–T–P information processing, first found in
the adaptive immune system of jawed fish 500 mya and more recently in mirror
neuron systems of humans, has enabled code-based self-organized intelligent
systems like life to survive over 3.7 billion years. Some lessons for AGI can be
gleaned from this discussion.

1 Introduction
Narrow artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at achieving specific tasks has had phenomenal
success with large language models (LLMs), deep learning, and artificial neural network
techniques based on multi-formatted data, including natural language, images, and
numerical data. AI can surpass human competencies in tasks like pattern recognition,
playing board games, and outputting text-based expert information in multiple domains,
especially with LLMs. Some people are of the view that, as GPT-4 is capable of solving

“novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision,
medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special
prompting,” (Bubeck et al., 2023), it already meets the hallmarks of
artificial general intelligence (AGI).Jones and Bergen (2025)make
similar claims for GPT-4.5, which aces the Turing test with a “win
rate” of 73% of convincing human judges that the AI is human,
while humans struggle to do so themselves. However, there has
been pushback on AI acing Turing tests as being insufficient, or
even a case of misdirected evidence of intelligence.Mitchell (2024)
claimsTuringtestssufferfrommovinggoalpostsdueto“ourshifting
conceptions of intelligence.” The capacity of machines to hold fluent
conversationsinnaturallanguagethatTuringproposedin1950isno
longer considered to be evidence of general intelligence. Whether
feats of GPT-4 LLMs qualify to be on par with human cognition,
which marks an apogee for general intelligence, is part of ongoing
debates (seeGoertzel, 2014; Zimmermann, 2024).
Many have characterized human-level intelligence as having
broad-ranging, adaptive powers that can respond to changing
external environments by selecting goals and the means to achieve
them by including novel solutions. For instance, having given a long
list of characteristics of human-level intelligence, which includes
self–other awareness and self-control,Goertzel (2014)requires AGI
to have “general scope and is good at generalization across various
goalsandcontexts.”Withregardtonovelsolutions,todate,theopen-
ended adaptive capacity of humans produces whatDawkins (1989)
calls extended phenotypes or artifacts outside of ourselves, rather
than following a trans-human agenda with genomic enhancements.
It has become commonplace to state that intelligence is what
mediates the goals–means nexus and is characteristic of goal-
directed agents (Russell and Norvig, 2003). The pushback on GPT
LLMs on having a Q&A format, in which the AI does not learn
anything, due to insufficient experientially driven data from the
environment actively elicited by the agent, has been raised bySilver
and Sutton (2024). Their vision of the next stage of AI agents is of
those that are autonomous in their selection of goals and means,
capable of self-learning from a continuous stream of experientially
driven feedback governed by reward maximization. However, we
have here the infamous proclamation of Captain Ahab in Moby
Dick, “All my means are sane, my motive and my object are
mad.” This calls into question what “sane” goals are, if the only
hallmark of rationality qua intelligence, in extant decision sciences
(see Markose, 2024; Silver et al., 2021), is the reward maximization
calculus of efficiency in the service of an objective.
In recent discussions, the AI control problem or the
misalignment problem (Bostrom, 2014; Russell, 2019; Ngo et al.,
2023; Hinton, 2023) has been recognized when AI systems are
autonomous and evolve malign behaviors that may not align with
human values and can evade human control. TheNgo et al. (2023)
description of AI agents that use deception and power-seeking
strategies to pursue misaligned goals underscores this as a perennial
problem of political economy that is not unique to AI. At least
since the Hobbesian thesis on the struggle for power and resources,
it has been recognized that there is an existential threat to life
and society when an agent with unbridled adaptive intelligence
is free to set its own goals and encounters other similarly intelligent
agents with their goals. The problem of adversarial and conflicting
goals is writ large. The extant computational environment is
swarming with sniffers, snipers, deep fakes, and computer viruses.
In all cases, though these bots are installed by humans, they can
operate with various degrees of autonomy to deceive, defraud,
bring down software systems, and, in the case of killer bots and
drones, physically decapitate humans and destroy their digital and
material possessions. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), for
instance, can program bots to resist detection by making deep fakes
of themselves.
In this note, I aim to throw new light on three aspects of the
control or misalignment problem of AGI. For this, I will draw
on advances in gene, neuro, and computer sciences, especially
cryptography, on how to protect purposeful software systems that
can lose autonomy when malware agents can hack and hijack host
codes to do their bidding. What is interesting is that autonomy and
selfhood, often considered to be vestiges of liberal democracy, are
part of the unique information processing of a code-based system of
life that has maintained the unbroken chain of life while permitting
evolutionary change.
The first step is to refer to the above discussions, the provenance
of general intelligence as a means of maintaining homeostasis of
life (Friston, 2010; Friston, 2013). In other words, the fundamental
alignment of general intelligence is in the service of life itself and
not any narrow objective. However, I will replace the Friston et al.
Free Energy principle for self-organization of life’s homeostasis in
terms of minimizing the degrading forces of entropy and disorder
with a code-based explanation for general intelligence. I will
elaborate on how the digital socio-economic world driven by AI
has parallels with what I call genomic intelligence (Markose, 2024),
which accords with the Walker and Davis (2013)epigram on the
“algorithmic take-over” of biology with digitization of inheritable
information encoded in a near-universal alphabet (A, T, C, G/U) in
the genome.
Second, I will introduce the reader to the adversarial digital
game, coextensive with life itself as the fundamental source of
misalignment,thatwasbroughttomyattentionbythegametheorist
Ken Binmore (see Markose, 2021c). Binmore (1987) raised the
specter of Gödel’s Liar, qua digital adversary, who will negate what
can be predicted. Binmore uses Gödel’s Liar to highlight the flaw
of extant Game Theory: by confining the best response to a given
action set, Game Theory not only guarantees that determinism will
be punished by the Liar but also precludes novelty and surprises
in the Nash equilibrium of a game. Markose (2017) produces
a Nash equilibrium of a game with Gödel’s Liar, which, from
logical necessity, produces novel syntactic objects outside listable
sets. To date, complexity, evolvability, novelty production, and
“thinking outside the box” in biology and humans have, for the
most part, relied on models of randomness or on statistical white
noise error terms (Markose, 2024; Markose, 2021b). This is despite
the long-standing type IV dynamics in the Wolfram–Chomsky
schema, based on foundational mathematics of Gödel, Turing,
and Post (G–T–P) aka recursion function theory (RFT), that
only code-based computational systems that can embrace self-
referential recursive structures of the Gödel incompleteness
theorems (GITs) can produce novelty (see Prokopenko et al.,
2019; 2025). Given that for some 90 years there has been little
evidence that GITs and the capstone construction in the form of
the Gödel sentence has relevance to any real world phenomena,
in Section 2, I will unpack some of the recent evidence of how
such self-referential intelligence was acquired for complexification

over the course of evolution of multicellular eukaryote life
(Markose, 2022).
Third, a major development of the 21st-century digital age,
whichhasabearingonthemisalignmentproblem,istheastounding
invention of the blockchain distributed ledger technology (BCDL).
This was first presented in the anarchic agenda of Bitcoin by
pseudonymous Nakamoto (2008)to resist centralized state control
of monetary systems. BCDL permits decentralized software-based
record keeping of actions of multiple agents, in which the fidelity
of extant digital records is maintained by a hashing solution to
a cryptographic puzzle. This also makes it difficult for malign
activity regarding new software additions by a subset of agents.
Abramov et al. (2021) , Markose (2021a), and Markose (2022)
have been the first to point out that the genome is a blockchain.
However, while Abramov et al. (2021) utilize the consensus
mechanism well known in manmade blockchain (Hussein et al.,
2023). Markose (2022)indicates that the genomic blockchain relies
on a self-referential hashing solution using the Gödel sentence,
which permits biotic elements to self-report that they are under
attack. The immutability of protein coding blocks of life for 3.7
billion years, associated with Crick’s notion of a “frozen accident”
while novelty is added, in the 21st century, can be identified as
part of a unique self-referential BCDL embodied in the organism
that secures alignment with the homeostasis of life. In any case,
there is a growing understanding that unless software systems
are embedded in a BCDL, they will be doomed to failure by
optimization of narrow objectives, as in the Bostrom (2014)
paperclip apocalypse, or hacked to pieces due to the sitting duck
problem (seeNabben, 2021; Heaven, 2019).
2 Staples of G–T–P/RFT, genomic
intelligence, and homeostasis of life
Until recently, there has been little evidence of how the staples
of RFT and Gödel (1931) relate to genomic systems, let alone to
BCDLs. This section will unpack the breakthroughs on the evidence
that RFT staples are ubiquitous in the self-referential genomic
intelligence of eukaryotes.
2.1 Unique digital identifiers and hashes in
biology
First, which is also a major ingredient of BCDLs for malware
detection, is the feature of unique digital identifiers pioneered by
Gödel (1931), called Gödel numbers (g.n.) or indexes, whereby a
finite string of letters maps to a unique integer. The hash compresses
variable-length strings to a fixed length, and any change in input
strings will alter the hash. There is now extensive evidence of
bio-peptide and other unique identifiers, including “zip codes”
for cellular signal processing, as discovered in the Nobel prize-
winning work ofBlobel (1999). It appears that all signaling in bio-
ICT relies on peptide identifiers from transcription factors in gene
expression to neuron-neuron links. As in the design of BCDLs that
all nodes of the distributed system have the same information, more
than 30 trillion cells in a human have the same DNA, with some
exceptionsofmosaicism.Thereisevidence(see Brickneret al.,2012 )
that subnetworks of gene regulatory networks have characteristic
identifiablebindingmotifs in transcriptionfactorsandtheirbinding
sites for associated gene expression for temporal and specialized
cell development in tissues. We will denote byg, g ∈ G, the DNA
instructions that lead to gene expression of specific somatic and
phenotype developments of the organism, where G is the set of
expressed genes.
2.2 Self-reference and diagonal
self-assembly machines in biology
In RFT, using epithets from Hofstader (1999), we have self-
reference (Self-Ref) or diagonal operators typically stated as a
program, g, that builds a machine that runsg and halts (denoted as
ɸg (g) ↓). Gershenfeld (2012)and Gershenfeld et al. (2017)give the
remarkable insight that what 21st-century digital fabrication aims to
do, which is described as end-to-end code-based 3-D self-assembly
of digitized materials, is something biology solved 3.7 billion years
ago. The self-assembly programs of biology are associated with the
ribosome and other transcriptase machinery that implement gene
expression for the morphological, somatic identity, and regulatory
control of the organism.
The breakthrough on the significance of this staple of self-
referential/diagonal operator in RFT found in textbooks likeRogers
(1967) and Cutland (1980) for biological self-assembly is given in
Panel A ofFigure 1. Following the set theoretic proof of GITs inPost
(1944), Cutland (1980), andSmullyan (1961), g ∈ G, that determine
selfhood of the organism can be considered the theorems for the
organism and G–T–P information processing, and alignment to
the homeostasis of life is stringently governed by the principle of
consistency.
2.3 Offline self-representation (Self-Rep)
or mirror mappings of online self-assembly
machine executions
A major breakthrough here is the evidenceMarkose (2021a),
Markose (2022)found for Self-Rep mirror structures of the adaptive
immune system (AIS), approximately 500 mya post jawed fish,
which is not present in prokaryotes. The major histocompatibility
complex (MHC1) receptors of the thymus are found to record
85% of expressed genes relating to the 3D self-assembly of the
morphology and somatic identity of the organism. This is shown,
respectively, in the left (offline recording) and right (online self-
assembly Self-Ref machine execution) sides of Panel A ofFigure 1.
For good reason, these self-repped gene codes in the thymus have
been called the Thymic Self, Sánchez-Ramón and Faure (2020)or
“the science of self” Greenen (2021). As is well known, the Self-
Rep in AIS thymic receptors is primarily to identify the hostile
other, viz., negation function operators of non-self-antigens, as will
be discussed below. Indeed, Miller et al. (2019) wax lyrical: “As
self-referential cognition is demonstrated by all living organisms,
life can be equated with the sustenance of cellular homeostasis in
the continuous defense of ‘self’.” This is remarkable in that Miller
et. al. give centrality to self-referential information processing in
genomic systems specifically to detect and mitigate adversarial

An even larger literature in neuroscience on mirror mappings
has followed important discoveries of the Parma Group
(Fadiga et al., 1995 ; Gallese et al., 1996 ; Rizzolatti et al., 1996 ;
Gallese and Sinigaglia, 2011; Gallese, 2009) of a mirror neuron
system (MNS) in the primate brain where embodied self-action
codes from the sensory-motor cortex are mappedoffline and reused

Markose 10.3389/frobt.2025.1624695
to make action inference in conspecifics and help facilitate complex
self–other interactions (see also Markose et al. (2025)). However,
despite the central role assigned to self-reference for the sentient
self in advanced organisms (Gardenfors 2003; Northoff et al., 2006;
Newen, 2018; Miller et al., 2019, etc.), onlyTsuda (2014), Markose
(2017), Markose (2021b), andMarkose (2022)have noted how the
evolutionary development of Self-Rep offline mirror structures is
necessary for biotic elements to make statements about themselves.
Tsuda (2014) makes an explicit observation that unless the two-
step mirror Self-Rep recursive structures are in place, the mapping
between the online machine execution codes and the offline
recording of the same shown inFigure 1 using the σ (x,x) 2 – place,
the Gödel substitution function, it is unlikely that statements about
self can be made, let alone about the other.
2.4 How can changes to genomic
self-codes be detected, specifically those
brought about by a digital adversary?
Here, the breakthrough in gene science, which debunks the idea
that the primary source of evolutionary changes arises from random
transcription/replication errors, follows the epochal discovery by
NobelLaureateBarbara McClintock(1984) oftransposableelements
(TEs) of viral origin. TEs that conduct cut-paste (transposons) and
copy-paste (retrotransposons) give a code-based explanation for
genomic changes. TEs, which account for some 45% of the genome,
have been found to engineer genomic evolvability, brain plasticity,
and novel phenotypes primarily in eukaryotes ( Fedoroff, 2012).
This underscores the truism that only software can change software
and also sheds light on the double-edged sword of viral software.
It can benignly copy and paste as in replication, which entails a
simple sliver of code, as shown in one of the earliest accounts of
code biology byKauffman (2015). However, malign viral hacking,
done externally by bio-malware and or internally by TEs to gene
expression itself, forms the Achilles heel of genomic digital systems.
Hence, here we have the model for the self-referential detection
of Gödel’s Liar. This entails the adaptive immune system (AIS)
(Flajnik and Kasahara, 2009) in the T-cell receptors that “simulate”
theapplicationofnegationsoftwarefunctions, f ¬,quavirus(hacker)
on self-repped gene codes. The breakthrough here is to see that
an RFT generalization of Gödel (1931) using Roger’s Fixed Point
Theorem (Rogers,1967) is needed for the counterparts in the
periphery of the self-repped gene codes in the T-cell receptors
to self-report when software changes to self-codes are brought
about by novel non-self-antigens in real time. The latter are an
uncountable infinity.
The AIS implements “out of the box” astronomic anticipative
search for novel non-self-antigens necessary for novel antibody
production and cognition in humans, manifesting unbounded
proteanism for novel extended phenotypes (Dawkins, 1989) in the
form of artifacts outside of ourselves. This facility, first found in the
AIS, relies on the recombination activator genes (RAG 1 and 2) and
also in the human brain for neural receptor diversity (Muotri et al.,
2009; Kaesar and Chun, 2020; Peña de Ortiz and Arshavsk, 2001),
which runs into orders of magnitude of 1020–1030 (Kapitonov and
Jurka,2005)thatexceedthepre-scriptedgermlineofthegenomesize
manytimesover.Likewise,detectionofnegationofwhatispredicted
in the human mirror neuron system found in neuroscience
experiments by Scott Kelso and co-authors (Tognoli et al., 2007)
gives evidence for perception of deceit and complex counterfactuals
in the Theory of Mind in social cognition.
The Rogers (1967)fixed point indexes of the Second Recursion
Theorem for yet-to-happenf ¬ attacks by the non-self-antigens are
generated in the AIS in a most ingenious fashion: a large number of
codes/indexes purported to be of differentf ¬ on each self-reppedg
are generated in the T-cell receptors. This is the most spectacular
case of predictive coding. Suppose that the g.n for the tuple {f ¬,
g } specifying that f ¬ has attacked g, is denoted byg¬. When the
attack by f ¬ takes place in real time in the periphery involvingg,
the experientially driven peripheral MHC1 receptor mediated by
interferon gamma must record this. If this “syncs” with the one
that was speculatively generated in the thymic MHC1 receptors, two
parts of the fixed point come together to construct a genomic Gödel
sentence, which will now have a fixed-point index of σ (g¬, g ¬). At
this point,g self-reports that it is under attack.
The index σ (g¬, g ¬) of the Gödel sentence effectively signals
the hash for an untenable state of 0 = 1 produced by the fixed point
of af ¬ negation function of self-codes (seeKauffman, 2023). Such
syntactic objects, σ (g¬, g ¬) at the point at which it is recursively
generated, are undecidable in that they lie outside of listable sets
arising from the mapped self-repped expressed gene codes that are
thetheoremsfortheorganismandthelistofindexesforknownnon-
theorems. Such indexes σ (g¬, g ¬) of Gödel sentences have recently
been identified byMarkose (2017), Markose (2021a), andMarkose
(2022)asaprecursorforendogenousnoveltyproductioningenomic
systems.Indeed,itisatestablehypothesisthatitistheinabilityofthe
peripheral MHC1 receptor to update the index to σ (g¬, g ¬) when

In RFT, the productive set of Post (1944) provides the unique
recursiveconstructionoftheblockchainoffixedpointindexesσ( g¬,
g¬) for the novel non-self-antigens and the novel antibodies thereof.
This takes on the structure of an arms race, which is somatic and
extraneous to the germline; hence, this exercise is geared to conserve
the genome rather than to improve it.
Schmidhuber (2006) and more recent articles (Zhang et al.,
2025) have depicted Gödel machines and Darwin Gödel machines,
respectively, to show how self-referential mappings can lead to
self-improving machines that can rewrite their own codes. It is
important to note here that the precise implementation of the
structuresofGödelincompletenessasfoundintheadaptiveimmune
system, which involves the detection of novel negation functions
of adversarial agents and their fixed-point indexes as in the Gödel
sentence, the novel antibody production that follows does not lead
to self-improvement in the germline. Instead, the self-referential
recursive structures are geared toward conserving self-codes against
adversaries, and the arms race in novelty is to improve defenses
and maintain autonomy of the organism against prolific digital
adversaries.
It is conjectured that an identical RFT machinery is involved in
the self–other nexus in both the AIS and MNS. What evidence is
there for this? In a knockout of interferon gamma in theJonathan
Kipnis Group experiment on rats ( Filiano et al., 2016 ), it was
found that the rats lost immune capabilities as well as their social
cognition of recognizing another rat. Kipnis et al. give an Evo-Devo
Frontiers inRobotics and AI 05 frontiersin.org
Markose 10.3389/frobt.2025.1624695
explanation that evolution has taught rats to socially isolate when
their immune system is compromised. My code-based explanation
(see Markose, 2021a) is that the same self-referential recursive
structures are in place both for the AIS as well as in the brain
MNSforself–othercognitionandhencewhentheinterferongamma
mediator,especiallyinthe peripheral MHC1receptorisknockedout,
the circuitry for the fixed point generation needed for predictive
coding for non-self–other misfires and self becomes blind to the
other. It is conjectured that this is how the rats in theFiliano et al.
(2016) experiment lost their immune capabilitiesand their capacity
for social cognition of another rat.
3 Concluding remarks
In conclusion, genomic intelligence in vertebrates that has
reached its pinnacle in humans is highly empathic as the
conspecific/other is the projection of self; greatly Machiavellian
having co-evolved from adversarial viral agents; geared toward
unbounded proteanism from the get-go starting with transposon-
based diversity creation by recombination activation genes (RAG)
in the immune system and brain; and stringently self-regulated by a
self-referential block chain distributed ledger (BCDL) driven by the
principle of autonomy of the life of the organism and an agenda to
be hack free.
It is a matter of incredulity that some 90 years have passed since
Gödel (1931), for evidence to be found that the RFT staples of Self-
Ref and Self-Rep and the Gödel sentence are ubiquitous in biology
andgenomicintelligence.Severalfactorscanbeadducedforthelack
of precise computational modeling of self-reference in the context
of general intelligence. Even those who espouse that code-based
operations are relevant in cognition, such as in the Computational
Theory of Mind (seeRescorla, 2020), never mention Self-Ref, self-
assembly machines, Self-Rep mirror systems, or computational
fixed-point indexes and, of course, the role of the Gödel sentence.
Thereisastronganti-machineviewthatclaimsthatbiologyisanon-
digital “natural” process that is creative in some vitalistic way. This
viewoverlooksthefactthatinnature,onlybiology,withtheencoded
basis of the genome, and the extended phenotypes of humans who
have built computers, manifest software-based digital systems.
Two canards are associated with the Gödel incompleteness
theorems (GITs) that seem to propagate anti-machine vitalistic
beliefs about life and intelligence. These have posed a stumbling
block to the necessary breakthroughs on code-based explanations
for genomic information processing. The canards are that the
GIT proves that human cognition is not computational and self-
referenceleadstoparadox(see Battagliaetal.,2025 ).IntheGödelian
setting, as unlike the Cretan Liar paradox This is False , Gödel’s
painstaking two-step process of Self-Ref and Self-Rep, found in
Rogers (1967)generalizations thereof, on how statements about self
and other appear to be made in the immune-cognitive systems (see
Figure 1; Markose, 2021b), there are no paradoxes. Furthermore,
influential commentators like Roger Penrose have used the GIT to
conclude that human cognition can outstrip what Turing machines
can do. As Rescorla (2020) says, “It may turn out that certain
human mental capacities outstrip Turing-computability, but Gödel’s
incompleteness theorems provide no reason to anticipate that
outcome.”Theworkof LaForteetal.(1998) ,On Why Gödel’s Theorem
Cannot Refute Computationalism, and others has provided push
back on such flawed anti-machine views on biology and human
cognition.
Section 2 gives an account of how G–T–P based immune-
cognitive systems may be conducting self-referential information
processing. As first noted byTsuda (2014), it is unlikely that any
statements regarding self or the other can be made by humans
without the two-step Self-Ref and Self-Rep recursive information
processing structures having evolved. Furthermore, the recursive
generation of an index of the Gödel sentence should demystify
what it is, a hash representing “0 = 1,” viz., non-theoremhood or
misalignment, and how it signifies a novel object as a constructive
“witness” for proof of incompleteness. In view of this, the following
statement is misconstrued: “The paradox of a brain trying to
study itself presents a conundrum, raising questions about self-
reference, consciousness, psychiatric disorders, and the boundaries
of scientific inquiry” (Battaglia et al., 2025). Likewise, in the absence
of the precise recursive function structures of Self-Ref and Self-Rep
necessary to identify software changes to self-codes, the important
discovery by the Parma Group of the mirror neuron system in the
brain has been stymied by hype and inaccuracies.
In the influential non-code-based Free Energy principle
explanation for general intelligence involved in the homeostasis
of life ( Friston, 2013), Friston does not fall into the trap of
the mainstream optimization framework, which effectively
constrains search to under the lamp post and cannot
produce novelty. Schwartenbeck et. al (2013) state that search for
novel solutions and “explorative behavior is not just in accordance
with the principle of free energy minimization but is, in fact,
mandated by it.” However, from the vantage of the discussion here, it
seemsthattherehasbeeninsufficientconsiderationbyFristonofthe
regulatory framework of maintaining homeostasis of life’s vital signs
within feasible physical/analog states, viz., minimizing “surprisals,”
when this is under the aegis of smart algorithmic controls. The latter
must contend with software-related data security breaches from
bio-malware or adversarial digital agents.
What has been overlooked is that a large part of homeostasis
in formalistic code-based self-assembly systems of life involves the
complexification of phenotype with dynamic adversarial digital
game structures that must embrace an arms race in novelty and
surprises in order to avoid threats to autonomy from adversarial
agents that can hack gene codes. This is a problem that genomic
intelligence appears to have solved. AI, in contrast, has ignored this
self-referential design for data integrity for autonomous existence
that can vitiate what is called the “sitting duck” problem (Heaven,
2019). Furthermore, extant decision sciences are devoid of any
epistemic structures for novelty production and complexification
(Markose, 2024). As noted, there is a considerable difference
between the Gödel self-reference models for novelty production
by Markose (2021c), Markose (2022) and those of Schmidhuber
(2006) and Zhang et al. (2025). I underscore the formal system
premise of consistency and theoremhood for providing the
stringent selection mechanism for what novelty is permitted in
genomic systems and do not use the language of optimal self-
improvement or reward frameworks as do these and other
authors.
In closing, it is my view that the biological immuno-cognitive
model of the self-referential genomic BCDL with Gödel sentence

hashes has far-reaching implications for understanding the full
gamut of self–other pathologies, gene regulatory networks that must
deal with malign transposable element activity, and more robust
design solutions for sustainable AGI.
