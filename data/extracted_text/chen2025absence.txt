Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to
their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV 3Sb5 has attracted
signiﬁcant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order
and unconventional superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring the
emergent phenomena from the interplay of phonons, electronic ﬂuctuations, and
topological effects. The nature of CDW formation in CsV 3Sb5 is unconventional
and has sparked considerable debate. In this study, we examine the origin of the
CDW state via ab initio ﬁnite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics.
Through a comparative study of CsV 3Sb5 and 2H-NbSe 2, we demonstrate that
the experimental absence of phonon softening—a hallmark of conventional CDW
transition—in CsV 3Sb5 along with the presence of a weakly ﬁrst-order transition, can
be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears
the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even
below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could
cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to
a weak ﬁrst-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported
by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV 3Sb5. Our results provide
crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to
no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum
effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV3Sb5.

Kagome materials have recently become a focal point in condensed matter physics due
to their inherent features such as geometric frustration and ﬂat electronic bands (1, 2).
These features enable the potential to host a gamut of exotic quantum phenomena (3–6).
Among Kagome materials, the newly discovered Z2 topological metal CsV3Sb5 (7–10)
has received intensive research interest. One of the intriguing feature of CsV 3Sb5 is the
coexistence of a charge density wave (CDW) order below 94 K and superconductivity
below 2.5 K out of a CDW background (11–14). Understanding the nature of its
CDW transition is not only crucial for determining pairing mechanisms for the
unconventional superconductivity (15, 16) but also important for developing next-
generation quantum devices (17). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism driving the CDW
order in CsV 3Sb5 remains poorly understood, presenting a substantial challenge both
theoretically and experimentally.
Previous research has suggested that conventional factors driving CDW transitions,
such as Fermi surface nesting and strong electron–phonon coupling (EPC) may not
play a major role in CsV 3Sb5 (18–21). For example, calculations of the Lindhard
susceptibility (22–24) have shown that Fermi surface nesting is not the predominant cause
due to inconsistent nesting wavevector and the CDW wavevector. In addition, CsV3Sb5
differs notably from conventional EPC-driven CDW materials [e.g. 2 H −NbSe2 (20)]
due to the absence of phonon softening across the CDW transition—a hallmark of EPC-
induced CDW transitions (20, 21). The absence of phonon softening is supported by
Raman and X-ray measurements (25, 26), despite both measurements and simulations
indicating moderate EPC strengths (24, 27–30). Explanations for the absence of phonon
softening have been suggested, such as a very broad linewidth of the soft phonon
mode (31) and a persistent phason gap (32), but the conﬁrmation of these conjectures
remains elusive. Additionally, alternative mechanisms for CDW formation that go
beyond conventional EPC have been proposed, such as a Jahn–Teller-like transition (23),
Signiﬁcance
The charge density
wave (CDW) transition
is an important phenomenon
in condensed matter physics.
Typical CDW transitions are
driven by strong electron–phonon
coupling signaled by phonon
softening and lattice instability
near the transition temperature.
Combining first-principles
simulation and experiment,
here we challenge this notion
by pointing out that quantum
zero-point motion can potentially
suppress phonon softening across
the CDW transition, as recently
observed in topological kagome
metal CsV3Sb5 and some high-
temperature superconducting
cuprates. Using CsV3Sb5
as a model system, we use finite-
temperature lattice dynamics and
coherent phonon spectroscopy to
probe the free-energy landscape
near its CDW transition and point
out the surprisingly important
role of quantum fluctuations.
Our result leads to profound
understanding of CDW transitions.

exciton condensation (33, 34) etc. These approaches have not
fully accounted for all the experimental observations, indicating
that additional factors might be involved.
Conventional density functional theory (DFT) calculations—
the workhorse of modern predictive materials modeling—have
been employed to investigate the electronic and phononic prop-
erties of CsV 3Sb5 to understand its CDW formation (23, 32).
However, these calculations are typically restricted to zero
temperature, while the ﬁnite-temperature lattice dynamics and
quantum zero-point ﬂuctuations are usually overlooked. In this
study, we employ DFT to analyze the free energy landscape of
CsV3Sb5 with various CDW distortions. To further account for
the effect of thermal and quantum zero-point ﬂuctuations (35),
we apply a ﬁnite-temperature lattice dynamics technique
based on the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation
(SSCHA) (36) to examine how the free energy landscape and the
phonon dynamics impact the CDW transition in CsV3Sb5.
Through a detailed comparative study with 2H-NbSe 2, we
elucidate the important and unique role of quantum zero-
point motion in suppressing the phonon softening behavior
in CsV3Sb5, stabilizing the pristine structure of CsV 3Sb5 and
leading to a weak ﬁrst-order CDW transition and the coexistence
of CDW and pristine phases around the transition temper-
ature. This scenario naturally explains the phonon linewidth
broadening observed in our coherent phonon spectroscopy
(CPS) measurements on single-crystalline CsV 3Sb5. Our result
challenges the prevailing understanding of phonon softening
behavior as a necessary indicator of EPC-induced CDW tran-
sitions. This work reconciles the possibility of EPC as the
origin of CDW, despite the absence of phonon softening in
CsV3Sb5, and provides insights that may be applicable to other
unconventional CDW materials like cuprates (20, 21). Moreover,
we highlight the surprising signiﬁcance of quantum zero-point
motion in a relatively heavy-element material like CsV3Sb5. This
behavior is related to quantum paraelectricity in SrTiO3 (37, 38).
However, there are important differences between these two
scenarios: Whereas the ferroelectric transition is suppressed by
quantum ﬂuctuations in SrTiO 3, there is a weak ﬁrst-order
CDW transition in CsV3Sb5. We elaborate on this difference in
Section 2.B.
1. Methods
1.1. Computational Methods. First-principles DFT calculations were con-
ducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package version 6.4.1 (39, 40),
using the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials (41). A 300 eV plane-
wave cutoff was employed for CsV 3Sb5, and 400 eV cutoff for 2H-NbSe 2. The
exchange-correlation functional was chosen to be the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional (42) with van der Waals (vdW) D3 correction (43), denoted
as PBE+vdW. The electronic conﬁgurations for the elemental pseudopotentials
were Cs (5 s26p66s1), V (3 s23p63d34s2), Sb (5 s25p3), Nb (4 p64d35s2), and
Se (4s24p4). Brillouin zone sampling was performed using an 18 ×18 ×12
Γ-centered k grid for CsV3Sb5 unit cell, and a 24×24 ×8 Γ-centered k grid for
2H-NbSe2 unit cell. The converged lattice parameters werea = b = 5.4491 Å,
c = 9.3056 Å for pristine CsV3Sb5 and a = b = 3.4517 Å,c = 12.3909 Å for
pristine 2H-NbSe2, in a good agreement to experimental dataa = b = 5.52 Å,
c = 9.36 Å for CsV 3Sb5 (8) and a = b = 3.4446 Å, c = 12.5444 Å for 2H-
NbSe2 at 298 K (44). Both systems utilized no spin polarization for the absent
local spin moments (7, 8) and a Gaussian smearing of 0.1 eV. The convergence
threshold was set as 1 ×10−7 eV for energy and as 0.005 eV/Å for force.
The harmonic phonon calculations were executed using the ﬁnite-displacement
method in Phonopy (45), with supercell sizes of 3 ×3 ×2 for CsV3Sb5 (162
atoms) and 6 ×6 ×1 for 2H-NbSe2 (216 atoms), using Γ-centered supercell k
grids of 3 ×3 ×3 and 2 ×2 ×2, respectively. We found that the harmonic
phonon dispersion in CsV3Sb5 was strongly affected by the supercell size, whose
convergence needs to be carefully checked [See SI Appendix, Fig. S1 for the
supercell convergence in CsV3Sb5 pristine phonon]. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC)
was turned off after verifying its negligible effect on phonon dispersions [See
SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for a comparison of pristine phonon dispersions with
PBE+vdW+SOC and PBE+vdW].
The SSCHA technique was employed to explore anharmonic and quantum
effects on lattice dynamics at a nonperturbative level (46–48) [See SI Appendix
for more details]. The SSCHA method variationally minimizes the free energy by
optimizing internal coordinates while preserving the symmetry of the system.
Gaussian ensembles of lattice distortions surrounding an average structure
are sampled to estimate the lattice free energy, which is then minimized by
adjusting the average structure and the spread of the Gaussian probability
distribution including both thermal and quantum effects. Self-consistency was
achieved for each temperature by utilizing 200 conﬁgurations per ensemble,
ensuring that the error ratio to the free-energy gradient stayed below 1×10−4.
Once self-consistency was achieved, phonon dispersions at ﬁnite temperatures
were calculated using the free energy Hessians (47) evaluated with up to
5,000 conﬁgurations. The computational setup of ensemble conﬁgurations was
aligned with the harmonic phonon calculations, maintaining consistency across
our methodology.
1.2. Experimental Methods.For the CPS experiment, optical pump–probe
transient reﬂectivity measurements were performed on a freshly cleaved sample
of CsV3Sb5 mounted in an optical cryostat. A noncollinear optical parametric
ampliﬁer generated ∼70 fs signal (800 nm) and idler (1,515 nm) pulses at a
50 kHz repetition rate, with a pump ﬂuence of approximately 100 mJ /cm2.
Measurements at different temperatures were performed upon successive
warming from a base temperature of 9 K. To isolate the coherent phonon
oscillations, an exponential background was subtracted from the transient
change in reﬂectivity, followed by an apodization step, and Fourier transforming
to the frequency domain. Further details on the experimental technique can be
found in ref. 49.
2. Results and Discussions
2.1. Conventional Phonon Behavior of EPC-Driven CDW Mate-
rials. Fig. 1A illustrates the pristine cell of CsV 3Sb5, featuring
a layered structure composed of alternating atomic planes.
The vanadium (V) atoms are arranged in a two-dimensional
Kagome lattice, surrounded by hexagonal antimony (Sb) atoms.
The Kagome plane is sandwiched between two honeycomb
Sb layers, with cesium (Cs) atoms situated between the V-Sb
layers. CDW materials typically transition from a high-symmetry
pristine structure to a low-symmetry CDW structure as the
temperature decreases. For instance, CsV3Sb5 transitions from a
P6/mmm structure at room temperature, depicted in Fig. 1 D,
to a CDW structure at 94 K, which is the trihexagonal (TrH)
2 ×2 ×2 or mixed TrH star-of-David (SoD) 2 ×2 ×4
conﬁguration (9, 25, 50) with an in-plane TrH layer shown
in Fig. 1 E. Similarly, 2H-NbSe 2 undergoes a transition into
its CDW structure at 33 K (51) [See SI Appendix for more
details about the CDW order in 2H-NbSe 2 (52–54)]. From
ground-state DFT calculations conducted at zero temperature,
the CDW structures are energetically favorable compared to
the pristine structure. Considering a continuous variation of
structural coordinates, where each structure correlates with one
energy, we can visualize an energy landscape, as illustrated in
Fig. 1B. In this energy landscape, the potential wells correspond
to the energetically stable CDW structures, and the saddle point
indicates the unstable pristine structure.
EPC-driven CDW transitions are often accompanied by a
phonon softening behavior sketched in Fig. 1 C (51, 55). Due
to the unstable saddle point in the energy landscape, the pristine

structure at zero temperature should display imaginary phonon
frequencies at phonon wavevectors corresponding to the CDW
distortions, as depicted by the purple curve in Fig. 1 C. As
the temperature increases, the imaginary phonon is gradually
suppressed, which becomes stable ( ! ≥0) above the CDW
transition temperature (T ≥TCDW). For instance, experimental
observations of EPC-driven CDW in 2H-NbSe 2 show these
typical softening behaviors illustrated in Fig. 1C (51). In contrast,
CsV3Sb5 does not follow this pattern: Experimental results reveal
no phonon softening (25, 26), which was previously interpreted
to suggest that EPC is not the dominant mechanism driving the
CDW transition in CsV3Sb5.
Fig. 2 A–C illustrates the schematic evolution of the free
energy landscape in CsV 3Sb5 as the temperature decreases. In
Fig. 2A, above the CDW transition temperature ( T > TCDW),
the pristine structure, which is labeled by the blue dot with
the atomic structure shown in Fig. 2 D, represents a global
free energy minimum and the system favors the high-symmetry
pristine state. As the temperature approaches the CDW transition
(T ≈TCDW) in Fig. 2 B, low-symmetry CDW structures, like
the 2 ×2 ×2 TrH structure shown in Fig. 2E indicated by the
green dot, exhibit free energies comparable to that of the pristine
structure, facilitating the onset of the CDW transition. Below
the transition temperature ( T < TCDW) in Fig. 2 C, additional
CDW orders, such as the orange dot 2 ×2 ×1 TrH order in
Fig. 2F, become local minima with lower free energies than the
pristine phase. The rationale for depicting the pristine structure
as a local minimum at all temperatures will be discussed in the
next section.
We systematically explored and identiﬁed multiple possible
CDW structures in CsV 3Sb5. Fig. 2 G provides an overview of
the energy hierarchy of identiﬁed CDW structures as compared
to the pristine structure, computed using the PBE+vdW+SOC
method. The energies of the structures are directly comparable, as
they were calculated using consistent setups, with computational
details and their atomic structures provided in SI Appendix.
Among these, the 2 ×2 ×2 TrH order is the most energetically
favorable structure with a stable phonon dispersion. The 2×2×4
4TrH1 and 4TrH2 chiral structures, both consisting of four TrH
layers, exhibit energies close to the global minimum, which can
potentially explain the chirality observed in experiments (56).
The 2×2×4 SoD-3TrH structure, comprising one layer of SoD
and three layers of TrH, corresponds to the structure reported in
ref. 57. The 2 ×2 ×1 TrH structure exhibit a stable phonon
dispersion, similar to the global minimum [See SI Appendix for
the stable phonon dispersions of 2 ×2 ×1 and 2 ×2 ×2 TrH
orders (26, 58, 59)]. The structures with SoD layers are found
to be more unstable. The 2×2 ×1 SoD is dynamically unstable
with imaginary phonon frequencies. The 2 ×2 ×2 SoD-TrH,
composed of one SoD layer and one TrH layer, and 2×2×2 SoD,
composed of two SoD layers, only emerge under less stringent
convergence criteria, as they tend to relax back to the 2 ×2 ×2
TrH conﬁguration under tighter conditions.
Overall, Fig. 2 G also provides an estimation of the energy
barriers between these distinct structures. The energy barrier
between the ground state structure and the pristine phase is
about 6.23 meV per formula unit (f.u.), which corresponds to
49.84 meV(= 6.23 ×8) for the degree of freedom associated
with the distortion into a 2 ×2 ×2 CDW structure. Given that
the CDW transition occurs at 94 K ( ≈8 meV), this barrier is
unlikely to be overcome solely by thermal ﬂuctuations. In the
following section, we will show that the energy barrier could be
reduced due to the effects of zero-point motion.
2.2. Quantum Zero Point Motion.To effectively grasp the im-
pact of ﬁnite temperatures on CDW materials, it is crucial
to incorporate both thermal ﬂuctuations and quantum zero-
point effects on their lattice dynamics, for which we employ
the SSCHA method (36). Speciﬁcally, the SSCHA method
aims to variationally minimize the free energy F = E −TS,
where E represents the energy and TS denotes the entropy
contribution (60). During the minimization process, SSCHA
generates a set of ensemble conﬁgurations based on statistical
ﬂuctuations involving both the thermal and zero-point effects.
Zero-point motion in a lattice arises from the quantum
mechanical effect that introduces position uncertainty. The

Hamiltonian of the lattice can be transformed to a set of inde-
pendent harmonic oscillators. For a single harmonic oscillator
at zero temperature, the position uncertainty of the ground
state is given by ⟨x2
i ⟩= ℏ
2m!i , where m is the effective mass
of a particle in a harmonic potential with frequency !i, and
xi is the displacement amplitude relative to the coordinates of
the reference structure, which is the pristine structure in our
case. The mass-weighted distance from the pristine structure
is
√
⟨mx2
i ⟩=
√
ℏ
2!i , which depends solely on the vibrational
frequencies. To simulate the quantum effects and thermal effects,
we can generate an ensemble of conﬁgurations, where position
xi is drawn from a Gaussian distribution, determined by the
position uncertainty at ﬁnite temperatures. By evaluating the
energy of the ensemble conﬁgurations via DFT, we can extract
various ensemble-averaged physical properties, such as the ﬁnite-
temperature average structure, phonon dispersions, etc.
The analysis of phonon softening in 1H-NbSe 2 and 2H-
NbSe2 including both thermal and zero-point ﬂuctuations by
SSCHA has been performed before (61). Here, we ﬁrst replicated
the phonon dispersion calculations for 2H-NbSe 2, as shown in
Fig. 3A. The blue curve represents the phonon dispersion without
considering zero-point motion (“No zero-point”) calculated
using the ﬁnite displacement method and its displacement
amplitude was set as 0.01 Å. In contrast, the red curve illustrates
the phonon dispersion with zero-point motion at 5 K (“With
zero-point”), performed via SSCHA. For the 5 K calculation
with zero-point motion, thermal effects are negligible, yielding
results equivalent to those at 0 K, and we selected 5 K to avoid
potential numerical divergence issues. Our results were consistent
with the previous study using SSCHA (61), where the imaginary
frequency of “With zero-point” is around−5 meV nearM point,
validating our approach and computational setup.
Next, we applied the same procedure to CsV 3Sb5. Surpris-
ingly, the 5 K “With zero-point” phonon dispersion exhibited
dynamic stability without imaginary phonon frequencies, as
shown in Fig. 3 B, which is in sharp contrast to the case in
2H-NbSe2. Fig. 3 B differs from another SSCHA study on
CsV3Sb5 (31), which we believe is most likely due to the
use of a different supercell size. To understand the difference
between 2H-NbSe2 and CsV3Sb5, we examined the optimized
ensembles used for computing the free-energy Hessian matrices
and observed signiﬁcant differences in the distributions of the
5,000 ensemble conﬁgurations used in both calculations. As
depicted in Fig. 3 C and D, the blue dotted line represents the
energy landscape along the CDW distortion from the pristine
structure calculated using DFT, with energy per formula unit
referenced to the pristine structure. The CDW landscape is
chosen to represent the most stable CDW structure for CsV3Sb5
and 2H-NbSe2, respectively [See SI Appendixfor the 2H-NbSe2
CDW structure]. The horizontal axis, “distance to pristine,” is
deﬁned as the averaged mass-weighted distance to the pristine
structure
√∑
i Mi(Ri −ri)2/N , whereN is the number of atoms
in a given structure, Mi is the mass of the i-th atom in atomic
mass units (amu), Ri is the Cartesian coordinate of the i-th atom
in the given distorted structure, ri is the Cartesian coordinate of
the corresponding atom in the pristine cell. This value serves as a
one-dimensional representation of the multidimensional atomic
displacements, quantifying the normalized radial deviation of a
given structure from its pristine state. The right y-axis illustrates
the distribution of zero-point ensemble conﬁgurations based
on their radial distances to the pristine structure. SI Appendix,
section IB provides a simpliﬁed model to derive this distribution,
which shows a Gaussian-like proﬁle centered around the effective
position uncertainty from quantum zero-point motion.
The “No zero-point” phonon dispersion, calculated by
0.01 Å ﬁnite-displacement method, probes the immediate
vicinity of the pristine cell within the DFT landscape. In contrast,
the ensemble due to zero-point motion detects a broader range
of distances extending beyond the CDW potential well in Fig. 3
C and D. The ﬁrst vertical dashed line of each ﬁgure denotes the
location of the CDW potential well, whereas the second vertical
dashed line indicates the average distance of conﬁgurations from
the pristine structure in the optimized zero-point ensemble. The
black double arrow represents the distance between these two
vertical dashed lines and is almost twice larger in CsV 3Sb5
compared to that in 2H-NbSe 2. The red dashed lines denote
the expected free-energy landscapes as a result of the phonon
dispersions sampling from the zero-point ensemble. The red
dashed line in Fig. 3 C reveals an expected landscape with a

smeared negative parabola for pristine 2H-NbSe 2, suggesting
that the zero-point ensemble effectively samples the CDW
potential well. In other words, even though the expected free
energy landscape in 2H-NbSe 2 is smeared by the position
uncertainty due to zero-point motions, the pristine structure
remains dynamically unstable with imaginary phonon modes. In
contrast, Fig. 3 D reveals an expected landscape with a positive
parabola for CsV3Sb5, since the average distance from the pristine
structure of the zero-point ensemble is much wider than the
CDW potential well. In this case, the CDW potential well cannot
be effectively sampled by the ensemble, resulting in stabilized
phonons of the pristine structure even near zero temperature. As a
result, the uncertainty of the atomic position introduced by zero-
point motion effectively stabilizes the CsV 3Sb5 phonons in the
pristine structure. Near the CDW transition temperature (94 K),
thermal ﬂuctuations further broaden the ensemble sampling
space and, together with quantum ﬂuctuations, further stabilize
the pristine structure, leading to the absence of phonon softening.
To further investigate why the absence of phonon softening
is observed speciﬁcally in CsV3Sb5, we examine the relationship
between the zero-point ensemble and the CDW potential well.
From the simpliﬁed model inSI Appendix, the average distance of
the zero-point distribution can be estimated using the quantum
uncertainty relation, approximately
√
ℏ
2!, where ! represents
the effective frequency of phonon modes. Thus, we can assess
the quantum ﬂuctuations in the pristine phases from phonon
dispersions. Given that the phonon dispersions in 2H-NbSe 2
and CsV 3Sb5 are similar, the zero-point ensemble average
distances are comparable: 0.65 amu 1/2Å for 2H-NbSe 2 and
0.73 amu1/2Å for CsV3Sb5. What distinguishes these two cases
is the relative distances of the CDW structures to the pristine
structures. In 2H-NbSe 2, the CDW structure is located at a
distance 0.39 amu 1/2Å from pristine, while in CsV 3Sb5, this
distance is shorter, at 0.30 amu 1/2Å. This indicates that the
distorted CDW structure in CsV 3Sb5 is relatively closer to the
pristine structure than 2H-NbSe 2, which plays a crucial role in
stabilizing the phonons.
Other than CsV3Sb5, it has been shown that in SrTiO3 the fer-
roelectric order is suppressed by quantum ﬂuctuations (37, 38),
and in 2H-NbSe2 quantum ﬂuctuations can suppress the CDW
phase transition at elevated pressures (62). These examples
suggest that quantum ﬂuctuations may play a signiﬁcant role
in materials containing relatively heavy elements. For instance,
the paraelectric ground state of SrTiO 3 stabilized by quantum
ﬂuctuations has been studied in detail with SSCHA (38).
Although the ferroelectric phase of SrTiO3 has a lower energy, the
tetragonal paraelectric phase remains dynamically stable down to
0 K due to quantum ﬂuctuations, preventing the ferroelectric
transverse optical (TO) phonon mode at the zone-center from
softening and becoming unstable (38) [although partial softening
of the TA phonon near Γ was recently observed, which was
attributed to the development of mesoscopic ferroelectric do-
mains (63)]. Extrapolating the temperature-dependent frequency
of the ferroelectric TO mode in SrTiO 3 suggests that the free
energies of the paraelectric phase and the ferroelectric phase cross-
over around 35 K, much lower than that in CsV 3Sb5 (94 K).
It is possible that at a much lower temperature, thermal and
quantum ﬂuctuations are not sufﬁciently strong to overcome
the potential barrier separating the paraelectric and ferroelectric
phases in SrTiO3, preventing a ﬁrst-order transition. However,
there are also experimental claims of the existence of ferroelectric

domains in paraelectric SrTiO 3 below roughly 40 K (63–65),
which is analogous to the coexistence of pristine and CDW
phases in CsV 3Sb5. Due to the lower temperature and smaller
energy scale in SrTiO 3, this phase coexistence may be more
sensitive to extrinsic factors, such as defects and strain. Our
ﬁnding in CsV3Sb5 provides an alternative view to the prevailing
understanding that phonon softening behavior is a necessary
feature for EPC-induced CDW transitions. Instead, the extent
of phonon softening depends on the competition between
quantum ﬂuctuations and the energy landscape that drives
the transition and should lie in a continuous spectrum. For
example, certain cuprates exhibit approximately 15% softening
across the CDW transition (66, 67) and SrTiO 3 shows 10 to
40% softening of its TA phonons at 20 K (63). Using our
notion described above, cuprates and SrTiO 3 are likely to dis-
play an intermediate zero-point ensemble distribution between
the ones of complete-softening 2H-NbSe 2 and no-softening
CsV3Sb5.
2.3. Experimental Implications.The lack of phonon softening
in CsV 3Sb5 also presents a signiﬁcant deviation from the
typical second-order phase transitions seen in conventional
CDW materials. The phase transition in CDW materials is
typically characterized by complete phonon softening, implying
a continuous second-order transition. The softening behavior
indicates that the curvature of the free energy landscape proﬁle
at the pristine structure, which reﬂects the phonon stability,
decreases with decreasing temperatures. In the framework of
Landau theory, this behavior indicates the continuous evolution
of the pristine structure in the free energy landscape from
a local minimum to a local maximum, implying a gradual
modiﬁcation of the order parameter from the pristine to the
CDW phase.
In stark contrast, CsV 3Sb5 exhibits a weak ﬁrst-order phase
transition, as evidenced by previous experiments, such as
NMR (68, 69), X-ray scattering (70), heat capacity measure-
ments (8), and thermal hysteresis behavior (71), etc. This beh-
avior has previously been attributed to symmetry arguments,
which allow for the presence of third-order terms in Landau
theory (32). Our ﬁndings provide a physical explanation for the
local stability of the pristine phase, which is stabilized by zero-
point motion. As discussed in the previous section, we identiﬁed
the dynamic stability of pristine CsV3Sb5 even below the CDW
transition temperature. The stable pristine phase consistently
represents an effective local minimum in the free energy landscape
sketched in Fig. 2 A and C. The transition to the CDW phase
is not accompanied by the gradual softening behavior. Instead,
it occurs via a sudden shift in the order parameter indicated by
the red arrow in Fig. 2 B, characteristic of a ﬁrst-order phase
transition.
Additionally, the inﬂuence of quantum ﬂuctuations implies
that the ﬁrst-order phase transition in CsV 3Sb5 is likely weak.
The zero-point ensemble samples a broad range of distances,
leading to an effective potential landscape that is considerably
smeared. Thus, the prominence of DFT energy barriers is
reduced, further supporting the notion of a weak ﬁrst-order tran-
sition. An immediate implication of CDW being the ﬁrst-order
transition is that the pristine and CDW phases coexist as distinct
local minima near the transition temperature, a phenomenon
also detected in CPS with a long-lifetime metastable state (49)
and NMR with a narrow coexistence temperature range 91 K
to 94 K (72). Another possible implication essentially suggests
that the reduced energy barriers can be dynamically overcome,
and thus we anticipate smearing effects in the X-ray diffraction
measurements in CsV3Sb5 (73).
We have also attempted to match the computational results
with our CPS measurement of CsV3Sb5. Since CPS only observes
the fully symmetric phonon mode, Fig. 4 A includes the fully
symmetric phonon modes at the Γ point of phonon dispersion
for the CsV3Sb5 pristine, 2 ×2 ×1 TrH, and 2 ×2 ×2 TrH
orders [see SI Appendix for the irreducible representations of Γ
optical modes for 2 ×2 ×1 and 2 ×2 ×2 TrH orders]. The
blue, green, and red colors are the, , modes aligned with the
CPS result. These modes have been previously reported in ref. 49
from the M and L point of the pristine phonon dispersion.
The  mode at 17.0 meV(4.1 THz), present at all tem-
peratures, corresponds to the out-of-plane motion of the Sb
atoms within the unit cell, oscillating toward and away from
the Kagome plane (49). The  and  modes are induced by
symmetry breaking as the system enters the CDW phases. The
mode at 5.5 meV(1.3 THz) emerges at 94 K and corresponds to
the 5.09 meV(1.23 THz) mode in the 2×2 ×2 TrH structure,
supporting the transition picture described in Fig. 2 B, where
the 2 ×2 ×2 TrH structure is the most stable phase that ﬁrst
occurs at the transition temperature. The  mode at 13.0 meV
(3.1 THz) is broader and is observed only at lower temperatures
around 60 K. This mode likely arises from the competition
between different CDW structures. Speciﬁcally, the 2 ×2 ×1
TrH structure has a mode at 13.03 meV (3.15 THz), while the
2×2×2 TrH structure has modes at 13.55 meV and 12.11 meV
(3.28 THz and 2.93 THz). This suggests that the metastable
CDW structures, possibly including the 2 ×2 ×4 structures,
have a set of modes with similar frequencies collectively leading
to a broad  spectrum. The appearance of this  mode at 60 K
signals the onset of metastable states, reﬂecting the coexistence
of multiple CDW minima, as depicted in Fig. 2 C. Our analysis
has also identiﬁed additional modes in black that are active in
CPS due to CDW distortions. The correlation of these newly
identiﬁed peaks with the experimental observations is notably
strong.
The typical effect of decreasing temperature on the CPS active
modes is a narrowing of the peak linewidths due to reduced
electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scatterings. However,
as depicted in Fig. 4 C–E, a saturation trend for the full-
width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of the , , 
peaks emerges at lower temperatures [See SI Appendix for peak
positions and peak areas of the , , modes]. Our theory offers
a potential explanation for this saturation behavior. Below the
CDW transition temperature ( T < TCDW), as illustrated in
Fig. 2 C, the free energy proﬁle introduces additional CDW
orders as local minima with smeared energy barriers. These local
minima could act as a source of disorder through competing
CDW phases, which would contribute to the broadening of
phonon peak linewidths, counteracting the narrowing effect of
a lowering temperature. We propose that both the broadening
and narrowing effects contribute to the observed saturation in
the FWHM linewidth. This analysis elucidates the dynamical
evolution of structural orders under thermal and zero-point
effects, which is of fundamental importance in studying phase
transitions in CDW materials.
3. Conclusion
In this study, we investigate the temperature-dependent free
energy landscape associated with CDW structures in CsV 3Sb5
using ab initio simulations, highlighting the important role of

quantum zero-point motion. We identify an energy hierarchy of
CDW structures including two chiral 2×2 ×4 structures, with
the 2 ×2 ×2 TrH order being the most energetically favorable.
Unlike typical CDW materials such as 2H-NbSe2, the inclusion
of zero-point motion results in the stabilization of phonons
in pristine CsV 3Sb5 even below the transition temperature.
In addition, quantum ﬂuctuations can also smear the energy
barriers, suggesting that CsV 3Sb5 undergoes a weak ﬁrst-order
phase transition, accompanied by a coexistence of pristine and
CDW phases near the transition temperature. We propose a
dynamic evolution of the free energy landscape, in which certain
stable higher-energy CDW states, such as the 2 ×2 ×1 TrH
order, could occur at lower temperatures. Our theory aligns
with CPS results, particularly in the additional local minima
states contributing to the saturating linewidth trend of the ,
, and modes. Overall, this work challenges the conventional
understanding that phonon softening must accompany EPC-
induced CDW transitions. CsV 3Sb5 exempliﬁes how quantum
mechanical effects can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence macroscopic prop-
erties and the nature of phase transitions. Given the complexity
with competing energy landscape and quantum/thermal ﬂuc-
tuations, we expect that more experimental and computational
data, especially ﬁnite-temperature simulations near the CDW
transition temperature, can further clarify the physical picture
sketched here. This research provides a unique perspective for
further studies into other unconventional CDW materials and
has rich implications in the interpretation of solid-state phase
transitions.
