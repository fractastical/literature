for Edge AI Inference: Joint Feature Quantization
and Active-Passive Beamforming Design

Abstract—The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge
inference by leveraging ubiquitously deployed artificial intelli-
gence (AI) models, facilitating intelligent environmental percep-
tion for a wide range of applications. A critical operation in
edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate multi-
view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby
boosting perception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp)
emerges as a promising technique for rapid feature aggregation
by exploiting the waveform superposition property of analog-
modulated signals, which is, however, incompatible with existing
digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid reconfig-
urable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable
of simultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits
potential for enhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes
a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme,
which employs vector quantization to map high-dimensional
features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated into
symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the
AirComp transceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal
superposition across agents, the EN can estimate the aggregated
features from the received signals. To endow HRD-AirComp
with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a surrogate
function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact
of feature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on
this surrogate, we formulate an optimization problem targeting
inference accuracy maximization, and develop an efficient algo-
rithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit allocation, agent
transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and hybrid
RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed HRD-AirComp outperforms state-of-the-art
digital AirComp baselines in terms of both inference accuracy
and uncertainty, achieving performance close to the idealized case
with perfect feature aggregation.

network capabilities: sensing and artificial intelligence (AI)
[3]. The former involves the fusion of multi-view sensory data
acquired through collaborative devices, while the latter aims to
enable the ubiquitous deployment of advanced AI models. The
natural integration of these two capabilities at the network edge
gives rise to a novel paradigm termed edge inference, referring
to the intelligent processing of sensory data via well-trained
AI models deployed across edge infrastructure and distributed
devices [4].
In typical edge inference systems, distributed devices out-
fitted with sensors (e.g., cameras and radars) and hardware
accelerators (e.g., GPUs), termed as agents, collect sensory
data from their individual viewpoints and perform local fea-
ture extraction using lightweight AI models. The extracted
features are transmitted to an edge node (EN), where they
are aggregated and then processed by a computation-intensive
edge model to complete the inference task [5]. However, the
aforementioned feature aggregation, serving as a critical oper-
ation in edge inference by harnessing multi-view information
to enhance perception accuracy, suffers from a communication
bottleneck. This stems from the concurrent transmission of
high-dimensional feature vectors over resource-limited wire-
less channels, resulting in substantial aggregation latency that
fails to meet the timeliness demands of inference tasks. To
address this bottleneck, over-the-air computing (AirComp) has
emerged as a promising solution by exploiting the waveform
superposition property to enable rapid aggregation of simul-
taneously transmitted data streams [6], [7]. This appealing
characteristic has spurred growing research interest in the
seamless integration of AirComp into edge inference systems.
A. Related Works
1) AirComp-Enabled Edge Inference: In this context, Air-
Comp facilitates the over-the-air aggregation of local fea-
tures transmitted by agents, enabling the EN to reconstruct
global features directly from the superimposed signals. Unlike
traditional AirComp that primarily focuses on minimizing
computation error, the design objective in AirComp-enabled
edge inference shifts toward boosting the end-to-end per-
formance of inference tasks [8]. This inspires a series of
studies, ranging from inference performance analysis to task-
oriented transceiver design. Specifically, based on the as-
sumption that the global features obey a Gaussian mixture
distribution, literature [9] established a theoretical framework
for analyzing the scaling law between inference uncertainty

and receiving signal-to-noise ratio of AirComp. Work in [10]
introduced the concept of AirComp mutual information (MI),
which was shown to be generalized to the inference accuracy
metric in edge inference systems. To maximize the AirComp
MI, the authors developed a majorization-minimization-based
beamforming method. [11] investigated a broadband AirComp
scenario where different dimensions of local feature were
simultaneously aggregated at multiple subcarriers, thereby
improving communication efficiency. Subsequently, subcarrier
allocation and power control were jointly optimized to reduce
the distortion of reconstructed global features. The authors of
[12] further considered a multi-task edge inference system,
in which MIMO beamforming was optimized to suppress
inter-task interference and facilitate accurate AirComp-based
feature aggregation. Meanwhile, batching was designed to
strategically assemble the global features of different tasks for
parallel inference. It is worth noting that the aforementioned
works all resort to analog AirComp, wherein each agent
linearly modulates local feature values onto the amplitude of
transmission signals, thereby making signal superimposition
equivalent to feature aggregation. Nevertheless, the prevalent
adoption of digital modulation in practical wireless communi-
cation systems poses significant challenges to the deployment
of analog AirComp on existing hardware. Additionally, the
aggregation of analog-modulated features is inherently suscep-
tible to channel impairments, which degrades the reliability of
edge inference.
2) Digital AirComp Designs: To overcome the limitations
of analog AirComp, several early studies have explored digital
AirComp designs. In this line of research, quantization serves
as a fundamental operation that transforms continuous-valued
data into a finite set of discrete levels, which are then mapped
to digitally modulated symbols for over-the-air aggregation.
Reference [13] proposed a one-bit digital aggregation scheme,
in which each agent quantized its data to a single bit us-
ing a sign function, enabling direct mapping to BPSK or
QAM symbols. Afterwards, a majority-vote-based decoder
was employed at the EN to recover the aggregation result via
AirComp. The single bit aggregation was further elaborated
in [14], with additionally design of digital channel coding,
thereby addressing the phase asynchrony issue inherent in
AirComp. To eliminate the need of precise channel estimations
in AirComp, [15] allowed the agents to transmit the quantized
versions of analog data on two subcarrier frequencies, then the
EN detected the aggregation result via non-coherence receiver.
Literature [16] contributed to improving the reliability of Air-
Comp through bit-slicing, where the bit sequence quantizing
an analog value was partitioned into segments, each of which
was modulated using a constellation with small size. Work
in [17] developed a massive digital AirComp scheme, where
a large number of agents could freely transmit their signals
without the permission of the EN. Under this setup, the authors
designed a quantitation codebook for mapping the agents’
analog values into codewords, and proposed a signal detection
algorithm to estimate the number of agents applying each
codeword. However, most existing digital AirComp designs
are limited to scalar quantization, wherein each data value is
independently mapped to a codeword. This incurs substantial
communication overhead when applied to high-dimensional
feature vectors, which often consist of tens of thousands of el-
ements. Incorporating efficient vector quantization techniques
into digital AirComp is still an open question that warrants
further investigation. Moreover, in edge inference systems,
feature elements typically exhibit unequal importance [18],
[19], yet this characteristic is neglected in existing quantization
schemes. Consequently, task-oriented digital AirComp designs
that explicitly aim to enhance inference performance remain
largely unexplored.
3) Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-Aided AirComp:
Conventional AirComp primarily relies on transceiver design
to mitigate the adverse effects of wireless transmission, leaving
the propagation environment, characterized by channel fading
and blockages, largely uncontrollable. Motivated by recent
advances in RIS, a number of studies have explored the addi-
tional degrees of freedom (DoFs) offered by RIS to proactively
reconfigure wireless channels, thereby enhancing AirComp
performance. Paper [20] considered a passive RIS-aided Air-
Comp scenario, and developed a robust design approach for
jointly optimizing AirComp transceiver and RIS reflection
beamforming, thereby minimizing the computation error under
environmental imperfections. In [21], a pair of RISs were
deployed at the agent and EN sides, respectively, for further
reducing the computation error of AirComp. Thereafter, the
passive beamforming matrices of the two RISs were carefully
optimized to coordinate the single- and double-reflection links.
More recently, the RIS-aided AirComp framework has been
extended to incorporate various advanced RIS architectures,
such as active RIS [22], simultaneously transmitting and
reflecting (STAR) RIS [23], and multi-functional RIS [24].
Among these variants, hybrid RIS has emerged as a promising
architecture that comprises both active and passive elements,
thereby enabling simultaneous signal amplification and reflec-
tion while maintaining moderate hardware complexity as well
as power consumption. [25] considered a hybrid RIS-aided
communication network to jointly optimize transceiver beam-
forming at users and base station together with RIS reflection
beamforming, demonstrating significant rate improvements
over fully-passive RIS. The hybrid RIS element allocation
problem for maximizing the ergodic capacity was elaborated
in [26]. Their results revealed that flexible assignment of
active and passive elements could yield additional performance
gains. Different from [25], [26] which leverages hybrid RIS
to enhance communication performance, the integration of
hybrid RIS with digital AirComp induces a sophisticated
tradeoff among channel-induced misalignment error, power
amplification noise, and quantization distortion. This leads
to a completely distinct problem formulation, for which no
dedicated beamforming solution has been reported in the
existing literature.
B. Contributions
To empower communication-efficient feature aggregation
for edge AI inference, this work proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided
Digital AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme that is compatible
with both existing and future mobile systems. We consider a
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS 3
scenario where multiple agents upload local features to an EN
to collaboratively perform the inference task, with a hybrid
RIS deployed to assist the over-the-air feature aggregation
process. The proposed scheme exploits vector quantization
to map each feature block comprising multiple local feature
elements into a quantization codeword, whose index is sub-
sequently employed to select a digitally modulated symbol
sequence for transmission. By utilizing shared quantization
and modulation codebooks across all agents, the waveform
superposition inherent in AirComp can be leveraged to aggre-
gate the quantization codewords at the EN, thereby facilitating
global feature reconstruction. Furthermore, HRD-AirComp
embraces a task-oriented design principle that identifies the
importance levels of different feature elements and jointly
optimizes quantization bit allocation as well as active-passive
beamforming. This enables the preservation of critical features
during transmission and ultimately improves inference accu-
racy. Our main contributions are summarized below.
1) To capture the unequal importance of local feature
elements in edge inference, the proposed HRD-AirComp
scheme partitions each high-dimensional feature vector
into multiple blocks, which are quantized individually
using differentiated codebooks with non-uniform bit
allocation. The digital modulation codebook is then de-
signed with a one-to-one mapping from the quantization
codebook, enabling the EN to reconstruct each aggre-
gated quantized feature block from the received super-
imposed signals across all agents. We present a perfor-
mance analysis of the edge inference system exploiting
HRD-AirComp-based feature aggregation. Leveraging
the widely adopted entropy of posteriors metric, we
derive a rigorous and tractable surrogate function for
inference accuracy. This surrogate not only provides a
closed-form characterization of the impact of distortions
introduced by feature quantization and over-the-air ag-
gregation, but also reveals an explicit feature importance
indicator that can guide subsequent system optimization.
2) Building upon the theoretical analysis, we formulate an
optimization problem that maximizes the surrogate of
inference accuracy by jointly optimizing quantization bit
allocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving
beamforming, and hybrid RIS reflection beamforming.
The intricate coupling among these variables, together
with the non-convex unit-modulus and amplification
power constraints of the hybrid RIS, makes the problem
highly challenging to solve. To this end, we develop
an efficient algorithm that optimizes the four sets of
variables in an alternating manner. Specifically, the bit
allocation is determined using the successive convex ap-
proximation technique, while the transceiver designs at
agents and EN are reformulated into convex optimization
issues via a series of tailored transformations. For the
hybrid RIS reflection beamforming, we propose a low-
complexity iterative method that enables the closed-form
update of both active and passive reflection coefficients.
3) We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the per-
formance of HRD-AirComp in inference tasks including

tion. Experimental results demonstrate the convergence
of the proposed optimization algorithm, as well as
its superior implementation efficiency. The results also
confirm the consistency between the derived surrogate
function and the numerically computed inference ac-
curacy, validating the effectiveness of our theoretical
performance analysis. Besides, by harnessing the per-
formance gains brought by adaptive feature quantization
and hybrid RIS deployment, HRD-AirComp achieves
12.23% to 24.67% improvement in inference accuracy
over state-of-the-art digital AirComp baselines, with
performance close to that of the idealized case, which
assumes perfect feature aggregation.

II. S YSTEM MODEL
Consider an edge inference system designed for intelligent
environmental perception, as illustrated in Fig. 1. There are
K agents (whose set is denoted by K = {1, . . . , k, . . . , K})
acquiring sensory data from distributed viewpoints, which are
subsequently processed at an EN to generate inference results.
During each perception round, each agent k inputs its sensory
data (e.g., images or 3D point clouds) into a light-weight AI
model to extract local features. All local features are then
transmitted wirelessly to the EN, with a hybrid RIS deployed
to assist the feature uploading process. After receiving the
superimposed signals from all agents, the EN reconstructs
global features and performs edge inference. Detailed models
are demonstrated in the following subsections.
A. Inference Model
For each agent k, the features extracted by its local AI
model are signified by a W-dimensional vector fk ∈ RW×1.
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS 4
Afterwards, all feature vectors {fk}K
k=1 undergo an aggrega-
tion process to yield a global feature vector f at the EN.
Consider the popular average aggregation function, we have
f = 1
K
P
k∈K fk in the ideal case. The EN then feeds f into
its edge AI model to obtain the perception results (e.g., the
label of the perceived target).
To address the communication bottleneck caused by high-
dimensional feature uploading, the proposed edge inference
system employs HRD-AirComp to enable efficient feature
aggregation, while being compatible with the widely adopted
digital communication paradigm. The specific operations of
HRD-AirComp will be delineated in Section III, herein we
define some required performance metrics.
Due to the feature quantization and channel distortion in-
herent in HRD-AirComp, the EN reconstructs a global feature
vector ˆf that deviates from f. The feature aggregation error is
defined as e = ˆf − f. Additionally, considering that a broad
class of perception tasks can be formulated as classification
problems, the inference accuracy at the EN is evaluated using
the entropy of posteriors [9], which is written as

where L indicates the number of classification classes, Pr(l|ˆf)
represents the probability that the inference result corresponds
to the l-th class (similar to the output of a softmax classifier
in DNN). Accordingly, H quantifies the uncertainty associ-
ated with the inference result given the reconstructed global
features ˆf.
B. Communication Model
The EN and each agent are equipped with M antennas and
a single antenna, respectively. The hybrid RIS incorporates N
reflecting elements with Na active and Np passive elements,
whose sets are denoted by Na and Np, respectively. Let Φ =
diag (ϕ1, . . . , ϕN ) ∈ CN×N be the reflection matrix of the
hybrid RIS, where ϕn represents the reflection coefficient of
element n. Since both the amplitudes and phases of the active
elements can be adjusted, whereas the passive elements are
only capable of controlling the phase shifts, we have
ϕn =
|ϕn|ejαn, n∈ Na,
ejαn, n ∈ Np, (2)
where αn ∈ [0, 2π) denotes the phase shift of element n. To
facilitate subsequent expressions, we decompose Φ into

III. HRD-A IRCOMP -BASED FEATURE AGGREGATION
SCHEME
The operations of the proposed HRD-AirComp scheme
are illustrated in Fig. 2 and elaborated in this section. The
key innovation lies in the seamless integration of vector
quantization and digital modulation into AirComp. Rather than
directly aggregating analog values, the scheme leverages wave-
form superposition to support the aggregation of quantization
codewords. Furthermore, we emphasize that HRD-AirComp
serves as a general approach for over-the-air data computation
in digital communication systems, with this work focusing on
its application to feature aggregation in edge inference.
A. Vector Quantization
At each agent k, the W-dimensional feature vector fk is
divided into T blocks of length D, represented by fT
k =
[fT
k,1, . . . ,fT
k,T ] with fk,t ∈ RD×1 indicating the t-th block,
and we have W = T D. Each block, say fk,t, is further
decomposed into its norm βk,t = ∥fk,t∥ and normalization
vk,t = fk,t/∥fk,t∥. Owing to the scalar βk,t can be conveyed
through the amplitude of the transmission signal, we concen-
trate on the quantization of vector vk,t in the sequel.
Since vk,t is a unit vector uniformly distributed over the
hypersphere in RD×1, it defines a one-dimensional subspace
that resides on the Grassmannian manifold G (1, D) [27].
Consequently, vk,t can be quantized using a Grassmannian
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS 5
codebook Qt ∈ RD×It, with It being the codebook size.
Given that different feature dimensions contribute unequally
to edge inference, the bit allocation across quantization code-
books corresponding to different blocks is non-uniform. Let B
denote the total number of available bits, and Bt is the number
of bits assigned to codebook Qt, such that It = 2 Bt andPT
t=1 Bt = B. Note that {Bt}T
t=1 are optimization variables
and will be designed to enhance inference accuracy in Section
V . With given Bt, the corresponding codebook Qt can be
optimized using the Lloyd algorithm in offline [28], which
iteratively updates clusters on G (1, D). The resulting cluster
centroids form the quantization codewords of Qt.
Subsequently, Qt is shared by all agents to quantize
{vk,t}K
k=1. For each agent k, let vk,t be quantized into the
˜i-th codeword in Qt with the minimum distance, i.e.,
˜i = arg min
i∈{1,...,It}
vk,t − [Qt]:,i
. (5)
We then define a It -dimensional binary vector xk,t, in which
[xk,t]˜i = 1, and the other It − 1 elements are zero. As such,
the quantized version of vk,t is given by Qtxk,t.
B. Digital Modulation
After obtaining the quantization codeword, each agent
modulates it into a transmission sequence. To this end, we
introduce a modulation codebook Pt ∈ CJ×It shared by all
agents, where each column represents a sequence of length J,
and a one-to-one mapping exists between the It columns of Pt
and those of Qt. To be specific, if block vk,t is quantized into
[Qt]:,˜i, then it is modulated as sequence [Pt]:,˜i. Notably, the
sequences in Pt can be generated based on standard digital
modulation constellations, ensuring that the proposed HRD-
AirComp scheme is highly compatible with current commu-
nication systems [29]. By multiplying the selected sequence
with block norm βk,t, the transmission signal of each agent k
can be expressed as sk,t = βk,tPtxk,t.
C. Feature Aggregation and Reconstruction
Given {sk,t}K
k=1, the EN aims to compute st =P
k∈K sk,t = Pt
P
k∈K βk,txk,t via AirComp. We then de-
fine xt = P
k∈K βk,txk,t, and it can be seen that its i-th
element [xt]i equals P
k∈Ki
βk,t, with Ki denoting the set of
agents which quantize their block normalizations {vk,t}k∈Ki
into codeword [Qt]:,i. In practice, the EN first observes the
received signal yt in (4), which serves as an estimation of
st, then detects xt using the known modulation codebook
Pt. The detection result of xt at the EN is expressed as ˆ xt.
To ensure that ˆ xt closely approximates xt, it is essential to
jointly design the agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving
beamforming, and hybrid RIS reflection beamforming. A
received signal processing algorithm should be also considered
to detect xt, which will be elaborated in Section V .
Thereafter, the average of the t-th feature blocks of all
agents, i.e., ft = 1

IV. T HEORETICAL ANALYSIS ON INFERENCE ACCURACY
WITH HRD-A IRCOMP
In this section, we theoretically analyze the inference per-
formance of the proposed system exploiting HRD-AirComp-
based feature aggregation. Given the intractable form of the
inference accuracy metric H, the analysis proceeds in two
main steps: characterizing the distribution of reconstructed
global features, and designing reasonable surrogate function
for H. The resulting insights offer theoretical guidance for
the system optimization in Section V .
We commence by introducing some commonly adopted
assumptions in inference performance analysis.
Assumption 1: The error-free version of the global feature
vector, f, follows a Gaussian mixture distribution as below [9]
f ∼ 1
L
LX
l=1
N (µl, C), (7)
where µl = [µl,1, . . . , µl,W ]T ∈ RW×1 denotes the centroid
of the l-th class, C = diag (c1, . . . , cW ) ∈ RW×W is the
diagonal covariance matrix.
Assumption 2: The EN detects xt from a noised observation
yt, and the detection mean square error (MSE) is determined
by the computational MSE between yt and the desired result
st, namely E
h
∥ˆ xt − xt∥2
i
= ηE
h
∥yt − st∥2
i
with η being
a constant [17].
Assumption 3: Since all agents extract local features from
a shared data source, the transmission signals, modulated
from their quantized features, are inherently correlated. Such
correlations can be characterized by a matrix U ∈ RK×K,
whose (k, k′)-th entry is given by [12]
uk,k′ = 1
J E
h
(Ptxk,t)HPtxk′,t
i
, ∀t. (8)
Hence, uk,k′ indicates the correlation between the selected
sequences of agent k and k′, while J is used for normalizing
uk,k′ ∈ [0, 1].
Assumption 4: The block norms of all agents are upper
bounded by E[βk,t] ≤ β, ∀k, t[19].
A. Distribution of Reconstructed Global Features
To calculate the probabilities Pr(l|ˆf), ∀l in the entropy of
posteriors H in (1), we need to derive the distribution of the
reconstructed global feature vector ˆf. Based on the operations
of HRD-AirComp, we first characterize the feature aggregation
error e = ˆf − f as follows.
Theorem 1: Under Assumption 2-4, the aggregation MSE
of the t-th block, E[∥ˆft − ft∥

First, the overall error comprises three components: misalign-
ment error, channel noise, and quantization distortion. The
first two components are common in conventional analog
AirComp [20], whereas the third arises from the distortion
introduced by vector quantization and digital modulation.
Second, traditional AirComp typically assumes independent
transmission signals across agents [23], which is not hold in
edge inference systems. To account for the feature correlations,
the misalignment error in HRD-AirComp incorporates inter-
agent coupling, making it more intricate than in conventional
AirComp. Third, the deployment of hybrid RIS can enhance
the agent-EN channels, but also incur additional channel noise.
This calls for the judicious design of active and passive
reflection coefficients at the hybrid RIS to fully exploit its per-
formance gains. Fourth, quantization bit allocation introduces
a tradeoff, i.e., increasing Bt reduces the quantization error for
the t-th block, but also amplifies both the misalignment error
and channel noise. Therefore, {Bt}T
t=1 should be carefully
allocated to protect the important features.
Afterwards, leveraging the central limit theorem [30], the
feature aggregation error e can be approximated as a Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and variance

whose (w, w)-th entry is represented by ce

the following corollary to characterize the distribution of the
reconstructed global features.

the reconstructed global feature vector ˆf follows a Gaussian

Proof: According to the definition ˆf = f + e, the l-th
component of ˆf is expressed as the summation of independent
Gaussian vectors, with mean µl and variance C + Ce. By
averaging all the L components, we can obtain (11). This
completes the proof. ■
The distribution of ˆf lays a foundation for further deducing
the inference accuracy, as elaborated in the next subsection.
B. Surrogate Function for Inference Accuracy
Given the inference accuracy metric, i.e., the entropy of
posteriors H in (1), we establish the following theorem to
provide a rigorous lower bound.
1The Appendix A-B is available in our online supplemental material at
https://pan.baidu.com/s/14a612j1oKCVpYTSBfzSv5w?pwd=sykx

L(L−1)
P
l<l′≤L Gl,l′.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix B, available online. ■
Remark 2: Theorem 2 yields two key observations. First,
the lower bound of H is determined by {Gl,l′} and G, both
of which possess clear geometric interpretations. Specifically,
Gl,l′ quantifies the distance between the centroids of class pair
(l, l′), normalized by the covariance. A larger Gl,l′ indicates
that the two classes are more distinguishable in the feature
space. G represents the average of {Gl,l′} across all class
pairs, thus capturing the overall class separability given the
reconstructed global features. Second, the lower bound of
H is shown to be monotonically decreasing with respect to
(w.r.t.) G, implying that increasing G leads to lower inference
uncertainty and thus higher accuracy. As a consequence, G
serves as a tractable surrogate for the original metric H.
To this end, we rewrite G as follows, which offers a task-
oriented objective for system optimization.

Here, ρw = P
l<l′≤L (µl,w − µl′,w)2/L (L − 1) can be inter-
preted as an importance indicator for the w-th feature dimen-
sion. It is desirable to allocate more resources to suppress the
variance ce
w of dimensions with larger ρw, thereby enhancing
the class separability G and ultimately improving the edge
inference accuracy.
V. J OINT FEATURE QUANTIZATION AND ACTIVE -PASSIVE
BEAMFORMING DESIGN
Building on the surrogate for inference accuracy established
in the preceding section, we now aim to maximize this
surrogate by developing a joint optimization algorithm for
feature quantization and active-passive beamforming design.
A. Problem Formulation and Transformation
With the objective of maximizing G in (13), the problem for
jointly optimizing quantization bit allocation {Bt}T
t=1, agent
transmission coefficients {νk}K
k=1, EN receiving beamforming

≤ PR, (14f)
where constraint (14b) limits the total available number of
bits. (14c) indicates the transmission power constraint with
PA being agent power budget. (14d) restricts the phase shift
at the hybrid RIS. (14e) demonstrates that the passive elements
should satisfy unit-modulus constraints. In (14f), the amplifi-
cation power of the hybrid RIS is not higher than its power
budget PR.
To cope with the complex optimization objective in (14a)
in the form of summation over multiple fractional func-
tions, we introduce auxiliary variables {λw}W
w=1 with λw =
ρw
cw+cew
, ∀w, and transform P1 into
P2 : max
{Bt}T
t=1,{νk}K
k=1,b,Φ,{λw}W

WX
w=1
λw, (15a)
s.t. ce
w ≤ ρw
λw
− cw, ∀w, (15b)
(14b) ∼ (14f),
where the equality in constraint (15b) must hold at the optimal
solution of P1, otherwise we can increase λw to enlarge the
objective value, thus the transformation does not impact the
optimality. However, solving P2 remains challenging due to
the strong coupling between quantization bit allocation and
high-dimensional beamforming variables, as well as the cor-
relation among agents’ transmission signals. Additionally, the
hybrid RIS imposes both unit-modulus constraint at its passive
elements as well as amplification power constraint at active
elements, making the reflection beamforming design more
complicated than that in conventional RIS-aided AirComp.
To tackle these challenges, we decompose P2 into four
subproblems, which optimizes bit allocation {Bt}T
t=1, trans-
mission coefficients {νk}K
k=1, receiving beamforming b, and
reflection beamforming Φ in an alternative fashion. For ease
of discerning, the variables with bar, e.g., ¯νk, means that they
are obtained from the previous iteration.
B. Quantization Bit Allocation Optimization
The subproblem for determining {Bt}T

KD . It can be ob-
served that the exponential functions in the left-hand-side
(LHS) of (16b) are convex, whereas the convexity of the right-
hand-side (RHS) results in that the constraint is non-convex.
To this end, we use the first-order Taylor expansion to provide
a lower bound of the RHS, i.e.,
ρw
λw
− cw ≥ −ρw
¯λ2w
λw + 2ρw
¯λw
− cw. (17)
By substituting (17) into (16b), SP1 becomes a standard con-
vex optimization issue that can be addressed via interior-point
method (IPM). Thereafter, we round {Bt}T
t=1 into integer
values for satisfying their physical meanings.
C. Transmission Coefficient Optimization
To handle the inter-agent coupling induced by feature cor-
relations, we propose to alternatively update the transmission
coefficient of each agent k, then the subproblem for optimizing
νk is expressed as

observe that the objective in (18a) and the LHSs of
constraints (18b)-(18c) are all quadratic functions w.r.t. νk,
hence SP2(k) is convex and can be directly solved via IPM.
To gain more insights, we consider a special case in which
the feature correlations among agents do not exist, namely
uk,k′ = 0, ∀k ̸= k′ and uk,k = 1, ∀k, then the transmission
coefficient optimization subproblem reduces to

optimizing b is recast as

Evidently, SP3 is an unconstrained convex optimization
problem, and we can derive the optimal receiving
beamforming by setting the first derivative of the objective
function to zero. Then, we have
Πb − ω = 0 ⇒ b = Π−1ω. (22)
After performing beamforming to obtain received signal yt,
the EN should execute a signal processing algorithm to detect
xt, thereby completing global feature reconstruction via (6).
For equation yt = Ptxt, the column number of Pt, It, may
exceed the row number J, as vector quantization generally
demands a large number of bits to ensure high precision [19].
Fortunately, such an underdetermined equation can be solved
by exploiting the sparsity of xt. Specifically, the number of
non-zero elements in xt is no greater than agent number K,
and thus much smaller than the dimensionality It, rendering
xt highly sparse. Consequently, to recover xt from yt, the EN
can apply any compressive sensing algorithm, e.g., stagewise
weak orthogonal matching pursuit (SWOMP) used in our
experiments [31].

Although SP4.1 can be handled by semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) by converting the variable into ˜D = ˜d˜dH with

, the computational complexity is prohibit, i.e.,
O((N + 1)7), for directly optimizing matrix ˜D [21], [32].
Towards this end, we propose a low-complexity iterative
approach in the sequel, enabling efficient update of all
variables in closed-form.
We observe that d is uniquely determined by two fac-
tors, i.e., amplitude matrix of active elements Λa =

from (26) that the optimal α is updated as
αn = [¯ r2]n/|[¯ r2]n|, ∀n. (27)
By substituting (27) into (26), whilst defining qΛa ∈ RNa×1
as the vector acquired by stacking the Na non-zero diagonal

mining qΛa .

be obtained through the KKT condition, given by

To summarize, the RIS reflection beamforming is optimized
by alternatively updating α, qΛa , and d via (27), (29), and
(26), respectively, and the procedure continues until the dif-
ference of the objective value (24a) in two adjacent iterations
is sufficiently small.

simulation, agent-EN, agent-RIS, and RIS-EN links possess
different parameters {ϑAE, ϑAR, ϑRE} and {χAE, χAR, χRE}, as

two representative types of inference tasks:
1) Linear Classification on Gaussian Mixture Dataset: The
global features f are sampled from a Gaussian mixture dis-

L
PL
l=1 N (µl, C) with dimension W = 100 and
class number L = 20 . The local features are generated by

F = 0 .5. After obtaining the reconstructed
features ˆf, the EN calculates the classification result as
arg min
l
(ˆf − µl)T(C + σ2
F IW )−1(ˆf −µl). We set the number
of agents K = 24 and available quantization bits B = 40 in
default.
2) Multi-View Object Recognition on ModelNet Dataset: In
this kind of task, K = 12 agents collect multi-view images
of a common object, and the EN aims to classify the object
from L = 40 classes. We train a lightweight MobileNet-v2
on the ModelNet dataset, and deploy the layers before the
linear classifier at each agent for feature extraction [34]. The
resultant feature dimension W is 1280, and the number of
bits is set as B = 512 . The EN feeds the reconstructed ˆf
into the linear classifier to obtain the classification result. The
inference accuracies presented in Section VI-C are on the test
data of ModelNet.
Moreover, we employ the Lloyd algorithm [28] to design
the Grassmannian codebook {Qt} based on the optimized
bit allocation. The elements of the modulation codebook
{Pt} are drawn from complex Bernoulli distribution, i.e.,

[31], primarily due to its advantage of not requiring prior
knowledge on the sparsity level.
The following baselines are invoked for comparison:
1) Massive Digital (MD)-AirComp [17]: This state-of-the-
art digital AirComp scheme employs a common codebook,
optimized using the K-means++ algorithm, to quantize all
feature blocks with uniform bit allocation. Moreover, due to
the absence of theoretical analysis on the inference perfor-
mance in [17], truncated channel inversion and minimum-MSE
beamforming are adopted by agents and EN during over-the-
air feature aggregation, respectively. Meanwhile, hybrid RIS
deployment is not considered in this scheme.
2) One-Bit Digital Aggregation (OBDA) [13]: In this
scheme, each dimension of the local feature vector is quantized
using a single bit, where the sign is mapped to a BPSK symbol
for transmission. The EN reconstructs the aggregated feature
vector by extracting the sign of the received signal. This
scheme adopts the same design for transmission coefficients
and receiving beamforming as in MD-AirComp.
3) Full Power Transmission: Each agent leverages the
full power budget to transmit signals by setting νk =q
PA
β2J e−j∠¯hT
k¯b, ∀k, whilst the other optimization variables,
i.e., bit allocation, receiving beamforming, and RIS reflection,
are optimized by our JQAPB algorithm.
4) SDR+Gaussian [21], [32]: This baseline replaces the
RIS reflection optimization in JQAPB with an SDR-based
method. Concretely, SP4.1 is solved by optimizing the
(N + 1) × (N + 1) matrix ˜D followed by recovering a rank-
one solution via Gaussian randomization. To ensure satisfac-
tory performance, 10 4 random vectors are generated during
the randomization process.
5) Perfect Feature Aggregation (PFA): This benchmark
assumes that the transmission signals of all agents are per-
fectly aggregated at the EN, free from both misalignment

B. Performance Evaluation for Linear Classification
Fig. 3 illustrates the convergence behavior of the proposed
JQAPB algorithm. Specifically, Fig. 3 (a) presents the conver-
gence of the outer iteration, where the four sets of variables are
optimized in an alternating fashion. It can be observed that for
different values of the agent number K, the surrogate function
G increases monotonically and converges within 10 outer
iterations. Fig. 3 (b) further verifies the convergence of the
inner iteration for optimizing the RIS reflection beamforming.
We can see that the achieved objective value of SP4.1 is
consistently lower than that obtained by SDR+Gaussian. This
is because the proposed iterative approach leverages closed-
form expressions to update the amplitude and phase shift
of the hybrid RIS, thereby yielding higher-quality locally
optimal solution compared to those recovered via Gaussian
randomization.
In addition, Table II compares the implementation time
of different RIS reflection beamforming methods for solving
SP4.1. Compared to SDR+Gaussian, the proposed iterative
approach reduces the implementation time by approximately
two orders of magnitude. This significant reduction in com-
putational complexity is attributed to the fact that our method
involves only arithmetic operations, avoiding the optimization
of high-dimensional matrices and the generation of numerous
random vectors required in SDR+Gaussian. Furthermore, as

the number of RIS elements N increases, the runtime of
our approach remains moderate, while that of SDR+Gaussian
becomes prohibitively high.
Subsequently, we investigate the necessity of incorporating
transmission signal correlations (as elaborated in Assumption
3) into the AirComp beamforming design. We consider two
estimations on the correlation matrix U, where Estimation 1
sets U = ϵ1K×K +(1 − ϵ) IK with ϵ being an empirical value
on the degree of correlation. Notably, existing schemes often
assume independent transmission signals, corresponding to the
case of ϵ = 0 [20]–[24]. In Estimation 2, U is approximated
based on the correlation among agents’ local features, i.e.,
uk,k′ = 1
W
PW
w=1 [˜fk]w[˜fk′]w, ∀k, k′, where ˜fk is normalized
from fk [12]. It should be emphasized that Estimation 2 serves
only as a performance baseline, as it relies on knowledge of
the local features, which are not available in practice.
Fig. 4 displays that the normalized aggregation MSE, calcu-
lated by 10 lg

, increases with the variance of
feature extraction noise σ2
F , and the minimum MSE is achieved
by different values of ϵ under varying σ2
F . More specifically,
when σ2
F < 1, the local features exhibit strong correlation, and
setting ϵ = 0.6 yields a close approximation to Estimation 2,
resulting in low aggregation MSE. In contrast, Estimation 1
with ϵ = 0 , which neglects signal correlation, suffers from
high MSE in the low- σ2
F region and only becomes effective
when σ2
F is sufficiently large. These observations demonstrate
that the proposed beamforming design offers a more general
approach compared to [20]–[24], as it accommodates varying
degrees of feature correlation in edge inference systems.
Furthermore, Fig. 4 suggests that Estimation 1 with ϵ = 0.6
performs best under our default setting σ2
F = 0 .5, which is
therefore adopted in the subsequent simulations.
Fig. 5 showcases the inference accuracy of linear classifi-
cation under varying values of J and B. On the one hand,
increasing the available quantization bit B leads to a smaller
accuracy gap between PFA and ideal edge inference . The
rational is that a larger B allows each local feature block
to be quantized with higher precision, thereby reducing the
distortion in the aggregated global features. On the other
hand, we observe a performance gap between JQAPB and
PFA, attributed to the imperfections in over-the-air feature
aggregation under practical wireless channels. Interestingly,
this gap gradually diminishes as the transmission sequence
length J increases, whilst a higher J is required to reduce
the gap when B is large. This phenomenon can be explained
by that the detection performance of compressive sensing
improves with the number of observations (i.e., the length of
the received signal yt), but more observations are needed when
the dimension of the signal to be recovered ( xt) increases.
Nevertheless, increasing J and B leads to higher communi-
cation overhead and larger codebook sizes, which should be
judiciously balanced against the desired inference accuracy.
Fig. 6 depicts the curves of the surrogate function G, en-
tropy of posterior H, and inference accuracy versus number of
agents K. One can observe that with the increment of K, both
G and the accuracy rise, while the classification uncertainty
represented by H decreases, indicating enhanced inference
performance. This improvement is owing to the availability
of more diverse viewpoints provided by a larger number of
agents, which collectively help suppress feature extraction
noise. The consistency between G and accuracy coincides with
Theorem 2, corroborating that G is an effective surrogate for
characterizing inference performance. Additionally, the pro-
posed JQAPB algorithm outperforms MD-AirComp, OBDA,
full power transmission, and SDR+Gaussian by 4.48%, 5.82%,
2.74%, and 1.29% in enhancing the inference accuracy, respec-
tively. This is because that our scheme allocates quantization
bits to different feature blocks based on their importance indi-
cators, thereby better preserving local features that contribute
more to edge inference. Meanwhile, JQAPB leverages a hybrid
RIS to assist feature uploading and adaptively adjusts the
active-passive beamforming to align the agent-EN channels,
enabling accurate global feature reconstruction in the pres-
ence of communication errors. Furthermore, and the inference
accuracy of JQAPB is 0.84% and 6.85% lower than PFA and
ideal edge inference, respectively, indicating that quantization
distortion is the dominant limiting factor under the current
setting. Nevertheless, this effect can be mitigated by increasing
B, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.
C. Performance Evaluation for Multi-View Object Recognition
This subsection presents the experimental results for multi-
view object recognition task. Although the features extracted
by MobileNet-v2 (or, more broadly, common DNNs) may not
strictly follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we can exploit
the training set feature vectors to fit such a distribution. Fig.

(chair, table and sofa), along with their fitted centroids. Obvi-
ously, these classes are more distinguishable in dimensions
w = 1 , 2 than w = 4 , which aligns with the importance
indicator relationship ρ1 > ρ2 > ρ4. Since the derived
surrogate function G captures the varying importance across
feature dimensions and quantifies the overall class separability
in the feature space, enhancing G leads to improved inference
accuracy. Consequently, the proposed theoretical framework
and JQAPB algorithm are readily applicable to general DNN-
enabled inference tasks, whose performance are evaluated in
the sequel.
Fig. 8 elucidates the inference accuracy of object recogni-
tion versus K. Similar to the linear classification results in Fig.
6, the accuracy increases with K, and the proposed JQAPB
approach outperforms most benchmark methods. Specifically,
JQAPB achieves inference accuracy that is 12.23%, 24.67%,
5.77%, and 3.39% higher than those of MD-AirComp, OBDA,
full power transmission , and SDR+Gaussian, respectively.
Meanwhile, its accuracy is only 0.51% and 3.33% lower than
PFA and ideal edge inference . Notably, the performance gap
caused by feature quantization is smaller than that observed
in linear classification. This suggests that in DNN-based
inference, a small number of important features tends to
dominate the inference outcome, thus mitigating the impact
of quantization.
The curves of inference accuracy versus agent power budget
PA is plotted in Fig. 9. The proposed JQAPB is capable of
flexibly adjusting the agent transmission coefficients, so as to
compensate for the misalignment error during feature aggre-
gation. As a result, it effectively harnesses the performance
gains brought by increased power budget, achieving inference
accuracy close to that of PFA and ideal edge inference, whilst
outperforming other benchmark methods.

urations on inference accuracy. In Fig. 10 (a), we vary the total

number of RIS elements N, while setting the number of active
elements as Na = ⌊N/8⌋. The results show that the inference
accuracy increases with N, owing to the enhanced spatial
DoFs for improving the feature uploading channels. However,
the accuracy saturates when N becomes sufficiently large, as
the limited amplification power of the RIS PR emerges as the
performance bottleneck.
In Fig. 10 (b), we fix N = 64 and change Na, where
Na = 0 and 64 correspond to a fully-passive RIS and a fully-
active RIS, respectively. When PR = 18 dBm, the inference
accuracy monotonically decreases with Na, indicating that the
fully-passive RIS yields the best performance in low power
regine. This is because the square-order beamforming gain
provided by the passive elements dominates the contribution
of power amplification. In contrast, fully-active RIS realizes
the highest accuracy when PR = 28 dBm, as the ample
power budget allows the active elements to fully leverage their
amplification capability. Furthermore, at a moderate power
budget of PR = 23 dBm, hybrid RIS with Na = 16 strikes a
good balance between passive beamforming and active power
amplification, thereby outperforming other types of RISs. In
conclusion, the proposed JQAPB offers a generalized RIS
reflection beamforming approach that can flexibly adapt to
various RIS configurations.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed the HRD-AirComp scheme to
enable communication-efficient feature aggregation in multi-
agent collaborative edge inference systems. A key advantage
of the proposed scheme lies in its compatibility with existing
digital communication infrastructures, achieved by employing
vector quantization to map each feature block into a discrete
codeword, which is then used to select a corresponding trans-
mission sequence from the modulation codebook. In addition,
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS 13
HRD-AirComp incorporates task-oriented feature quantization
and active-passive beamforming design. Specifically, based on
the derived closed-form surrogate function for inference accu-
racy, the JQAPB algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the
quantization bit allocation, AirComp transceivers at the agents
and EN, as well as the hybrid RIS reflection beamforming.
Our theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal that:
1) HRD-AirComp realizes effective preservation of critical
features during transmission by quantizing feature blocks with
differentiated codebooks and adaptively allocated bits. 2) The
deployment of hybrid RIS enhances inference performance, as
it proactively reconfigures the over-the-air feature aggregation
process through simultaneous signal amplification and reflec-
tion. 3) Thanks to the closed-form updates of optimization
variables, JQAPB achieves significantly higher implementa-
tion efficiency compared to traditional SDR-based methods.
4) In real-world object recognition tasks, the proposed scheme
improves inference accuracy by 12.23% to 24.67% over exist-
ing baselines, with a performance gap of only 0.51% relative to
the idealized PFA case. As HRD-AirComp provides a general
framework for over-the-air data computation within digital
communication systems, future work will explore its broader
applicability to other edge AI scenarios, such as federated
learning/fine-tuning and distributed consensus.

of the mean square feature aggregation error in Theorem 1.
This completes the proof.
