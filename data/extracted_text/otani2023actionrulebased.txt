Introduction: The human brain can flexibly modify behavioral rules to optimize 
task performance (speed and accuracy) by minimizing cognitive load. To show 
this flexibility, we propose an action-rule-based cognitive control (ARC) model. 
The ARC model was based on a stochastic framework consistent with an active 
inference of the free energy principle, combined with schematic brain network 
systems regulated by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), to develop 
several hypotheses for demonstrating the validity of the ARC model.
Methods: A step-motion Simon task was developed involving congruence or 
incongruence between important symbolic information (illustration of a foot 
labeled “L” or “R,” where “L” requests left and “R” requests right foot movement) 
and irrelevant spatial information (whether the illustration is actually of a left or 
right foot). We made predictions for behavioral and brain responses to testify to 
the theoretical predictions.
Results: Task responses combined with event-related deep-brain activity (ER-
DBA) measures demonstrated a key contribution of the dACC in this process 
and provided evidence for the main prediction that the dACC could reduce the 
Shannon surprise term in the free energy formula by internally reversing the 
irrelevant rapid anticipatory postural adaptation. We also found sequential effects 
with modulated dip depths of ER-DBA waveforms that support the prediction 
that repeated stimuli with the same congruency can promote remodeling of the 
internal model through the information gain term while counterbalancing the 
surprise term.
Discussion: Overall, our results were consistent with experimental predictions, 
which may support the validity of the ARC model. The sequential effect 
accompanied by dip modulation of ER-DBA waveforms suggests that cognitive 
cost is saved while maintaining cognitive performance in accordance with the 
framework of the ARC based on 1-bit congruency-dependent selective control.

1 Introduction
1.1 General background
The selection of information important for appropriate goal-
directed behaviors while ignoring irrelevant interfering or conflicting 
information is an essential cognitive skill. Under laboratory 
conditions, this capacity is often measured using Simon tasks, 
stimulus–response conflict (SRC) tasks where subjects are asked to 
produce relevant responses consistent with presented symbol 
information while suppressing irrelevant responses consistent with 
location (spatial) information when location and symbol information 
are incompatible (Simon, 1969; Lu and Proctor, 1995; Leuthold, 2011; 
Welch and Seitz, 2013). During the Simon task, irrelevant location-
consistent responses are produced automatically prior to relevant 
symbol-consistent responses (Ivanoff, 2003; Bardi et al., 2015). Hence, 
the irrelevant responses must be suppressed for correct performance, 
resulting in response conflict (Hübner and Mishra, 2013). However, 
this conflict resolution mechanism enhances the cognitive load, which 
can lead to mental fatigue and performance errors ( Marcora et al., 
2009; Hornsby, 2013; Van Cutsem et al., 2017 ; Benoit et al., 2019 ; 
Díaz-García et al., 2021; Salomone et al., 2021).
One potential mechanism for reducing the cognitive load imposed 
by conflict monitoring is stimulus–response (SR) mapping for 
automatic goal-directed responses. It is well-known that effortful 
cognitive processing can be  replaced under certain conditions by 
automatic processing (Schneider and Chein, 2003; Grossi and Coch, 
2005; Verbruggen and Logan, 2009; D’ Angelo et al., 2013; Spruyt and 
De Houwer, 2017; Anderson, 2018; Norris et al., 2018; Fabio et al., 
2019), including through heuristics (Shah and Oppenheimer, 2008; 
Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011; Korn and Bach, 2018; Meinert and 
Krämer, 2022), for cost-saving while still maintaining relevant task 
goals. This transfer is supported by the highly flexible medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ( Conen and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015 ; 
Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015; Klein-Flügge et al., 2016; Rich 
and Wallis, 2016; Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017 ; Ballesta and 
Padoa-Schioppa, 2019; Shi et al., 2022). A simple selection-rule-based 
cognitive processing scheme based on relevant SR mapping is an 
example. As the map is temporarily stored in the inferior frontal 
gyrus, the response to a Simon stimulus is automatically guided to the 
task goal without cognitive computations. This simple scheme has 
been formulated mathematically as the Theory of Event Coding 
(Hommel et al., 2001; Hommel, 2019), and numerous studies have 
provided evidence for the Theory of Event Coding in conflict 
adaptation (Clayson and Larson, 2011 ; Larson et  al., 2011 , 2012; 
Clawson et al., 2013; Duthoo et al., 2014; Huber-Huber and Ansorge, 
2018). However, it is still debated whether conflict adaptation works 
in actual conflict tasks ( Chen et  al., 2009 ; Schmidt et  al., 2015 ; 
Schmidt, 2019) when the tendency for irrelevant responses is strong, 
or whether these irrelevant responses must still be  suppressed by 
conflict monitoring.
1.2 Proposal of action-rule-based cognitive 
control (ARC)
Here, we  propose a novel action-rule-based cognitive control 
(ARC) model as an alternative to the conventional conflict adaptation 
framework for executing SRC tasks. In this model, the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex (dACC) acts as a primary conductor by integrating 
the outputs of intrinsic large-scale networks such as the salience, 
central executive, and default-mode networks (Bressler and Menon, 
2010; Schulz et  al., 2011 ; Sheth et  al., 2012 ; Lanius et  al., 2015 ; 
Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Aben et al., 2020). 
This study aimed to investigate whether conflict resolution can 
be accomplished in accordance with the model. To this end, we started 
by explaining the ARC model in detail, followed by hypotheses and 
predictions based on a conventional neural network model to 
understand how the ARC model is reflected in the actual brain, finally 
using a simple computational model for making quantitative 
predictions to evaluate experimental data.
1.2.1 Concept of the ARC model
In general, the Simon task is distinguished from other 
conflict tasks ( Kleinsorge, 2021 ) by dimensional overlap and 
taxonomy ( Kornblum, 1994 ; Scerrati et al., 2017 ). The Simon 
task generates a dimensional overlap between two response sets 
and the task-irrelevant stimulus location dimension. This 
dimensional overlap causes a SRC. The Theory of Event Coding 
based on stimulus–response mapping is expected to efficiently 
resolve the SRC ( Hommel et al., 2001 ; Hommel, 2019 ); however, 
the effect of SR mapping may be disrupted by fast, task-irrelevant 
responses to stimulus location. Here, we propose an ARC model 
that utilizes location-relevant responses ( Figure  1A ). Simon 
stimuli include symbols and locations that define four stimulus 
types. We assumed that Simon stimuli can be simply categorized 
as congruent or incongruent ( Ashby and Spiering, 2004 ; 
Poldrack and Rodriguez, 2004 ; Poldrack and Foerde, 2008 ). 
Location-relevant responses are promptly guided to the task goal 
if adequately adapted based on the simple rule that responses are 
horizontally reversed for the incongruent condition but 
non-reversed for the congruent condition. This simple rule 
yields a novel task set accompanied by a category–action rule 
map. Figure 1B  shows a practical implementation of the ARC 
model. The task-irrelevant response generated by the 
incongruent Simon stimulus is promptly corrected based on the 
category–action map and then executed. Such cognitive control 
relies on the confidence that the category–action rule will guide 
automatic responses to the task goal, thereby avoiding SRC and 
reducing cognitive load (cost saving).
Moreover, the informational entropy is reduced from 2 bits 
(location [right/left] × symbol [R/L]) to 1 bit (congruent/incongruent). 
The generation of automatic location-relevant responses assists in this 
information entropy reduction. Specifically, an impulsive response to 
the location information of the presented stimulus causes a reduce in 
the information-entropy in SR mapping. According to information 
theory (Shannon, 1948), the processing cost reduction, as evaluated 
by information entropy reduction, is
 
H pp
i
ii=− ∑ log,
 
(1)
where pi is the occurrence probability.
Given that the degrees of freedom decrease from 4 to 2 by 
categorization, the reduction in processing cost for determining the 
goal-relevant state, as evaluated by the entropy reduction, is
Otani et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1239207
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org
 log 2,H∆= −  (2)
where the occurrence probability of the final state is assumed to 
be unity.
The ARC model is completely conceptual and practically relies on 
the confidence based on metacognitive knowledge gained via 
experience, as there are no explicit goal representations. Therefore, 
we  need to verify whether the model is consistent with 
neurophysiological observations.
Extending this cost-saving effect, we propose that the action rule 
can avoid the expansion of category × response combinations in 
conventional SR maps (Iyengar and Lepper, 2000; Reutskaja et al., 
2018), thereby reducing the cognitive processing costs associated 
with mapped memories. Further, our model promotes dynamic 
regulation between impulsive and strategic cognitive control for 
achieving the best effort during tasks. This could allow highly 
accurate ballistic cognitive control beyond the speed versus accuracy 
trade-off ( Herz et  al., 2017 ; Vandierendonck, 2021; Mittelstädt 
et al., 2022).
1.2.2 Computational framework for simulating 
the ARC model
We here provide a simple computational framework for 
developing the ARC model, which is necessary for experimentally 
demonstrating the validity of the ARC model with an appropriate 
Simon task. In the Simon task, the stimuli provide not only visual 
ambiguity from congruency between spatial and symbolic 
information but also temporal ambiguity from the sequence 
structure consisting of randomly allocated incongruent and 
congruent trials. We  here present a framework based on the 
stochastic modeling of the brain, which refers to the free energy 
principle (FEP) ( Friston, 2010 ).
This framework utilizes two vectors for expressing the right and 
left responses as
φ ζ =() = 


0 1
0  (right) and φ ζ =() = 


1 0
1  (left), (3)
where ζ is the parameter representing right (0) and left (1). A 
matrix operator is introduced as
 
1 01 .10
− Ψ=Ψ =   
(4)
This operator simply provides the following reversible relationship
 φ ψφ φψ φ01 10() = () () = (),.  (5)
We further introduced a scalar parameter θ for expressing 
congruency as θ = 0 for congruence and θ = 1 for incongruence. 
Using the above formula, Figure  2A  represents the cognitive 
processes occurring during the Simon task based on the FEP . The 
Simon stimuli containing the spatial information p and symbolic 
information q as ϕ ϕ= ()pq,  immediately generates rapid 
FIGURE 1
(A) Schematic diagrams for explaining the action-rule-based cognitive control model. Conventionally, four types of Simon stimulus variations have 
been linked to the task-relevant responses (responses on the right/left). In our model, these four types are simply categorized as congruent or 
incongruent. These states are linked to the action rule where behavioral adaptation is switched from nonreverse for the congruent condition to reverse 
for the incongruent condition. (B) A specific application for the Simon task to guide impulsive responses to the task goal, where behavioral adaptation 
is switched from nonreverse for the congruent condition to reverse for the incongruent condition to guide impulsive responses to the task goal. The 
behavioral adaptation is conducted based on confidence in the action rule.

responses compatible with the spatial information generated as 
φ p() . To determine the conditional probability of the stimulus 
state ϕ occurring under the condition φ p() , the brain generates 
an inference as Q ϕ() , accompanied by an inference error using 
the Kullback–Leibler divergence formalism as 
D QPKL ϕϕ φϕ() ()()  | . In the FEP framework, free energy is 
defined as

Considering the conditioning probability formula 
P AB PA BP B,|() = () () , the free energy is expressed as
 F DQ Pl ogPKL= () ()()  − ()()ϕϕ φϕ φϕ |,  (7)
where the first term is the Bayesian surprise, followed by the 
Shannon surprise. The brain aims to minimize the free energy, which 
leads to inference with the highest likelihood. For the congruent 
condition p q=  the free energy is zero. However, for the incongruent 
condition p q↑ , the free energy increases due to the large inference 
error corresponding to the Bayesian surprise and the rare discomfort 
corresponding to the Shannon surprise as
 F DQ qP pl ogP pKL= ()() ()()  − ()()φϕ φφ |.  (8)
However, this free energy is readily decreased by the active 
inference framework (Friston et al., 2017), where the brain virtually 
mediates a rapid response ( )pφΨ , supported by the congruency 
signal θ. The free energy becomes

where Γ  is a constant. This equation also implies that repeating congruent trials reinforces the normal state. (C) The functional architecture of the 
cognitive control system based on visual information. The scheme presents the known functions of dissociable dorsal and ventral visual information 
processing pathways, lateralized functions of the fusiform gyrus (FG), and contributions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in impulsive and strategic 
decision-making. The left FG (part of the ventral pathway) analyzes symbolic information. In the conventional dual root model, this symbolic 
information is transferred to the DLPFC, which potentially interferes with the dorsal visual information pathway at the response level, causing response 
conflict. However, in the ARC model, symbolic information is transferred to the rostral part of the dACC via the orbitofrontal cortex. The rostral dACC 
can modify the initial response code from the dorsal pathway via the CBGTC network with the involvement of the SMA. This modification corresponds 
to active inference. The amygdala evaluates the cognitive load for each congruency and introduces bias for distinguishing between congruence and 
incongruence. The dACC reaches the final decision for providing goal-relevant responses by confirming that the adapted response is consistent with 
the symbolic information (q). Note that semantic information is not necessarily required in this comparison stage. IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; DLPFC,

where, the lower limit of the free energy is Shannon surprise, and 
indicating that the best possible case where errors are minimized for 
the incongruence.
The brain confirms that the adapted behavior ( )pφΨ  is equal to 
φ q()  for p q↑  (incongruence), thereby providing goal-relevant 
responses without response conflicts. Here, the Bayesian surprise term 
can be reduced by modifying the internal model so that the semantic 
definition can be exchanged between the right and left as qq→ , 
where means ,R LL R→→ . Such Bayesian inference term 
reduction minimizes free energy. However, the brain metacognitively 
recognizes that the space-compatible response φ p()  is irrelevant for 
the final task goal φ q()  thus, such Bayesian inference is invalid for the 
Simon task and thereby minimized. Consequently, active inference 
is enhanced.
In cognitive processing following the ARC model, active inference 
is enhanced by adjustment the sensitivity to the incongruence.
Here, we assume that the congruency is indirectly estimated from 
the sensory signal V based on an appropriate discrimination 
threshold Vth as
( ) ( )1; 0 ,th thV V congruence V V incongruenceθθ> ⇒= < ⇒=  (9)

where V0 and V1(VV10> ) are the peak values of the sensory signals

where κ is the frequency ratio between incongruence 
and congruence.
This equation suggests that decreasing the discrimination 
threshold improves sensitivity to congruence. Such top-down 
mediation of the sensory cortex is valid for the congruent condition 
because there is no risk of accepting the rapid response φ p()  as the 
final approved behavior for the task. Hence, the brain will improve the 
sensitivity to incongruence as

Biases due to sequence effects can be expressed as adjustments to 
the active-discrimination threshold. In such an adjustment, 
sensitivity increases when congruent sequences are provided. 
Conversely, sensitivity is reduced for incongruent sequences. If the 
consistency does not change after the sensitivity was adjusted, error 
responses do not occur immediately. However, because of the 
potentially increased false detection probability, error responses are 
likely to occur in the sequence in which consistency switches. Under 
a condition of repeated trials with the same congruency, such 
threshold mediation is accumulated by increasing the number of 
repeated trials as
 
( ) ( ){ }1,th thVV θρκ= +− Γ
 (13)
where Γ represents the threshold variation. This threshold 
mediation promotes reinforcement learning for maximizing sensitivity 
to each congruency (Colas et al., 2022). Figure 2B schematically shows 
this threshold mediation.
The cognitive cost is higher for incongruent trials than for 
congruent trials, which can be attributed to active inference. Simon 
stimuli provide a specific sequence where congruent and 
incongruent blocks are alternatively provided. Hence, the cognitive 
cost is high in incongruent blocks but low in congruent blocks. 
Such congruency-dependent cognitive cost modulation is 
beneficial for total cost savings: cognitive cost could be  saved 
during the congruent trials, whereas additional cost is required 
only in the incongruent trials. Note the risk of such cognitive cost 
modulation as well as the benefit. In the incongruent trial 
subsequent to the congruent, active inference could be missing or 
incorrectly adapted by the repetition of the congruent trials. Such 
a situation is attributed to lower cognitive load. In contrast, in the 
congruent trial subsequent to the incongruent, the active inference 
could be erroneously applied to the congruent trial. Such opposite 
situation can attribute to excessive cognitive cost for active 
inference. Consequently, the ARC model predicts response 
conflicts limited to such irrelevant responses in congruent trials 
preceded by incongruent trial. On the other hand, predicting no 
conflicts for relevant responses under such as congruence 
sequence conditions.
1.2.3 Integration of a computational framework 
with an actual brain model for experimental 
predictions
To examine how the ARC model works in the actual brain, 
we integrated the computational framework with a conventional brain 
model (Figure 2C).
In general, visual information is processed via dissociable dorsal 
and ventral pathways. The dorsal pathway primarily processes location 
information, while the ventral pathway focuses on symbolic 
information (Sakai et al., 2000; Soutschek et al., 2013). Thus, location-
relevant early-stage anticipatory postural adaptations (APAs) are 
caused, at least in part, by input from the dorsal pathway. Information 
processing in the dorsal pathway is faster than in the ventral pathway, 
so early-stage APAs are likely completely location-relevant without 
interference from the symbolic information processed by the ventral 
pathway. Hence, APA corresponds to a rapid response in the 
Otani et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1239207
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.org
computational framework. Taken together, we first predicted that the 
location-compatible APA could appear at almost the same time, 
independently of congruency.
Next, we examined how the brain promptly detects congruency θ 
much before sematic processing to promote active inference utilizing 
the rapid APA response. The whole symbolic feature of Simon stimuli 
may be processed as a “visual form-associated” by the left fusiform 
gyrus (FG), which is part of the ventral pathway (Ma and Han, 2012; 
Carlos et  al., 2019 ; Hildesheim et  al., 2020 ). Such visual form-
associated processing is reflected by the P200 event-related potential 
(ERP) component (He et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2020; Teixeira-Santos 
et  al., 2020; Zhang et  al., 2020 ; Hsu et  al., 2021 ; Larionova and 
Martynova, 2022). In such visual form-associate FG, specific visual 
stimuli, such the incongruent image in the Simon task, could 
be  weighted by the amygdala–FG circuit ( Frank et  al., 2019 ), 
potentially affecting the P200 amplitude. Hence, we made a second 
prediction: the P200 could reflect congruency.
Finally, we  theoretically examined how active inference could 
be promoted by the dACC, which strongly supports the ARC model. 
The congruency information detected in the FG may be transferred to 
the rostral dACC via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where it is 
promptly used for activating processes associated with active inference 
utilizing the early-stage APA via the supplementary motor area (SMA) 
(Lerner et  al., 2009 ; Asemi et  al., 2015 ; Diwadkar et  al., 2017 ). 
We speculate that active inference accompanied by reciprocal APA 
changes is promoted by strategic cognitive control signals from the 
rostral part of the dACC under the “incongruence” signal.
The dACC may improve connectivity with the mPFC, a node of 
the default-mode network needed to activate the action rule, i.e., the 
matrix operator Ψ, as described in the computational framework and 
modulate the APA via the OFC–striatum pathway.
The rostral dACC may promote this processing while suppressing 
any other task-unrelated activities, manifesting deactivation. Hence, 
we  made the third prediction that task-relevant responses could 
be accompanied by dACC deactivation, while irrelevant responses 
could not.
1.3 Aim of the current study
The current study aimed to show the validity of the ARC model 
through testable tasks. To this end, we devised a step-motion Simon 
task on the response elements essential for achieving task goals, 
including robust APA based on location information and congruency-
based action-rule adaptation for automatically generated APA. In this 
study, four trial conditions were defined according to sequential 
congruency [Current trial (previous trial)]: C(C), C(I), I(I), and I(C), 
where C and I refer to congruent trial and incongruent trial.
Based on our theoretical considerations, we  developed three 
theoretical and two experimental predictions:
Theoretical predictions that:
(1) The cognitive cost could be  improved in the incongruent 
blocks and reduced in the congruent blocks. (2) Error risk increases 
with congruence change [C(I), I(C)]. Error at I(C): reactive error 
under low cognitive load. Error at C(I): SRC under higher cognitive 
load. However, due to the higher cognitive load, the error frequency 
could be rather low.
Experimental predictions that:
(3) APA occurs almost at the same time, independently of 
congruency. In other words, the APAs appear in every sequence in 
accordance with the spatial characteristics of the stimuli, and the 
latencies are comparable. (4) The ERP P200 component reflects 
congruency. We predicted that incongruences such as I(I) or I(C) 
would show a larger P200 than C(C) or C(I). (5) Appropriate task 
execution needs adequate dACC activity accompanied by deactivation 
(ER-DBA dips). We  expected the ER-DBA dip to be  larger in the 
incongruent than in the congruent condition. It was also expected that 
the ER-DBA dip would be more pronounced in the C(I) and I(C) 
sequences, in which the stimulus characteristics switch, than in the 
C(C) sequence, in which the same stimulus is provided.
Then, we investigated behavioral and brain responses during tasks 
to confirm the validity of our hypotheses and predictions. We adopted 
an event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA) method to evaluate the 
dynamics of dACC activity with high temporal accuracy (~300 ms) 
using electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of occipital alpha-2 
power fluctuations ( Omata et  al., 2013 ). The ER-DBA method 
evaluates has been shown to reflect the activities of regions such as the 
dACC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Omata et al., 2013). This 
technique is characterized by its ability to assess the time course of 
cognitive workload via dACC activity. Behavioral and additional 
neurophysiological data, including acceleration (ACC), 
electromyogram (EMG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), were 
acquired to further support our model.
2 Methods
2.1 Subjects
Healthy young university and graduate students (23.8 ± 7.0 years) 
were recruited from Kobe International University, and 17 (4 females, 
13 males) ultimately participated in the study. A The sex ratio was 
imbalanced, however, we  considered that this would not affect 
experimental results, considering argument by recent studies 
providing opposing claims on gender difference in the Simon effect 
(Evans and Hampson, 2015; Stoet, 2017). All had normal vision, and 
none were using psychotropic agents. Prior to the study, participants 
were briefed on study goals and methods, and informed that they were 
free to withdraw at any time without penalty in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All provided written informed consent for 
participation, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences 
(No. 885).
2.2 Procedure
The step-motion Simon task was conducted using single left or 
right footprint images on the right or left sides of a display screen 
labeled “R” or “L ” (Figure  3A). Images were either congruent or 
incongruent according to the footprint position and label. Subjects 
were instructed to move the left or right foot 40-cm forward in 
accordance with the letter (R for the right foot and L for the left foot), 
but the footprint image could be  a left or right foot in accord

(congruent) or in conflict (incongruent) with the symbol. The four 
possible image types were presented in a random sequence, each for 
500 ms, at randomly varying inter-trial intervals from 3,000 to 
5,000 ms. During inter-trial intervals, a fixation cross was displayed at 
the center of the screen. Experiments consisted of two sessions 
(Figure 3B). The first session (Session I) was the Simon task with 200 
trials in total, including 160 congruent and 40 incongruent trials. The 
second session (Session II) was a non-conflict (NC) task including 
only 100 congruent trials. All images were presented on a 17-in liquid-
crystal display placed 1.5 m from the standing participant (Figure 3C). 
Image presentation was controlled by BioTrace+Software for Nexus32 
(MindMedia, Inc). The subjects were allowed to rest between sessions 
to consider fatigue while performing the task.
2.3 Measurements and analyses
2.3.1 Data recordings
Behavioral task performance was evaluated by reaction time (RT) 
and error responses (i.e., irrelevant responses). RT was evaluated from 
the horizontal component of ACC data (sampling rate: 256 Hz) using 
a tri-axial accelerometer sensor attached to the back of the lower trunk 
(L3 spinous process). The ACC provided two reaction stages, the first 
corresponding to the APA necessary for step-motion and the second 
to the initiation of foot-off ( McIlroy and Maki, 1993; MacKinnon 
et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2010). Error responses for each trial condition 
were evaluated by analyzing each frame (static image) of the acquired 
video records. An EEG was acquired simultaneously using a head cap 
with 21 Ag/AgCl electrodes of low contact impedance (<5 kΩ) 
arranged according to the international 10–20 system. The EEG was 
recorded during all task sessions using a 24-bit EEG system with 
256 Hz sampling (Nexus32, MindMedia Inc.). On-line EEG 
acquisition was conducted via optical-fiber transmission to suppress 
electrical noise. The acquired EEG data were re-referenced to mean 
mastoid signals at sites A1 and A2. EMG was used to evaluate ankle 
muscle activity during the task. EMG sensors were attached to the 
tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius (lateral head) of both legs 
(Figure 3D) according to the conventional anatomical viewpoint of 
step motion (Zipp, 1982; Rainoldi et al., 2004). EMG signals from the 
muscles were acquired independently and simultaneously from both 
legs at 1024 Hz. ACC, EEG, and EMG were measured synchronously 
on the same system (Nexus32).
2.3.2 Data analysis
Data were analyzed separately for each trial condition. In this 
study, four trial conditions were defined according to C(C), C(I), I(I), 
and I(C) as sequential congruency. These means current trial (previous 
trial), C and I  refer to congruent and incongruent stimuli. All

period. (B) Outline of the experimental task sessions. In the first session (Session I) was a Simon task consisting of 80% of trials presented congruent 
stimuli and 20% incongruent stimuli. Two hundred trials were presented in total. The second session (Session II) was a control (non-conflict) task 
consisting of 100 congruent trials. (C) Experimental setup. The Simon stimuli were presented visually using a 17-inch display 1.5  meters from the 
standing subject. Two lines, 40-cm apart, were drawn on the floor to guide appropriate stepping behaviors, which were monitored by an acceleration 
sensor. The trial shown is incongruent, with left (L) foot movement required despite presentation of a right footprint. (D) EMG sensors were attached to 
the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius (lateral head) of both legs (right leg shown) for evaluating EMG activities during tasks and compared to motor 
and EEG responses. COG: Center of gravity.

time-series data, including acceleration, EEG, and EMG, were 
anchored by event-trigger markers corresponding to sequential image 
condition and performance (relevant or irrelevant), such as C(C)-
relevant. Hence, there were eight distinct event conditions (Table 1). 
Time-series data were analyzed separately for the eight event 
conditions (Table 1). Briefly, we extracted epochs from 500 ms before 
(−500 ms) to 2000 ms on the basis of stimulus onset at time 0. Such 
time-series data segmentations yielded eight time-locked event-
related (ER) traces corresponding to eight event conditions, including 
ACC, EEG, and EMG.
ACC data was processed using a low-pass filter (5-Hz cutoff). 
ER-ACC traces derived from the acceleration data were then used to 
calculate two reaction times for each subject: the ACC waveform of 
the horizontal component during step motion can be expressed as a 
sine curve. The first peak in this curve represents the APA, and the 
second represents the foot-off. Prior to step initiation, APAs accelerate 
the center of mass forward and laterally over the stance leg by moving 
the center of pressure posteriorly and toward the swing leg. Using this 
feature, we could evaluate the kinesiological and physiological changes 
that occur during the transition from a quiet standing to the first step 
following a stimulus of the experimental tasks (Gazit et al., 2020). The 
RTs of APA and foot-off were calculated by evaluating the time of peak 
appearance. Hence, APA and foot-off correspond to step preparation 
and step initiation, respectively. The grand averages of APA and 
foot-off step initiation RT for the 17 participants were then calculated 
for each of the eight event conditions. Error responses were considered 
when both toe and heal parts of the irrelevant step side rose from the 
floor; the response is regarded as irrelevant. Error responses for each 
sequential congruency were first evaluated as error rates (dividing the 
number of errors by the number of trials per sequence) for individual 
subjects, and averaged thereafter.
We utilized ERPs to examine the whole word processing 
framework during the Simon task. The cognitive processing for the 
Simon stimuli, regarded as general ambiguous stimuli, consists of two 
dissociable stages, i.e., orthographic and phonological processes: the 
former could capture congruency information, while the latter could 
capture contextual meaning, including the task goal. As in previous 
ERP studies addressing such ambiguity (Joos et al., 2020; Imbir et al., 
2022), the former process provides the P200 reflecting congruency 
perception, while the latter provides the N200 reflecting emotional 
information, the P300 reflecting attentional processing onset, the 
N400 reflecting contextual processing, and the late positive potential 
(LPC) or P600 reflecting the profound meaning, including the task 
goal. Hence, we focused our attention on these ERP components. 
We set spatial and temporal regions of interest (ROIs) for identifying 
ERP components in accordance with previous studies ( Joos et al., 
2020; Imbir et al., 2022). The vertex Cz electrode was selected (Joos 
et al., 2020), and the time windows were set as follows: 150–275 ms 
(P200), 200–350 ms (N200), 300–400 ms (P300), 250–550 ms (N400), 
and 450–800 ms (LPC or P600). In the current study, we focused our 
interest on the P200 component as a marker of congruency without 
any higher cognitive processing. Therefore, EEG time-series data were 
elicited from the Cz electrode and bandpass-filtered (0.05–45 Hz). 
Eight ERP waveforms were grand averaged across the 17 participants 
in accordance with each event condition (Table 1). All time-locked 
waveforms to the stimulus onset were baseline corrected using 
averages ranging from −500 to 0 ms.
The EMGs are considered top-down signals from the motor 
cortex to the peripheral muscles (Hallett et al., 2021). This suggests 
that the EMG reflects processing in central motor control systems. 
Hence, we checked event-related EMG traces for evaluating motor 
control-specific brain activity to support ER-DBA and ERP data. 
Generally, EMG signals are bipolar, and their average is zero. Hence, 
we utilized the EMG power signals derived from low EMG signals. 
Here, we measured two EMG signals from two different muscles per 
leg, i.e., (EMG1) and (EMG 2), which were transformed to a single 
EMG power signal by averaging as

(EMG1: tibialis anterior, EMG 2: gastrocnemius, RMS: root 
mean square)
We evaluated the RMS-EMG amplitude for the left and right legs 
separately and calculated the total EMG power. As the step motion can 
be  characterized by the muscles, i.e., tibialis anterior and 
gastrocnemius, the total EMG power reflects higher-order motor 
control commands such as GO or STOP . In the current study, the 
24-bit time-series EMG data were filtered using a third-order 
Butterworth IIR bandpass filter with a frequency window of 20–500 Hz 
and transformed to RMS amplitude time-series data before 
transforming the two RMS-EMG amplitude time-series data into a 
single EMG power time-series data. We further evaluated eight grand-
average EMG traces time-locked to the stimulus onset using the eight 
event-marker sets used in ERP trace calculations. These analyses were 
performed separately for the support and step sides during the task. 
The reliability of the ER-EMG power traces was confirmed by the 
standard error of the mean (SEM). Furthermore, muscle activity-
related characteristics were evaluated during the stepping motion by 
determining the difference (Δ) in EMG power between the stepping 
and supporting sides.
2.3.3 Event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA) 
method
The study on the brain regions correlated with relationships 
between occipital EEG alpha powers and cognitive and emotional 
activities originates from the past (Larson et al., 1998; Sadato et al., 
1998; Lindgren et al., 1999; Goldman et al., 2002; Schreckenberger 
et al., 2004; Oishi et al., 2007). These studies revealed that the occipital 
EEG alpha power correlates contain various regions, including the 
limbic system and upper brain stem. Alpha oscillations may be related 
to generators of cortical rhythm, such as the occipital cortex

Otani et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1239207
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org
(Salek-Haddadi et al., 2003). Recent results established that the faster 
(>0.1 Hz) and slower (<0.04 Hz) components of the occipital EEG 
alpha-2 (10–13 Hz) power fluctuations reflect the activities of the 
dACC and the VTA containing dopaminergic neural systems, 
respectively (Omata et al., 2013).
This finding has been extended to the development of the ER-DBA 
method and evaluating the dynamic dACC activity during word-
generation (Imai and Katagiri, 2018) and memory consolidation tasks 
(Araki et al., 2018 ). These studies revealed that ER-DBA increases 
reflect improved dACC-DLPFC and dACC-SMA connectivity via the 
caudal dACC, where the former connection is associated with seeking 
external information and the latter connection is associated with 
execution; in contrast, a decrease implies rostral dACC-mPFC 
connectivity for internal processing, including memory recall and 
value evaluation. Hence, typical cognitive control processing provides 
a characteristic ER-DBA waveform accompanied by a dip, whose 
resolution corresponds to proactive dACC decision-making. The 
previous two studies also ascribed failure responses during cognitive 
tasks to a lack of ER-DBA dips reflecting reactive decision-making of 
the dACC. Hence, dip depth reflects differences in the cognitive cost 
necessary for promoting such proactive and reactive control.
The ER-DBA method is similar to conventional event-related 
desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) techniques 
(Sochůrková et al., 2006; Wianda and Ross, 2019; Zhozhikashvili et al., 
2022). However, only the ER-DBA method can provide dynamical 
information about fast dACC activity, as supported by EEG-fMRI 
simultaneous measurements (Omata et al., 2013).
Based on these previous studies, we adopted the ER-DBA method 
for this study. First, occipital EEG amplitude signals elicited from the 
O1 and O2 electrodes referring to mastoid electors (A1 and A2) were 
filtered using a third-order Butterworth digital filter to extract the 
alpha2-band component from the signals and smoothed by a moving 
average (time window: 32.25 ms). We defined a DBA index as the 
mean actual power of these amplitudes. The O1 and O2 mean power 
data were averaged and further segmented into epochs from −500 to 
2000 ms around stimulus onset, according to eight event conditions. 
Then, ER-DBA waveforms were grand averaged and baseline corrected 
using averages of the prior epoch ranging from −500 to 0 ms. Each 
grand averaged ER-DBA waveform time-locked to stimulus onset was 
statistically evaluated using SEM. Differences between ER-DBA traces 
(Δ ER-DBA traces) were further examined to evaluate the features of 
dACC activity specific to the stimulus conditions. Notably, we focused 
on the differences as NC – C(C) for evaluating the dACC activity 
specific to the Simon task, I(I) – C(C) to evaluate the one necessary 
for active inference during the Simon task, and C(I) – C(C) to evaluate 
the congruency sequence effect.
2.4 Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Origin Pro 2022 
software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) to examine the 
statistical significance among the event conditions for each index. The 
Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyze the error rate, and the Dunn 
test was conducted for post-hoc analysis. The RTs of APA and foot-off 
were analyzed using two-way ANOV A (trial conditions × eight 
performance conditions). ERPs were analyzed using two-way ANOV A 
(ERP components × congruent or incongruent trials). When an 
interaction effect was observed in the two-way ANOV A, the Sidak–
Holm test was conducted as a post hoc test. ER-DBA depth [depths for 
C(I), C(C), I(C), and I(I)] was analyzed using one-way ANOV A, and 
the Sidak–Holm test was used to examine sequential effects. Statistical 
significance was set at p < 0.05. Time-series traces (ACC, EEG, and 
EMG) were characterized by peak latency and amplitude and are 
expressed as mean ± standard error.
3 Results
3.1 Summary of Simon task performance
The Dunn test, a post hoc test of Kruskal–Wallis test (χ2 = 15.4, 
p = 0.0014), indicated that the error frequency in the Simon task 
strongly increased from congruent to incongruent trials (p = 0.0026, 
Z = −3.5) and decreased in repeating incongruent trials (p = 0.0034, 
Z = 2.7; Figure  4A). Other combinations provided no significant 
differences. The error frequency did not significantly increase when 
congruency changed from incongruent to congruent trials 
(Z = −0.418). The results were consistent with the prediction (2) that 
the error frequency could decrease due to the higher cognitive load.
Here, we found that errors occurred randomly during the session, 
suggesting no effects of habit or fatigue (Figure 4B). This suggests that 
the ARC model does not utilize any memory effects associated with 
the Bayesian surprise term.
Next, the early and late RTs (reflecting APA and foot-off delay, 
respectively) for each performance and stimulus condition 
(relevant/irrelevant × 4 event conditions) in Session I were evaluated 
using individuals’ grand-averaged ER-ACC traces ( Figure  5A). 
Session II was analyzed only with congruent stimuli and relevant 
trials (no errors occurred). The APA and foot-off times were clearly 
distinguishable in all traces (event conditions) as well as the NC 
condition, but the time to peak APA was generally longer and the 
foot-off delay was usually shorter in incongruent trials 
(Figures 5B,C).
We conducted multiple comparisons using the Sidak–Holm test 
after the two-way ANOV A to identify pairs under eight performance 
and stimulus conditions providing significant differences in RTs of the 
early-stage APAs, but no pairs were found (the C(C)-I(I) pair provided 
the minimal probability of 0.12). These results are consistent with our 
third theoretical prediction (Figure 5B).
In contrast, similar ANOV A analyses on the RTs of the foot-off  
identified pairs with significant differences: irrelevant I(C)-relevant 
I(I) (p = 0.000000103), irrelevant I(C)-relevant I(C) (p = 0.0000098), 
relevant I(I)-relevant C(C) (p = 0.000041), irrelevant C(I)-relevant I(I) 
(p = 0.00027), irrelevant I(I)-relevant I(I) (p = 0.00047), and relevant 
I(C)-relevant C(C) (p = 0.0019; Figure 5C). Among them, the relevant/
irrelevant I(C)-I(C) pair was notably attributed to the absence of 
active inference. This was supported by the lack of significant 
differences in the irrelevant I(C)-relevant C(C) pair, suggesting that 
the irrelevant I(C) response was as fast as that for the relevant C(C) 
pair. In contrast, the irrelevant C(I)-relevant I(I) pair significantly 
differed, suggesting that erroneous responses for the congruent trials 
could be promoted by response conflict. This result was consistent 
with our second prediction.

3.2 Effects of Simon task conditions and 
performance on DBA and ERPs
ER-DBA originating from electrodes O1 and O2 was greatly 
influenced by both Simon task trial sequence (congruency) and 
response. All grand-averaged ER-DBA traces for relevant responses 
decreased from the time of stimulus onset and exhibited a dip, 
reaching a nadir around the grand-averaged foot-off time 
(Figures  6A,B). This result testified to the prediction (5) that the 
dACC could be crucial for cognitive processing. Moreover, dip depth 
was significantly larger (lower) in conditions including an incongruent 
trial compared to the C(C) condition (Figure 6C).
Based on previous DBA recordings during cognitive tasks, 
including word generation tasks (Araki et al., 2018) and paired word 
memorizing and retrieval (Imai and Katagiri, 2018), we believe that 
the DBA index represents the cognitive cost of executing tasks.
The congruency blocks were provided as C(C)-I(C)-I(I)-C(I) in 
the Simon task. The dip depths differed when the congruency 
changed. The Sidak–Holm test after the one-way ANOV A for the four 
congruency conditions limited to relevant responses identified two 
pairs with a significant difference in dip depth as I(C)-C(C) 
(p = 0.00024) and I(I)-C(C) (p = 0.0077). Such a dip-depth difference 
between congruent and incongruent trials suggested that the cognitive 
cost was flexibly mediated trial-by-trial by the dACC, resulting in 
cost savings.
In contrast, grand-averaged ER-DBA traces recorded during 
irrelevant responses exhibited no such dip around the foot-off time 
except for the C(C) condition, which provided a dip (Figure 6D). The 
absence of ER-DBA dips suggests that dACC deterioration may 
induce erroneous responses. In contrast, excessive activity of the 
dACC may generate response conflict, thus dismissing the relevant 
APA. These findings supported our second prediction.
In the NC task, the grand-averaged ER-DBA trace exhibited a 
small, significant dip (Figure 6E). This suggests that the dACC may 
reactively select goal-relevant responses. This situation implies that the 
internal model is completely consistent with the external response; 
thus, the Bayesian surprise as an inference error in the NC task is 
always negligibly small.
All differences between ΔER-DBA traces except for I(I) –C(C) 
(Figure 7) showed little deviation from baseline until about 300 ms 
after stimulus onset (corresponding to P300). The I(I) –C(C) trace 
started to decrease at around 150–200 ms, suggesting a higher 
cognitive cost for engaging with incongruent stimuli. However, all Δ 
ER-DBA traces exhibited substantial trace changes after this critical 
time point (300 ms).
The large difference between C(C) and NC traces suggests that 
inhibitory motor control is dominant after this critical time, while the 
difference between congruent and incongruent trials [C(C) vs. I(I)] 
suggests higher cognitive load in incongruent trials.
Further, the difference between C(C) and C(I), representing the 
congruency sequence effect, suggests reduced cognitive load in the 
successive C(C) condition. This was consistent with the first prediction.
Simon task performance and congruency conditions also 
influenced the ERPs originating from electrode Cz. Figure 8A  
shows congruency-specific ERP traces obtained during relevant 
responses. Traces exhibited typical ERP components P200, P300, 
and N400, as well as LPC waveforms, including P600. The P200 
demonstrated significant differences between congruent and 
incongruent trials using a post-hoc test ( p = 0.00012, power = 0.94), 
and other ERP components were not significantly different 
(Figure  8B ). This result suggests that P200 might reflect 
congruency, meaning that the fusiform gyrus, as a P200 source, 
could detect Simon stimuli congruency. This result explanation is 
consistent with the fourth prediction associated with automatic 
congruency detection. ERP waveforms were also identified for 
both relevant and irrelevant responses ( Figure 8C ). They clearly 
indicated that the P200 appeared earlier in the relevant condition 
than the irrelevant condition. The LPC (late positive potential) 
exhibited an earlier component at around 500 ms in the irrelevant 
condition and a significant late component at around 700 ms in 
the relevant condition ( p = 0.0002). These results suggest that the 
LPC may reflect successful trial execution.

p >=χ2 0 0014.) ,identifies pairs with significant differences in error rate as C(C)-C(I) (p  =  0.0026, Z  = −3.5), C(I)-I(C) (p  =  0.0088, Z  = −3.2), and I(C)-
I(I) (p  =  0.034, Z  =  2.8), suggesting that the error rate was significantly higher when switching the congruency condition on consecutive trials compared 
to non-switching consecutive trials. (B) Error rate demonstrated no trend over the course of a session, indicating that error occurrence was idiopathic

3.3 Associations of Simon task condition 
and performance with motor activity
All ER-EMG traces recorded during the Simon task 
(Figures 9A–H) exhibited a rise in the range of 100–150 ms post-
stimulus onset and clear lateralization of EMG power to the swing side 
compared to the support side according to location information. The 
critical time of 150 ms corresponded to the ERP P200 component. The 
emergence of EMG power indicated that motor control processing 
started very early, at least up to 150 ms.
Among the relevant responses ( Figures 9A –D), EMG traces 
time-locked to the stimulus onset for the congruent condition 
peaked at 200–250 ms post-stimulus onset. Notably, EMG power 
on the step side provided steep negative inclinations for the 
incongruent condition at around 200 ms post-stimulus onset, 
which corresponded to the ERP P200 component. After the peak, 
FIGURE 5
Measurements of peak early-stage anticipatory postural adaptation (APA) and behavioral reaction time (foot-off RT) under all event conditions derived 
from ER-ACC traces. (A) Examples of acceleration traces along the X-axis (horizontal to the stepping direction) averaged for each subject: (i) C(C)- and 
C(I)-relevant; (ii) I(C)- and I(I)-relevant; (iii) C(C)- and C(I)-irrelevant; (iv) I(C)- and I(I)-irrelevant; (v) Non-conflict (NC) task. These traces revealed early-
stage APA at ~300  ms during relevant responses, all of which were consistent with location information and independent of congruency. Foot-off 
times were delayed by around 100  ms under incongruent conditions [I(C) and I(I)] compared to congruent conditions [C(I) and C(C)]. The acceleration 
traces during relevant responses under incongruent conditions exhibited smooth reversal for goal-directed behavioral correction. The acceleration 
traces with no correction under incongruent conditions indicate execution while maintaining the irrelevant APA. These ACC trace features were shared 
by all subjects. In contrast, an example of ER-ACC trace for the NC task (Session II) yielded an ER-ACC trace exhibiting clear APA and foot-off times. 
(B) Summary of grand-averaged peak APA time for the four sequence conditions C(C), I(C), I(I), and C(I) and performance classes (relevant and 
irrelevant). The two-way ANOVA showed no significant sequential differences (F  =  1.4, p  =  0.23) nor a significant difference between relevant/irrelevant 
difference (F  =  1.8, p  =  0.17). Hence, the Sidak–Holm test performed after a two-way ANOVA identified no pairs with a significant difference in reaction 
time. (C) Summary of grand-averaged foot-off times for event conditions. The two-way ANOVA showed a significant sequential difference between 
relevant and irrelevant responses (F  =  15.6, p  =  0.00018) but no significant sequential difference (F  =  0.18, p  =  0.89). The Sidak–Holm test after a two-
way ANOVA identified six pairs with a significant difference in reaction time: irrelevant I(C)-relevant I(I) (p  =  0.000000103), irrelevant I(C)-relevant 
I(C) (p  =  0.0000098), relevant I(I)-relevant C(C) (p  =  0.000041), irrelevant C(I)-relevant I(I) (p  =  0.00027), irrelevant I(I)-relevant I(I) (p  =  0.00047), and 
relevant I(C)-relevant C(C) (p  =  0.0019). *p  <  0.05, APA*: corrected APA by reversed.

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org
the EMG trace on the swing side steeply decreased, whereas that 
on the support side increased in the incongruent trials. This 
lateralization of EMG power toward the support side denoted that 
motor control processing started to guide goal-irrelevant APAs to 
goal-relevant responses. In contrast, such EMG power 
lateralization was not exchanged in congruent trials.
The EMG power increased in both congruent and incongruent 
trials after 300 ms post-stimulus onset. This critical time corresponded 
to the ERP P300 component, whose source is the ACC. The 
lateralization of EMG power reversed at around 400–500 ms, 
corresponding to the ERP N400 component in incongruent trials, 
whereas it maintained the same pattern emerging at the early stage in 
congruent trials. Interestingly, the EMG patterns in the incongruent 
condition, which were promptly corrected from 200 to 350  ms, 
manifested the same pattern as in the congruent condition.
In contrast, irrelevant responses ( Figures  9E–H) exhibited 
patterns similar to relevant responses at earlier stages. However, the 
EMG traces were not corrected until around 450 ms post-stimulus 
onset in the incongruent condition, while traces in the congruent 
condition exhibited earlier corrected patterns.
Figure 9I shows the Δ EMG trace difference for relevant responses 
during the Simon task to evaluate the magnitude of EMG 
lateralization. The difference increased with time post-stimulus onset 
but manifested distinct features according to congruency. For the 
congruent condition, the difference peaked at around 250 ms and then 
gradually decreased, while in the incongruent condition, the difference 
exhibited a sharp reversal at 200 ms, and reached almost the same level 
as that in the congruent condition at around 400 ms post-stimulus 
onset. Such reversal for relevant responses was not observed for 
irrelevant responses in the incongruent condition (Figure 9J).

exhibited a large negative waveform (dip, asterisk) beginning later than 300  ms post-stimulus onset. This dip was slightly attenuated in the successive 
congruent condition C(C) compared to the switching condition C(I). (B) ER-DBA traces recorded during relevant incongruent trials I(C) and I(I). The dip 
depth was much larger for the successive condition I(I) than the switching condition I(C), while both traces reach a minimum at similar latencies of 
around 500  ms post-stimulus onset. Further, dip depths were much larger than those in the C(C) and C(I) conditions. (C) Summary of sequence effects

congruency conditions limited to relevant responses identified two pairs with significant differences in dip depth: I(C)-C(C) (p  =  2.4E-4) and I(I)-
C(C) (p  =  0.0077). *p  <  0.05 (D) ER-DBA traces recorded during irrelevant responses. The trace exhibited an early dip around 300  ms only for the 
successive congruent condition C(C) (within the region of interest [ROI] shown in the inset above), while only the I(I) condition exhibited a late-stage 
dip around 600  ms. (E) The NC task exhibited a much smaller DBA dip at around 450  ms, corresponding to the foot-off time.

The ER-EMG traces for the NC task (Figures 9K,L) showed no 
difference between swing and support sides in the early-stage up to 
300 ms, which corresponded to the peak times of the ER-EMG traces 
(Figure 9K). After the peak, traces exhibited the same changes as those 
for the relevant responses in the congruent condition of the Simon 
task. However, the peak levels were much higher than those of the 
Simon task. The difference in ER-EMG between step and support sides 
during the NC task exhibited a small reversal around 250 ms followed 
by a rapid increase at around 300 ms.
3.4 Evaluation of cognitive processing in 
the dACC
We evaluated Δ ER-DBA traces between task conditions for 
extracting process-specific cognitive costs (Figure 7). The I(I) – C(C) 
difference corresponded to the cognitive costs associated with Simon-
task-specific processing. The difference started at around 200 ms post-
stimulus onset, suggesting that cognitive processing for engaging in 
incongruent trials was initiated by congruency detection in the 
dACC. In contrast, the C(I) – C(C) difference corresponded to the 
cognitive cost reduction by repetition of congruent trials. The 
difference started at around 500 ms post-stimulus onset. This suggests 
lower incongruence-specific cognitive cost in C(C) trials. The foot-off 
times, as reaction times, were also around 500 ms for the C(C) trials. 
Hence, the incongruence-specific cognitive cost should be associated

significantly different between congruent and incongruent (p  <  0.05). (C) The ERP traces also differed significantly between relevant and irrelevant 
responses independently of congruency.

with decision-making in the dACC. Cost-saving implies that cognitive 
control may be  more reactive in the C(C) trials. Overall, these 
considerations are consistent with the ARC model referring to the 
FEP . We further examined the Δ ER-DBA of NC – C(C) and found 
that the cognitive cost was much higher for the Simon task than for 
the NC task. This cognitive cost increase in the Simon task may 
be attributed to the active inference for engaging in the Simon task.
4 Discussion
We proposed and demonstrated an action-based cognitive control 
(ARC) model to show evidence that response-conflict tasks can 
be executed beyond the trade-off between cost saving and accuracy by 
behavioral adaptation via active inference. Figure 10 summarizes the 
results, which are consistent with the predictions set in the

early-stage up to 300  ms post-stimulus onset. In all cases, lateralization reflected location information in the Simon trial. (E–H) In contrast, ER-EMG 
patterns for irrelevant responses were rather complex. (E) In congruent trials, responses showed that a maintained goal-relevant pattern up to around

Introduction section. To confirm the feasibility of the ARC model, 
we examined whether alternative theories could explain the results.
4.1 Response adaptation by ARC versus 
top-down inhibition of irrelevant responses 
through a hyper-direct pathway
Alternative theories typically include the conflict monitoring 
theory ( Schmidt, 2019 ), wherein the ACC monitors conflict and 
triggers the PFC to suppress irrelevant responses in Simon tasks 
(Kerns, 2006). This hypothesis claims that the PFC replaces the prior 
irrelevant response with the relevant response, while the subthalamic 
nucleus (STN) promotes global (nonselective) motor inhibition, 
leading to response delay (Wessel et al., 2019). Hence, the hypothesis 
fits the conventional dual root model (Luo and Proctor, 2019). The 
hypothesis also claims that the conflict adaptation effect in Simon 
tasks, i.e., the Gratton effect ( Gratton et al., 1992 ), is part of such 
global inhibition by the STN ( Hommel et al., 2004). However, our 
results disagree on several points. First, prior irrelevant APA 
responses in the incongruent trials were reused for generating 
relevant responses. Furthermore, such behavioral adaptation started 
at around 200 ms after stimulus onset, which means that the 
behavioral adaptation observed in our results was not affected by 
global motor inhibition. Second, although we  identified such 
STN-promoted global inhibition, it was selective. EMG was 
asymmetrically generated on the right and left sides. This difference 
was attributed to the EMG inhibition on the step side. This means 
that spatial information is perceived, at least at this early stage. This 
difference was attributed to EMG inhibition on the step side. This 
means that the spatial information is at least perceived at this early 
stage. We ascribed such selective inhibition to some metacognitive 
risk-hedge manners. The impulsive reaction based solely on the 
information brought by the dorsal visual pathway is risky. Hence, the 
Simon stimuli-triggered fast reaction, notably on the spatial-
information-relevant side, and is proactively inhibited by the rostral 
dACC. Such selective inhibition was observed only in the Simon task 
but not in a non-conflict task consisting of relevant trials only.
4.2 Response adaptation by ARC versus 
feature integration without executive 
control
The feature integration theory (FIT) (Mayr et al., 2003; Hommel 
et al., 2004) has been proposed for accounting sequential effects in 
Simon tasks by automatic processing without top-down executive 
control. We  thus examined whether the FIT could alternatively 
account for the results of this study. The theory is based on a 
bottom-up framework using SR mapping. During Simon tasks, the SR 
maps must be  memorized and recalled trial-by-trial. Such FIT 
processing framework is certainly advantageous for cognitive cost 
reduction for conflict resolution. However, FIT feasibility is still 
argued (Schmidt et al., 2015) to many options included the maps. To 
apply such FIT to account for the cognitive processing in Simon tasks, 
the option selection from the SR maps should appear in a late 
processing stage after semantic processing for the Simon stimuli. 
Thereby the FIT could not account for our results of early-stage 
correction of irrelevant APAs in incongruent trials at approximately 
200-ms post-stimulus onset. Furthermore, neural evidence in this 
study characterized by ER-DBA dips indicates that any executive 
control association via the dACC disagrees with the FIT characterized 
by executive control absence. Hence, the flexible dACC activity 
predicted by the ARC model for prompt response adaptation in the 
Simon task may explain conventional congruency sequence effects 
better than the FIT.

4.3 Absence of trade-off between 
cost-saving and accuracy
An important concept of this discussion is that the ARC model 
could account for the cost-saving effect. Recent studies have reported 
that the caudal dACC interacts with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to 
control impulsive decision-making while the rostral dACC interacts 
with the OFC to control strategic decision-making ( Venkatraman 
et al., 2009; Venkatraman and Huettel, 2012; Konovalov et al., 2021). 
It has also been demonstrated that strategic decision-making 
promoted by the rdACC provides accuracy at the cost of additional 
cognitive load, while impulsive decision-making promoted by the 
cdACC provides rapidity at the cost of increased error rate (Kim et al., 
2011; Leota et al., 2021). Such duplicate decision-making mechanisms 
can be either compensatory or conflicting under time pressure, so 
each strategy has distinct merits and drawbacks (Ebitz and Hayden, 
2016). This indicates that there is a trade-off between cognitive cost-
saving and accuracy.
In contrast, a major portion of the total cognitive cost of the 
Simon task may be  allocated to information processing, which is 
inversely correlated with free energy (Trujillo, 2019). Accordingly, the 
cognitive cost was necessary for the active inference to reduce the 
entropy associated with the Shannon surprise. Our results indicate 
that the ER-DBA dip depth changed in accordance with stimulus 
sequence, with the greatest depth for the successive incongruent 
condition and the shallowest for the successive congruent condition. 
Such trial-by-trial adaptation suggests that cognitive costs may 
be actively regulated in accordance with circumstances.
Such flexibility enables not only cost-saving but also cost-saving 
and accuracy beyond their trade-off relationship as described by 
previous studies ( Marshall et  al., 2006 ; Klein-Flügge et  al., 2016 ; 
Shenhav et al., 2016). Of course, the ARC model does not completely 
prevent the risk of cognitive errors. For successive congruent trials, 
such cost-saving degrades the activity of the rostral dACC due to the 
disuse of active inference, which counterbalances the promotion of 
impulsive decisions mediated by the caudal dACC. This increases the 
error risk when the trial changes to incongruence as I(C). However, 
such a risk will be avoided if the dACC maintains high flexibility while 
being sufficiently supported by the ventral tegmental area involving 
abundant monoaminergic neurons.
4.4 Limitation
It is unclear whether this ARC model can be extended to other 
task paradigms. In theory, a simple APA reversal mechanism utilizing 
the spinal central pattern generator ( McCrea and Rybak, 2007 ; 
McCrea and Rybak, 2008; Danner et al., 2015; Minassian et al., 2017; 
Merlet et al., 2021; Ryu and Kuo, 2021) and midbrain locomotion area 
(Shefchyk and Jordan, 1985; Noga et al., 2003, 2017) could regulate 
step-motion conflict based on mature walking mechanisms. If so, our 
findings were task specific. Moreover, while our study provides data 
supporting the ARC model, we did not directly compare or test this 
model against other existing models, which is a limitation that should 
be considered when interpreting our results. The current study also 
did not examine patients with neuropathological disorders such as 
literal spatial neglect. It is debated whether allocentric spatial reference 
frameworks exist independent of egocentric references ( Filimon, 
2015; Demeyere and Gillebert, 2019 ). The experimental paradigm 
described here could be adapted to examine how these patients resolve 
Simon-like SRCs, which may in turn provide clues to the underlying 
path mechanisms. For instance, these patients could be examined in 
Simon-like tasks using virtual-reality ( Vourvopoulos et  al., 2016; 
Laver et al., 2017; Riva et al., 2019; Hoffman et al., 2020; Sip et al., 
2023) or brain-machine interface technologies (Juliano et al., 2020; 
Leeb and Pérez-Marcos, 2020).
5 Conclusion
In this study, we  proposed a novel ARC model where Simon 
stimulus information is reduced from 2-to 1-bit by categorizing Simon 
stimuli into simple congruent/incongruent groups (Prezenski et al., 
2017; Bejjani and Egner, 2019). We theorized the ARC model based 
on the free energy principle to show the validity of the ARC model by 
making theoretical and experimental predictions. One of our main 
predictions is that the simple behavioral adaptation rule of guiding 
automatic APAs to goal-relevant responses could be promoted by 
active inference. Furthermore, we  predicted that congruency 
repetition blocks contribute to cost-saving. We  conducted a step-
motion Simon task with simultaneous EEG, EMG, and kinetic 
measurements to investigate neural mechanisms, hypothesizing that 
flexible dACC activity would be crucial for realizing the ARC model. 
Our results were consistent with those theoretically predicted, 
suggesting ARC model feasibility. Taken together, we could conclude 
that the ARC model provides rationale for modifying complex 
stimulus–response mapping processes to more sophisticated rule-
based processing characterized by simplicity and cost-saving. This 
model could potentially aid in cognitive training and rehabilitation 
program development. In this study, the FEP was formulated, and 
model validation was conducted. Behavioral modifications due to 
active inference were observed during step movement during the 
Simon task. Since this finding may be task specific, it would be possible 
to discuss generalization, including model extension, by verifying 
whether active inference is also valid for different types of movements, 
such as upper limb movements and finger tapping.
