An Erratum on
Meaningfulness and attachment: what dreams, psychosis and
psychedelic states tell us about our need for connection
by Fischman, L. (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/four.tnum).Front. Psychol./one.tnum/five.tnum:/one.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/one.tnum/one.tnum/one.tnum. doi:/one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/four.tnum./one.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum/one.tnum/one.tnum/one.tnum
Due to a production error, a portion of the text was omitted from the published
article. In the section “The intersubjective basis of the sense of reality, ” the ﬁrst sentence
of paragraph three was incorrectly written as “Blankenburg and Mishara (2001, p. 309).”
This sentence should instead be written as shown below.
“Blankenburg describes something akin to disruption of ipseity in attributing the
schizophrenic prodrome to a loss of natural self-evidence or common sense. In this
account, “the healthiness of common sense rests on habituality. The natural self-evidence
of everyday existence draws its nourishment from just such a habituality” (Blankenburg
and Mishara, 2001, p. 309).”
The publisher apologizes for this mistake.
The original version of this article has been updated.
