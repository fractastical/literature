The human need to find meaning in life and the human need for connection 
may be  two sides of the same coin, a coin forged in the developmental 
crucible of attachment. Our need for meaningfulness can be  traced to our 
developmental need for connection in the attachment relationship. The free 
energy principle dictates that in order to resist a natural tendency towards 
disorder self-organizing systems must generate models that predict the hidden 
causes of phenomenal experience. In other words, they must make sense 
of things. In both an evolutionary and ontogenetic sense, the narrative self 
develops as a model that makes sense of experience. However, the self-model 
skews the interpretation of experience towards that which is predictable, or 
already “known.” One may say it causes us to “take things personally.” Meaning 
is felt more acutely when defenses are compromised, when the narrative self 
is offline. This enables meaning-making that is less egocentrically motivated. 
Dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic states offer glimpses of how we  make 
sense of things absent a coherent narrative self. This has implications for the 
way we understand such states, and lays bare the powerful reach of attachment 
in shaping what we experience as meaningful.

Introduction
The closing line of Letheby and Gerrans’s (2017) much-cited paper, “Self Unbound” is a 
quotation from James Kingsland’s book, Siddharta’s Brain: “We have evolved into an ape that 
takes things personally” (Kingsland, 2016, p. 209). This provocative metaphor alludes to how 
humans model (make sense of) their phenomenal surroundings in ordinary states of waking 
consciousness by comparing their impressions with prior personal experiences. It refers 
directly to our use of predictive processing. This contrasts with how humans process their 
surroundings in non-ordinary states of consciousness, such as those induced by high doses of 
psychedelic drugs and in dreams. In framing their conclusion in an evolutionary context, 
Letheby and Gerrans invite speculation about the adaptative implications of our particular 
way of processing experience.
Philosophers, poets, and scientists have long noted similarities between our ways of 
thinking in dreams and madness, a short list to which, in the last century, psychedelic states 
have been added. The repeated finding in studies comparing cognition in people with and

without schizophrenia that people with schizophrenia are less 
susceptible to visual illusions has been interpreted as suggesting a 
strength, rather than a deficit, of this style of thinking. What is 
significant about this assessment is not so much whether it truly 
represents a strength, which is debatable, but the idea that its 
adaptiveness is being considered at all. As discussed below in more 
detail, this finding illustrates a way in which (some) humans have 
evolved not to take things personally. The observation that people with 
schizophrenia are less susceptible to visual illusion may reflect an 
under weighting, or reduced attribution of precision, to prior 
experience. Ironically, by not allowing prior experience (expectation) 
to color perception, or by not, in Kingsland’s terms, taking things 
personally, persons with schizophrenia become susceptible to the idea 
of reference, the conviction that unrelated phenomena have personal 
relevance or meaning, which grows out of the primary delusional 
mood, the sine qua non of psychotic experience according to Jaspers 
(1913/1997; Mishara and Fusar-Poli, 2013).
This somewhat paradoxical observation calls for a careful 
examination of the processes which give rise to a sense of 
meaningfulness, and how the construction (and deconstruction) of 
narratives, including one’s sense of self, bear upon these processes. 
I will try to show how one’s sense of meaningfulness is related to one’s 
felt sense of connectedness with the attachment object. The infant 
exists continually on the brink of “impingements” which may induce 
feelings of annihilation: “Going to pieces. Falling forever. Having no 
relationship to the body. Having no orientation” (Winnicott, 1962); 
the infant’s sense of security rests upon feeling connected with the 
attachment object. The sense that the caregiver is emotionally invested 
in the infant’s well-being (motivated) and able to recognize her needs 
(capable) determines the infant’s sense of security within this 
relationship. As I will argue, the subject’s sense of connection with the 
caregiver in the attachment relationship (trust) models the subject’s 
sense of meaning in later life.
Narratives, particularly the self-narrative, which embodies both 
the sense of connection with the attachment object and defenses 
against awareness of the limits of that connection, create a sense of 
meaning. The unraveling of the narrative self that occurs in dreams, 
psychosis, and psychedelic states affords glimpses of un-relatedness, 
of meaninglessness, of annihilation. At the same time, these states 
afford the opportunity to form new narratives. In the transition, 
we  can observe the process of meaning-making, of determining 
relatedness, or experiencing connection. It is a powerful affective 
process that during ordinary states of consciousness largely takes 
place unconsciously.
The loss of the narrative self in dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic 
states is experienced as an intense, complex, ambiguous, risk-filled, 
content-rich state; its affective valence ranges from highly pleasant to 
terrifying. In this presumably neuroplastic or critical state, the subject 
feels powerfully compelled to know how she relates to her 
surroundings. The subject’s usual repertoire of prior generative models 
is no longer accessible as a guide for allocating precision, yet the 
biologically driven exigency to ascertain causes persists. Here, the ape 
cannot take things personally. The process of meaning-making, no 
longer implicit, assumes a strongly felt, conscious quality1. The new 
1 Less conscious, of course, in dreams.
relations experienced in such states carry greater significance, as if the 
subject somehow senses that she is no longer taking things personally.
This paper casts the process of meaning-making, which is 
amplified by the dissolution of the narrative self in dreams, psychosis, 
and psychedelic states, as driven by the same motivation—a 
biologically and psychologically determined need for connection—
which turns the infant and her caregiver towards each other in the 
primary attachment relationship.
Attachment
Bowlby describes attachment as a relational system of fitted infant 
and caregiver behaviors whose evolutionary purpose is to protect the 
infant from internally generated distress and externally perceived 
danger. The system builds upon genetically determined capacities for 
infant behaviors such as sucking, following, and clinging as well as for 
signaling internal states (e.g., crying and smiling), and coordinated 
motivated response capacities in the caregiver. Successful proximal 
interactions between infant and caregiver result in relieving the 
infant’s feelings of distress or perception of danger and instantiating a 
sense of security. They also condition the infant to seek proximity to 
the caregiver when feelings of distress or danger arise anew. When the 
infant experiences distress or danger in the absence of an attachment 
figure, separation anxiety ensues ( Bowlby, 1960b ). Prolonged 
unavailability of the caregiver engenders feelings of loss, leads to grief 
and mourning (Bowlby, 1960a).
Memories of attachment-based interactions with caregivers enable 
infants to develop representations or internal working models of these 
interactions, which are used to generate outcome predictions of future 
infant-caregiver interactions in a variety of circumstances and 
contexts. These models incorporate defenses used to mitigate distress 
resulting from insufficient caregiver responses. Caregiver responses 
are at least partly determined by the infant’s or child’s need activating 
the caregiver’s own early developed internal working models, which 
include their own characterological defenses. The behaviors resulting 
from the interaction between child and caregiver lead to consistent 
patterns of interaction that fall into categories that can be labelled as 
secure or insecure attachment, with the latter category subdivided into 
avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganized types. Essentially, these 
categories describe the nature and quality of connectedness in primary 
object relationships, which transposes to the quality of object 
relatedness in general.
The key points about attachment which will be developed further 
below are its role as the developmental template for the 
phenomenological experience of connection in later object 
relatedness, and its essential value in terms of individual adaptation 
and species survival.
Attachment and meaning
What constitutes the sense of meaningfulness? Meaningfulness 
simply refers to the subjective sense of having ‘meaning’ ( Klinger, 
1977; Park, 2010), which is a bit harder to define. Baumeister defines 
meaning as “shared mental representations of possible relationships 
among things, events, and relationships… meaning connects things” 
(Baumeister, 1991, p. 15). Proulx and Inzlicht (2012) supplement this 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
definition by discussing the human reaction to the absence of 
meaning. They cite Camus, who held in his only philosophical essay 
(Camus, 1942/2004) that people naturally organize their experiences 
into systems of relationships. “When these systems are undermined 
by contradictory experiences, he believed that a corresponding feeling 
of absurdity motivates efforts to make sense of experiences in other 
ways” (Proulx and Inzlicht, 2012). They also cite Kuhn, who argued 
that scientists naturally organize their observations into paradigms 
(Kuhn, 1962). “When these paradigms are violated by anomalous 
observations, Kuhn believed that the corresponding anxiety motivates 
efforts to make sense of the observations in other ways” (Proulx and 
Inzlicht, 2012). They cite Piaget, too, who theorized that cognitive 
development is built upon schemata, or organized representations of 
reality constructed from experience. When subsequent experiences 
fail to match our schemata, Piaget “believed that the corresponding 
disequilibrium motivates us to find other ways to make these 
experiences make sense” (Proulx and Inzlicht, 2012).
These and related observations prompted the meaning 
maintenance model (MMM) (Heine et al., 2006), at the core of which 
is “the proposition that humans are inexhaustible meaning makers” 
(p.  91). The model recognizes both the human compulsion to 
“construct mental representations of expected relationships between 
people, places, objects, and ideas” and their urgent need “to 
reconstruct a sense of meaning whenever their meaning frameworks 
are disrupted” (p. 90).
Are disruptions in meaningfulness existential crises? There are, of 
course, many kinds and levels of disruptions of meaningfulness. The 
relative levels of distress caused by the appearance of a black queen of 
hearts in a deck of cards (Bruner and Postman, 1949), an unfair ruling, 
child abuse, and genocide differ widely, yet all of these events violate 
our sense of the expected relations of things. Without compensatory 
efforts to “make sense” of such events, they leave us distraught. More 
consequential disruptions of meaning, when protracted or repeated, 
cause us to question the value of life. Studies of the MMM suggest that 
adaptation to disrupted meaning is fluid. One may compensate for 
disrupted meaning in one area of one’s life by deepening one’s sense of 
meaning in another area. While other explanations are possible, the 
“fluid compensation” model suggests that the diverse sources of 
disruption to our sense of meaning may have a common 
dynamic underpinning.
The authors of the MMM suggest that this common dynamic 
underpinning is the maintenance of expected relations themselves, 
and the sense of control over one’s life this affords. They cite the 
evolutionary advantage that the human capacity for making 
associations or connections between people, events and things 
confers, especially in discerning the intentions (expected behaviors) 
of fellow humans (Heine et al., 2006, p. 92). But there may be a deeper 
motivation: disruption to expected attachment relationships with 
caregivers is a direct threat to survival. The urgency with which 
we defend our sense of expected relations between things (meaning) 
derives from their affective matrix in the attachment relationship 
(Bowlby, 1969; Stern, 1985).
Meaning-making and free energy
The MMM was formulated without reference to the free energy 
principle and predictive processing models of the brain, but there are 
striking convergences between them. The reason for outlining these 
parallels here is to buttress the notion that making meaning does not 
simply enrich subjective experience. It serves an adaptive function 
which is critical for survival.
The free energy principle (FEP) is a “mathematical formulation of 
how adaptive systems… resist a natural tendency to disorder” (Friston, 
2010, p. 127). To maintain fragile physiological systems and sensory 
states within life-compatible bounds, self-organizing systems must 
resist surprise. As “free energy is an upper bound on surprise” 
(Friston, 2010, p. 128), minimizing free energy minimizes surprise. 
Importantly for our discussion of meaning-making, “minimizing 
surprise is the same as maximizing the sensory evidence for an agent’s 
existence” (Friston, 2010, p. 128).
The FEP views the brain as an inference machine that maximizes 
evidence for its existence by generating models that predict and 
explain its sensory inputs. These models are essentially beliefs about 
the probable causes of its sensory inputs. They are updated within a 
hierarchical nervous system that tests predicted belief outcomes 
against actual sensory inputs at each level of the system. The 
hierarchical structure of the system allows belief updating at each level 
to reduce “prediction error” (the difference between predicted sensory 
input based on prior belief and actual sensory input).
There are two strategies that an organism may use to minimize 
surprise, or reduce prediction error. One, called perceptual inference, 
is via learning, or updating generative models so that new models 
more closely fit incoming sensory data. The other, termed active 
inference, involves taking action to sample data which more closely 
conform with existing models. The two strategies may be viewed as 
either changing the model to fit the world, or changing the world to 
fit the model (Seth, 2013).
The MMM, while not a mathematical model, is built around 
similar dynamics and motivational underpinnings. The FEP holds that 
living organisms are primarily motivated by a resistance to disorder 
(italics in original; Friston, 2010, p. 127). The MMM grew out of a 
recognition that “humans strive to create and maintain order, 
certainty, and value in light of challenges and abruptions in their 
endeavors to do so” (Heine et al., 2006, p. 89). Under the FEP account 
humans, construct generative models that are best guesses as to causes 
of their interoceptive and sensory inputs. Under the MMM account, 
humans construct mental representations aimed at making sense of 
their internal and external environments. Disruptions in 
meaningfulness under MMM are treated as “expectancy violations” 
(Proulx et al., 2012), which are analogous to prediction errors under 
FEP . To reduce prediction error under FEP , the subject changes the 
model to fit the world, or else changes the world to fit the model 
(perceptual or active inference). Under MMM, the subject most often 
uses assimilation or accommodation to resolve expectancy violations. 
In language borrowed from Piaget (2000), the MMM describes how 
these processes work: “Experiences that are inconsistent with our 
schemata will arouse a sense of disequilibrium, which in turn motivates 
an assimilation of the experience so that it matches our schemata, or 
an accommodation of our schemata so that they account for the 
experience” (Proulx and Inzlicht, 2012, p. 325).
Finally, a critical axiom of the FEP is that minimizing surprise is 
the same as maximizing the sensory evidence for an agent’s existence. 
Extending our analogy with the MMM, this suggests that the process 
of making meaning (reducing expectancy violation, or by analogy, 
prediction error) maximizes evidence for the agent’s existence. This

Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
has interesting implications. An illustration would be: ‘In making 
sense of my experience, I feel more confident that I exist. ’ The negative 
of this contingent relationship between making meaning and existing 
would be: ‘When I cannot make any sense of my experience, I doubt 
my own existence. ’ In this way, the logic of the FEP offers an interesting 
perspective on how a sense of meaning supports continued existence, 
and conversely, how losing a sense of meaning coincides with suicidal 
thoughts or actions.
While making meaning, or reducing prediction error, does not 
always carry life or death consequences, it seems reasonable that 
evolution favors agents that can successfully resist disorder within 
their environmental niche. Because infants lack the physical capacity 
and repertoire of prior experience to use predictive processing 
effectively, their sensory states must be intuited by caregivers, who 
employ perceptual and active inference to help them resist disorder 
(Fotopoulou and Tsakiris, 2017 ). The two-person developmental 
origin of minimizing surprise explains, through the analogy between 
making meaning and minimizing surprise, how the sense of 
connection within the attachment relationship is the prototype for 
one’s sense of meaning later in life.
Meaningfulness, narratives, and 
attachment
Narrative is how we  knit disparate encounters with our 
environment into a meaningful form. As Adler et al. (2016)  state, 
“narratives communicate not just the events that are central to the life 
of an individual but the meaning these events hold for the narrator. ” 
The construction of narrative enables identity, an “inner story of the 
self that integrates the reconstructed past, perceived present, and 
anticipated future to provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning” 
(McAdams, 1995, p. 365). Scholars from different disciplines generally 
agree that narratives have a beginning, a middle, and an (anticipated) 
end (Stern, 1992). This obtains for the narrative we call the self as well. 
In the FEP account, the self-narrative is a story of resisting disorder. 
Its beginnings, and its inevitable conclusion, are bounds upon the 
dramatic range of possibilities that comprise its middle. As we have 
seen, this middle is a story of finding, losing, and re-finding meaning.
The self-narrative begins within the matrix of attachment. As 
mentioned above, attachment interactions between infant and 
caregiver are remembered and represented as internal working models 
(Bowlby, 1969), or as representations of interactions with others that 
have become generalized ( Stern, 1985), and serve as relationship 
expectancies against which new or imagined experiences with others 
are compared. The invariant qualities of the subjects and objects which 
comprise these representations are woven into narratives about oneself 
and others, and importantly, narratives about self with others 
(Moutoussis et al., 2014). The linking of thoughts, feelings, memories, 
desires, hopes and fears into a story with temporal continuity supplies 
an identity, a story of ‘me. ’ A measure of coherence may be found 
“even amidst manifest arbitrariness, illogic, senselessness, and 
incoherence” (Freeman, 2010, p. 185), and “includes within itself all 
of the equivocations, contradictions, struggles and hidden messages 
that find expression in personal life” (Gallagher, 2000, p. 20).
Recent accounts of narratives as active inference within a predictive 
processing system have highlighted their adaptive and evolutionary 
value. By organizing and condensing cognitive and affective elements of 
prior experience into relational themes, narratives can represent multiple 
events efficiently and meaningfully, which makes them ideal candidates 
for generative models that can be used predictively. As the way that agents 
minimize prediction error is through actively sampling their 
environment, it is crucial that agents recognize their own role in altering 
the environment which is sampled, i.e., in causing deeply hidden states. 
In this way, the process of minimizing prediction error results in refining 
the model of the self as an actor in the system, or as Hohwy and Michael 
(2017) put it, “Self-modeling is thereby a process that can be described in 
causal terms, as first finessing a model of the self, and then engaging that 
model in action, leading to further finessing of the model, and more 
action” (p. 376). The self-model constructed and refined in this manner 
as the hidden cause of active states may be viewed as a narrative that 
unifies “regularities or plotlines at different, interlocked time scales. Such 
a theory or narrative can be seen as an answer to the question: which kind 
of agent am I?” (Hohwy and Michael, 2017, p. 370).
In contrast to other models of a narrative self, the active inference 
self-model is, in part, pre-linguistic and unconscious. It is a narrative 
account in the sense that it subsumes events under higher order 
behavioral “regularities” over longer time scales, and in minimizing 
prediction error, both “constrains our interpretation of those events” and 
“actively shapes itself over time to align with those higher-level 
regularities” (Hohwy and Michael, 2017, p. 370). By enabling “cultural 
learning, ” active inference with attachment figures enables “further 
finessing” of the self-model. Infants recognize early on that other people 
are agents with intentions. Infants and young children apply agent models 
to the behavior of others in much the same way they apply agent models 
to their own actions, through the process of active inference. They 
represent the goals and strategies of others based upon their observed 
actions within environmental affordances, and structure their learning 
around these models, as is evident in their imitation of adults. By aligning 
with these intuited intentions, infants progressively conform self-models 
to the goals and strategies of the key objects in their world.
This is consonant with the model of natural pedagogy (Gergely 
and Csibra, 2005) as extended by Fonagy (1998) and colleagues in 
their model of epistemic trust, whereby “the very experience of having 
our subjectivity understood—of being mentalized—is a necessary 
trigger for us to be able to receive and learn from the social knowledge 
that has the potential to change our perception of ourselves and our 
social world” (Fonagy and Allison, 2014, p. 372).
By enabling cultural learning, active inference in interactions with 
others leads to better predictive models of the self (Hohwy and Michael, 
2017). In the FEP , free energy can be formulated as complexity minus 
accuracy (Friston, 2010). Narratives enable agents to decrease model 
complexity or increase model accuracy. As Bouizegarene et al. (2020, p. 21) 
states, “Narratives enter the generative model as prior constructs or beliefs 
that either enable more accurate explanations for an unfolding scenario or 
provide a simpler account, thereby minimising the complexity of belief 
updating” . They further speculate that these properties of narrative 
constructs account for their evolutionary value: “the capacity to build and 
share narratives evolved largely because they provide group members with 
the ability to engage in cooperative action by avoiding ‘unexpected’ states 
of uncoordinated or contextually inappropriate action; i.e., ‘this is how we 
do things here (and not in other ways)’” (p. 19). This presumptive 
evolutionary role for narratives is consistent with positing meaning-making 
as an existential need.
But perhaps the strongest argument favoring an evolutionary role 
for finding meaning comes from applying the FEP to attachment.

Hopkins (2016)  notes that “basic expectations connected with 
biological imperatives like homeostasis are woven into the functioning 
of the brainstem. ” Free energy resulting from deviations in prior 
homeostatic expectations (regarding hunger, thirst, pain and 
temperature regulation, etc.) necessitates action in the form of 
regulatory interoceptive and motor responses. Beginning in infancy, 
these responses are generated within “prototype emotions systems” 
outlined by Panksepp (1998), Watt and Panksepp (2009), and Watt 
(2012). These prototype emotional systems enable the infant to 
navigate the vagaries of the interpersonal world on which her 
survival depends.
Most of these systems are roughly divisible into those which 
promote social connection (LUST, PLAY , NURTURANCE, 
SEPARATION DISTRESS) and those which promote defense (RAGE 
and FEAR) (Watt, 2012). The motivational aims of these systems are 
often in direct opposition. As Watt puts it, “We cannot simultaneously 
reach out to give and receive love and affection, and at the same time 
protect ourselves from injury and disappointment” ( Watt, 2012, 
p. 103). Such conflict often arises within the context of attachment, 
which affords the infant the behavioral means of satisfying homeostatic 
regulatory needs she cannot meet herself. Hopkins (2016) cites the 
Strange Situation (Ainsworth and Bell, 1970) as an example of conflict 
within the attachment setting. In this situation, in which an infant is 
exposed to repeated separation distress, the generative models of an 
insecurely attached infant “seize up, becoming incapable of predicting 
whether an optimal sensorimotor trajectory will approach or avoid 
their mothers. ” Hopkins stresses that such seizing reflects overly-fitted, 
or excessively complex generative models of infant-
caregiver interactions.
Video microanalysis of infant-caregiver interactions reveal the 
origins of this excessive complexity in patterns of repeated mismatches 
or misattunements between infant and caregiver. Essentially, this 
refers to expectancy violations within the infant-caregiver dyad, or in 
FEP terms, significant prediction error. When left unrepaired, this 
leads to infants not feeling known by or knowing their caregivers, 
insecure attachment, and predicts future difficulties with social 
connectedness (Tronick et al., 1998; Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz, 2008; 
Beebe et al., 2012a ,b; Beebe and Lachmann, 2014 ) or dissociation 
(Liotti, 2006). Or as Watt (2012, p. 103) states, “Continued powerful 
activation of systems for organism defense, aggravated by the failure 
of social bonding and the promotion of separation distress may 
eventually contravene in a fundamental way our very capacities for 
social connection. ”
This has significant adaptive and therefore evolutionary 
implications. Watt continues,
although prototype emotional systems for social connection were 
presumably selected because they enhanced homeostasis and the 
probability of successful procreation and survival, these systems 
for social connection became independent motivational systems of 
enormous power in the mammalian and hominid lines.  The 
vicissitudes of attachment and our desire to secure connections 
and the rewards of social connection and intimacy color the entire 
emotional trajectory of a human life (italics in original; 2012, 
p. 104).
This notion, which emerges from studies of “affective 
neuroscience” (see also Panksepp, 1998; Davis and Montag, 2019), 
suggests an evolutionary basis for the claim that the process of 
meaning-making is driven by the same motivation—a biologically and 
psychologically determined need for connection—which turns the 
infant and her caregiver towards each other in the primary attachment 
relationship. We shall now explore the process of meaning-making, or 
the subjective sense of meaningfulness, where its dynamics are laid 
bare by the dissolution of the self-narrative in dreams, psychosis, and 
psychedelic states.
Dreams
The above discussion of meaning-making has only confirmed 
Kingsland’s contention that we have evolved into an ape that takes 
things personally. One might argue from the above that the pursuit of 
meaningfulness and the construction of the narrative self (i.e., taking 
things personally) are parallel if not identical processes. The circular 
logic of the FEP suggests that our efforts to find meaning or to make 
sense of our world, to determine the probable hidden causes of our 
sensory data, are identical with the process of gathering evidence of 
our own existence, our models of ourselves. But what happens when 
our models of ourselves are deconstructed, when the “binding” 
necessary to assemble wholes from parts are taken offline?
Since Freud’s seminal work on dreams and the discovery of REM 
sleep ( Aserinsky and Kleitman, 1953 ), much scientific and 
philosophical discussion about dreams has debated whether or not 
dreams are meaningful. This has ranged from Freud’s position, that 
dreams are the “royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities 
of the mind” (Freud, 1900, p. 608) to Hobson and McCarley’s (1977) 
activation-synthesis hypothesis which holds that dream images are 
little more than random neuronal discharges, brain impulses which 
hold no meaning. Why has this become such a fierce debate? Why do 
humans look to dreams for their meaning?
This may be related to differences in the quality of the experience 
of meaningfulness between ordinary and non-ordinary states of 
consciousness. During ordinary waking consciousness, the process of 
meaning-making is seldom urgent, and usually takes place 
automatically, without our attention. We  are seldom aware of our 
attribution of meaning to experience. Y et this is not so while we dream. 
In dreams we  are absorbed by suspense. Meanings are uncertain, 
inconstant, and clamor for clarification. We  are rapt, anxious, 
exhilarated, thoroughly “entangled” (Ricoeur, 1992, p. 30; Pace-Schott, 
2013). We are immersed in a spatiotemporal here-and now (Windt, 
2010). We often awaken from dreams with a sense of incompleteness, 
wishing we could resume them to learn their conclusions, as if they 
were narratives with a determined outcome. But most dream 
experiences are fragmentary. Upon awakening, these fragments often 
seem so real that it takes a moment to realize they were only dreams. 
Y et they seem so significant that we want to remember their details so 
we can reflect on them when fully awake. We sense that the elements 
of a telling narrative are present, if only we could make sense of them.
The enhanced sense of meaningfulness we have in dreams may 
derive in part from feeling less defended while we  sleep, more 
vulnerable (Windt, 2018). It is not hard to imagine why this should 
be so, as we lose awareness of our surroundings and cannot move 
voluntarily. But this only touches on our physical vulnerability. In 
dreams, one loses (most of) one’s phenomenal sense of connection 
with one’s body. With this, the ties between the dreamer’s (minimal) 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org
self—the “I” in the dream—and the (waking) narrative self-
representation are notably loosened ( Windt and Metzinger, 2007). 
We  also lose connection with our interpersonal regulatory 
mechanisms and expectancies, our ways of ascertaining and 
validating who we are and how we belong in the world. Without 
these checks and balances on our generative models, and without 
the coherent self-narratives in which our defenses are subtly 
interwoven, we become immersed headlong in imagined scenarios 
(Windt, 2015) which evoke our deepest fears and wishes. In dreams 
we contact the subliminal fantasies in which some part of us dwells, 
a cauldron of repressed feelings, unexpressed desires, fears, hopes, 
buried memories; all of the veiled threats that we keep at bay while 
awake in order to interact effectively and efficiently with 
our environment.
It is precisely for these reasons that we instinctively regard dreams 
as meaningful, as revealing something of ourselves which 
we ordinarily deny access. It is as though we know we are creatures 
who hide unpleasant facts while we wake and visit these concealed 
truths while we sleep.
It is not that we are never similarly absorbed or vulnerable while 
awake. We can be carried away by stories, films, music, games, etc. 
What are we carried away from? Not by chance we answer with idioms 
like we ‘forget our selves’ or ‘lose our selves. ’ In losing ourselves, we are 
carried closer to the kind of mentation we experience regularly when 
we sleep, when the connection with our narrative selves is detached, 
reinforced by the physiological attributes of the sleep state. In dreams, 
access to the reality testing processes which are partially suspended in 
daydreams and other versions of absorption, is even more limited 
(Gerrans, 2014) by the near complete exclusion of sensory input and 
motoric action from the process of active inference.
Coleridge’s (1817) famous description of absorption in a fiction as 
a “willing suspension of disbelief ” (p.  208) may be  apt here. The 
willing suspension of disbelief equates to a voluntary easing or 
suspension of our wired-in tendency to search for the hidden causes 
of our sensory data. As this hierarchical system is constructed around 
top-down generative models of self, it becomes understandable why, 
in describing absorption, we choose idioms that convey the process of 
being carried away from, or losing our selves. In suspending disbelief, 
we  stop behaving, if only transiently, like apes that take things 
personally. Active inference continues, but attention, or precision-
weighting is shifted towards interoceptive signals ( Pianzola 
et al., 2021).
I offer the following to illustrate how the search for meaning in a 
dream is driven by the need for connection. Some friends and I had 
an email discussion of a recent newspaper article by a Stanford 
graduate student (Ball, 2022) about the cutthroat competition taking 
place on college campuses. The writer mentions the suicide of Katie 
Meyer, a Stanford undergraduate who was also a talented soccer 
goalkeeper. She died shortly after she received a disciplinary letter 
from the university administration. Her parents sued Stanford. 
Initially, I felt her parents were wrong to blame the administration for 
something that was likely considerably more complicated than a 
reaction to a letter. But after thinking further about Ball’s article, 
I realized that the Meyers lawsuit would focus needed attention upon 
student mental health. I wrote to my friends, “Ball asks, ‘What would 
it look like if we stopped more often to help others along in their 
course of study or to think through the course of life together?’ I think 
this is probably a good place to start…. ”
That night I  dreamt I  was engaged in some debate about the 
significance of Katie Meyer’s suicide. Katie Meyer was variously an 
adult, an infant, Black (she was Caucasian actually), and pregnant with 
Katie Meyer at the time of her death. Still at least half-asleep, I thought 
about what the infant Katie Meyer was able to accomplish in just two 
short weeks of life; how her action spoke in a way she could not 
represent in words, and compared this with what would have 
happened if had she thought about suicide, but decided against it. 
I was engaged in some discussion about this, though with whom was 
unclear. I argued that in choosing suicide, Katie may have had a vision 
of what her suicide would engender, of lasting systemic changes she 
might achieve. I felt badly that she would never know what her death 
achieved. I wondered whether this weakened my argument. When 
more fully awake, I gradually realized that Katie Meyer was not an 
infant, nor was she Black, nor pregnant with herself at the time she 
died. But I  recognized that my dream might illustrate what 
I am discussing in this paper: how we turn to dreams for a sense of 
meaningfulness. In the dream, I portrayed Katie Meyer’s decision to 
commit suicide as an act which gave her life lasting positive meaning— 
that instead of feeling shamed, victimized, and angry about Stanford’s 
disciplinary action, she may have died thinking about how her death 
would prevent other deaths and miscarriages of justice (by altering the 
way college administrations handle disciplinary issues and larger 
issues of mental health on campus, including support for victims of 
sexual assault), and may have died feeling some positive self-regard 
for making the ultimate sacrifice.
Hopkins (2016) discusses how dreams use counterfactual thinking 
to reduce complexity and thereby minimize variational free energy, in 
keeping with the FEP (Hobson et al., 2014). This theory underscores 
the critical biological role of REM sleep and dreams in allowing 
nocturnal synaptic pruning and model updating, which enables more 
adaptive and efficient generative models for daytime predictive coding 
(Hobson and Friston, 2012 ). It is consistent with Revonsuo’s 
evolutionary theories of dreams as trial simulations of threat and 
social reality (Revonsuo, 2000; Revonsuo et al., 2015). Hopkins holds 
that complexity in dreams is generated by emotional “overfitting” and 
is reduced in dreams through condensation, symbolization and 
reconsolidation of emotionally charged memories evoked by 
challenging daytime events, as first outlined by Freud (1900). Machine 
learning simulations suggest that complexity reduction during sleep 
may facilitate “aha” moments and insight (new meaning) ( Friston 
et al., 2017).
To illustrate, emotional overfitting (stress) arose in my dream 
from several sources: I felt pressured as the psychiatrist in the group 
to make a meaningful comment to my friends in our email discussion 
about mental health on campus; I was anxious that evening about a 
planned presentation to a group of psychotherapists/psychiatrists the 
following day of a paper I  wrote, which upon re-reading seemed 
poorly written; thinking about Katie Meyer’s parents having no 
premonition of their daughter’s suicide despite talking with her shortly 
beforehand stirred up my worst nightmare as a psychiatrist—failing 
to recognize the risk of suicide in a patient; the threatening letter 
Meyer received from the Stanford administration stirred up troubling 
fears in my own life related to a letter from an administrative body; 
finally, I worried about making a cogent argument to an imagined 
audience for this paper about the meaningfulness of dreams.
All of this is condensed and counterfactually resolved by 
representing Katie Meyer in the dream as being in utero [a critical 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org
plank of Hobson and Friston’s (2012) virtual reality generator theory 
is that REM sleep and “protoconsciousness” begin in utero]; as Black 
(casting her death, like that of George Floyd, as igniting a vast process 
of meaningful social change); pregnant with Katie Meyer (thus 
emphasizing paradoxically her suicide as a way of creating another life 
for herself).
The vague audience in the dream subsumes my college friends, the 
students in my class, whoever I imagine might oversee my practice, 
and whoever I imagine might read this paper. Some of the dream’s 
meaning, as mentioned, directly reflects feelings stirred by Katie 
Meyer’s suicide, but its affective intensity, the reason I had the dream, 
emerges from feeling that my attachment to important objects was at 
stake. It has a quality of immediacy, a sense of meaningfulness, that 
waking consciousness does not impart. It condenses events with a 
common effective valence suppressed by the narrative self in waking 
life to minimize surprise.
Psychosis
As with dreams, there is something in the nature of psychosis 
which invites questions of meaningfulness, of discerning within the 
unexpected juxtaposition of ideas, words, and actions in “madness” 
something which transcends reason. Many writers, including Kant, 
Hughlings Jackson, Wundt, and Freud have viewed madness as a 
waking dream (reviewed by Zarcone, 1979; Carhart-Harris, 2007). 
Hobson (1999) wrote, “We can therefore regard our own dreams as a 
proper basis for studying a normal process that becomes exaggerated 
in psychosis” (p. 22). In his short story, Eleanora, Poe (1845) wrote, 
“They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape 
those who dream only by night. ” In the words of Theseus in A 
Midsummer Night’s Dream,
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends (Shakespeare, 1595-
96/1974, 5.1.4).
Jaspers’s (1913/1997) concept of the delusional mood illuminates 
the phenomenology of meaning-making in psychosis. In this view, 
delusion formation is a way of making sense of an unaccountable 
change in one’s sense of reality, a new existential feeling ( Ratcliffe, 
2005) in which things suddenly seem unexpectedly significant, 
meaningful, though it is unclear how or why. “Patients feel uncanny 
and that there is something suspicious afoot. Everything gets a new 
meaning…. Something seems in the air which the patient cannot 
account for” ( Jaspers 1913/1997 , p.  98). And later, “‘I noticed 
particularly’ is the constant remark these patients make, though they 
cannot say why they take such particular note of things nor what it is 
they suspect. First they want to get it clear to themselves” (p. 100). 
Jaspers holds that this delusional atmosphere or mood engenders a 
“delusional experience of reality in which the environment offers a 
world of new meanings” (p. 99; emphasis in original in both quotes). 
He terms this experience the “primary delusion” and notes the great 
relief these new meanings bring to the patient.
This view has been affirmed by subsequent writers ( Arieti, 
1955/1974; Rycroft, 1962; Bowers and Freedman, 1966; Maher, 1974; 
Maher and Ross, 1984 ; Roberts, 1991 , 1992), and has been 
incorporated into the aberrant salience theory of delusion formation 
(Kapur, 2003; Roiser et al., 2008; Mishara and Fusar-Poli, 2013; Howes 
and Nour, 2016; Hayashi et al., 2021).
Jaspers emphasizes throughout his tome the importance of 
distinguishing between understanding (Verstehen) and explanation 
(Erklären). In his view, primary delusion arises from an “alteration in 
the personality” (p.  105), something that “in its essence cannot 
be understood” (p. 105; emphasis added), even if it may be explained 
further in terms of abnormal perceptions, affective states, and bodily 
feelings, which he elaborates with great nuance and specificity.
Parnas (2013) takes issue with Jaspers’s ‘no further understanding’ 
claim. Parnas and Sass (2001) view delusional mood as a prodromal 
stage of schizophrenia marked by an alteration in one’s sense of 
presence. “The most prominent feature of altered presence in the 
pre-onset stages of schizophrenia is an unstable sense of the 
groundedness, fullness, or reality of the self and a frequent, intimately 
correlated feeling of alienation from the world. The patient feels that 
a profound change is afflicting him, but he  cannot verbalize and 
pinpoint what exactly is changing” (p. 105). They regard this change 
as a pre-reflective alteration of consciousness which simultaneously 
disrupts one’s sense of being the subject of experience (ipseity) and 
one’s sense of embeddedness in the world (see also Ratcliffe, 2017), 
where “Ipseity refers to the experiential sense of being a vital and self-
coinciding subject of experience or first person perspective on the 
world” (Sass and Parnas, 2003, p. 428; emphasis in original).
In aligning their work within the phenomenological tradition in 
psychiatry (including Jaspers), Sass, Parnas and colleagues express this 
disruption in ipseity as a dysfunction of minimal selfhood (Nelson 
et  al., 2014 ). This formulation refines prevalent models of 
schizophrenic psychosis as a reflection of a disordered narrative self, 
recognizing that disruptions in minimal selfhood necessarily disrupt 
narrative self-models (Sass et al., 2011). In their ipseity-disturbance 
model, derived from empirical research using the highly specific 
Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE) scale ( Parnas 
et al., 2005), Sass and Parnas add richly to our explanation (Erklären) 
of the psychotic process, but stop short of rendering the experiential 
contents of this change more accessible to empathic understanding 
(Verstehen). We are still left to wonder, along with the patient, what is 
“afflicting” him, “what exactly” is changing?
The fundamental change noted by Jaspers and by Parnas and 
Sass in their patients is well-captured in the sense of perplexity in 
the statement: “Something is going on; do tell me what on earth is 
going on” (Jaspers 1913/1997, p. 98). What is implied is that ‘I’ no 
longer trust ‘my’ impressions, either about what is going on within 
‘me’ or ‘out there. ’ Experience takes on an uncanny “lurking” 
character, as captured by Conrad (1958/2013) in his analogy between 
the schizophrenic Trema (analogous to Jaspers’s delusional mood) 
and walking through a forest at night. “It remains undefined. It is the 
lurking itself. In that area between what is visible and what is 
‘behind’ the visible (e.g., the particular tree), what we  call the 
background, where what we  cannot grasp becomes uncanny” 
(p.  265). The simplest and most introspectively or empathically 
accessible way of describing what is changing is the patient’s felt 
sense of certainty about things,  or trust. This may be  a direct 
consequence of a confused sense of agency. This diminution of 
agency is experienced globally (thoughts, feelings, sensations, 
movement, etc.) “( Patient 21)-Things just happen to me now and 
I have no control over them. I do not seem to have the same say in 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
things any more. At times I cannot even control what I want to think 
about” (McGhie and Chapman, 1961). The first-person account of 
psychosis literature is rife with similar examples ( Fusar-Poli et al, 
2022). To save space, I  quote the conclusion of a review of this 
literature: “the multiform possible alterations in perception and 
cognition do lead rather reliably to the progressive loss of a sense of 
self and to the depersonalizing feeling of loss of control over one’s 
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that characterize the onset of an 
acute schizophrenic psychosis” (Freedman, 1974).
A faulty sense of agency has long been cited as a possible source of 
delusions of influence and control in schizophrenia (Frith, 1987; Daprati 
et al., 1997; Fletcher and Frith, 2009; Jeannerod, 2009), and experimental 
evidence suggests it can distinguish prodromal psychosis as well (Hauser 
et al., 2010). This distorted sense of agency and its accompanying sense 
of passivity—and thereby vulnerability— may be a direct impetus for the 
need to establish meaning, partly to explain this startling loss itself, but 
more so, to restore a sense of connection. A socially dependent organism 
might tolerate a loss of connection as long as homeostasis can 
be maintained autonomously, but a perceived loss of agency poses an 
immediate and dire threat to autonomous functioning. Closer inspection 
of the phenomenal experience of “disrupted ipseity” helps explain why 
compensatory efforts are aimed at restoring a sense of connection.
The intersubjective basis of the sense 
of reality
“Ipseity” refers to what it is like to be the subject of experience, or 
to have minimal selfhood (Zahavi and Parnas, 1998, pp. 689–691). It 
coincides with the ‘givenness’ of one’s experience as ‘mine. ’ When 
ipseity is disrupted, experience no longer feels automatically ‘given’ 
or ‘mine. ’
I think the main warning signal was my identity – the safety of 
knowing that I  was an “I” – was starting to crumble. I  became 
increasingly insecure about whether or not I really existed, or if I was 
only a character in the book or of being someone had made up. I was 
no longer certain of who was controlling my thoughts and actions; 
was it me, or was it someone else – the author maybe? I started 
feeling insecure about whether or not I was alive, really alive, because 
everything felt so empty and gray. In my diary I replaced “I” with 
“she” and after a while I started thinking like this as well: “She was 
walking to school. She was sad and wondering if she was going to 
die. ” And someplace within me, something was questioning if “she” 
was still “me” (Lauveng, 2012, p. 4).
While Zahavi (2014) argues that minimal self is a “pre-condition” 
for intersubjective experience, that self and other are not 
“co-constituted, ” other writers argue that minimal self experience is 
inseparable from intersubjective experience. Ratcliffe argues that “the 
most basic sense of self is indeed developmentally dependent upon 
interactions with other people. Furthermore, it is interpersonally 
sustained, and continues to depend upon other people” (2017, 
pp. 2–3). He maintains that “minimal self cannot be distinguished 
from an interpersonally constituted self, and that self-disturbances in 
schizophrenia are equally relational disturbances” (2017, p. 3).
Blankenburg describes something akin to disruption of ipseity in 
attributing the  schizophrenic prodrome to a loss of natural self-evidence 
or common sense. In this  account, “the healthiness of common sense 
rests on habituality. The natural self-evidence of everyday existence draws 
its nourishment from just such a habituality” (Blankenburg and Mishara, 
2001, p.  309). Habit and common sense are derived from “the 
intersubjective constitution of the life-world” (2001, p. 310). Blankenburg 
holds that through intersubjectivity “what occurs or does not occur 
between the family members—becomes internalized in the patient and 
plays some role in how the presuppositions for cognition, judgment, and, 
also, the ability to encounter others develop” (2001, pp. 309–10). These 
intersubjectively acquired presuppositions serve as standards of 
comparison for evaluating new situations. In the development of 
psychosis, this basis for comparison is somehow lost. Blankenburg quotes 
a 20 year old female patient diagnosed with schizophrenia:
What is it that I am missing? It is something so small, but strange, it 
is something so important. It is impossible to live without it. I find 
that I no longer have footing in the world. I have lost a hold in regard 
to the simplest, everyday things. It seems that I  lack a natural 
understanding for what is matter of course and obvious to others…. 
Every person knows how to behave, to take a direction, or to think 
something specific. The person’s taking action, humanity, ability to 
socialize...all these involve rules that the person follows. I am not able 
to recognize what these rules are. I am missing the basics.... It just 
does not work for me.... Each thing builds on the next.... I do not 
know what to call this.... It is not knowledge.... Every child knows 
these things! It is the kind of thing you just get naturally (pp. 307–08).
Blankenburg emphasizes that what this patient feels she is missing 
“is not only the knowledge of the naturally understood and matter-of-
course things of everyday life, it is also the manner in which she 
understands things to be this way or that” (p. 308). The loss of common 
sense therefore refers to a global change in the structure of intentionality, 
in the way possibilities are conceived, not just a lack of social knowledge. 
Importantly, the intentional possibilities opened through common sense 
arise from its intersubjective developmental origins in a matrix of “‘basic 
trust’ as the foundation of the person’s relationship to world” (p. 310).
Blankenburg’s loss of common sense, then, as illustrated by the 
young woman quoted above, is another way of conceptualizing the 
development of a state of perplexity, of uncertain meanings and 
possibilities, that Sass and Parnas describe as disrupted ipseity. Fuchs 
(2015), like these writers, links this process to its intersubjective 
origins, but adds “embodiment” to theory of mind-based explanations 
of intersubjectivity. “Bodily behavior is expressive, intentional, and 
meaningful within its context…. It constitutes a sphere of primary 
intercorporeality as the basis for all forms of intersubjectivity” 
(pp. 193–94). In this “enactive” view, compatible with earlier discussed 
active inference models, “organisms do not passively receive 
information from their environment which they then translate into 
internal representations; rather, they constitute or enact the world 
through their sensorimotor interactions with the environment” 
(p. 204). Meanings are continuously “co-constructed” with others. 
“We live in a shared life-world because we continuously create and 
enact it through our coordinated activities and ‘participatory sense-
making’” (p.  204). The rules governing these sense-making 
interactions are similar to those of Blankenburg’s common sense. 
Along with Blankenburg, Fuchs identifies “one most important 
element of this background” as “a basic sense of trust” (emphasis in 
original; p.  205). “This ‘bedrock’ of unquestioned certainties is a 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org
fundamental presupposition of the consensual understanding of a 
situation” (pp. 205–06).
Delusional mood results from the breakdown of this joint 
negotiation of meaning and basic trust in others. Fuchs therefore 
views delusions as a “relational phenomenon, ” or a breakdown in 
“enacting a world through interaction with others” (p. 208). A similar 
explanation may account for the kind of perceptual changes which 
take place in schizophrenia, too. To explain this, Fuchs (2008) calls on 
Husserl’s theory of perception. Each time we look at an object (e.g., a 
table), we only see a part of it, one angle of, it as it were. Y et we make 
implicit assumptions about it as if the whole object were given to us. 
Perception “overcomes its own limited perspective by intending the 
object through its nonseen aspects” (p.  281). Rather than simply 
recording observable aspects of an object like a camera, perception 
actively constitutes an object by synthesizing many intentive processes, 
including temporal processes, which enable experiencing a table as the 
same table seen at different times. According to Husserl, this rests on 
the presumption that other subjects could perceive hidden aspects of 
the table from other angles.
In this way, Fuchs continues, “the Other is always already 
copresent in my habitual way of perceiving objects” (p.  282). 
Intersubjectivity is thus an integral part of the constitution of 
conscious (and unconscious) perception. The process of apprehending 
meanings (of gazes, actions, stories, etc.) rests upon the same process 
of synthesizing the imagined perspectives of other subjects, and allows 
the experience of meaningful unity. Rather than viewing someone as 
contracting hip flexors on one leg, lifting that leg off the ground, 
shifting one’s weight to the other leg, extending that leg at the knee, 
etc., one experiences these actions as “walking. ” Fuchs (2008, p. 282) 
holds that this synthetic process is disturbed in schizophrenia, and 
that this disturbance may derive from the disruption in ipseity cited 
by Parnas and Sass.
How might this account for the altered perception Jaspers and 
others have described in the delusional mood? The habitual organizing 
principles that comprise common sense no longer apply. Removing 
intersubjectively derived (consensually validated or “known”) unifying 
meanings leaves an intentional void; perplexity and surprise reign. 
Salience, the relation of information to adaptive needs, can no longer 
be gauged by habitual associations or expectations. Everything feels 
significant, but without conventional prior meaning. Fuchs writes, 
“Single aspects or details of the perceptual field, now no longer framed 
and kept in distance by active intention, may become prominent, leap 
at the perceiving subject, catch him or penetrate into him. Especially 
the gaze of others, the quintessence of expression, obtains a captivating 
and piercing power” (p. 283).
Linking the sense of reality to 
attachment
We will return to these circumstances later in discussing 
psychedelic states. In summarizing our discussion of psychosis thus 
far, we have seen that meaning is intersubjectively constituted; that its 
disruption leads to intolerable perplexity or uncertainty; that this 
creates an urgent search for meaning, and that new meaning, albeit 
delusional, affords great relief. The relational origins of meaning-
making in intersubjective processes suggests that disruptions of ipseity 
in the psychotic prodome may signify threats to one’s sense of connection 
(attachment), and that the quest to re-establish meaningfulness is at core 
a wish to restore connection. This hypothesis does not minimize genetic 
or neurodevelopmental contributions to the development of 
schizophrenia or psychosis in general. It is intended only to address 
triggers of psychosis and suggest a context for treatment.2
Ratcliffe (2017)  endorses the idea that the minimal self is 
interpersonally constituted. In Ratcliffe’s view, our experience of things 
is always influenced by how we imagine another person is, or could 
be, experiencing those things. “The kind of confidence we have in our 
own beliefs involves their rootedness in a consensus world; and the 
significance that attaches to things -what we anticipate from them- is 
shaped by relations with others” (p.  21). In Ratcliffe’s view, our 
common sense (borrowing Blankenburg’s notion), our pre-reflective 
awareness of how we  belong in the world, is intersubjectively 
determined. “The ordinarily presupposed sense of confidence or 
certainty, in which the modalities of intentionality are rooted, 
implicates other people through and through” (p. 21).
The loss of common sense in the prodrome to schizophrenia 
signals a loss of the “ basic capacity for trust” (emphasis in original; 
p. 19), a prerequisite for intersubjective experience. Recognizing a link 
between a loss of the capacity for trust and the disruption of ipseity in 
prodromic schizophrenia posited by Sass and Parnas, Ratcliffe 
suggests that, at least in certain cases, the onset of schizophrenia may 
be linked to trauma. He mentions an often overlooked historical detail 
in the well-known case of M. Sechehaye’s patient with schizophrenia, 
“Renee. ” Renee mentions that she began having bouts of unreality 
around the “same period I learned my father had a mistress and that 
he made my mother cry. This revelation bowled me over because I had 
heard my mother say that if my father left her, she would kill herself ” 
(Renee, 1951, p. 22). In her state of unreality, when she “looked at a 
chair or a jug, I thought not of their use or function – a jug not as 
something to hold water and milk, a chair not as something to sit in 
– but as having lost their names, their functions and their meanings; 
they became “things” and began to take on life, to exist” (pp. 55–56). 
Ratcliffe highlights a link between Renee’s feared loss of connection 
with her mother and her sense of unreality, but he might also have 
pointed out that Renee’s sense of reality returned dramatically when 
her therapist, M. Sechehaye, to whom Renee transferred many of her 
feelings and fears and to whom she referred as Mama, conducted a 
well-timed “symbolic realization. ” She gave Renee an apple in a play-
acting role mimicking breast-feeding that allowed Renee to feel that 
Mama loved her. Renee tells us that immediately afterwards,
“I realized that my perception of things had completely changed. 
Instead of infinite space, unreal, where everything was cut off, 
naked and isolated, I saw Reality, marvelous Reality, for the first 
time. The people we encountered were no longer automatons, 
phantoms, revolving around, gesticulating without meaning; they 
were men and women with their own individual characteristics 
their own individuality. It was the same with things. They were 
useful things, having sense, capable of giving pleasure” 
(pp. 105–06).
2 All of the authors whose studies of psychosis are discussed and/or cited 
in this section specifically make a similar acknowledgement.

Following this, subsequent losses and reinstatements of Renee’s 
sense of reality could be reliably traced to her sense of connection or 
disconnection from Mama.
Of course, this is only one case, but it remains one of the best 
documented case studies in the literature on psychosis. It strongly 
suggests a causal link, if not an outright identity, between a sense of 
connection and a sense of meaningfulness. There is a rich, if somewhat 
neglected, body of literature which views psychosis as a meaning-
making process ( Arieti, 1955/1974; Bentall, 2013; Martindale and 
Summers, 2013; Charles, 2017; Garrett, 2019, [see footnote p. 10 for 
an expanded reference list]; Ruffalo, 2019 ; Tan, 2022 ), and its 
treatment a process of examining these meanings ( Larsen, 2004; 
Attard et  al., 2017 ). Studies also suggest, consistent with Renee’s 
treatment, that the key element in recovery from psychosis is 
establishing a trusting relationship with the therapist ( Arieti, 
1955/1974; Winnicott, 1971; Stanghellini and Lysaker, 2007; Hartley, 
2011; Koehler et al., 2013; Charles, 2017; Marcus, 2017; Garrett, 2019; 
Ruffalo, 2019; Tan, 2022). Trust arises from a long-term commitment 
on the part of the therapist to grasp the narrative meaning (make 
sense) of the psychotic person’s hallucinatory and delusional (and 
other) experiences, very often by tracing them back to the phenomenal 
states discussed above: a loss of ipseity, a state of perplexity, diminished 
sense of agency, trust, meaningfulness, or pre-reflective common sense.
Or perhaps just as likely, it arises from making a long-term 
commitment, period (Hawley, 2014). This aligns with the idea that 
psychosis is an attempt to find new meaning when one can no longer 
trust anything, when (nearly) all connections stop making sense. Ogden 
(1980) describes “schizophrenic conflict” as “a tension between wishes 
to maintain a psychological state in which meaning can exist versus 
actual attacks on the capacities to create and maintain meaning” (p. 516). 
For “heuristic” purposes, he outlines four “stages” of this conflict, which 
include pre-psychotic and psychotic stages, and how these manifest in 
the therapeutic relationship through projective identification. In this 
in-depth case study, a person with schizophrenia (Phil) enters treatment 
in a state in which nothing has any meaning for him, all experience is 
devoid of affective value and therefore interchangeable; he does not even 
have a dysphoric sense of meaninglessness. He shows no engagement 
with the therapist. After a few months of regular sessions, he begins to 
project a sense of meaninglessness onto the therapist. Through projective 
identification, he begins to experience meaninglessness himself, but also 
begins to attach some meaning to things. This leads to a stage of overt 
psychosis (auditory hallucination, thought blocking and paranoia), but 
also to beginning to value his therapist. In this stage, overt psychosis is 
seen as a sign of progress towards resolving the “schizophrenic conflict” 
about experiencing meaning. This coincides with viewing the therapist 
“as a person who may be able to help with one’s frightening experiences” 
(p. 525). Finally, after 2 years of intensive therapy, Phil enters the stage of 
“symbolic thought. He says, “‘I’m able to think now. I could not before. 
Now that I can think, I can know what I’ve been thinking about’” (p. 527).
Ogden concludes, “In the course of the resolution of the 
schizophrenic conflict, the patient allows progressively more attention 
to, organization of, and attachment of meaning to his perceptions” 
(p.  528). In essence, Ogden sees schizophrenic psychosis as a 
manifestation of unconscious conflict between the wish to have 
meaningful experience and a protective need to limit the experience 
of meaningfulness. The balance of these conflicting forces is altered 
through gradual trust in the psychotherapeutic relationship via 
constructive projective identification, a process that involves both 
fantasied projection and real interpersonal interaction. He coins the 
term “actualization fantasy” in “an attempt to address the interface 
between the sphere of psychological meanings and representations 
(e.g., thoughts, motivations, and fantasies) and the sphere of the 
person’s capacities to create meanings and representations” (p. 530). 
The salient point Ogden calls attention to here is the vital link in 
psychosis between the intersubjective and interpersonal interaction with 
the therapist and the capacity to experience meaning.
Models of psychosis and models of 
dreams
The previous section was meant to extend what Jaspers termed 
understanding (Verstehen) of delusional mood in a way which might 
allow a deeper dialog with someone who feels as if “something’s going 
on. ” This section will focus on further explaining ( Erklären) 
this feeling.
The main themes discussed above, losing one’s sense of meaning, 
connection, agency, control, and trust can all be related to expectancy. 
This bring us back to the interesting observations mentioned in the 
introduction, that there are some psychometric measures on which 
people with psychosis outperform “controls” ( Dakin et  al., 2005). 
There is a voluminous literature on the topic of resistance to visual 
illusions in people with schizophrenia. The interested reader is 
referred to reviews by Notredame et al. (2014), King et al. (2017), and 
Costa et al. (2023) . It is evident that further research is needed to 
resolve some contradictory data and competing explanations, but 
there is robust agreement that people with schizophrenia are less 
susceptible than controls to visual illusions, most notably to the 
Müller-Lyer, Ebbinghaus, and hollow mask illusions. This resistance 
to illusions is not limited to visual illusions. For example, it also 
includes the tactile/proprioceptive-based force-matching illusion 
(Shergill et al., 2003, 2005). Several plausible explanatory models have 
been proposed, including Bayesian accounts ( Corlett et  al., 2009; 
Fletcher and Frith, 2009 ; Adams et  al., 2013 ), circular inference 
models, (Jardri and Deneve, 2013; Notredame et al., 2014; Leptourgos 
et al., 2022), source monitoring deficits (Nelson et al., 2014; Cannon, 
2015) and difficulty accessing personal experience as context 
(Hemsley, 2005). There are other explanations as well. Whether the 
emphasis is upon reduced precision of top-down prior beliefs or 
increased precision-weighting of bottom-up sensory signals, a 
common element in these models is that inference in psychosis is 
significantly less influenced by prior experience, or expectancy (Dima 
et al., 2009).
The accounts mentioned above all attempt to explain a deficit or 
abnormality in pre-psychotic or psychotic thinking, even though the 
data they analyze reflect a superior (more accurate) performance 
among schizophrenic subjects compared with controls. The 
presumption that perceptual experiences in people with schizophrenia 
are maladaptive has significant downstream consequences in the 
treatment setting, particularly with regard to establishing trust in the 
therapeutic relationship. For reasons too complex to discuss here, 
formulations which view psychosis as meaning-making (Johnstone 
et al., 2011; Basset et al., 2014 ) or adaptive (Scheepers et al., 2018 ; 
Lancellotta and Bortolotti, 2019) have had difficulty gaining traction 
within the larger mental health community, despite documented 
successful outcomes and “consumer” satisfaction. Seeing resistance to 
illusion as an adaptive response to ambiguity, one which allows a fresh 
take on conflict or challenging situations without canalized 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org
interpretations, is a necessary and empathic step toward helping 
people with psychosis establish the trust needed to (re-)access the 
world of intersubjectively shared meanings.
It is also a step toward de-pathologizing the process of meaning-
making in psychosis (Johnstone et al., 2011). Seeing objects outside of 
their everyday contexts is exactly what takes place in dreams. Currently 
accepted dream theories—seeing REM sleep as critical for optimizing 
the brain’s generative model of the world (Hobson and Friston, 2012), or 
seeing dreams as rehearsals for threat perception and avoidance 
(Revonsuo, 2000) or simulations of social reality ( Revonsuo et  al., 
2015)—emphasize the evolutionary or adaptive value of dreaming. 
Recognizing the parallel between meaning-making in dreams and the 
resistance to illusions in psychosis builds supports for the view that the 
meaning-making process in psychosis is an alternative mode of 
consciousness with certain adaptative advantages. This is not a radical 
claim that psychosis is desirable or healthy, but that as a meaning making 
process, it may enable vulnerable individuals to move through a 
pre-psychotic phase of untenable conflict, unbearable meaninglessness 
or anxious perplexity in the same way that dreams, even nightmares, may 
prepare people to cope with challenging fears or stressors.
Nielsen and Germain (2000) have suggested
the observation that interactive character imagery is virtually 
universal to dreaming could lead forthright to a theory of 
dreaming as simulation of attachment relationships. Attachment 
relationships (Bowlby, 1969) are also fundamental to survival and 
may have been as essential to threat mitigation as were the 
behavioral strategies of running from predators and disasters…. 
(S)uch a socio-emotional function for dreaming would still have 
clear adaptive significance for dreams occurring today.
Psychedelics and the loss of 
expectancy
In this section, we will explore the process of meaning-making in 
psychedelic states, particularly those on the way to, during, and 
following ego dissolution. Here, meaning-making is tied to the loss of 
expectancy. This will extend the argument for the adaptive value of 
meaning-making in dreams and psychosis, as well as the argument 
that meaningfulness represents a symbolic satisfaction of basic human 
attachment needs. Put slightly differently, the compelling human quest 
for meaning derives from evolutionarily programmed developmental 
needs for connection in order to assure safety and survival.
The meaning-enhancing properties of psychedelics have long 
been recognized (see Hartogsohn, 2018 for a summary; Cohen, 1964; 
Griffiths et al., 2006; Belser et al., 2017 ; Preller et al., 2017; Barrett 
et al., 2018; Miceli McMillan, 2020). Subjects often describe this as a 
direct perceptual experience. On mescaline, Huxley (1954) witnessed 
“a bunch of flowers shining with their own inner light and all but 
quivering under the pressure of the significance with which they were 
charged” (p. 5). Ordinary books on shelves became “lapis lazuli books 
whose color was so intense, so intrinsically meaningful, that they 
seemed to be on the point of leaving the shelves to thrust themselves 
more insistently on my attention” (p. 5). On mescaline, “The mind 
does its Perceiving in terms of intensity of existence, profundity of 
significance” (p. 5).
This new expanded significance, or salience, coincides with 
unbinding the self-representation (Letheby and Gerrans, 2017), or what 
is often called ego dissolution. The directly felt salience of objects during 
psychedelic-induced ego dissolution is phenomenologically similar to 
that experienced in psychosis. Matussek (1952/1987) writes (of 
psychosis), “ Abnormal significance is perceptually encountered as an 
integral part of the object. It is not primarily deduced, thought out, or 
dredged up in some other way from our thoughts, but rather experienced 
directly as inherent in the object” (p. 98). These and similar observations 
suggest that the process of meaning-making in both states is altered from 
that which takes place during ordinary waking consciousness. Normally, 
meaning is apprehended as an outgrowth of perceived relationships or 
connections between things (Baumeister, 1991), and is intersubjectively 
and culturally influenced by the meanings attributed to the object or 
event by others. In psychedelic ego dissolution and psychosis, meaning 
is felt to inhere in the object; one feels as if in touch with the object’s 
“Is-ness” (Huxley, 1954, p. 5). In the predictive processing model, the 
sense of directly felt expanded significance or meaning may represent the 
phenomenological embodiment of a shift towards increased precision of 
“bottom-up” signaling relative to “top-down” generative modeling 
(Millière et al., 2018; Timmermann et al., 2018). This means sensory 
input is no longer (as) constrained by prior expectation (Swanson, 2018, 
p. 16). As Letheby and Gerrans eloquently state, “ Attention is no longer 
guided exclusively by adaptive and egocentric goals and agendas; salience 
attribution is no longer bound to personal concern” ( Letheby and 
Gerrans, 2017, p. 6). As this model would predict, subjects on LSD show 
the same resistance to the hollow mask illusion as people with 
schizophrenia (Passie, T., unpublished study reported in Caragol, 2009).
In a psychodynamic model, the sense of expanded significance 
reflects the loss of defense mechanisms which would ordinarily 
modulate affective intensity. This could account for the 
unaccustomedly powerful emotions one feels during ego dissolution, 
as well as the appearance of unitive feelings. As psychedelics “relax” 
the precision of prior expectations (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019), 
or “unbind” multisensory integration from models of self (Klee, 1963; 
Letheby and Gerrans, 2017) — really, models of self-with-other — 
then cautionary (defended) approaches to object relations based upon 
historically-derived expectations of frustration, disappointment, 
misattunement, trauma etc. no longer guide action policy.
This has important implications for attachment and feeling 
connected. Whether explained psychodynamically as a suspension of 
defensiveness, or computationally as a reduced precision of 
hierarchically-generated models of self(−with-other), psychedelics 
consistently foster feelings of increased connectedness with others, and 
more globally, unitive feelings, or feelings of oceanic boundlessness 
(Belser et al., 2017; Cosimano, 2017; Watts et al., 2017; Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2018; Kałużna et al., 2022). As discussed above, one’s sense of 
meaningfulness is closely tied to recognizing how things are connected 
or related. It is not surprising, therefore, that many people consider the 
unitive feelings they experience on psychedelics to be among the most 
meaningful experiences of their lives (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008).
As stated above, the process of meaning-making in psychedelic-
induced ego dissolution is tied to the drug’s interference with one’s 
capacity to attend selectively to personally relevant information, and to 
integrate information into narrative models of self-with other. This may 
be  seen in the early stages of psychedelic-induced ego dissolution, 
where a loss of ipseity strikingly similar to that which presages the 
onset of psychosis occurs. In both, one’s implicit expectancies in 
relation to internal states is disturbed, and previously unconscious 
somatic and interoceptive sensations unwillingly become a focus of 
attention. “The entire body is felt; instead of being taken for granted, it 
Fischman 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1413111
Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org
becomes the entire focus of attention. Things that ordinarily occur out 
of awareness come into the foreground: the fillings in one’s teeth, the 
contractions of the stomach, and the urinary and anal sphincters, the 
pulsations of the arteries, the pounding of the heart, the sensations of 
the skin and muscles” (Savage, 1955, p. 7). The smooth concatenation 
of expectancies regarding self-states required to enable efficient 
allocation of attentional resources “to egocentric goals and agendas, ” to 
function “like an ape that takes things personally, ” is disturbed. The 
meaning-making process is disrupted
Attachment and expectancy
Attachment is predicated upon generating expectancies of one’s 
own and one’s caregiver’s states and actions. Video microanalysis of 
mother–infant interaction shows that contingency-based expectancies 
at age 3–4 months regulate interpersonal behavior and predict the 
quality of attachment behavior at 12 months (Beebe et  al., 2010). 
Contingency detection means anticipating how each partner’s actions 
affect oneself and one’s partner (Haith et al., 1988). Infants detect and 
respond to contingencies from birth (Papousek and Papousek, 1975; 
DeCasper and Carstens, 1981 ). Remembering these contingencies 
enables the construction of predictive sensorimotor schemas or 
internalized models of being with others (Bowlby, 1969; Stern, 1985). 
These schemas are the basis for implicit relational knowing (Stern, 
1992; Lyons-Ruth et al, 1998, Lyons-Ruth, 1999), or knowing and 
being known (Beebe et al., 2012a,b; Beebe and Lachmann, 2014).
The Still-Face experiment, ( Tronick et al., 1978) demonstrates 
how the disruption of expectancy, at a basic level, is a catastrophic 
threat to secure attachment. This frames the evolutionary need for 
strategies to adapt to expectancy disruptions. Y et secure attachment 
does not require highly contingent responses. In fact, “mid-range” 
maternal contingent responses turn out to be  optimal for secure 
attachment (Beebe et al., 2012a). This is because discrepancies from 
expected interactions enable learning and adaptation, or updating of 
generative models, through important disruption and repair processes 
(Tronick, 1989; Tronick and Cohn, 1989; Beebe and Lachmann, 1994; 
Lachmann and Beebe, 1996). Expectancy disruption is, by definition, 
a disruption of known relations between things, a disruption of 
meaning systems. This directly links the process of finding meaning 
with the process of disruption and repair necessary to establish 
secure attachment.
Disrupting expectation is what enables the sense of expanded 
significance or meaningfulness under psychedelics (Fischman, 2019), 
and what allows dream content to unfold outside the rules of causation 
and logic. Together, the parallel between psychedelic states and dreams 
(Kraehenmann, 2017) and the critical role of expectancy disruption 
and repair in establishing secure attachment supports Nielsen and 
Germain’s (2000) theory mentioned above that dreams are simulations 
of attachment relationships and therefore have adaptive significance.
Conclusion: meaningfulness and 
connection
The capacities to feel life as meaningful and to feel human 
connection have a common root in attachment relationships. Secure 
attachment affords a needed base from which one ventures out to 
discover new meanings in the world. It is no coincidence that the 
language we use to define ‘meaning’ — “shared mental representations 
of possible relationships among things, events, and relationships… 
meaning connects things” (Baumeister) — is the language we use to 
describe bonds between people. Psychodynamically, understanding 
someone or something affords peace of mind because it re-evokes the 
security of attachment. Our motivation to find meaning in life derives 
from our evolutionarily programmed need for proximity and support.
In disrupting our self-models, dreams, psychosis, and psychedelic 
states each serve as windows on the process of making connections 
between things. Each affords an opportunity to create meaning outside 
of the usual routes traversed by expectancy. It behooves us to regard 
the capacity to find meaning unbiased by egocentric agendas as useful, 
perhaps even evolutionarily vital.
Such an approach is inherent in theories and intuitions which see 
dreams as “the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities 
of the mind” (Freud, 1900, p, 608); as “protoconsciousness” (Hobson 
and Friston, 2012); or as evolutionarily necessary simulations of threat 
or social reality (Revonsuo, 2000; Revonsuo et al., 2015). It is implied 
in therapeutic formulations which see psychosis as an individual’s 
struggle to make sense of a life that has lost meaning (Johnstone et al., 
2011; Basset et al., 2014 ; Friesen, 2022) and which emphasize the 
critical role of the informed and committed psychotherapist in 
rebuilding an individual’s sense of trust. It is also present in 
approaching psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy as an opportunity to 
gain new perspectives and to experience first-hand that what 
we generally accept as “reality” is only a model of what we expect to see.
It is re-assuring to know that we  do not always have to take 
things personally.
For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see 
face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as 
I am fully known.3
