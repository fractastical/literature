SUMMARY
The action observation network (AON) has been extensively studied using short, isolated motor acts. How
activity in the network is altered when these isolated acts are embedded in meaningful sequences of actions
remains poorly understood. Here we utilized intracranial electrocorticography to characterize how the ex-
change of information across key nodes of the AON—the precentral, supramarginal, and visual cortices—
is affected by such embedding and the resulting predictability. We found more top-down beta oscillation
from precentral to supramarginal contacts during the observation of predictable actions in meaningful se-
quences compared to the same actions in randomized, and hence less predictable, order. In addition, we
ﬁnd that expectations enabled by the embedding lead to a suppression of bottom-up visual responses in
the high-gamma range in visual areas. These results, in line with predictive coding, inform how nodes of
the AON integrate information to process the actions of others.
INTRODUCTION
How the brain processes the observed actions of others is a
question of enduring interest. The network of brain regions re-
cruited by action observation (action observation network,
AON) has been mapped in some detail by having monkeys and
humans view isolated actions, typically lasting a couple of sec-
onds, such as grasping or manipulating objects. It includes no-
des around the medial occipital, supramarginal, and precentral
gyri also activated during the execution of similar actions.
1–3
Outside the laboratory, actions seldom occur as isolated 2-s
acts. Instead, individual acts, such as grasping a knife, follow
each other in somewhat predictable order within meaningful se-
quences to achieve an overarching intention, such as preparing
breakfast.
4,5 How does the predictability of the acts within such
sequences inﬂuence how they are processed? How is informa-
tion integrated across the nodes of the AON, and how does
the predictability of an act within a sequence inﬂuence this infor-
mation ﬂow? These questions are at the heart of this study.
That predictions play a key role in perception, and manifest as
feedback information ﬂow in the beta band from higher brain re-
gions to lower sensory brain regions, has become prominent in
neuroscience.
6,7 In many models of predictive coding or active
inference, these feedback predictions are thought to attenuate
the response to expected stimuli in lower, visual cortices. 6–8
Empirical evidence of whether such feedback is also increased,
and visual representations suppressed, within the AON when
acts become predictable remains scarce—despite these fea-
tures having been at the center of inﬂuential models of AON infor-
mation integration for decades.
9–13
Evidence that predictions are computed within premotor
cortices in the monkey AON comes from single-cell responses
depending on what action can be predicted to come next. 14–18
That neural response latencies to predictable observed actions
can be shorter in premotor than parietal cortices is compatible
with the notion that predictions could be transmitted from pre-
motor to parietal cortices. 19 In the human AON, action-related
information in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
response in parietal and premotor cortices depends on the
sequence in which acts are presented,
20 and electroencephalo-
gram (EEG) recordings reveal anticipatory activity in the AON
when movements are expected.
21 Unfortunately, whether infor-
mation in fMRI studies ﬂows from premotor to parietal cortices
remains unclear, as directional connectivity measures applied
to the BOLD signal are notoriously unreliable.
22 Tentative
analyses however are encouraging: using Granger causality

measures, participants playing charades seem to send more in-
formation from premotor to parietal cortices when guessing the
meaning sequences of gestures, 23 and using dynamic causal
modeling, seeing people move in unpredictable ways triggers
changes in ﬂow in the premotor to parietal direction.
24 Using
methods other than traditional fMRI would thus be important to
corroborate these ﬁndings.
What paradigm should be used? Different paradigms have
been developed to study predictions in the visual system. A care-
ful review concluded that the cleanest and most successful strat-
egy has been to contrast different sequences of stimuli: if stimuli
appear in a highly familiar order, they become expected, because
their probability is constrained by the preceding stimulus; if they
appear in random sequences, they become neutral, as their prob-
ability is unconstrained by previous stimuli. 8 Comparing re-
sponses to expected, neutral stimuli then provide a good mea-
sure of the effect of predictions. The term neutral differentiates
stimuli with a probability that is independent of the prior stimuli
from truly surprising stimuli, i.e., those occurring if an ordered
sequence predicts one stimulus, but a different stimulus is pre-
sented. Surprising stimuli trigger attentional processes that are
difﬁcult to disentangle from predictions, which is why their use
to study predictions has been discouraged.
8 Interestingly, con-
trasting stimuli in expected vs. random sequences has also
been helpful in revealing how cortical networks are altered
when words occur in meaningful sentences using fMRI and elec-
trophysiological measures,
25,26 and this this approach thus ap-
pears as a strong candidate to investigate the effect of predic-
tions and their suppressive effects also in the AON. As lessons
learned from visual neuroscience have led to the conclusion
that ‘‘experiments testing for ES (expectation suppression)
should employ a range of recording techniques under similar or
identical stimulation conditions’’
8 and that ‘‘time-resolved elec-
trophysiological measures may be especially useful,’’ 8 one
should ideally perform such experiments using a variety of
recording modalities, including EEG, traditional 3T fMRI, depth-
resolved 7T fMRI, and intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG).
Accordingly, we recorded a number of longer action sequences
that should be familiar to most participants (Figure 1; Table 1), and
we aimed to present them to participants in two forms: ﬁrst in their
intact, natural order, in which each act can be expected based on
the previous acts and our decade long experience with these ac-
tions, and second, in a scrambled order, in which the same individ-
ual acts are relatively neutral, i.e., their probability is only minimally
constrained by the previous acts. As simply cutting movies at the
transition between consecutive acts and randomizing the
sequence would introduce sudden visual changes in the scram-
bled sequence that are absent in the intact sequence, we recorded
the sequences with two cameras 45
/C14apart, and we alternated be-
tween the two views between acts in both the intact and scrambled
sequences. This ensured similar levels of visual transients in both
conditions (seeFigure S1 for a quantiﬁcation), with the predictabil-
ity of the individual acts now being the primary difference between
the sequences. We then compared intact vs. scrambled se-
quences using multiple recording methods across multiple
studies. Here we present data recorded from intracranial ECoG
measurements. Using the same stimuli while recording 3T fMRI re-
vealed that the information content in premotor and parietal
cortices was higher for intact sequences, showing that these re-
gions are sensitive to the predictability of observed actions, and
while recording EEG, that responses in electrodes over the occip-
ital lobe were suppressed in the intact sequences, in line with the
notion of expectation suppression.
20 Whether the information
ﬂow was increased in the premotor to parietal direction for intact
sequences could not be determined due to the limitations of the
methods. Using these stimuli while measuring BOLD activity in a
depth-resolved 7T fMRI study, we leveraged that feedback con-
nections from premotor to inferior parietal regions are known to
terminate in layers 3, 5, and 6 in the monkey, and we found that in-
formation was indeed increased at depths aligning with these
layers in the intact /C0scrambled contrast, and intersubject func-
tional connectivity conﬁrmed that this effect could originate from
premotor feedback.
27
As attributing BOLD activity at certain depths to feedback or
feedforward information remains tentative, particularly outside
of the visual cortices,
28 here we aim to leverage the unique prop-
erties of ECoG to provide independent evidence by leveraging
the observation that feedforward information ﬂow associated
with visual input and the feedback information ﬂow associated
with predictions are associated with directed information transfer
in distinguishable frequency bands, namely the gamma and beta
band, respectively.
6,29,30 Both the gamma and the beta bands
contain separable subbands with distinct functions. 31,32 Be-
tween the premotor and parietal lobes, the high-gamma (60–
90 Hz) and high-beta (20–30 Hz) frequency bands seem particu-
larly relevant to information integration,
33,34 and these bands will
therefore be our frequency ranges of interest. We expect two ef-
fects when comparing expected versus neutral acts using the
intact versus scrambled sequence contrasts: First, that the pari-
etal node of the AON, in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) should
receive more premotor feedback from the precentral gyrus
(PreCG) in the high-beta range for intact than scrambled se-
quences, and second, that visual response in the high-gamma
band should be suppressed in the visual node of the AON in the
middle occipital gyrus (MOG) for this intact compared to the
scrambled sequences ( Figures 1 A and 1B). We thus selected
ECoG electrodes in the precentral, supramarginal cortex and
MOG across 10 patients implanted with ECoG grids ( Figure 1C).
We selected those three regions because they encompass key
nodes of the AON and because we had a sufﬁcient number of pa-
tients with ECoG strips that encompassed pairs of these regions
to calculate measures of directed information transfer: seven pa-
tients had electrodes in the PreCG and SMG and six had elec-
trodes in the SMG and MOG ( Figure 1D).
RESULTS
Increased high-beta power in precentral and
supramarginal channels for expected actions
To investigate whether beta oscillations were indeed increased
for expected action sequences, as an increase in feedback infor-
mation may suggest, we calculated the power spectral density
for all movies in each condition and used a linear mixed effect
model (LME) to compare power across conditions. We found
that in the high-beta range, precentral and supramarginal re-
gions showed the hypothesized increase in power for the more

expected, intact compared to the scrambled condition (p < 0.05,
corrected) (Figures 2A and 2B). When we averaged the power at
the hypothesized high-beta frequency range (20–30 Hz) in each
person across all electrodes, we saw that the majority of sub-
jects had higher beta power in the intact condition, in both the
precentral (LME, t
(116) = 3.09, p = 0.002) ( Figure 2 A, inset left)
and the supramarginal region (LME, t (110) = 2.29, p = 0.02) ( Fig-
ure 2 B, inset left).
Reduced gamma power in middle occipital channels for
expected actions
To investigate the notion that expected actions show suppressed
feedforward signals in the gamma range in earlier visual cortices,
we quantiﬁed the power in the gamma range. We observed oppo-
site effects in earlier visual cortices and supramarginal cortices.
We found the hypothesized reduction of gamma power for the
expected, intact movies compared to the scrambled movies in
channels over the middle occipital cortices (p < 0.05, Figure 2C).
However, over the supramarginal cortices, we found signiﬁcantly
higher gamma power in intact compared to scrambled condition
(p < 0.05, Figure 2B). Examining the averaged power in the gamma
band (60–90 Hz), we found that most of the participants had higher
gamma power in the intact condition in the supramarginal (LME,
t
(110) = 3.12, p = 0.002) (Figure 2B, inset right) but higher gamma po-
wer in the scrambled condition in the middle occipital cortices
(LME, t(78) = /C02.64, p = 0.01) ( Figure 2C, inset right).

(A) We presented participants with movies of everyday hand actions lasting /C241 min in length, ﬁlmed simultaneously with two cameras 45 /C14apart, which were cut
into /C2430 individual motor acts lasting /C242s( Table 1). In the intact condition, the motor acts were presented in their original order but switching from one camera
view to the other at the transition between acts to introduce visual transients similar to those in the scrambled condition. In the scrambled conditio n, the acts were
presented in randomized order.
(B) We hypothesize that for intact sequences (top arrows), the parietal node of the action observation network in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) would receive
comparatively more feedback information (blue) from the premotor nodes in the precentral gyrus (PreCG) than for scrambled sequences (bottom arrows ). We
further hypothesized that for intact sequences, responses to the expected acts would be suppressed in the visual cortices in the middle occipital gyr us (MOG)
compared to the scrambled condition. Accordingly, feedforward visual information (red arrows) would be more prevalent in the scrambled sequences ( bottom
arrows). We expect feedforward information to be mainly in the gamma range (60–90 Hz) and feedback signals to be mainly in the high-beta range (20–30 Hz ); the

Temporal dynamics of beta and gamma power relative to
camera change
We next investigated the temporal dynamics of both high-beta
and -gamma power in these regions just before and after the
camera changes. The camera changes represent a challenging
event for the brain. From a low-level visual point of view, camera
changes lead to a sudden change in the visual input ( Figure S1),
similar to those occurring during saccades though not self-initi-
ated like saccades. During saccades, predictions from higher-vi-
sual areas are thought to maintain a sense of continuity in the vi-
sual scene. We may thus expect an interplay between putatively
predictive signals in the high-beta range preparing the system for
a camera change ramping up around the likely time of a camera
change, followed by a high-gamma signal starting in the occipital
regions caused by the strong change in visual input following the
camera change. The former might be more pronounced for intact
sequences and the latter for scrambled sequences.
In the high-beta range, all regions showed a pattern in which
power was higher around the time of the camera change than
in the middle of a segment. As expected, for precentral and
supramarginal channels, the power was higher for the intact se-
quences, which encourage predictions, at several time points
(p < 0.05, Figures 3 A–3C), with signiﬁcantly higher beta power
in the precentral area from 140 ms before the camera change un-
til 220 ms after the camera change and in the supramarginal area
from 380 until 740 ms after the camera change ( Figures 3 A and
3B). The middle occipital cortex however showed a different
pattern, with higher high-beta power for intact movies only ap-
pearing late in the segment, with early segments showing the
opposite pattern (albeit only at uncorrected levels; Figure 3 C).
With regard to high-gamma power, the middle occipital cortex
showed the expected increase in high-gamma after typical visual
latencies, with the power being lower for the intact than scram-
bled sequences, as expected if expectation suppression was
at play within the AON ( Figure 3 F). The supramarginal and pre-
central cortices failed to show such a high-gamma peak
following the sudden change in visual input and instead showed
a dip in high-gamma power, which in the supramarginal cortex
was more pronounced for the scrambled sequences ( Figure 3E).
Precentral channels, on the other hand, showed no such
changes in gamma power ( Figure 3 D).
Beta synchronization and information transfer between
precentral and supramarginal
The increased high-beta activities in precentral channels for
intact sequences preceded that in supramarginal channels.
This would be in line with a model in which predictions in premo-
tor regions would be transferred backward to the parietal nodes
of the AON and in line with single-cell recordings in monkeys.
19
To test this notion, we computed the interregional connectivity
across precentral and supramarginal channels using spectral
coherence.
First, we measured imaginary coherence (see STAR Methods)
using all electrode pairs within the ﬁrst second after the camera
change, and we found signiﬁcantly higher beta coherence be-
tween precentral and supramarginal channels in the intact
compared to the scrambled condition. This effect was restricted
to the high-beta range (23–30 Hz, p
corr < 0.05) ( Figure 4 A).
Interestingly, the low-beta range showed a difference in the
opposite direction, conﬁrming the functional dissociation be-
tween low and high beta. 31 Frequencies around 50 Hz were
masked out due to line noise contaminating the coherence esti-
mates. Furthermore, using a sliding window method to charac-
terize the timing of the differential high-beta coherence, we
ﬁnd that it emerges 300 ms after the camera change (p < 0.05)
(Figure 4 C).
To further investigate the directionality of information transfer
between the precentral and supramarginal, we calculated the
non-parametric Granger causality (GC) using all electrode pairs
within the ﬁrst second after the camera change. In the intact
compared to the scrambled condition, the GC spectrum ex-
hibited higher feedback information from precentral to supra-
marginal in the high-beta band (p < 0.05; Figure 5 A), but there
was no difference between conditions in the opposite (feedfor-
ward) direction ( Figure 5 B). Both GC and coherence exhibited
frequencies that were in the high-beta range (20–30 Hz). We esti-
mated the phase slope index (PSI) in 20–30 Hz using a sliding
window method to further validate the information ﬂow between
precentral and supramarginal in this high-beta range. Starting
400 ms before the camera change, the PSI exhibited opposing
information directions, with feedforward information from supra-
marginal to precentral in scrambled movies and feedback infor-
mation from precentral to supramarginal in intact movies
(Figure 6 A).

Gamma synchronization and information transfer
between supramarginal and middle occipital cortices
We also looked at the interregional relationships between the
supramarginal and middle occipital channels. In both the high-
gamma (60–90 Hz) and low-gamma (30–40 Hz) ranges, the
computed imaginary coherence during the ﬁrst second following
the camera change indicated signiﬁcantly stronger gamma
coherence between supramarginal and middle occipital chan-
nels in the scrambled condition (p < 0.05, Figure 4 B). Further-
more, the time-resolved coherence increased 400 ms after the
camera changed in the scrambled condition (p < 0.05,
Figure 4 D).
Comparing the two conditions using GC did not demonstrate a
preferential information direction between supramarginal and
middle occipital channels in the gamma band (at p < 0.05,
Figures 5C and 5D). However, the PSI derived at a high-gamma
frequency (60–90 Hz) suggested the expected direction of effect,
with reduced feedforward information from the middle occipital
to the supramarginal channel, beginning 200 ms after the camera
change (p < 0.05), for the intact than scrambled condition.
(Figure 6 B).
DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to provide insights into how the nodes of the
AON interact with each other, and how that interaction is altered
when acts are not studied in isolation, but in natural sequences in
which they can be predicted from the preceding acts. We
compared these natural sequences, in which acts could be ex-
pected, against a control condition in which the order was ran-
domized to reduce expectations to a neutral level. We found
that signals in the high-beta and high-gamma range across the
precentral, supramarginal, and middle occipital regions of the
AON were indeed differentially modulated by this manipulation.
In what follows, we will discuss changes in these two frequency
bands separately, together with some background on how

changes in these frequency bands have been associated with
feedback and feedforward information ﬂow in the literature.
Beta oscillations in high-level brain regions have been associ-
ated with top-down processing and sensori-motor integration via
feedback information ﬂow across distal brain regions. 29,30,35–37
Several studies have shown that the power in the beta range,
particularly in the high-beta range from 20 to 30 Hz, is modulated
by action observation, conﬁrming that it may be important for
feedback processes also during action observation. 38–41 Here
we found that observation of actions in predictable order caused
higher high-beta power in, and higher high-beta coherence be-
tween, precentral and supramarginal cortices. While the fact
that this power and coherence increase occurs in the beta range
is indicative of a feedback direction of information ﬂow, the high
temporal resolution of ECoG, and its relatively higher spatial res-
olution compared to scalp recordings, allows us to directly test
the prevalent direction of information ﬂow using phase slope
indices and GC. Both methods conﬁrmed that intact sequences
lead to more information ﬂow in the high-beta range in the feed-

Figure 3. Temporal dynamics of beta and
gamma power
Time courses of averaged beta (20–30 Hz, left col-
umn) and gamma (60–90 Hz, right column) power in
intact (red lines) and scrambled (blue lines) condi-
tions in each region.
(A) Precentral showed signiﬁcantly higher beta po-
wer in intact condition even 140 ms before camera
changes, which lasted till 220 ms after the camera
changes.
(B) Supramarginal showed signiﬁcantly higher beta
power in intact condition from 380 ms after the
camera change.
(C) Middle occipital showed signiﬁcantly higher beta
power in intact condition from 680 ms after the
camera change.
(D) Precentral showed no gamma power difference
between conditions.
(E) Supramarginal showed signiﬁcantly higher
gamma power in intact condition from 410 ms
before and 160 ms after the camera change.
(F) Middle occipital showed signiﬁcantly reduced
gamma power in intact condition from 220 ms after
the camera change. Data are presented as mean ±

back direction from precentral to supra-
marginal cortices. This provides evidence
that the predictability of action sequences
indeed increases feedback information, in
line with the inﬂuential notion of predictive
coding during action observation
9,10,12,42
and in line with our ﬁndings of increased
action-observation-related activity for pre-
dictable actions in layers of the SMG
known to receive premotor feedback. 43 It
has been argued that corroborating ﬁnd-
ings regarding the effect of expectations
using multiple modalities is essential.
8 It is therefore reassuring
that these results from ECoG and depth-resolved fMRI using
the same stimuli also align with ﬁndings using different methods.
Monkey single-cell physiology has shown that neurons in the
premotor cortex can indeed show anticipatory responses while
witnessing the actions of others, in line with a role in generating
expectations,
15–18 and the responses in the premotor cortex to
such expected action observation at the population level pre-
cede those in the parietal cortex, in line with the notion that the
predictions could be transmitted from the premotor to the parie-
tal cortices.
19 This ﬁnding also dovetails with ﬁndings using con-
ventional 3T BOLD measurements that have shown that when
participants actively try to guess the meaning of sequences of
gestures, GC analyses reveal a net direction of information
ﬂow from the premotor to the parietal cortices,
23 and that activity
in the premotor and parietal cortices depends on the order in
which the acts are presented. 20 That the premotor to parietal
connection is inﬂuenced by predictability is also in line with a
recent ﬁnding, using DCM, that effective connectivity in that

direction is sensitive to mismatches between expected and
observed action kinematics. 24 We observed differences in po-
wer across conditions in the high-beta range (20–30 Hz), as ex-
pected, and comparing power across all frequencies conﬁrmed
that this effect was restricted to the high-beta (>20 Hz) and ab-
sent in the low-beta (13–20 Hz) band. The speciﬁc role of sub-
bands in the beta range remains incompletely understood,
31
but our ﬁndings converge with a small number of studies pointing
toward a particular relevance of high beta for integration of motor
signals33,34 and showing that the high-beta range is selectively
altered during the observation of other people’s actions. 41 Only
when examining the coherence between PreCG and SMG
across all frequencies did we observe a signiﬁcant difference
in the low-beta range across the intact vs. scrambled condition,
and this difference was no longer signiﬁcant when using GC.
Altogether, this conﬁrms the notion that different subbands of
beta have different functions, with high beta most involved in
top-down effects.

Gamma power, in contrast, has been associated with local
processing44 and feedforward information ﬂow. 29,38,45,46 In the
visual system, gamma is triggered particularly by sudden
changes in the visual input.
47,48 In accordance with that litera-
ture, the camera changes, which trigger a sudden change in vi-
sual input, triggered a transient in high-gamma power in our
more classically visual channels in the MOG, and, perhaps un-
surprisingly, such camera-change-locked increases were not
observed in the SMG and PreCG, where single-cell recordings
in monkeys have shown many neurons to generalize their re-
sponses over changes in low-level features and viewpoint

are occluded. 18 Given the association of activity in the gamma

range with visual changes, it is important
that we have not simply compared an
intact action sequence without camera
changes with its scrambled counterpart,
as they would have differed signiﬁcantly
in terms of abrupt visual changes. Instead,
by introducing camera changes in both sequences, we have
introduced similar levels of pixel-value changes at the transition
between acts in both types of sequences (see Figure S1). We had
hypothesized that visual responses to the acts would be sup-
pressed in our MOG contacts, based on the expectation sup-
pression reported in other domains of visual neuroscience,
8
and this hypothesis was conﬁrmed: in the intact condition, oc-
cipital channels had reduced high-gamma power compared to
the scrambled condition. Considering the aforementioned asso-
ciation of high-gamma activity with feedforward visual 45,46,51
and local information, 52,53 this attenuated high-gamma power
in the middle occipital cortices suggests, in line with some pre-
dictive coding accounts, that expectation suppressions also
occur in the visual nodes of the AON. Importantly, we also found
the coherence to be reduced in the intact condition across the
middle occipital cortex and the SMG, and the PSI conﬁrms
that this information in the high-gamma band indeed ﬂowed
from the middle occipital to the SMG, in accordance with the
notion that visual input to the parietal AON nodes is indeed atten-
uated by expectations. This expectation suppression dovetails
with our EEG ﬁnding, using the same stimuli, that showed atten-
uated responses over the occipital cortex in the intact compared
to the scrambled sequences. Considering the different timing of
the responses in PreCG and MOG, our results also dovetail with
the idea that high-level abstract stimulus features are anticipated
earlier than the low-level visual features that are predicted in
closer proximity to the actual sensory input.
54
Interestingly, high-gamma activity in the SMG was increased
in the intact compared to the scrambled condition. Given that
broadband high-gamma power is known to be tightly linked to
neural spiking and thereby reﬂects local processing,

increased high-gamma power in the supramarginal cortex dur-
ing intact sequences, together with the increased intersubject
correlation for intact sequences in the SMG in fMRI BOLD sig-
nals,
20 suggests that the parietal node indeed represents more
than the individual motor acts that are identical across the intact
and scrambled movies, and it preferentially encodes actions
when they integrate into larger, meaningful sequences. Such
preferential encoding of longer chains of actions in the parietal
node contrasts with the expectation suppression that appears
to dominate the occipital node, in line with the notion that there
is a progressive increase in the ‘‘temporal receptive ﬁeld’’ of
cortical regions along a hierarchy from earlier sensory regions,
with activity that integrates information over short intervals to
more anterior parietal and frontal regions that can integrate infor-
mation over minutes.
20,25
Leveraging the temporal resolution of electrical recordings,
and the spatial speciﬁcity afforded by recording so close from
the cortex, our data therefore add independent evidence for
how the brain processes actions when we observe them in
larger, meaningful sequences: when predictions are possible
(in our intact sequences), feedback information is transmitted
in high-beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal
cortices, and local processing in the high-gamma band is
increased in the supramarginal cortices and reduced in occipital
visual cortices. When expectations are more difﬁcult, as is the
case following a camera change in our scrambled sequences,
a more prominent transient increase in high-gamma activity in
the visual cortices is triggered, and information ﬂows from these
visual cortices to the SMG in the gamma band. Zooming in on the
moment of a camera change, our data suggest a particular suc-
cession of events. For intact sequences, precentral cortices

central to supramarginal in the intact condition in the

generate high-beta activity thought to
reﬂect predictions just before the camera
change, and this increased high-beta ac-
tivity continues after the camera change.
This pattern is reminiscent of the predictive
activity around a saccade onset in frontal
eye ﬁelds that is thought to provide the
brain with a continuity of perception
despite the low-level discontinuity that a
saccade causes.
55,56 In contrast, when vi-
sual input is difﬁcult to predict, after a cam-
era change in the scrambled sequences, a
more prominent, high-gamma transient,
occurring around the typical response
latency of visual areas after the camera change, appears to
emphasize the transfer of visual information in a forward direc-
tion of information ﬂow to the parietal node.
Limitations of the study
Our study has a number of limitations that should be considered.
First, we used a passive action observation paradigm. We chose
this paradigm because the length of these stimuli ( /C241 min), and
the possibility to use the same stimuli in all participants, allowed
us to characterize the effect of expectation in the AON using
complementary neural activity recording modalities including
faster electrophysiological measurements (EEG and ECoG)
and slower traditional and depth-resolved BOLD fMRI.
Combining these modalities using the same stimuli avoids that
ﬁndings are biased by the limitations of a given measurement
modality,
8 such as the disrupting effect of variability in hemody-
namic responses delays in connectivity analysis in traditional
BOLD MRI,
22,57 uncertainty about the attribution of signals at a
speciﬁc depth or frequency band to feedforward or feedback in-
formation in depth-resolved ultra-high ﬁeld MRI 28 or electro-
physiological signals. 58 However, given that perception is ulti-
mately at the service of action, an important complementary
approach will be to examine whether the same principles apply
when paradigms are more interactive, 59 even if doing so will limit
the ability to leverage such a comprehensive range of recording
modalities. Second, we focused on three key regions within the
AON, while the action observation process is known to be more
complex, also involving for instance somatosensory, cerebellar,
and other subcortical regions.
1,2,20,60 Future studies involving
patients with a wider coverage may be ideally suited to investi-
gate how information from these other nodes may integrate

with those of the network we focus on. Third, to increase the sta-
tistical power of our analyses, we pooled electrodes over
relatively large regions of the cortex within our three regions of
interest. Future studies may wish to explore whether speciﬁc
subregions show different patterns. Indeed, some studies
mentioned a speciﬁc topological organization of the premotor
cortex and its connectivity with the parietal lobe in action obser-
vation.
24,61 A preliminary analysis of our data however failed to
reveal a speciﬁc topography of connectivity ( Figure S2 ). Forth,
while for the high-beta analysis, two methods estimating the
direction of information ﬂow (PSI and GC) agree, for the high-
gamma frequency range across the occipital and parietal chan-
nels, the PSI analysis revealed a signiﬁcant difference between
conditions, while the GC did not. The exact source of this
discrepancy is difﬁcult to identify. It has been suggested that
PSI is a more robust and sensitive method than GC when signals
contain a mixture of several independent sources and when
noise levels are higher.
62–66 The fact that high-gamma fre-
quencies capture more local signals than high-beta frequencies
and the large size of our occipital region may have conspired to
generate the heterogeneity of signals that GC is thought to suffer
from more than PSI. That high-gamma frequencies also have
lower power than high-beta frequencies may have additionally
increased the relative noise level that GC is thought to suffer
from more than PSI. Together this may explain why only the
PSI analyses could detect the hypothesized condition effects
in the high-gamma signals. Such discrepancy should however
temper the conﬁdence we can have in the effect of predictability
on the directionality of the information transfer in the gamma
band across these regions
67,68 until future studies can better
isolate the origins of this discrepancy.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
Ethics
This study was approved by the ethics committee at Jichi Medical University Hospital and registered in the UMIN Clinical Trial Reg-
istry (number UMIN000040073). All participants had mental capacity and gave written informed consent to participation.
Participants
Ten subjects with refractory epilepsy participated in this study (ﬁve males and ﬁve females, aged 18–39 years, mean = 27.3 years,
standard deviation = 7.3; see Table S1 for the demographic features of patients). Subdural electrodes were placed to localize
epileptic foci and examine the cognitive and motor functions of areas under the electrodes. Preoperative interviews with the patients
and family members, and an examination of available medical records, did not reveal social or communicative deﬁcits in the included
patients. Epileptic activity was not recorded from the electrodes included in our regions of interest. Nine of the patients included also
participated in a task to be reported in a different manuscript, in which participants reported on a trial-by-trial basis how much pain
they perceive a person to experience in short movies of the person’s hand being hit by a belt. This task is known to depend on a
kinematic analysis of the movements of the hand.
73 Comparing the ratings of these 9 patients againsts those of an age and sex-
matched control group revealed that our group of patients was within the normal range (the z-scores were normally distributed,
Shapiro-Wilk, SW = 0.935, p = 0.529, and a one-sample t test against zero, mean(z) = 0.04, t(8) = -0.116, p = 0.91, BF 10 = 0.323)
suggesting that their ability to perceive the kinematics of biological agents is preserved.
METHOD DETAILS
Stimuli and experiment procedure
The stimuli used here were a subset of those used in. 20 Brieﬂy, twenty movies containing different daily actions (e.g., preparing sand-
wiches with butter and jam; see Table 1 for the full list) were simultaneously recorded by two video cameras (Sony MC50, 29 frames/s)
at an angle of 45 /C14. The videos were edited using Adobe Premiere ProCS5 running on Windows. Each movie was subdivided into shots
containing one meaningful motor act each (e.g., taking bread, opening the butter dish, scooping butter with a knife, etc.). This was
done on recordings from both camera angles. These motor acts (mean/standard deviation duration 2s ± 1s) were then assembled to
build two types of /C241 min long stimuli (average 67s, Figure 1). For the Intact (I) presentation, the natural temporal sequence in which
the acts were recorded was maintained, but a camera angle change was introduced between every two consecutive acts by alternate
sampling from the recordings of the two cameras. In the Scrambled (S) versions, the acts remained the same, but the order of the acts
was randomly re-arranged, and a camera angle change was introduced between every two consecutive acts. Camera angle changes
were imposed at each act transition in both types of movies to compensate for the visual transients that would otherwise be present
only in the scrambled movies. Because that stimulus set depicted actions typical for western Europeans, but the experiment was
performed in Japan, author YO examined all twenty movies and selected 12 actions that should be familiar to Japanese participants
(Table 1). This resulted in 12 intact and 12 scrambled movies. Each movie was presented twice. The experiment was conducted in 6
sessions. They were composed of 3 unique sessions presented twice, with each of the sessions including 4 intact and 4 scrambled
movies presented in pseudorandom order, with an inter-movie interval between 8 and 12 s. No behavioral response was required
during the experiment, but participants were to carefully observe the videos. Among the included participants, one completed
only 3 sessions and one completed only 2 sessions.
Electrophysiological recordings and signal preprocessing
Intracranial EEG signals were recorded using a Nihon-Kohden system with 1000Hz sampling rate in Jichi Medical University Hospital,
Japan. All signals were online referenced to two electrodes in the ﬁrst head stage. All data analysis was conducted in MATLAB using
the ﬁeldtrip toolbox ( www.ﬁeldtriptoolbox.org/) and customized scripts. The recorded signals were ﬁrst low-pass ﬁltered using a 4th
order Butterworth ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency at 200 Hz. The 50Hz power line noise and its harmonics were removed using bandstop
ﬁlters with variable bandwidth according to individual power spectra. Channels with obvious artifacts were excluded from further

OPEN ACCESS
analysis. Each electrode was then locally re-referenced to the average of its neighboring electrodes within 12mm spatial distance.
This procedure removes the common recording reference, which otherwise leads to spurious correlations and coherence. Coher-
ence, imaginary coherence, phase-slope index and Granger causality were exclusively calculated between electrodes, for which
the neighboring electrodes used for re-referencing had no overlap. Data were down-sampled to 500 Hz for subsequent analyses.
Electrode locations and region deﬁnition
The spatial locations were derived from each patient’s pre-implantation MR images and post-implantation CT images. For each pa-
tient, the post-implantation CT was co-registered to the pre-implantation MRI using a six-parameter rigid body transformation, im-
plemented in SPM12 ( https://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). The registration was visually veriﬁed and manually
adjusted if necessary. ECoG electrodes were identiﬁed semi automatically according to anatomical landmarks in native space.
70
For visualization of all subjects’ electrodes on an average surface, individual electrode coordinates were transformed to MNI152
space using the Freesurfer CVS function(v6.0.0, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The regions of interest including precentral gyrus
(PreCG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) were extracted from the Anatomy toolbox 74(Figure 1 C).
Trial separation
In the connectivity analysis including coherence, phase slope index and granger causality, data were ﬁrst separated into trials based
on the time of the camera change. The actions used in our stimuli were composed of a sequence of different shorter acts (e.g., the
action of buttering bread included the acts of e.g., taking bread, opening the butter dish, scooping butter with a knife, etc.). These
acts were used as ‘‘action primitives’’ and determined the location of the camera changes. The intervals between two camera
changes therefore depended by the duration of each act, and varied from 0.4–6.76s. In our analyses, to minimize the overlap between
trials as well as preserving the temporal dynamics during action perception, we thus chose a time window from /C00.5s to 1s relative to
the camera change.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Power spectral density
Power spectral density was estimated from 2 to 120Hz using the ft_freqanalysis function, and separate parameters for low (2-30Hz)
and high frequencies (30-120Hz). For the low frequencies, the power spectrum was estimated by a short-time Fourier transform with
Hann tapers of 1s, sliding over the whole experimental session in steps of 0.1s and averaged over all windows in a given condition. For
the high-frequency part, we used a multi-taper spectral estimation with 5 tapers in 0.5s windows sliding in steps of 0.1s, and results
were also averaged over all time windows in a given condition. Power difference between conditions in each frequency was then
compared using all the electrodes in each selected region of interest ( Figure 2). In some analyses, we used a prioribands of interest
in order to compare the power difference for speciﬁc frequency bands: we averaged the power from 20 to 30Hz for the high-beta
band and from 60 to 90Hz for the gamma band in both Intact (I) and Scrambled (S) conditions for each subject ( Figure 2 inset; Fig-
ure 3 ).The raw power of each frequency was multiplied by the square of frequency for better visualization in Figure 2 .
Coherence
For the selected time window, all trial data in each electrode within this window were Fourier transformed using multi-tapering with
6Hz frequency smoothing in frequencies ranging from 2 to 120Hz with 1Hz step using ft_freqanalysis. The coherence between two
signals was then calculated in each electrode pair and each region pair in both conditions using ft_connectivityanalysis, the imaginary
part of coherence was taken as the metric to measure the synchronization between regions ( Figures 4A and 4B). The time-resolved
coherence was calculated in a sliding-window manner with window length of 1 s and steps of 0.1s and averaged across the frequency
points in each frequency band of interest ( Figures 4 C and 4D).
Phase slope index
The phase slope index (PSI) was calculated in a similar manner as coherence across regions.
75 All trial data for each electrode were
Fourier transformed using multi-tapering with 4Hz frequency smoothing and 1Hz frequency resolution. The phase slope index was
then calculated ft_connectivityanalysis across frequencies ranging from 20 to 30Hz and 60 to 90Hz with the same bandwidth of 4Hz
for each frequency; the PSI values were then averaged, separately for each of the two frequency bands, to get the temporal
dynamics, this was done in each electrode pair for each region pair in both conditions as well ( Figure 6 ).
Granger causality
Granger causality (GC) was calculated in a time window from 0 to 1s relative to the camera change using the nonparametric estima-
tion.
68,76 The Fourier spectrum was estimated using the same parameters as the PSI mentioned above and entered into a nonpara-
metric spectral matrix factorization as implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox 69 (Figure 5 ).

Statistical assessment
Statistical assessments were performed to compare the difference between conditions using the LME model implemented in
MATLAB. We implemented the LME model with patient and electrode (or electrode pairs) as two random effects and used the
restricted maximum likelihood method to optimize. In the model, ﬁxed and random effects were considered together. Post hoc tests
of p values were performed using FDR correction to correct for multiple comparisons not speciﬁed otherwise. Statistical inferences
were under a signiﬁcance threshold of p < 0.05 if not speciﬁed otherwise. As there is no non-parametric alternative to LME that could
accommodate the nested structure of our data, and as LME has been shown to be robust against violation of normality,
77,78 we did
not test our residuals for normality.
