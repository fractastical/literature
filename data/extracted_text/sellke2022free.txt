Free Energy Subadditivity for Symmetric Random Hamiltonians
Mark Sellke∗
Abstract
We consider a random Hamiltonian H : Σ → R deﬁned on a compact space Σ that admits a transitive action
by a compact group G. When the law of H is G-invariant, we show its expected free energy relative to theunique
G-invariant probability measure on Σ obeys a subadditivity p roperty in the law of H itself. The bound is often
tight for weak disorder and relates free energies at diﬀeren t temperatures when H is a Gaussian process. Many
examples are discussed including branching random walks, s everal spin glasses, random constraint satisfaction
problems, and the random ﬁeld Ising model. We also provide a g eneralization to quantum Hamiltonians with
applications to the quantum SK and SYK models.
1 A General Subadditivity Result
A large part of statistical physics and probability theory i s concerned with determining the free energy of a
given Hamiltonian. In many models for disorded systems, thi s Hamiltonian is itself a random function. This
paper focuses on free energies of random Hamiltonians obeyi ng rich distributional symmetries.
We begin with a few generalities. Let Σ be a compact metric space equipped with reference Borel probability
measure µ. We consider a (random) continuous Hamiltonian function H : Σ → R with law L. Deﬁne the
associated (random) partition function Z(H) and (deterministic) expected free energy F (L) by
Z(H) =
∫
eH(σ )µ(dσ ); (1.1)
F (L) = E[log Z(H)]. (1.2)
F (L) will always be assumed ﬁnite.
Our main result requires that (Σ , µ, H ) be highly symmetric in a joint sense. Precisely, we require the
existence of a continuous and transitive action G × Σ → Σ on Σ by a compact group G; such an action is said to
make Σ a homogeneous space for G. In particular, each g ∈ G acts on Σ by a homeomorphism σ ↦→gσ . Since Σ
and G are compact, there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure on Σ under which σ and gσ have the
same law for each g ∈ G (see e.g. [
33, Theorem 6.2]). We require µ to be this G-invariant probability measure.
We say that the law L of H is G-invariant if for each g ∈ G the transformed Hamiltonian given by
Hg(σ ) = H(gσ ), ∀σ ∈ Σ
also has law L. Further, given two Hamiltonian distributionsL1 and L2, let L1 +L2 be the law of the independent
sum H1 + H2 for (H1, H2) ∼ L 1 × L2. We can now state our main subadditivity result.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose (Σ, µ, G) are as above, and in particular that µ is the unique probability measure on Σ
invariant under the transitive action of G. Let L1, L2 be two laws for random Hamiltonians on Σ and suppose
that L1 is G-invariant. Then
F (L1 + L2) ≤ F (L1) + F (L2).
Proof. Consider the random probability measure ˜µ deﬁned from H1 by
˜µ(dσ ) = eH1(σ )µ(dσ )∫
eH1(σ )µ(dσ ).

Note that E[˜µ(dσ )] = µ(dσ ), i.e. for any bounded, measurable function f : Σ → R independent of ˜µ, we have
E
[ ∫
f(σ )˜µ(dσ )
]
=
∫
f(σ )µ(dσ ). (1.3)
Indeed, (1.3) certainly deﬁnes some probability measure µ′ on the right-hand side. Moreover this probability
measure inherits G-invariance from L1. The uniqueness result [ 33, Theorem 6.2] mentioned above now implies
E[˜µ(dσ )] = µ(dσ ) as claimed. Using this, we obtain
F (L1 + L2) = E
[
log
∫
eH1(σ )+H2(σ )µ(dσ )
]
= E
[

eH1(σ )µ(dσ )

+ E

]
= F (L1) + E
[
log
∫
eH2(σ ) ˜µ(dσ )
]
≤ F (L1) + F (L2).
(1.4)
In the last step we used ( 1.3) together with Jensen’s inequality. This concludes the pro of.
Even without symmetry, a weaker form of the above estimate ca n be obtained with F (L2) replaced by the
simple upper bound
sup
σ ∈Σ
log E[eH2(σ )]. (1.5)
Indeed by Jensen’s inequality, ( 1.5) upper-bounds E
[
log
∫
eH2(σ ) ˜µ(dσ )
]
for any probability measure ˜µ. In the
special case that the marginal distributions of H1(σ ) and H2(σ ) do not depend on σ , we similarly ﬁnd that
F (L1) + F (L2) ≤ log E[eH1(σ )] + logE[eH2(σ )] = log E[eH1(σ )+H2(σ )].
In particular the estimate in Theorem 1.1 is asymptotically tight if L1 + L2 satisﬁes
F (L1 + L2) ≈ log E[eH1(σ )+H2(σ )].
This near-equality holds at weak disorder or high temperatu re in many examples, including some presented in
the next section. The right-hand side is often referred to as the annealed free energy of H1 + H2.
Let us also point out that specializing Theorem1.1 to zero temperature by replacing (H1, H2) with (βH1, βH2)
for large β yields only the trivial bound
max
σ ∈Σ
(
H1(σ ) + H2(σ )
)
≤ max
σ ∈Σ
H1(σ ) + max
σ ∈Σ
H2(σ ).
This bound holds with no symmetry assumption, but for ﬁnite β the symmetry conditions in Theorem 1.1 are
essential. In fact without symmetry, simple counterexampl es exist even on a two-point space Σ = {−1, 1} with
µ uniform and H1 = H2 deterministic. Taking H1(1) = H2(1) = 0 and H1(−1) = H2(−1) = x yields
F (L1) + F (L2) = 2 log
( 1 + ex
2
)
,
F (L1 + L2) = log
( 1 + e2x
2
)
and the latter is easily seen to be strictly larger for all rea l x ̸= 0.
Remark 1.2. Free energy subadditivity in the system size has been established for mean-ﬁeld spin glasses and
sparse graph models obeying certain convexity properties i n [48, 11, 49, 53]. These results are fundamentally
important as they imply the existence of a limiting asymptotic free energy or ground state value in such models.
Theorem 1.1 is in a diﬀerent spirit as the state space Σ is ﬁxed while the Ha miltonian varies. As demonstrated
by the examples in the next section, our result applies somew hat generically and does not require any convexity
conditions. On the other hand, Theorem 1.1 is a simpler bound and is usually not tight for low temperatur es,
while the results of [ 48, 11, 49] are asymptotically tight at all temperatures. (Indeed, ou r result only implies
an O(β2) upper bound for free energies at inverse temperature β, while Θ( β) is the correct asymptotic in e.g.
mean-ﬁeld spin glass models.)

2 Examples
We discuss several statistical physics models to which Theo rem
1.1 applies. While we focus on models that are
important in their own right, many others are easily constru cted by e.g. independently summing some of the
random Hamiltonians presented below.
2.1 Branching Random Walk
Let TN,d be a d-ary rooted tree of depth N, and ﬁx a probability distribution ν on R with ﬁnite exponential
moments. For each vertex v ∈ V (TN,d), generate an i.i.d. variable xv ∼ ν. For a leaf w of TN,d, let P (w) =
(v0, v1, . . . , v N = w) be the path to w from the root v0. The branching random walk Hamiltonian assigns to
each w ∈ V (TN,d) the sum
H(w) =
∑
v∈P (w)
xv. (2.1)
This model has been studied in e.g. [
19, 52] and is also known as the directed polymer on a tree. A lot of ot her
work including [14, 59, 16] has resulted in a precise understanding of the extreme valu es, which corresponds to
the zero temperature setting.
Here the appropriate transitive symmetry group G consists of all root-preserving automorphisms of TN,d . It
is easy to see that the random Hamiltonian in ( 2.1) is G-invariant for any ν, and that the unique G-invariant
measure on the leaf set Σ = ∂TN,d = TN,d − T N−1,d is uniform. Theorem 1.1 implies that the associated free
energy
FN (β) = E log
(∑
w∈∂TN,d
eβH (w)
dN
)
(2.2)
is a subadditive function of ν. Moreover Theorem 1.1 is asymptotically tight for small β: [ 17, 19] show that for
β ≤ βcrit(µ, d), the limiting free energy agrees with the annealed value
F (β) = lim
N→∞
FN (β)/N = log Ex∼ν [eβx ]
which is clearly additive in ν.
Let us also point out that the generalized random energy mode l (GREM) Hamiltonian [ 31, 32] takes the
same form as ( 2.2), but with the depth N ﬁxed and the degree d growing. Here the distribution of xv may
depend on the depth of v, which doesn’t aﬀect the symmetry used above. It follows tha t Theorem 1.1 applies
also to the GREM free energy.
2.2 Spin Glasses with Gaussian Disorder
Spin glasses give rise to some of the most canonical examples of random Hamiltonians. Theorem
1.1 applies
to the following quite general family of Ising spin glasses. Let ΣN = {−1, 1}N and for 1 ≤ p ≤ P and each
(i1, . . . , i p) ∈ [N]p, let
Ji1,...,ip ∼ N (0, ci1,...,ip )
be a centered Gaussian with arbitrary variance ci1,...,ip ≥ 0. We assume the variables Ji1,...,ip are jointly
independent and deﬁne the Hamiltonian
HN (σ ) =
P∑
p=1
1
N(p−1)/2
∑
1≤i1,...,ip≤N
Ji1,...,ip σi1 . . . σ ip . (2.3)
To apply Theorem 1.1 to HN , we take G = ZN
2 which acts on Σ by
(gσ )i = (−1)gi σ i, i ∈ [N].
This is a transitive action preserving the law of HN , and it is easy to see that the G-invariant measure µ is
uniform on Σ. Moreover the independent sum L1 + L2 amounts to adding the vectors ⃗ cof coeﬃcient variances.
For β ≥ 0 the associated free energy at inverse temperature β is
FN,β (⃗ c) = E log
∫
eβHN (σ )µ(dσ ),
for µ the uniform measure on ΣN . Of course FN,β (⃗ c) = FN (β2⃗ c), so we deﬁne alsoFN (⃗ c) = FN,1(⃗ c). Theorem
1.1
then implies the following.
3
Corollary 2.1. For entrywise non-negative coeﬃcient variances ⃗ cand ⃗c′, we have
FN
(
⃗ c+ ⃗c′)
≤ FN (⃗ c) + FN (⃗c′).
In particular for β1, β2 ≥ 0 we have the subadditivity in β2 bound
FN,
√
β2
1 +β2
2
(⃗ c) ≤ FN,β1 (⃗ c) + FN,β2 (⃗ c). (2.4)
The above setup includes many spin glasses, all of which thus satisfy Corollary 2.1. When ci1,...,ip = cp
depends only on p, we recover the well studied mixed p-spin model (see e.g. [ 66]) whose covariance
ξ(σ 1, σ 2) = E[H(σ 1)H(σ 2)] =
P∑
p=1
cp
( ⟨σ 1, σ 2⟩
N
) p
depends only on the overlap ⟨σ 1, σ 2⟩/N. In this case we may write FN,β (⃗ c) = FN,β (ξ). Hence we ﬁnd that for
Ising mixed p-spin models,
FN (ξ1 + ξ2) ≤ FN (ξ1) + FN (ξ2), (2.5)
FN,
√
β2
1 +β2
2
(ξ) ≤ FN,β1 (ξ) + FN,β2 (ξ). (2.6)
When c1 = 0 and β ≤ βcrit(c2, . . . , c P ) is small, the replica-symmetric formula
lim
N→∞
FN (βξ)
N = β2ξ(1)
holds. Thus ( 2.6) is asymptotically sharp as N → ∞ for β2
1 + β2
2 ≤ β2
crit in this case. Another notable example
of the form ( 2.3) is the Edwards-Anderson model [ 39, 64] in which ( cv1,v2 )v1,v2∈V (G) is the adjacency matrix
of a ﬁnite lattice. We mention that [ 29] considers the family of Hamiltonians ( 2.3) and shows that F (⃗ c) is
coordinate-wise increasing in ⃗ c.
We remark that for mixed p-spin models, we were surprisingly unable to prove ( 2.5) in the N → ∞ limit
directly from the (enormously more diﬃcult) Parisi formula . In the appendix we derive from the Auﬃnger-
Chen representation of the Parisi formula the weaker statem ent that free energy relative to counting measure
on {−1, 1}N is subadditive in ξ.
Instead of Ising spins Σ N = {−1, 1}N , one can also consider a spherical state space or even a produ ct of
spheres. Since the Hamiltonian must now be invariant relati ve to a larger symmetry group, the applications are
not quite as general as above. A still broad family of example s comes from setting
Σ =
r∏
i=1
SNi−1(
√
Ni)
for N = ∑ r
i=1 Ni, where SNi−1(√
Ni) is the sphere inRNi of radius √Ni. The corresponding transitive symmetry
group G = ∏ r
i=1 O(Ni) is a product of orthogonal groupsO(Ni) with the natural action, and the unique invariant
probability measure µ is the natural choice of uniform measure. Let s : [N] → [r] send the Ni coordinates in
the SNi−1(√
Ni) factor above to i ∈ [r]. It is not diﬃcult to see that Hamiltonians in ( 2.3) are G-invariant if
ci1,...,ip = cs(i1),...,s(ip ). Therefore the subadditivity results in Corollary 2.1 hold for such ⃗ c. These models are
known as multi-species spin glasses and are the subject of much recent work [ 8, 68, 62, 57, 79, 80, 78, 10, 9].
Yet another generalization is to consider pairs ( σ 1, σ 2) ∈ SN−1(
√
N) with the overlap constraint ⟨σ 1, σ 2⟩ =
RN for some R ∈ [−1, 1]. Our discussion above goes through essentially unchange d for σ 1, σ 2 on the sphere
SN−1(
√
N) because all such pairs are related by a simultaneous O(N) action. For Ising spin glasses, the same is
true once ZN
2 is replaced by the full symmetry group of the cube which inclu des also coordinate permutations.
In both these cases, the analog of Corollary
2.1 applies to the two-replica Hamiltonian
HN (σ 1, σ 2) = HN (σ 1) + HN (σ 2). (2.7)
Thus we deduce subadditivity in ⃗ cfor
FN,β (⃗ c) ≡ E log
∫
eβHN (σ 1)+βHN (σ 2)µR(d(σ 1, σ 2)),
where µR is the unique G-invariant measure on pairs (σ 1, σ 2) ∈ SN−1(
√
N) × SN−1(
√
N) with ⟨σ 1, σ 2⟩ = RN.
4
The free energies of such constrained pairs appear in Talagr and’s proof [ 81] of the Parisi formula and have
also been used to study disorder chaos [ 20, 27, 25, 21, 26, 24]. They are also a special case of the so-called
vector spin models [70, 69, 58]. Further generalizations with multiple correlated Hamiltonians and more replicas
have been used in relation with the overlap gap property to es tablish computational barriers against eﬃciently
optimizing HN [23, 44, 50] – on the sphere, these are still symmetric enough to conclud e subadditivity, but we
omit the details.
2.3 Orthogonally Invariant Spin Glasses
The orthogonally invariant Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mode l is a spin glass with dependent couplings studied in
[
61, 72, 13, 41, 7, 40]. To deﬁne it, one chooses a diagonal N × N matrix ΛN and sets
AN = ON ΛN O⊤
N
for a Haar-random orthogonal matrix ON ∈ O(N). The associated random Hamiltonian is HN (σ ) = ⟨σ , AN σ ⟩
for σ ∈ ΣN = {−1, 1}N . We let FN (ν) be the corresponding free energy when the entries of Λ are dr awn
i.i.d. from the compactly supported measure ν. Such Hamiltonians are O(N)-invariant by deﬁnition, and in
particular under the natural ZN
2 -action on ΣN . Hence the conditions of Theorem
1.1 are met.
In this case, addition of Hamiltonians corresponds to addit ive free convolution. Indeed if the entries of Λ N,i
are drawn i.i.d. from νi for i ∈ { 1, 2}, and if ON,1, ON,2 ∈ O(N) are Haar-random and independent, then the
sum
AN,1 + AN,2 = ON,1ΛN,1O⊤
N,1 + ON,2ΛN,2O⊤
N,2
is orthogonally invariant with random spectrum converging in probability (in e.g. W2 metric) to the additive
free convolution ν1 ⊞ ν2 as N → ∞ . Moreover it follows from [ 13, Proof of Proposition 1.1] that the normalized
free energy of the orthogonally invariant SK model is Wasser stein-continuous in the spectrum, leading to the
approximate subadditivity relation
FN (ν1 ⊞ ν2) ≤ FN (ν1) + FN (ν2) + oN (N) (2.8)
for the orthogonally invariant SK model. As in the previous subsection, this bound is asymptotically tight in the
replica-symmetric phase. Indeed here the limiting free ene rgy F (ν) = limN→∞
FN (ν)
N agrees with the annealed
value, which is given by an integrated R-transform of ν ([13, Theorem 1.2 and Equation (1.8)]) and is therefore
additive under free convolution.
A similar construction is possible for tensors as well. For p ≥ 3 one may construct a random p-tensor A(p)
N
by starting with a deterministic p-tensor Λ(p)
N and conjugating on all p “sides” by an independent Haar-random
matrix O(p)
N ∈ O(N). The resulting orthogonally invariant mixed p-spin model Hamiltonian
HN (σ ) =
P∑
p=2
⟨A(p)
N , σ ⊗p⟩
has law which is O(N)-invariant and hence ZN
2 -invariant. Thus for deterministic sequences (Λ (2)
N , . . . , Λ(P )
N ), the
subadditivity result Theorem
1.1 still applies. However it is unclear how to extend the clean s tatement (2.8)
beyond matrices; this would probably require a theory of fre e probability for tensors.
2.4 Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems
In a typical random constraint satisfaction problem, one equips the state space ΣN = {−1, 1}N with Hamiltonian
HN (σ ) = −
M∑
j=1
θj (σ ij
1
, . . . , σ ij
k
)
for M = αN or M ∼ Poisson(αN). Here each θj : {−1, 1}k → R≥0 is an i.i.d. non-negative function invariant
in law under the action of ZN
2 , and the indices ij
ℓ ∈ [N] are i.i.d. as well. For example random k-SAT and NAE
k-SAT can be represented in the above way, where θj equals 0 when the corresponding clause is satisﬁed and 1
otherwise. These models have been studied in great detail [
1, 28, 34, 35, 63].
In this setting, applying Theorem 1.1 shows the free energy is subadditive in the clause densityα. Specialized
to βHN for large β, this roughly says that the typical solution density is subm ultiplicative in α, which is easy
5
to see directly. (However technically we cannot set β = ∞ in Theorem 1.1 to obtain “hard” constraints as then
log(Z) = log(0) holds with positive probability.)
The random Ising perceptron model (see [82, 83, 36]) is similarlyZN
2 -invariant. Here k = N with deterministic
indices (ij
1, . . . , i j
N ) = (1, 2, . . . , N ) and the functions take the formθj (σ ) = ϕ(⟨gj , σ ⟩) for a deterministic function
ϕ : R → R and Gaussian disorder vector gj ∼ N (0, IN ). Theorem
1.1 applies also to this model, as well as to
the spherical analog where Σ = SN−1(
√
N) is equipped with uniform measure.
2.5 Random Field Ising Model and Spiked Matrices
The random ﬁeld Ising model (RFIM) was introduced by [
51], see also [15, 3, 18, 37]. Here one considers a vertex
set such as V = [N]d with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions and a ran dom external ﬁeld h ∈ RV ,
giving rise to a Hamiltonian with independent two contribut ions:
H(σ ) = H1(σ ) + H2(σ ), σ ∈ {− 1, 1}V ; (2.9)
H1(σ ) =
∑
v∈V
hvσv,
H2(σ ) =
∑
(v,w)∈V : ∥ v−w∥ =1
σvσw.
The random ﬁeld term ∑
v∈V hvσv is invariant under the natural ZV
2 action of {−1, 1}V if the values (hv)v∈V
are jointly independent and each hv has negation-invariant law. Since Theorem
1.1 requires only that H1 be
G-invariant, this implies an upper bound on the free energy in (2.9) with µ the uniform measure on {−1, 1}V .
As the expected free energy of H1 is just ∑
v∈V E[log cosh(hv)], we obtain an elementary upper bound on the
RFIM free energy in terms of the ordinary Ising model free ene rgy. The same techinque also gives a simpler
proof of the lower bound in [ 43, Theorem A.1].
Another natural example of a random Hamiltonian which is a sum of two diﬀerent terms is the spiked matrix
or tensor model which has been studied extensively in e.g. [ 55, 6, 12, 38, 74, 73, 22, 4]. The spiked matrix
model is deﬁned by starting with a random matrix A and adding a random rank 1 spike to obtain A + vv⊤.
The resulting Hamiltonian is H(σ ) = ⟨σ , Aσ ⟩+ ⟨σ , v⟩2. If for example v is uniform on the sphere or {−1, 1}N ,
then the spike is O(N) or ZN
2 invariant. As explained in e.g. [
22], the free energy in a spiked model is intimately
related with detectability of the spike. In these models as w ell, Theorem 1.1 applies when either A or v obeys
the requisite symmetry property and gives a simple free energy upper bound separating the diﬀerent interactions
in the Hamiltonian.
3 Generalization to Quantum Hamiltonians
A version of our result extends to quantum Hamiltonians. We restrict attention to operators on ﬁnite dimensional
spaces, though this is probably not essential. Let M be a random N × N Hermitian matrix with law M. Then
the associated quantum partition function and average free energy are given by
Z(M) = Tr
(
eM
)
/N; (3.1)
F (M) = EM∼M[log Z(M)]. (3.2)
In the case that M is almost surely diagonal in a ﬁxed orthogonal basis ( v1, . . . , v N ), M can be viewed as a
classical Hamiltonian taking value λi(M) on the state σ = vi. Z(M) and F (M) deﬁned above then agree with
the classical free energy for the uniform reference measure µ on {v1, . . . , v N }.
Similarly to before, let M1 + M2 denote the law of the independent matrix sum M1 + M2 for (M1, M2) ∼
M1 × M 2. We say that M is G-invariant for a compact group G ⊆ U(N) of unitary transformations if for
M ∼ M independent of any ﬁxed g ∈ G , we have gM ∼ M .
Our generalization of the symmetry assumption is as follows . With Eg∈G denoting expectation relative to
Haar measure, we say that G is M-symmetrizing if
Eg∈G [gMg −1] = Tr(M)IN
N . (3.3)
(Here Tr(M) is a scalar and IN denotes the identity matrix.) For diagonal M, the group SN ⊆ U(N) of permuta-
tion matrices is M-symmetrizing, as are all of its transitive subgroups. This recovers the setting of Theorem 1.1
6
for ﬁnite Σ. As another example, the subgroup of signed permutation matrices is M-symmetrizing for all
not-necessary-diagonal M. With these deﬁnitions in place, we can now state a generaliz ation of Theorem 1.1 to
quantum free energies.
Theorem 3.1. Suppose M1 is G-invariant and G is almost surely eM1 -symmetrizing for M1 ∼ M 1. Then
F (M1 + M2) ≤ F (M1) + F (M2).
Proof. Recall the Golden-Thompson inequality [
45, 84, 42]: for all Hermitian matrices M1 and M2,
Tr(eM1+M2 ) ≤ Tr(eM1 eM2 ) . (3.4)
Using Jensen’s inequality in the ﬁnal step below, we ﬁnd:
F (M1 + M2) = E

.
Next recall that egM1g−1
= geM1 g−1 for unitary g and in particular Tr(egM1g−1

of M1 in the ﬁrst step, we ﬁnd that for any ﬁxed M2,

Combining the above displays completes the proof.
In the next two subsections, we explain how to apply Theorem 3.1 to the quantum SK and SYK models. In
Remark 3.7, we brieﬂy explain a more complicated model that subsumes bo th while still obeying subadditivity.
3.1 Application to the Quantum SK Model
The quantum SK model was introduced in [
75, 46]. Following rigorous results in [ 30, 60], its free energy was
determined at all temperatures for constant transverse ﬁel d through a connection to (classical) vector spin
glasses in [2]. We consider a variant with Gaussian transverse ﬁeld. To de ﬁne the model, we ﬁrst recall the 2 × 2
Pauli matrices
σx =
( 0 1
1 0
)
, σ y =
( 0 −i
i 0
)
, σ z =
( 1 0
0 −1
)
. (3.5)
Together with the identity I2, the Pauli matrices form a basis for the 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices. Moreover they
each square to I2 and satisfy the relations
σxσy = iσz = −σyσx
σyσz = iσx = −σzσy
σzσx = iσy = −σxσz .
(3.6)
Fix a positive integer m, the number of interacting particles. For i ∈ [m], let σx
i : (C2)⊗m → (C2)⊗m be the
linear operator which acts by σx on the i-th tensor factor, and by the identity on the others:
σx
i = I2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σx ⊗ · · · ⊗ I2.
7
Similarly deﬁne σy
i and σz
i . The quantum SK Hamiltonian with Gaussian transverse ﬁeld is the random operator
Mm : (C2)⊗m → (C2)⊗m given by
Mm = β√m
∑
1≤i,j≤m
Ji,j σz
i σz
j + h
m∑
i=1
Jiσx
i . (3.7)
Here β and h are constants while as usual Ji,j and Ji are i.i.d. standard Gaussians. The corresponding free
energy is
F QSK
m (β, h) = E log
(
Tr(eMm )/2m
)
.
It should be noted that taking h = 0 recovers the classical SK model, since then Mm is diagonal in the standard
basis. However the transverse ﬁeld h ∑ m
i=1 Jiσx
i behaves diﬀerently from a classical external ﬁeld.
For i ∈ [m], deﬁne the ﬁnite group
Qi = {±I2, ±σx
i , ±σy
i , ±σz
i }
of matrices acting on the i-th tensor factor. Let Q ⊆ End
(
(C2)⊗m)
be the group generated by all of the Qi,
so that |Q| = 22m+1 (there are four choices for the operator in each tensor facto r, as well as a global choice
of sign). Applying Theorem
3.1 to the quantum SK Hamiltonian with symmetry group Q yields the following
subadditivity result for the quantum SK model.
Corollary 3.2. For any m ≥ 1 and constants β1, β2, h1, h2 ≥ 0, we have
F QSK
m
( √

2 ,
√

)
≤ F QSK
m (β1, h1) + F QSK
m (β2, h2).
Proof. It is easy to see that independently summing quantum SK Hamil tonians with parameters ( β1, h1) and
(β2, h2) gives another with parameters
( √
β2
1 + β2
2 ,
√
h2
1 + h2
2
)
, so it suﬃces to check that the quantum SK
model veriﬁes the conditions of Theorem
3.1 with symmetry group Q.
First, note that for any g ∈ Q , if Mm is as in ( 3.7), then the relations ( 3.6) imply
gMmg−1 = β√m
∑
1≤i,j≤m
εi,j (g)Ji,j σz
i σz
j + h
m∑
i=1
εiJi(g)σx
i .
for deterministic εi,j (g), ε i(g) ∈ {− 1, 1}. Since Ji,j and Ji are negation-invariant in law and independent, we
ﬁnd that gMmg−1 has the same law as Mm, verifying the Q-invariance condition of Theorem 3.1.
Next we argue that all of ( C2)⊗m is symmetrized by Q in the sense of ( 3.3). It is not diﬃcult to see that a
basis for End
(
(C2)⊗m)
consists of the operators
M = σ1 ⊗ σ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σm (3.8)
where σi ∈ { I2, σx, σy, σz} for each i ∈ [m]. Moreover all of these are traceless except the identity I⊗m
2 = I2m
which clearly satisﬁes ( 3.3). It remains to show that if σi ∈ { σx, σy, σz } for some i ∈ [n], then M in ( 3.8)
satisﬁes
Eg∈Q[gMg −1] = 0. (3.9)
This in turn follows by considering the eﬀect of conjugation on the i-th tensor factor. Indeed since each of
σx
i , σy
i , σz
i commutes with half of Qi and anti-commutes with the other half, we ﬁnd that
∑
g∈Qi
gσg −1 = 0 (3.10)
for σ ∈ { σx
i , σy
i , σz
i } which implies (3.9).
3.2 Application to the SYK Model
The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model introduced in [
77, 56] is a quantum mechanical model for strongly inter-
acting fermions with applications to holography and black h oles [76]. While diﬀerent from the quantum SK
model, it also takes a similar form to classical spin glass Ha miltonians such as (2.3), again with non-commuting
variables. We will see that the SYK model also falls under the purview of Theorem 3.1.
8
To deﬁne the SYK model, we work in the involutive C-algebra Cn generated by χ1, . . . , χ n with relations:
χi = χ∗
i , i ∈ [n]
χ2
i = 1, i ∈ [n]
χiχj + χj χi = 0, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.
(3.11)
Its dimension is dim( Cn) = 2n, and a basis is given by the set of products
χS = χs1 . . . χ sk (3.12)
for subsets S = {s1, . . . , s k} with 1 ≤ s1 < · · · < s k ≤ n.
Being an associative algebra, Cn acts on itself by left-multiplication. This representatio n yields a canonical
identiﬁcation of each element x ∈ C n with a linear operator Mx : Cn → C n. Fixing a positive even integer
q ∈ 2N, the SYK Hamiltonian is given by such an operator Mx for random x. Precisely, we set
x = iq/2 ∑
1≤i1<···<iq ≤n
Ji1,...,iq χ1 . . . χ q (3.13)
where the disorder variables Ji1,i2,...,iq are i.i.d. centered Gaussians. It is easy to verify using the relations
(
3.11) that Mx is Hermitian.
Recalling (3.2), let
F SYK
n,q (β) = E log
(
Tr(eβM x
)/2n
)
be the expected free energy of Mx in (3.13). Our main result for the SYK model follows.
Corollary 3.3. For all n, q ≥ 1 with q even and any β1, β2 ≥ 0,
F SYK
n,q
( √
β2
1 + β2
2
)
≤ F SYK
n,q (β1) + F SYK
n,q (β2).
The proof of Corollary 3.3 is of course based on Theorem 3.1. Let G+
SYK = {χS }S⊆[n] consist of all 2 n
monomials written in sorted order, which is easily seen to be a basis for Cn. G+
SYK is not a group, but GSYK =
G+
SYK ∪ (−G+
SYK) is a group as shown in Proposition 3.6 below. We will apply Theorem 3.1 with G = GSYK.
Corollary 3.3 thus reduces to the following two claims.
Lemma 3.4. The law of Mx is GSYK-invariant.
Lemma 3.5. GSYK is Mx-symmetrizing for all x ∈ C n.
We begin with an easy preliminary result. For any permutatio n π ∈ Sn and S = {s1, . . . , s k} ⊆ [n] with
1 ≤ s1 < s 2 < · · · < s k ≤ n, deﬁne
χπ
S = χπ(s1)χπ(s2) . . . χ π(sk).
Proposition 3.6. For any π ∈ Sn, the set of 2n+1 monomials {±χπ
S }S⊆[n] coincides with the multiplicative
subgroup GSYK ⊆ C n and is in particular independent of π.
Proof. First we show that GSYK is a group. It is easy to see by using the relations (
3.11) to reorder terms that
any product of (possibly non-distinct) generators χi1 . . . χ ik takes the form ±χS for some S ⊆ [n], so that GSYK
is closed under multiplication. Similar reasoning reveals that χ−1
S ∈ { χS , −χS } for all S ∈ [n], so that GSYK is
closed under inverse and is hence a group.
Next, let Gπ
SYK ⊆ C n denote the set {±χπ
S }S⊆[n]. We claim that Gπ
SYK = Gπ′
SYK if π′ is obtained from π by an
adjacent transposition, which implies that Gπ
SYK does not depend on the permutation π. This in turn follows
from the equality of sets {χiχj , −χiχj } = {χj χi, −χj χi} for distinct i, j ∈ [n], completing the proof.
Proof of Lemma 3.4. Fix any monomial y = ±χj1 . . . χ jm and let
x = iq/2 ∑
1≤i1<···<iq ≤n
Ji1,...,iq χ1 . . . χ q
be as in ( 3.13). Note that y−1 ∈ { y, −y}. It follows from the relations ( 3.11) that
yxy−1 = iq/2 ∑
1≤i1<···<iq ≤n
εi1,...,iq (y)Ji1,...,iq χ1 . . . χ q
for deterministic constants εi1,...,iq (y) ∈ {− 1, 1}. Since the couplings Ji1,...,iq are i.i.d. centered Gaussian, we
ﬁnd that x and yxy−1 have the same law. Since x ↦→Mx deﬁnes a representation of Cn, Mx and MyMx(My )−1
also have the same law. This completes the proof since y ∈ G SYK was arbitrary.
9
Proof of Lemma 3.5. We show that for any linear map M : Cn → C n,
Eg∈GSYK [gMg −1] = Eg∈G+
SYK [gMg −1] = Tr(M) · I2n
2n . (3.14)
The ﬁrst equality is clear because gMg −1 = (−g)M(−g)−1 for all g ∈ G SYK, so we focus on the latter equality.
Recall that G+
SYK is a basis for Cn. In this basis, it is easy to see that each Mg for g ∈ G +
SYK acts by a signed
permutation matrix which is the identity when g = 1, and otherwise has all diagonal entries 0 hence trace 0.
Since (3.14) is clear when M is the identity, it suﬃces to establish for all non-identity elements x ∈ G +
SYK the
equality ∑
g∈G+
SYK
gM xg−1 = 0. (3.15)
From the Sn symmetry guaranteed by Proposition 3.6, we may without loss of generality assume that x contains
the term χn, so that x = χi1 . . . χ iq−1 χn for 1 ≤ i1 < · · · < i q−1 < n . Next, let G+
SYK,−n ⊆ G +
SYK consist of the
monomials with no χn term. Since G+
SYK = G+
SYK,−n ∪
(
G+
SYK,−n · χn
)
, we ﬁnd
∑
g∈G+
SYK
gM xg−1 =
∑
g∈G+
SYK,−n
gM xg−1 + gχnMxχ−1
n g−1
=
∑
g∈G+
SYK,−n
g
(
M + χnMxχn
)
g−1
= 0.
In the last step we used the identity χnMxχn = −Mx for x = χi1 . . . χ iq−1 χn. This holds because q is even and
χnχik = −χik χn for all 1 ≤ k ≤ q − 1.
Remark 3.7. In the spirit of ( 2.3), Corollary 3.3 extends to more general formulations of the SYK model. Let
[Q]2 = [Q] ∩ 2N be the set of positive even integers at most Q and consider
x =
∑
q∈[Q]2
iq/2 ∑
1≤i1<···<iq ≤n
Ji1,...,iq χ1 . . . χ q (3.16)
for independent centered Gaussians Ji1,...,iq with arbitrary variances ⃗ c= (ci1,...,iq )ij ∈[n],q∈[Q]2 . The analog of
Corollary 2.4 generalizes to this setting, as indeed Corollary 3.3’s proof extends essentially verbatim.
Further, Corollaries 3.2 and 3.3 admit a common generalization. This is not surprising if one observes that
the algebra of linear endomorphisms End( C2, C2) is isomorphic to C2. Indeed it follows from the relations ( 3.6)
that an isomorphism is given by extending the map
I2 ↦→1,
σx ↦→χ1,
σy ↦→i · χ1χ2,
σz ↦→χ2.
Therefore the quantum SK Hamiltonians considered previous ly live in C⊗m
2 while SYK Hamiltonians live in Cn.
In general, for any positive integers m and (n1, . . . , n m), we may consider the algebra ⨂ m
j=1 Cnj with (χj
i )i∈[nj ]
the generators of Cnj . Then Theorem
3.1 implies analogous free energy subadditivity for the random operators
on ⨂ m
j=1 Cnj given by
M =
∑
(q1,...,qm)∈[Q1]2×···×[Qm]2

where J(·) ∼ N (0, c(·)) are independent centered Gaussians with arbitrary varian ces. The proof is identical to
that of Corollary
3.2, with Lemma 3.5 used in the last step on each Cnj in place of ( 3.10).

A Suboptimal Alternate Approach for Mixed p-spin Models
Recall from Subsection 2.2 that for a deterministic sequence (c2, . . . , c P ) ∈ RP
≥0, the corresponding mixed p-spin
Hamiltonian without external ﬁeld
1 is given by
HN (σ ) =
P∑
p=2
1
N(p−1)/2
∑
1≤i1,...,ip≤N
Ji1,...,ip σi1 . . . σ ip
for independent Gaussians Ji1,...,ip ∼ N (0, cp) with variance cp. The celebrated Parisi formula gives the limiting
free energy in this model for the reference measure µ which is uniform on σ ∈ {− 1, 1}N .
Surprisingly, we were unable to recover the free energy suba dditivity in
ξ(x) =
P∑
p=2
cpxp (A.1)
directly from the Parisi formula. In this appendix we use it t o show the weaker Corollary A.3 in which free
energy is deﬁned relative to counting measure on {−1, 1}N instead of uniform measure. Counting measure
is actually more commonly used to deﬁne free energy in Ising s pin glasses since the corresponding partition
function is just the sum ∑
σ ∈{−1,1}N HN (σ ). (Indeed this discrepancy led to some confusion on our part , which
motivated us to include this appendix.) In Remark A.4 we discuss why our proof strategy seemingly cannot
recover the stronger estimate of Theorem 1.1. It would be interesting to derive free energy subadditivity relative
to uniform measure by using the Parisi formula in a diﬀerent w ay.
Let M[0,1] denote the space of increasing and right-continuous functions ζ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]. To state the Parisi
formula at inverse temperature β = 1 (without loss of generality since β can be absorbed into ξ), we deﬁne for
ζ ∈ M [0,1] the function Φξ,ζ : [0, 1] × R → R≥0 as the solution to the non-linear PDE:
∂tΦξ,ζ (t, x) + 1
2ξ′′(t)
(
∂xxΦξ,ζ (t, x) + ζ(t)(∂xΦξ,ζ (t, x))2)
= 0 (A.2)
Φξ,ζ (1, x) = log cosh(x).
Existence and uniqueness of solutions are shown in [ 5, 54] (in fact we will use the formula from [ 5, Theorem 1]
below, with the term log 2 omitted for the main statement with uniform measure). The Parisi functional for the
Ising mixed p-spin model is deﬁned by
Pξ(ζ) = Φξ,ζ (0, 0) − 1
2
∫ 1
0
tξ′′(t)ζ(t)dt. (A.3)
Finally the Parisi formula [ 71, 47, 81, 65, 67, 66] states that
F (ξ) ≡ lim
N→∞
FN (ξ)/N = inf
ζ∈M[0,1]
Pξ (ζ).
We will use the more convenient Auﬃnger-Chen representatio n for the Parisi functional which we now
describe. Given a ﬁltration F = (Ft)t∈[0,1] and adapted standard Brownian B(t), let D[0, 1] denote the space
of progressively measurable processes ( ut)t∈[0,1] such that |ut| ≤ 1 holds almost surely for each t ∈ [0, 1]. Deﬁne
Xξ,ζ (u; B) = Yξ,ζ (u; B) − Zξ,ζ (u);
Yξ,ζ (u; B) ≡ Φξ,ζ
(
1,
∫ 1

ξ′′(t)dB(t)
)
,
Zξ,ζ (u) ≡ 1
2
∫ 1
0
ζ(t)ξ′′(t)u(t)2dt .
Auﬃnger-Chen showed the Parisi functional can be represent ed as a stochastic control problem involving Xξ,ζ .
Proposition A.1. [5, Theorem 3] The function Φξ,ζ deﬁned in (A.2) satisﬁes
Φξ,ζ (0, 0) = max
u∈D[0,1]
E[Xξ,ζ (u; B)] .
We note that the statement in [ 5] assumes F is the ﬁltration generated by B(t), but this is not necessary.
1Corollary A.3 extends easily to handle an external ﬁeld, but we omit this fo r convenience.
11
Proposition A.2. For mixed p-spin covariances ξ1, ξ2 as in (A.1) and ζ1, ζ2 ∈ M [0,1], let
ζ(t) ≡ ζ1(t)ξ′′
1 (t) + ζ2(t)ξ′′
2 (t)
ξ′′
1 (t) + ξ′′
2 (t) ∈ M [0,1] . (A.4)
Then we have the inequality
Φξ1+ξ2,ζ (0, 0) ≤ Φξ1 ,ζ1 (0, 0) + Φξ2,ζ2 (0, 0) + log(2).
Proof. Let B1(t) and B2(t) be independent standard Brownian motions generating toge ther the ﬁltration F =
(Ft)t≥0. Deﬁne ζ as in (A.4) and set
B(t) =
√
ξ1(t)
ξ1(t) + ξ2(t)B1(t) +
√
ξ2(t)
ξ1(t) + ξ2(t)B2(t).
Note that B(t) is also a standard Brownian motion. We choose u ∈ D [0, 1] to maximize Xξ1+ξ2 (u, 0) with driving
Brownian motion Bt, so that Φ ξ1 +ξ2,ζ (0, 0) = Xξ1+ξ2,ζ (u; B). Proposition A.1 implies that for i ∈ { 1, 2}, we
have
E[Xξi,ζi (u; Bi)] ≤ Φξi ,ζi (0, 0) . (A.5)
Therefore it suﬃces to prove that almost surely,
Xξ1+ξ2,ζ (u; B) ≤ X ξ1,ζ1 (u; B1) + Xξ2,ζ2 (u; B2) + log(2). (A.6)
We ﬁrst have
Zξ1+ξ2,ζ (u) = Zξ1 ,ζ1 (u) + Zξ2 ,ζ2 (u)
by deﬁnition. Next, the inequality
Yξ1+ξ2,ζ (u; B) ≤ Y ξ1,ζ1 (u; B1) + Yξ2,ζ2 (u; B2) + log(2)
follows from the identity

and the easily veriﬁed subadditivity of the function log
(
2 cosh(x)
)
. This concludes the proof.
Corollary A.3. The free energy in the mixed p-spin model satisﬁes F (ξ1 + ξ2) ≤ F (ξ1) + F (ξ2) + log(2).
Proof. Choose ζ1, ζ2 ∈ M [0,1] to minimize the respective Parisi functionals, i.e.
F (ξi) = Pξi (ζi), i ∈ { 1, 2}.
Then with ζ as in (A.4). we have
F (ξ1 + ξ2) ≤ Pξ1+ξ2 (ζ)
= Φξ1 +ξ2,ζ (0, 0) − 1

= F (ξ1) + F (ξ2) + log(2).
Remark A.4. There is a good reason that our argument above cannot recover the stronger estimate of Theo-
rem 1.1. Since the process u used in proving Proposition A.2 is adapted to the ﬁltration generated by B(t), it
cannot agree with any nontrivial process adapted to the ﬁltrations generated by B1(t) or B2(t). This means that
(A.5) and hence Proposition A.2 essentially never hold with equality. By contrast the bound in Corollary 2.1
does hold with equality at high temperature.
Let us also mention that our proof of Proposition A.2 has a similar spirit to that of [ 5, Theorem 4], which
used Proposition A.1 to establish the strict convexity of the Parisi functional i n ζ. In fact the obstruction just
outlined resembles their proof that the convexity is strict .
