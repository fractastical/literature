Abstract: After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding
and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practi-
tioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable
brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new
path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical
tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes.
However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test–retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent
works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random)
variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that
understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with
an ensuing increase in test–retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a
general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating
brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.

1. Introduction: The Utility of Brain Imaging in Understanding Mental Illness
At the beginning of the last decade of the twentieth century, the field of psychiatry
experienced a ‘new wave’ in the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses. This
wave took the form of non-invasive and human-centered brain imaging. Basic researchers
and clinicians agreed that tools to understand the biological mechanisms underlying
the human mind could facilitate evidence-based therapies and biomarkers, transitioning
psychiatry from symptom-based definitions to biologically validated constructs of mental
disorders [1,2].
The expected utility of brain imaging for understanding mental illnesses has predomi-
nantly been statistical. By measuring brain activity, indexed, for example, by blood oxygen
level dependent (BOLD) signals (i.e., functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI,) during
the performance of cognitive tasks, neuroscientists have been able to collect myriads of
data points that encode complex associations between brain disfunction, aberrant cognitive
performance, and symptoms of mental disorders [3].
At the turn of the century, only the most statistically salient associations were identified
using traditional correlational approaches. However, advancements in big-data technolo-
gies, such as machine learning, have uncovered distinct features of mental illnesses [4–6].
Furthermore, metanalytic works have leveraged 30 years of cumulative data, leading to
proposed neural markers shared by several mental disorders [ 7]. Today, these types of
brain activity vs. observed behavior (i.e., brain–symptom) associations continue to prevail
in most brain imaging studies of mental illnesses [7,8].

While the scientific utility of brain–symptom correlational approaches is unquestion-
able, the expectations about their clinical utility have not been met yet [9]. Most setbacks
revolve around low specificity, sensitivity, and interrater reliability of diagnosis interpreta-
tion [10–12]. As an example of the kinds of errors the use of brain imaging can cause in
diagnoses, consider the diagnosis of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Con-
sistent with the still-prevalent phrenological perspective of functionally localized brain
causes of mental illness, aberrant increased activity in the sub-genual anterior cingulate
cortex (sgACC) has been reported to be associated with treatment resistance in major de-
pression [7,13]. The cingulate cortex functionally connects with the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. This implies that by increasing the activity of the prefrontal cortex, the activity of the
sgACC would be downregulated, resulting in remission of resistance to (pharmacological)
treatment. A recent placebo-controlled study involving repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has shown promising results in this direc-
tion [14]. Crucially, in this trial, prefrontal stimulation foci were identified via brain imaging
(MRI) at the individual level. Despite this optimistic progress in treatment, the diagnosis
of depression based on specific aberrant activity in the sgACC remains either unknown
(at best) or unreliable (at worst). At the moment, no consensus has been reached about
the specificity and sensitivity rates of aberrant activity of the sgACC in treatment-resistant
major depression. Furthermore, aberrant activity in the agACC has been associated with
other conditions [15–17]. This variability in aberrant cingulate activity among different
conditions poses difficulties in the interpretation of imaging data among clinicians (i.e., low
interrater reliability). Therefore, relying on the observation of aberrant cingulate activity to
diagnose treatment-resistant major depressive disorder could lead to both false negatives
and false positives cases. Similar limitations are present in the diagnosis of other disorders
(e.g., schizophrenia).
2. Computational Psychiatry and Computational Phenotyping
During the last two decades, the emergent field of ‘computational psychiatry’ has
opened a new path towards the fulfillment of the expected utility of brain imaging in
understanding and treating mental illnesses. Computational psychiatry works speak to
two general approaches: theory-driven and data driven. Whereas data-driven approaches
follow the steps of machine-learning statistical analysis of brain–symptom associations [18],
theory-driven approaches focus on unobserved or hidden variables at the interface between
the mind and the brain. A hallmark of theory-driven computational psychiatry speaks to its
potential for providing mechanistic neuro-cognitive explanations of the pathophysiology
of mental illnesses.
Theory-driven computational psychiatry attempts to explain a wide range of mental
disorders (see Table 1 for examples). Theory-driven computational psychiatry targets the
identification of hidden or latent variables that explain the mechanistic underpinning of
mental illnesses resulting from aberrant behavioral and cognitive states [19–26]. In bipolar
disorder, for example, a mood-sensitivity parameter of a dynamical bifurcation model
tracks mood oscillation at the individual level [27]. In substance abuse (e.g., alcoholism),
reinforcement learning models allow the identification of which behaviors would help
a particular patient to abstain from engaging in addictive behaviors [ 28]. Similarly, in
antisocial behavior, deficits in learning from punishment are associated with conduct
disorder, and reinforcement learning models allow the identification of the learning speed
of a particular individual [29]. In all the above examples, computational psychiatrists tend
to refer to a collection of subject-specific and symptom-specific computational parameters
as ‘phenotypes’ [30]. For most computational neuroscientists (including the authors of
this review), computational phenotyping will become the gold standard for diagnosis and
individualized treatments [20,21,31,32]. However, as we discuss below, to reach that point,
computational phenotype must increase its construct validity.

3. Current Limitations of Computational Phenotyping
Computational psychiatry has progressively paved the way towards clinical trials [22].
However, this path still has challenges to resolve [82]. As in the case of traditional (and
machine-learning augmented) statistical brain–symptom approaches, the clinical field of
psychiatry continues to expect reliable and valid computational phenotypes (c.f., biomark-
ers). Most critiques come from the fact that these phenotypes lack test–retest reliability,
being particularly unstable (i.e., variable) when estimated at two different times [83,84]. For
example, in a recent work, Silva et al. [75] used a Bayes network to assess the dependence
between linguistic phenotypes (a set of specific linguistic cues extracted from speech sam-
ples produced by patients) and diagnostic accuracy of schizophrenia. They estimated the
probability of observing a longitudinal change in specific linguistic cues and the consensus
diagnosis after six months from the first psychosis episode. Their work showed a high
probability of schizophrenia diagnosis given a longitudinal change in a specific instance
of the linguistic phenotype. However, their work did not assess whether the longitudinal
change was structural (due to the evolution of the disorder) or was due to random measure-
ment error. Test–retest reliability is particularly important because, even in symptom-based
approaches, stable symptoms over time (measured through consistent clinical scores) lead
to more reliable diagnoses and treatment decisions [85]. A crucial corollary of this, relevant
to the current work, is that if unstable symptoms are observed over time (through repeated
measurements), the causes of those changes must be identified.
While we agree with the above limitation, test–retest reliability (and all correlation-
based psychometric properties of a test measurement) largely depends on construct va-
lidity [86–88]. Recent works in computational psychiatry reveal a key limitation of com-
putational phenotypes: their construct validity (i.e., the cognitive mechanism explaining
the symptoms) is not yet causally informed by neural validity (i.e., the neural mechanism
causing the cognitive dysfunction). In the remainder of this review, we will discuss this
limitation and will discuss how the integration of brain imaging into the active inference
framework of brain functioning could contribute to improve construct validity trough
longitudinal, causal neural validity of computational phenotypes of mental illnesses. To
contextualize both discussions, we will first describe a recent work addressing the critique
of the test–retest reliability of computational phenotypes in healthy individuals [89] which
converges with other independent works with schizophrenia patients. This work unveiled
one fact (structural longitudinal changes) that ascribes construct validity a hinging role in
achieving test–retest reliability of computational phenotypes of mental illnesses.

3.1. Structural Longitudinal Changes in Parameters of Computational Phenotypes in Healthy
Subjects and Schizophrenia Patients
In a recent work aiming to assess the test–retest reliability of computational phenotypes
in healthy subjects, Schurr et al. [89] fit seven independent computational models to data
collected from subjects over three months. The participants performed cognitive tasks on a
weekly basis and filled out structured questionnaires about their emotions. The tasks were
selected based on their common use in both computational psychiatry and experimental
psychology (broadly defined): go/no-go, change detection, random dot motion, lottery
ticket, intertemporal choice, two-armed bandit, and numerosity comparison. For each of
these tasks, a specific computational model was fitted to the observed behavioral data. For
example, whereas the drift diffusion model [90] was used to fit data from the random dot
motion task, an uncertainty exploration model [91] was fitted to data from the two-armed
bandit task. To assess the test–retest reliability of parameter estimates, Schurr et al. [ 89]
computed intraclass correlations. The results of the test–retest assessments were mixed.
Crucially, they found that part of the variability over time was structural, associated with
learning and mood effects.
Schurr et al.’s [ 43] findings are contextualized in healthy subjects, and their meth-
ods did not include brain imaging data. In the context of mental illness, specifically
schizophrenia, Alonso-Sánchez et al. [92] and Silva et al. [75] reported longitudinal changes
in linguistic phenotypes estimated from spoken language productions. Furthermore, Liang
et al. [93] and Wang et al. [94] reported longitudinal changes in brain imaging data. The
main conclusion reached by these independent works suggests that longitudinal variation
in computational phenotypes does not relate to random noise and confirms the importance
of studying the structure of the longitudinal changes in computational phenotypes of [84].
3.2. Increasing Construct Validity of Computational Phenotypes Through Causal Understanding of
Structural Longitudinal Changes
That correlations do not automatically imply causation is a two-century old statistical
truth [95–97] which in the twenty first century gains especial meaning in the context of
computational phenotypes of mental illness. Structural longitudinal changes in computa-
tional phenotypes speak to informative dependencies between parameter estimates (c.f.,
multicollinearity as uninformative dependencies). However, we do not know whether these
informative dependencies indicate autocorrelation or causation. Therefore, a necessary step
to increase the construct validity of computational phenotypes of mental illness speaks to
understanding the causes of their longitudinal changes, if they are present.
Importantly, the fact that longitudinal changes are also observed in functional imaging
indicates that computational phenotypes show structural longitudinal changes not only
at the level of the mind but also at the level of the brain. This implies that computational
phenotypes should include the causes of the longitudinal neural changes. At present, no
computational psychiatry work has reported this type of validation, making it, therefore,
an imperative future direction in computational psychiatry.
4. Future Directions: Causal Understanding of Structural Longitudinal Changes in
Computational Phenotypes Through the Integration of Active Inference and Functional
Brain Imaging
The most informative dependency for computational psychiatry may be a set of
parameters representing the causal relationship between cognitive processes and brain
signals [98–100], ‘mind–brain causal computational parameters’. At present, most if not all
attempts in this direction still show correlational dependencies. Reinforcement learning
models represent exemplar cases of this approach [101,102], undoubtedly providing high,
but not sufficient, construct validity to relevant computational phenotypes.
One closer step towards the identification of causal computational parameters refers
to a recent work on linguistic phenotyping reported by Limongi et al. [ 32]. By using
Bayes network, a causal network, Limongi et al. reported a causal dependency between
linguistic phenotypes of conceptual disorganization of schizophrenia patients and pa-
Brain Sci.2024, 14, 1278 5 of 10
rameter estimates of brain connectivity (dynamic causal models of functional magnetic
resonance imaging, fMRI). They reported causal parameters between linguistic phenotypes
and causal parameters of fMRI. However, their work still lacks the desired mind–brain
causal parameters. Moreover, their work is not contextualized in the longitudinal changes
in computational phenotypes which, as discussed above, is necessary for increasing their
construct validity, and ensuing test–retest reliability. Despite these limitations, Limongi
et al. developed their work on the active inference framework of brain functioning [103].
As we elaborate upon below, this framework represents a biologically feasible way to
identify computational parameters representing mind–brain causal dependencies in the
longitudinal dimension.
The active inference framework of brain functioning [ 103] regards the brain as a
predictive machine equipped with a model of both the external (exteroceptive) and internal
(interoceptive) worlds. These models comprise hidden states or beliefs about the causes
of sensory (interoceptive and exteroceptive) observations. In active inference, hidden
states can be everything the organism has beliefs regarding and some of these can change
longitudinally over time, depending on the organism’s actions (behaviors). The organism
updates its state beliefs by inferring posterior probabilities of the states, given observations
and behaviors. To infer such posterior beliefs over states, the organism minimizes prediction
error signals.
From an implementational perspective, belief-updating and longitudinal changes in
hidden states occur through variational or marginal message passing [104–106] within a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) [102,107]. Importantly, active infer-
ence may serve as a general-purpose framework applicable to any cognitive process [108].
In principle, any cognitive task otherwise modeled through specific or task-dedicated
frameworks can be modeled through active inference (e.g., the drift diffusion model and
reinforcement learning models) [102,109,110].
As a biologically plausible generic data analysis procedure, a POMDP allows to assess
the causal relationship in the longitudinal dimension by answering what the value of
a phenotype parameter would be at time t + 1, given a hypothetical value at time t. A
POMDP allows assess to retrospective counterfactuals [96,97,111–113] over the structural
longitudinal changes in computational phenotypes. We invite the interested reader to
explore the implementational technicalities of a POMDP under active inference in dedicated
tutorials [102,107].
Furthermore, in active inference, prediction error signals are mathematically linked
to postsynaptic membrane potentials and the ensuing firing rates of neurons. This math-
ematical link allows the establishment, via POMDP , of neural validity to the parameter
estimates of computational phenotypes. Moreover, in theory, a POMDP model could be
fitted not only to a data set that includes behavioral responses as actions but also to a data
set comprising brain images (e.g., BOLD signals). Signals encoded in the brain images
would be regarded as observations caused by neuronal activity, collectively regarded as
hidden states in the form of brain regions (nodes). From the perspective of an active
inference agent housing a generative model of the causes of its observations, brain regions
would represent part of the agent’s hidden internal world (states). These states would
cause the signals (observations) encoded in the images.
Based on the above theoretical assumptions, a computational modeler could pursue
computational fMRI, electroencephalography, or magnetoencephalography (as just exem-
plar cases) by using the amount of belief-updating in each node (region) of the POMDP as
an explanatory variable and use this in a convolution model in the usual way.
5. Concluding Remarks: From Computational Psychiatry to Computational
Psychopathology
The present review showed key elements to conclude that identifying mind–brain
causal parameters accounting for longitudinal variability represents a necessary goal to
increase the construct validity of computational phenotypes. Integrating brain imaging with
Brain Sci.2024, 14, 1278 6 of 10
active inference in POMDPs offers a practical pathway to achieving this goal. By pursuing
the causal understanding of the longitudinal changes in model parameters relevant to a
computational phenotype, the field of computational psychiatry will likely converge with
the field of computational psychopathology [114]. While understanding the mechanisms
underlying symptoms (psychopathology) is essential, it is insufficient for the diagnosis of
a specific mental illness (psychiatry). Given this differentiation, the application of brain
imaging in mental illness will continue to be of upmost importance due to its contribution
to the mechanistic understanding of the symptoms. This understanding, we believe, will
ultimately help the psychiatry field to meet the expected goals that brain imaging brought
about in the last decade of the twentieth century.
