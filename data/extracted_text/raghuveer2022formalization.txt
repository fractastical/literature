Abstract
Expectations play a critical role in human perception, cognition, and decision-making. There has been a recent surge
in modelling such expectations and the resulting behaviour when they are violated. One prominent recent proposal is
the ViolEx model. To move the model & the literature forward, we identified three areas of concern and addressed two
in this study - Lack of formalization and implementation. Specifically, we aim to provide the first implementation of
ViolEx using the Active Inference formalism by leveraging the rich overlap between them. As a result, we successfully
simulated all expectation violation coping strategies of ViolEx and analyzed their potential mediators. Through this
analysis, we identified novel predictors of immunization & assimilation and documented the computational mechanism
of their mediation. We see this as the first step in developing a formal research framework to study expectation violations
and hope to serve as a base for future ViolEx studies.
