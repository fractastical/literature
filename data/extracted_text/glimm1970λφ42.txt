1. Introduction 
In this series of papers we construct a quantum field theory model. This model de- 
scribes a spin-zero boson field ~ with a nonlinear r selfinteraction in two dimensional 
space time. The corresponding classical field equation is 
a2~ ~2~ ~-m~+4/t~ b3=0" (1.1) 
~t ~ ~x 2 
The classical field ~ is by definition a real valued function of x and t which is a solution to 
(1.1). The quantum field ~ is also a function of x and t, but its values r t) are densely 
defined bilinear forms on some Hilbert space. The quantum field ~ is a solution to (1.1),

provided that 4 8 is suitably interpreted. The quantum field r t) depends continuously 
on x and t and the derivatives in (1.1) are taken in the sense of distributions. 
Certain averages of the quantum field 
Cq) = re(x, 0 f(x, 0 dx dt (1.2) 
r t) = fr t)/(x) dx (1.3) and 
are self adjoint operators on the Hilbert space. In addition, the quantum field r satisfies 
the canonical equal time commutation relations 
[r O, ~ r t)] = i f /(x)" dx. (1.4) 
The construction of a quantum field r satisfying (1.1)-(1.4) was one of the main results of 
the first papers in this series [10, 12] (denoted hereafter as I, II). General background ma- 
terial can be found in [9, 17, 19]. 
The field r constructed in I and II is a bilinear form on the Fock space ~, the Hilbert 
space for noninteracting bosons. The Cauchy data for the quantum field 
and (~td~)(x,O) (1.5) r 
are the same Cauchy data that give a solution to the free field equation 
~t'-2 tfree -- ~XZ tfreo "~- ?Yt2 tfree = O, (1.6) 
and that satisfy (1.4). In other words, 
r 0) = ~btr.. (x, 0) (1.7) 
and (~t) (x, 0)= (~r 0,. (1.8) 
It is expected that this quantum field theory of Iand II, with r realized on the Fock 
space ~, will not possess all the properties conventionally assumed in quantum field 
theory: For example, it seems that there will not exist a Hamiltonian operator H to generate 
time translations 
r t+~) = ~ r t)~-~. 

THE ~(~4)2 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WITHOUT CUTOFFS. III 205 
Also there will not exist a vacuum vector (a translation invariant ground state of H). 
The cause of these difficulties is made clear by the circle of ideas and results known as 
Haag's theorem [16, 24]. Haag's theorem states that if the field ~ ~=r satisfies (1.7)-(1.8) 
and if there is a Hamiltonian H for r then H will not possess a unique Euclidean invarian~ 
vacuum vector. 
In order to understand and deal with these difficulties--the lack of a Hamiltonian 
operator H on ~ and of a vacuum vector ~ in F--we first consider the cutoff field equation 
~2 ~2 
~t- ~ r - ~ r + m]r + 42gr 3 = 0. (1.9) 
Here the spatial cutoff g(x) is a smooth, positive function that equals one on some bounded 
set and that vanishes off some larger bounded set. Corresponding to the cutoff field equation 
(1.9), there is a Hamiltonian operator 
H (g) =H 0 + ~f: r (x): g(x) dx - Eg = H o + H z. g - Eg. (1.10) 
The operator H 0 is the free field Hamiltonian and it corresponds to the free field equation 
{1.6). The interaction energy operator Hz.g contains the spatial cutoff g. The operator 
Ho +Hz.g is a self adjoint operator [10, 11] and is bounded from below [22, 8]. The constant 
Eg is chosen so that 
0 = inf {spectrum H(g)}. 
The constant Ea is one of the standard renormalization counterterms of quantum field 
theory. Eg is called the self energy of the vacuum. Eg is finite because of the spatial cutoff 
and because of the limitation to only one space dimension [13]. Both g and the restriction 
to a single space variable serve to reduce the singularity of the perturbing operator H1.g. 
In I, II we constructed the Heisenberg picture dynamics for (1.1). We started from the 
locally correct equation (1.9) for which the solution is 
Cg(x, t) = e ~H(g)t r 0) e -~(g)t . (1.11) 
The solution Cg is independent of g(. ) provided g(y) = 1 for J y[ ~ Ix [ + It]. Thus by patching 
together different local solutions (1.11), corresponding to g= 1 on different sets, we con- 
structed ~ solution r to (1.1). This solution is associated with a time translation auto- 
morphism a~ implemented locally by H(g) as in (1.11). 
~(r t)) = r t +3). (1.12) 
While a vacuum vector ~ does not exist in 3, we showed in II that the approximate 

206 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
Hamiltonian H(g) does have a vacuum. In fact, zero is an isolated eigenvalue of H(g) 
with multiplicity one. Thus there is a vector ~g in ~ such that 
H(g) o= 0, I1 o11--1, (1.13) 
and ~a is unique up to a scalar multiple. 
We wish to obtain the ttamiltonian H and the vacuum ~ corresponding to (1.1) by 
taking the limit g(. )-+ 1. We cannot use the most conventional types of limits because as 
g(.)~l, 
Eg-~ - c~ (1.14) 
[13]. Furthermore, perturbation theory predicts that 
~g -~ 0, (1.15) 
in the sense of weak convergence on ~. In fact (1.15) can be compared to the simpler weak 
limit in L~(R), 
g(. )/llgll   o. 
Instead of studying these quantities, we define the expectation values 
cog(A) = (~g, A~g), (1.16) 
where A is a bounded function of the field operators (1.2) or (1.3). The set of all such A form 
a C* algebra 9~ of bounded operators on ~, and cogEq~(*, the dual space of 9~. Furthermore, 
e% is positive and has norm one, and thus cog is a state in the sense of C* algebras. We use 
a limiting process as g(. )-~ 1 to obtain a limiting expectation value co(A), and then co Eq~* 
is necessarily a state also. 
According to the Gelfand-Segal construction, co comes from a vector ~ in some new 
Hilhert space ~ren in the sense that 
co(A) = (a, =(A)a), Ilall = 1, (1.17) 
where ~: A-~(A) = Aren 
is a representation of 9~ as operators on ~ren" The Sehr6dinger picture dynamics exists on 
~ren. In the SchrSdinger picture, the time translation is given by a one parameter family 
of unitary operators 
U(t) =e -~ut. (1.18) 
If A~A(t) = a~(A) 
is the Heisenberg picture dynamics constructed in I, II, then 

THE ~(~4)2 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WITHOUT CUTOFFS. III 
~((r t (A)) = e mt zt(A) e -mr. 
Here H is positive and s is a vacuum for H, 
H~ = 0. 
207 
(1.19) 
(1.20) 
The operator H is the renormalized Hamiltonian, and it is the limit of the H(g) in the 
sense that 
(~(B) s e mt ~(A) s 
is obtained through a limit as g(- )-+ 1 of 
(Bs e~m~)t A~o). 
We call s the physical vacuum and ~ the physical representation. The vectors in ~re= are 
called physical vectors. 
The space translations are also given by a one parameter group, commuting with 
the U(t) and leaving ~ fixed. 
~(ax.~(A))=emt-wX~(A)e-att+~x, e~X~=~. (1.21) 
It is well known that certain representations of g[ (coming from states of 2 via the 
Gelfand-Segal construction) cannot be extended to the unbounded field operators r 
of (1.2), (1.3). Such states and representations seem to be totally unsuited for use in physics. 
The deepest result of this paper is the fact that the physical representation z is not one of 
these pathologieM representations. We now formulate this result in a stronger and more 
precise form. 
The C* algebra 9~ is an inductive limit. Let B be a bounded region of space time (or a 
bounded region of space at time zero). Let ~(B) be the weakly closed (von Neumann) 
algebra generated by bounded functions of the operators (1.2) or (1.3), but with / restricted 
to have support in B. Then ~ is defined as the norm closure of 
U~[(B). 
We prove that ~ is locally equivalent to the representation of 9~ as operators on the 
Fock space 3; in brief ~ is locally Foek. For each bounded region B, there is a unitary 
operator Us, 
UB: y~ y~= (1.22) 
such that for all A in g[(B), 
ze(A) = Aro= = U~AU*. (1.23) 
We have remarked that there is no vacuum vector s in 3- It immediately follows 

208 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTItUI~ JAFFE 
from the locally Foek property that for each bounded region B there is a vector ~s in 
which serves as a vacuum vector for the algebra 9~(B). In other words, for all A Eg~(B), 
~(A) = (g~, A~o.~) = (~,A~). (1.24) 
The vector ~s could be called a local vacuum. The vector ~s is not unique, but one choice 
would be U~ ~. The unitary Us is also not unique. 
An important consequence of the locally Fock property of g is the fact that the field 
~b exists on the physical Hilbert space ~e=. Let r be self adjoint on ~. This is the case if, 
for example, )t is a real, twice differentiable function with compact support [II]. Then for 
supp./~ B and for real s, 
s-~ ~(d ~(I)) = U~ e ~cf) U* 
is a weakly continuous one parameter group of unitary operators on ~re=" We let 
~(r = r (/) = u~ r u~ 
be the 
Inore~ 
self adjoint operator that is the infinitesimal generator of the group.(1) Further- 
r162 ~*, (X,t)~, 
is a densely defined bilinear form depending continuously on x and t, and eren is a solution 
to (1.1)--(1.4). All the local properties of r established in II go over immediately to r 
For example, eren is local, so that er~n(/x) and ~bren(]2) commute if the supports of/1 and/~ 
are spaeelike separated. Also, ere=(x, t) transforms correctly under the space-time translation 
group. 
r (X + ~, t + 3) = e ~- ~P~r (X, t) e -~+~. 
The Haag-Kastler axioms [15] are valid for !~ [12, 27] and carry over to g(9~) on ~r~. 
The main technical step in proving the locally Fock property of 7~ is an estimate on E~, 
-MV ~ E~. 
Here M is a positive constant and V is essentially the length of the support of the spatial 
cutoff g(. ). From this estimate it easily follows that 
(1) Our definition of tbre n is Za ~ times the usual renormalized field. The field strength renormaliza- 
tion constant Z 8 is chosen to normalize the one particle states produced by the field~b. Perturbation theory 
predicts that Z 3 is strictly positive in our model. Hence Za ~ should be finite and neglecting Z~ is merely a 
matter of convenience. 

THE ~(~4)2 QUAI~TUM FIELD THEORY WIT.OUT CUTOFFS. HI 209 
We use space translation averaging in the limiting process which defines oJ, and therefore 
we are able to conclude that 
co(H~ ~162 ~ const., 
where H~ ~176 resembles a local energy operator for free particles. An estimate of this na- 
ture, valid for a sequence o~n of Fock states implies that 
lies in a norm compact subset of the dual 9~(B)*. We note that the set of all states is w* 
compact, and that any state ~ Eg~* can be reached as a w* limit point of Fock states [5, 7J. 
In particular, the pathological states referred to above are w* limits of Fock states. How- 
ever, a norm convergent limit of Fock states is normal on 9~(B), and this excludes the un- 
wanted states. In order to complete the construction of Us, we use the result of Araki [1] 
that ~(~) is a factor of type III, for any bounded open set ~ at time zero. We also use a 
result of Griffin [14] that isomorphisms between separable factors of type III are unitarily 
implementable. 
There are several properties of ~ E ~ren which we have not established. For example, 
the uniqueness of ~ is one of the Wightman axioms. Also ~ should be in the domain of 
any polynomial in the field operators ~ren(/)" 
The main phenomenon that we encounter in this paper is the necessity of changing 
Hilbert spaces. This is a common feature of quantum field theory. In all cases this phe- 
nomenon can be traced to the fact that the fundamental objects, such as the Hamiltonian 
or energy operator, are given in the form 
(Self adjoint operator) + (Perturbation) 
with the perturbation exceedingly singular. (In the (~b4)2 theory, the perturbation is a bilinear 
form, but not an operator on 3- In fact the perturbation is so singular that the total Hamil- 
tonian, as a bilinear form on Fock space, is unbounded below. It does not yield an operator 
on Fock space, but on ~re, the renormalized Hamiltonian is a positive self adjoint operator.) 
Two important reasons for this phenomenon are the translation invariance of the Hamil- 
tonian and the fact that the interaction involves an infinite number of degrees of freedom. 
The results of this paper extend to the interaction P(~)2, where P is a scmibounded 
polynomial. L. Rosen [28] has proved for this model that the cutoff Hamiltonian H(g)= 
H 0 +Hng is essentially self adjoint and has a vacuum vector. We expect that the conclu- 
sions of section 2 of this work remain valid for certain models, even when the estimates on 
the vacuum self energy derived in section 5 fail to hold. In particular, we expect that if the 
vacuum energy in a finite volume has a logarithmic (but not a linear) ultraviolet divergence, 

210 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
the corresponding physical representation is still locally Fock. In two dimensional space- 
time, the interaction P(r162 has this property. Here P(~b) is a polynomial bounded 
from below and Q(r is a polynomial of lower degree than P. The two dimensional Yukawa 
interaction v~r also has a logarithmic vacuum energy divergence so we expect that the 
theory is locally Foek. 
The logical order of the following sections is 5, 3, 4, 2. We have rearranged this order to 
present results, first, followed by details of increasing complexity. 
2. The physical representation and renormali74ation 
In this section we construct the physical vacuum vector ~ and the corresponding 
Hilbert space ~ren. On ~re= we construct the renormalized self adjoint Hamiltonian H, 
and the self adjoint momentum operator P. The space time translations are implemented 
by the unitary group 
U(~, T) = e tHv-lp~ (2.1) 
and the vacuum satisfies Hl'l = P~ = 0. (2.2) 
Furthermore, H and P commute and H ~> 0. 
We construct ~ as a limit of the vacuum vectors ~ of the cutoff Hamiltonians H(g). 
For concreteness, we take g(x) to be a nonnegative C~ function equal to one on the interval 
[-3, 3]. Let 
g. (x) = g(z/n) (2.3) 
1 f (~a,, a~ (A ) ~o,) h(ot/n) d~, (2.4) and for AEg~, let ton(A) =n 
where a~ is the space translation automorphism (see II, sections 3.6 and 4). The function 
h(. ) >~0 is C ~176 has support in [- 1, 1] and 
f h(x)dx= l =l f (2.5) 
By a general compactness principle for states on a C* algebra, there is a w* conver- 
gent subnet eon~ of the states {con}. 
Thus for each A E ~[, w,j(A)-~ o~(A). 
The limiting state to can be used to construct the inner product of a new Hilbert space 
~ren, and the operators A E~ can be realized as operators on ~re=. The advantage of working 
on the Hflbert space ~r,= is that the space-time automorphisms aa are given by unitary 
operators (2.1). We state some results.

TH ~ 0 R E M 2.1. Let r be a w* limit point o/the sequence con Eg*. There is a subsequence o/ 
the con which converges w* to o~. There is a separable Hilbert space ~ren, a * isomorphism 7e 
o/9~, a continuous unitary representation U o/R ~, and a vector ~ E ~en such that 
co(A) = (~, u(A)~) = (~, A~o.~) (2.6) 
U (a)g(A ) U(-a) = ~(aa(A)) (2.7) 
and U(a)~=~. (2.8) 
The spectrum o/the generator H o/time translation8 is contained in the interval [0, ~). 
The existence of ~ren, g and gs satisfying (2.6) is the Gelfand-Segal theorem [21]. 
We will prove Theorem 2.1 using the locally Fock property of g, which also leads to the 
properties of ere. explained in section 1. 
T ~ E O R v, M 2.2. Let ~o be a w* limit point o/the sequence (o~n} and let ~ be the corresponding 
representation o/9~. Let ~ be a bounded region o/space time or o/ space at t = O. Then there 
is a unitary operator U~: ~--> ~en such that/or A Eg~(B) 
7e(A) = UsA U*. (2.9) 
In short, we say that w and n are locally Fock. 
The locally Fock property of o~ rests on the following theorem. 
THEOR]~M 2.3. Let B be a bounded region o/sTace time or o/space at t=0. Then the 
sequence 
o~. ~2(B) e~(B)* (2.10) 
lies in a norm compact subset o/2(B)*. Any limit point r ~ 2(B) is normal. 
The proof of Theorem 2.3 will be given in the following sections. We introduce some yon 
Neumann algebra terminology [2]. A state ~ of a von Neumann algebra ~ is called normal if 
sup ~(A~) ~- ~ (sup A~) (2.11) 
for each monotone increasing generalized sequence {A~}, A~ E~, provided the sequence 
A~ is bounded from above, so that sup A~ exists. 
Let us consider linear functionals on ~J~ of the form A ~l(A), 
I(A) = ~ (AO,, v2,), (2.12) 

212 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
where ~ II0,11 ~ < ~, ~ Ilw, II ~ < ~. (2.13) f-1 t-1 
Ultraweak convergence in ~j~ is defined by convergence of all linear functionals of the 
form (2.12)-(2.13), and conversely each ultraweakly continuous linear functional on 
can be represented in the form (2.12)-(2.13) [2, page 40]. A state Q is ultraweakly con- 
tinuous if and only if it is normal, and every ultraweakly continuous linear functional can 
be written as a linear combination of four normal states [2, page 54]. The norm of 1 fi ~Cj~* 
defined by 
H = sup {Ig(A)l: A E ~, IIAII < 1}. (2.14) 
The A in (2.14) can be restricted to a subalgebra ~)~0 of ~ which is weakly or ultraweakly 
dense in ~rj~, by Kaplansky's density theorem [2, page 46, page 43]. 
We apply these concepts to the yon Neumann algebra 9~(B) and the weakly dense 
subalgebra 9~0(B ) generated (algebraically) by the operators 
{e ~r et4(1): supp/cB,/E O~}, (2.15) 
where B is a region of space time or of space at t = 0. 
Proo/ o/ Theorem 2.2. We first prove that z ~ 9~(B) is ultraweakly continuous. The right 
and left multiplications 
A -+AC and A-+CA 
are ultraweakly continuous on B(y). For 01 and 02 in some 9~(B1), with B1 D B, 
A -+ O* A C2 E ?i(Bi) 
is ultraweakly continuous. By Theorem 2.3, to ~ ~-~(B1) is normal, and hence ultraweakly 
continuous. Thus 
A-+ to(O~AC2) = (~t(C1) ~, z(A) :t(C~) ~2) (2.16) 
is ultrawcakly continuous. Since the vectors ~r(C~) ~ run over a dense subset of ~ren, and 
since :t(A) is bounded, the map 
A-+zt(A), AE2(B) 
is ultraweakly-weakly continuous. (This map is also ultraweakly continuous.) 
Since 9~(B) is ultraweakly separable, :t(9~(B)) has a countable, weakly dense subset. 

THE ~(~4)2 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WlTI~OUT CUTOFFS. III 213 
Since the weak and strong closures of a linear subspace of ~ren coincide, ~(~(~)) has a 
countable, strongly dense subset. But 
U~(~(~)) 
is dense in ~ren, SO ~ren is separable also. 
In proving the theorem, we replace B by a bounded open set at time zero (the domain 
of dependence of ~), since this change merely enlarges ~(~). For such a B at time zero, 
Araki has shown that ~(~) is a factor of type III [1]. His proof requires a computation that 
a certain operator is not of trace class, and he shows that the operator in question is closed 
but not everywhere defined due to the conditions at the boundary of ~. Thus his proof which 
is given in three spatial dimensions is valid in one spatial dimension, and is somewhat 
easier in the latter case. 
The kernel of r~ ~(B) is a weakly closed two sided ideal. Since there are no proper 
weakly closed two sided ideals in any factor, we see that ker (~ ~ 9~(~)) equals zero and 
~ 9~(~) is an isomorphism. According to a theorem of E. Griffin [14], r~ ~(~), as an iso- 
morphism between separable type III factors, is unitarily implemented. This completes 
the proof. 
We remark that the argument of the above paragraph combined with the fact that 
there are no norm closed two sided ideals in a factor of type III shows that ~ is simple, 
and thus 7~ is an isomorphism of 9~. 
Proo/ o/ Theorem 2.1. On the metric space ~*(B), compactness implies sequential 
compactness. Thus using Theorem 2.3, we can find a subsequence con~ with 
Using the diagonal process, the subsequence can be chosen independently of B. 
The existence of the unitary U(a) satisfying (2.7)-(2.8) follows from the Gelfand-Segal 
construction if for each space-time translation a~, 
a)(a~(A)) = w(A). (2.17) 
Thus we must show that co is a fixed point of a*. Since ~o is norm continuous, it is sufficient 
to take A in the dense subalgebra 
U~ 2(~B). 
Thus we let A belong to ~(B) for some region B, and we choose n sufficiently large so that 
for all (x, t) E B, 
 >l l+ltl. 

214 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
We define BIll as the set of points within the distance ] z [ of . With the above restrictions, 
H(g,~) is a Hamiltonian for Yl~l+l~J, provided that [a[ <n and ]v[ <n. The restriction on 
is satisfied if 
E supp h(./n). 
Under these restrictions a~(a~(AI)E ~(~gM+l~l) 
and (r~ (a~ (A)) = aT (a,, (A)) = e m't as (A) e- m,,~, 
see II. We have set Hn =H(gn)=Ho+Hz, o-Eo. (2.I8) 
Since e- atn T ~o~ = ~o~, 
we see that for a in supp h(. In) and [v[ <n, 
(fIo~, a~(a~(A)) f2o. ) = (f/o~, a~(A) f~o.) 
and con (a~ (A) ) = con (A). 
The formula (2.17) for time translations follows immediately. 
In order to prove (2.17) for space translations, we substitute ap(A) for A in (2.4) 
and perform a change of variables ~-~-fl in the integration. This leads to the estimate 
j~o~((~p(A)-A)] 
=1 If (~g,a~,(A)~o,){h((a-fl)/n)-h(o:/n)}d~z[<~[[A,] h(=)[ da 
This vanishes as n-~ ~o, so that for Ae2(B), 
o(az(A)) = co(A), 
(2.17) is valid, and U(a) does exist. 
We prove now the strong continuity of U(a). The vectors ze(A)~ are dense in ~o~ 
for A in (J~ 9~(]g) for bounded space-time regions B. If aa(A) is in some ~(B), we have 
U(a) ~(A) ~ = ~(aAA)) 
by (2.7) and (2.8). By (2.9), 
U (a) u(A ) ~ = U~(7~(A ) U* ~. (2.19) 
Since ~ is implemented locally on ~ by unitary operators of the form 
exp (ill(g)v) exp (-iPa), 
the right side of (2.19) is strongly continuous in a. This proves the strong continuity of 
U(a) on a dense set of vectors, which is sufficient.

The remaining assertion of the theorem is that H >~ 0. Let 
H = fpdE(lx ) 
be the spectral resolution of H. Then we define 
= o.)(A*a~(A)) = (~(A) ~, ear~(A) ~) = fe'~'~d [[E(/~) ~(A)~II ~, (2.20) F(~) 
In order to prove that H has nonnegative spectrum, we must show that only the half line 
[0, co) contributes to the integral (2.20). For A in some local algebra 2(B), we infer from 
Theorem 2.3 that F(T) is the limit through a subsequenee of the similar functions 
where H n is defined in (2.I8). Since H~ >/0, F~(x) has a Fourier transform ~n(/~) with sup- 
port in the half line [0, ~). The subsequence Fn~(v) converges pointwise to F, and is uni- 
formly bounded, 
I P i( )l < iIAII'. 
Hence the F~ converge to F as tempered distributions, and consequently the Fourier 
transforms Pn~ converge as tempered distributions also. Their limit P must therefore have 
support in [0, c~), and so only the interval [0, c~) contributes to (2.20). As the vectors 
g(A)~, A Eg~(B), are dense in ~o~, this shows that H>~0. 
3. Local number operators 
In this section we define local number operators 2V~, N~.s and N~. ~ and we investigate 
their properties. Each of these operators is the biquantization of an operator on the one 
particle space. We reduce the study of such quantized operators to the study of the cor- 
responding one particle operators. We analyze the one particle operators in detail, and 
thereby arrive at results for the quantized operators. In Section 3,3 we assume the estimates 
derived in Section 5, and we show that expectation values of the above local number opera- 
tors in the approximate vacuum states ~on are bounded uniformly in n. We shall use such 
results in Section 4. 
3.1. One particle operators. The one particle space consists of Lebesque square integrable 
functions L2(R1). We study operators c on L2(R 1) that are defined on the dense domain 

216 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
S(R1), the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing C ~ functions with rapidly decreasing 
derivatives. We require that c be a bounded transformation from $(R 1) to L~(R1), 
II~lll~ < II111~, (3.1.1) 
where I1" I1~ denotes some Schwartz space norm. Such an operator c can be represented by 
a tempered distribution kernel. The Fourier transform is an operator of this type. 
c 
/(~) = (2 =)-* J y (p) e -'~ alp. (3.1.2) 
Corresponding to the physical interpretation of position and momentum, we say that 
Fourier transformation connects the momentum representation with the configuration 
space (position) representation. This physical identification corresponds to the introduction 
of Ne~r position coordinates. 
To each bounded operator %:$(R1)~L2(R 1) in the momentum representation, there 
is a bounded operator c~: $(R 1) ~L2(R 1) in the configuration space representation, where 
(3.1.3) 
Conversely given c~ there is a corresponding %. 
We now mention a few other examples. Let/~(p) be the energy of a particle of mass 
m 0. The operator % =/~(p)~ of multiplication by 
~(py = (p~ + m0~) ~ (3.1.4) 
maps S(R 1) onto S(R1). 
The configuration space operator/~ corresponding to ju(p) 9 is convolution by a kernel 
k~. Here k~(x) is C ~ except for x = 0. If ~/2 is a nonnegative integer, k~ has support at x = 0. 
Otherwise k~(x) decreases exponentially at infinity. Explicitly [25, page 185], 
F [- ~) 
from which we see that for ~ >i - 1, 
t I k~(x) <o(~-~,,% as Ixl~, (3.1.~) 
for n=0, 1, 2 .... For ~< -1, estimates of the form (3.1.6) hold if m 0 is replaced by m0-~, 
for any ~ > 0. 

THE ~(~4)2 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WITHOUT CUTOFFS. III 217 
A third example of an operator Cx which we will need is multiplication by the charac- 
teristic function E(x) of an interval B = [a, b]. The Fourier transformed operator % is con- 
volution by 
/\2 89 sin ((a-b) p/2)= I-! (e '(~ (2~)-+R(p). (3.1.7) \~1 P 
A fourth example of an operator % is multiplication by a C~ function $(x). The cor- 
responding % is convolution by (2~)-89 S(R1). Both cx and % map $(R 1) into itself. 
Thus the operator 
% = ~(x)/t~ ~(x) (3.1.8) 
is a bounded transformation of $(R 1) into itself, and it is a localization of the operator 
#x. We also want a localized version of/t~ with a sharp boundary. Thus we wish to replace 
~(x) in (3.1.8) by E(x). 
THEOREM 3.1.1. Let ~ < ~. Then E(x)/~ E(x) is a bounded operator/tom S(R i) to Lz(Ri). 
Let z < {. 11 $(x) is a positive C~ /unction equal to one in a neighborhood o I the support o 1 
E(x), and i I e>0, then as bilinear ]orms on S(R l) x S(Ri), 
E(x) tt~E(x) <~ const. $(x) #~'+~ ~(x), (3.1.9) 
where the constant depends only on 7:, e and supp E. 
Proo 1. It is sufficient to prove that for ~ < 88 e > 0, and /E $(Ri), 
(1, E#~'E[) < const. (/,/t~+*l). (3.1.10) 
In that case HE#~E1[I ~ < II~EIII ~= (1, Et~:E/)< const. (3.1.11) 
which shows that E(x) tt~E(x) is an operator and a bounded transformation from $(R i) to 
L 2 (Ri). Furthermore, /= ~1 + (1 - ~)1 and 
El = E~/. 
(1, E#~E]) = (~1, EI~E~1) < const. (1, ~/t~+*~l), Hence 
which is (3.1.9). 
In order to prove (3.1.10), we write 
(/, EtudE/) = (t, Eg~I) + (/, E~, E]/). 
Since I(/, E~I)I < lI/ll ll~lll -< const, llm~tll ~,

We now show that for any e > 0, there is a constant such that h(p)<~ const. #(p)-l+~+,. 
We break up the integral in (3.1.15) into two regions:

TH:EOREM 3.1.2. Let 0<~< ~ and let c~ be the Friedrichs extension o/ 
where E(x) is the characteristic /unction /or a bounded interval . Then c~ commutes with 
the orthogonal projection o/ L z (R 1) onto L2 (B), and 
[c~ ~ LI(B)] -1 
is a vompact operator. 
Proo/. The projection of L~(R 1) onto LI(B ) is given by multiplication by E(x). Clearly 
E(x)/~E(x) Commutes with multiplication by E(x) on $(R1), since B(x)~= E(x). By con- 
tinuity, this extends as a bilinear form to the domain O(c~)  O(c~), and so holds on ~(%) 
as an operator equality. 
In order to show that c~ has a compact resolvent on LI(B), it is sufficient to show that 
the resolvent of c~ is compact on L~(B). The latter is true if whenever O is a set of vectors 
such that 
O=O(c~ ~ LI(B) ) (3.1.24) 
and sup Ilc~/H < co, (3.1.25) feV 
then ~) has a compact closure. It is sufficient to replace ~(c~ ~L~.(B)) in (3.1.24) by any core 
of c~ ~ LI(B ). By definition of the Friedrichs extension, $(R 1) is a core for c~ and E(x) $(R 1) 
is a core for c~ ~L~(B). 
It is convenient to imbed LI(B ) in L~(R 1) and to write a noulocal expression for c~. 
For/e E(x) $(R1), we have

or eqnieontinuity of the functions in O. It is a classical result that an equieontinuous set 
D of L~ functions with support in a bounded interval has a compact closure D-. This 
completes the proof of the theorem. 
3.2. Quantized operators on Fock space. We first review (1) some standard notation. The 
Fock space y for noninteraeting bosons is the Hflbert space completion of the direct sum 
of n-particle Fock spaces, oO 
y= @0y.. (3.2J) 
Here Y0 is the complex numbers and yn is the completion in L2(R '~) of the n-fold symmetric 
tensor product of y~ =L~(R1). Thus a vector / = {/n} r y is a sequence of n particle vectors 
in Yn, I]/H~=~=0 ][/=[[2- As for the one particle space, we represent n particle vectors in 
the momentum representation/n(k 1 ..... k=) or in the configuration representation/~(x 1 ..... Xn). 
(Xl ..... x=) = (2 f(k  ..... k=) dk, (3.2.2) 
where kx = ~'~a ki x~ and dk = YI~l dke Fourier transformation is an isomorphism of y= 
and of y. We use a domain D0 = Y of well behaved vectors, The vectors in Do have a 
finite number of particles with wave functions in the Schwartz space $(Rn), 
Do = {1 :/flY,/n=0 for large n, and/ne$(Rn)} (3.2.3) 
Fourier transformation maps D0 onto itself. 
We define the annihilation operator a(k) on D0, which maps Yn onto Yn-r For /E D0, 
(a(k)/)n-1 (kl ..... kn-1) = n89 (]r ]r ..... IOn-l), (3.2.4) 
so that a(k) 'Do ~ Do. Clearly [a(k), a(k')] Do = 0 
and any product a(k 0 ... a(k~) is defined on the domain Do. 
The adjoint a(k)* of a(k) has domain zero as an operator, but it is a densely defined 
bilinear form on D0  Do- Even though a(k)* is not a densely defined operator, we follow 
convention and call it the creation operator for a particle with momentum k. 
Any monomial of creation and annihilation operators 
(1) Formulations of Fock space and operators on it may be found in many places. Convenient for 
our point of view is the systematic treatment of Kristensen, Mejlbo and Poulsen [20]. Creation and anni- 
hilation operators as bilinear forms were also considered by Galindo [6]. Our use in [10J of weak inte- 
grals of bilinear forms has been questioned [23], and for this reason we present the elementary details 
leading to formula (3.2.7). We note that every Wightman field ~b(x) is a densely defined bilinear form 
with C ~ dependence on x [3]. 

THE ~(r QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WITHOUT CUTOFFS. I~ 223 
a*(kl) ... a*(k~)a(kl) ... a(kp), (3.2.5) 
with the creation operators to the left of the annihilators, is a bilinear form on 9o  9o 
with values 
(/, a* (ki) .,, a* (k~) a(pa) ... a(p~) g) E S(R~+~). (3.2.6) 
Thus if cap(k;p)E $' (R ~+p) is a tempered distribution, 
Cap = fcaB (k; p)a* (kl)... a* (ka)a(pl)... a(pp)dk dp (3.2.7) 
is a bilinear form on 9o  90 that exists as a weak integral of bilinear forms. The Cap of 
(3.2.7) is a Wick ordered monomial and is the quantization of the tempered distribution 
c~p(k; p). 
If c~B(k;p ) is the kernel of a bounded operator c~p from $(RP) to L~(R~), then the 
bilinear form Cap on 90  90 determines an unbounded operator on ~ with domain 9o- 
In order to establish this, we note that if ivr is the identity operator on Lf(Rv), then 
c~p| is a bounded operator from $(R~)| S(Rv) into Lf(R~+v), and it extends uniquely 
to a bounded operator from S(RP ~v) into L~(R~+v). 
Symmetrization is a projection on L~ and on S. Thus the symmetrization of c~| r 
in the ~ § initial variables and in the :r 47 final variables yields a bounded operator from 
$(RZ+v) to L~(R~+v), and an unbounded operator from ~P+v to ~a+v with domain $(RZ+v) 
YP+v" Finally, C~p is the sum over 7 of the symmetrizations of ((a + 7) !/7 !) ((/~ + 7) !/7 !)89 
c~B| v with domain 90. 
If cn is a bounded operator from S(R 1) to Lf(R~), then the operator C~I has a closure 
on ~ if the operator Cli has a closure as an unbounded operator from L~(R 1) to L~(R1). If 
c~p is bounded from L~(RZ) to Lf(R~), then C~B has a closure with domain containing 
9(N(~+P)/2), where N is the total number of particles operator defined by 
(N/)n = n/,. (3.2.8) 
If [[c~p[[ is the norm of caz as a transformation from L~ (R ~) to L 2 (R ~) then 
II (N + i)-~,2 c~ B (N + i)-~/21[ ~< Ilc:pH. (3.2.9)

If c~ maps $(R~) continuously into ~(R~), then C~ maps 90 into 90- 
By Fourier transformation we define the annihilation operator A(x) for a particle a~ 
the space point x, 

224 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
A (x) = (2 st)- 89 e-tVx dp, (3.2.10) 
corresponding to the quantization of c01(p) = (2~t) -11~ exp ( - ipx). In the configuration space 
representation, for f E Do, 
(A(x) /),,-l(Xl, ..., xn-1) = nt/,,(x, Xl, ..., x,,_l). (3.2.11) 
As above, we can quantize a tempered distribution c~p(x; y) yielding 
C~,p = f c~p (x; y) A* (Xl) ... A* (x~,) A (y~) ... .4(yB) dx dy, (3.2. 12) 
a bflinear form on O0  O0- These C~p have the same properties as the C~p in the momentum 
representation discussed above. 
We also use the Foek space ~(B) defined over the one particle space L2(B ) where B is 
an interval in RL 
~(B) =.~o ~" (1~)' (3.2.13) 
where ~(B) is the Hilbert space completion of the n-fold symmetric tensor product of 
L~(B)= ~x(B). If Bc B~, then ~(B)c ~(Bs)-If B=B1U B2 and B1A B2 = O, then 
y(B) = Y(~I)(~s y(B$), (3.2.14) 
where | s denotes the completion of the symmetric tensor product. 
We now specialize to study the biquantization C of operators c on the one particle 
space ~1- For simplicity, we do not write c1~ or Clr We consider operators c studied in 
Section 3.1; they are defined on the domain S(R 1) and are continuous transformations 
of S(R 1) into L~(R'). Then on the domain Do, 
C = fc(x, y).4* (x) .4 (y) dx dy, (3.2.15) 
where c(x, y) is the kernel of c. 
We give some examples which we call local number operators: 
N~ is the quantization of multiplication by E(x). (3.2.16) 
N~ is the quantization of g~. (3.2.17) 
Nr. ~ is the quantization of ~(x)lx~(x ). (3.2.18) 
N~. B is the quantization of E(x)la~ E(x), for r < 88 (3.2.19) 
In the ease r= 1, the operator N1. ~ provides a local energy operator H~ ~176 discussed in 
Section 1.

THEOREM 3.2,1. The operator C ~ Do o] (3.2.15) has any o] the ]ollowlng properties if 
and only i] the operator c ~ $(R 1) has the same property. 
(a) The operator is essentially sel/ ad]oint. 
(b) The operator is positive. 
(c) The operator is positive and the Friedriche extension (or closure) has a compact 
resolven$. 
Proo/. (a) If C ~ Do has a self adjoint closure, the domain of the self adjoint closure 
contains a dense set of analytic vectors. Since C commutes with the projection of ~ onto 
~1, there is a dense set of one particle analytic vectors, obtained as limits of one particle 
states in $(R1). Thus they arc in the domain of the closure of c, and c is essentially self 
adjoint. Conversely, if c ~ $(R 1) has a self adjoint closure, the domain of the closure c- 
contains a total set of analytic unit vectors e~(x), i = 1, 2 .... The vectors e~, ... ~, = e, | ~ ... | e~, 
are n-particle vectors in the domain of the closure of C ~ Do- Clearly they are C ~176 vectors 
for C-, since 
Furthermore if, 
then 
C-et,...~ =c-e~,| | +... +e~,|174 
...... 
Thus the e~,...u are analytic vectors for C- and C ~ Do is essentially self adjoint. 
(b) If C is positive, c is clearly positive. Conversely, suppose that c is positive and 
In(x1 ..... xn) e Do ~ ~n. Then for each x 2 ..... xn, ],(Xl, x2 .... , xn) E $(R 1) and 
f~ (Xl, x~ ..... xn) c(x, y) ]~ (y, x~ ..... x,) dy >1 dx 0 
is a function in $(Rn-1). Thus integrating over x 2 ..... xn we have shown that c is a positive 
operator on each n particle coordinate and hence C is positive on D0 N ~n, and so on Do. 
(c) Let Cp and cF be the Friedriehs extensions of C ~ D0 and c ~ $(R 1) respectively. 
It is sufficient to show that c~ has a compact resolvent if and only if C~ does. Note that 
Do is a core for C~ and $(R 1) is a core for c~. The Friedrichs extension CF commutes with the 
projection P1 onto ~1 as a bilinear form on D(C~) x D(C~), and hence as an operator on 
D(CF). Thus C~ commutes with P,, and if C~ has a compact resolvent, so does c~ =PiC~P,. 
Conversely, if c~ has a compact resolvent, we choose orthonormal eigenvectors et of c~ cor- 
responding to eigenvalues 0 ~<~t~, ~tt -~ cr Since et=limj..~e~j where etj(x)E $(R 1) and 

226 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
lim (%- e~, ce o - e~,) = O, (3.2.20) 
it follows that e~..~,=%| ... | is in the domain of C~, and hence is an eigenvector 
with eigenvalue ~a +... § 2~. These eigenvectors are total in ~, so that C~ has been diagonal- 
ized. It has discrete spectrum and eigenvalues 
n~ )t~ (3.2.21) i=0 
for nonnegative integers n~, only a finite number being non-zero. Since 2~-+ co, the eigen- 
values have no point of accumulation except co and hence C~ has a compact resolvent. 
This completes the proof. 
COI~OLLARY 3.2.2. (a) The operators N~ and N are essentially sel] adjoint on go. The 
operators N~. ~ /or ~(x) >~ 0 and Nv. ~ ]or ~ < 88 are positive. 
(b) I/0<~<~, the JFriedrichs extension o/N~.~ has a compact resolvent on ~(~). 
(c) Let B be a bounded interval and 
J 
~= UBj. J=Z 
Then/or 0 < v < 1 the Friedrichs extension o/ 
Y 
Z N~.~ t=1 
has a compact resolvent on ~(B). 
Proof. We need only prove (b) and (c). Since the Friedrichs extension of E/~E com- 
mutes with the projection of L2(R 1) onto/~(B) (see the proof of Theorem 3.1.2) a similar 
argument shows that the Friedrichs extension of N~. ~ commutes with the orthogonal pro- 
jection P~ of ~ onto ~(B). The corollary now follows from part (c) of the theorem, which can 
be proved for operators C ~P~0 and c ~ E$(R 1) on ~(B)and L2(B ). The compactness of 
the resolvent of (EF~E)F is proved in Theorem 3.1.2. This completes the proof of (b). 
The proof of (c) follows from the compactness on L2(}~ ) of the resolvent of 
J 
( ~ Ej#~ Ej)F, (3.2.22) 
t=1 
where Ej is the characteristic function of Bj. Noting that 11/112 ~< 5~=1 I]Ej/H s, we follow the 
proof of Theorem 3.1.2 in order to establish the compactness of the resolvent of the 
operator (3.2.22).

results of Section 5, and give estimates on the vacuum expectation values of local number

operators. We first recall some definitions. In terms of the A(x) and A(x)*, the local fields 
r and ~(x) are defined by 
1 r = -~ #;~(A* (x) + A (x)) (3.3.1) 
~r(x) -i i(A*(x)-A(x)), (3.3.2) -V~# x 
and are S(R 1) valued bilinear forms on O0  O0. 
In Section 2 we defined the approximate vacuum ton by 
ton(A) =n (non, a~(A) ~g,) h(oc/n) d~. (3.3.3)

we need only consider the Wick ordered terms in (3.3.8). Each such term has ?" annihilators, 
j = 0, 1, 2, and 2 - j creators. We now show that it is sufficient to consider the terms with

square root of the Friedrichs extension of r ~. The desired inequality now follows from 
part (b) of this theorem, by choosing e sufficiently small so that 2v +e ~< 1. 
4. Norm compactness of the approximate vacuums 
In this section we use the bounds on the local number operators derived in Section 3. 
We give a proof of Theorem 2.3, and hence complete the proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2. 
We restate our result as Theorem 4.1, in a somewhat more general form. 
THEOREM 4.1. Let con be a sequence o] normal states de]ined on the algebra 91 and suppose 
that/or some T > 0 and/or each ~(x) >~ 0 in C~, 
con (~v~. ~) < M, (4.1) 
where M = M(~) a translation invariant constant independent o/n. Then the sequence On ~ 91(B) 
lies in a norm compact subset o/the dual 91()*, and any limit point co ~ 9~(B) is normal. 
Remarks. 1. The state con defined in (2.4) is a normal state on 91, since the vector state 
(~2q,,. g/q,) is normal and the space translation automorphism (ra in (2.4) is implemented by 
a one parameter continuous unitary group of operators on ~. Hence aa extends to a strongly 
continuous automorphism of all bounded operators on ~. 
2. In Theorem 3.3.1 we established the bound (4.1) for all z~<l in the case that the 
con are the approximate vacuum states defined in (2.4) for the (r interaction. Thus a 
proof of Theorem 4.1 provides a proof of Theorem 2.3.

ton (Na. r ~< m~-" ton (N~. r 
If a<89 and a<88 then for a bounded interval B we conclude from (4.1) and the proof of 
Theorem 3.3.1 (d) that 
r ) ~< M, (3.3.6a) 
for a translation invariant constant M=M(B) that is independent of n. The estimate 
(3.3.6 (a)), for some a > 0, is the crucial estimate in the proof of Theorem 4.1. 
The method of proof is to use (3.3.6(a)) to replace the sequence con by a regularized 
sequence to ~ n that is close to con in norm. 
II n-  =11 < (4:2) 
In the regularized state ~o~, there will be only a finite number of particles in each bounded 
region of space, and that number will grow at most as a power of the diameter of the region. 
These bounds on (D~ will be uniform in n. 
The algebra ~0(B) defined in (2.15) is weakly dense in 9~(B). Since 
it is sufficient to prove that any sequence (D~ ~ 9~0(fl) has a norm convergent subsequenee. 
The next step in the proof is to approximate CEg~0(B ) by an operator C s such that 
I o=(c- <  llcII, (4.3) 
where C 8 is independent of n. The approximation C 8 of C is obtained by expanding the 
exponentials in C in power series, each term of which is a product of unbounded field 
operators. Because of the regularity of (D~, the expectation value (D~(C) has a corresponding 
infinite series expansion which converges uniformly in n. To obtain C s, we neglect the tail 
of this expansion and we also localize each term in a finite interval of space. The localiza- 
tion also leads to a small error, uniform in n, and satisfying (4.3). 
Finally it will be possible to apply the compactness of the resolvent of the localized 
number operator N~.~ proved in Corollary 3.2.2(c), in order to prove that the twice regu- 
larized expectation values ~(C s) have a subsequence such that 
e (De C e ( )l < o(1)Ilcll. (4.4) 
From (4.2)-(4.4) we will conclude that Theorem 4.1 is valid. 

232 JAMES OLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
We prove Theorem 4.1 in the case where B is an open interval of space whose closure 
is contained in (0, 1). This restriction on B is for convenience only. Let 
xj = [i, j+l). 
The local number operators Nz~, ~=0, _+ 1 ..... are commuting self adjoint operators. Let 
P:. ~ denote the spectral projection of the self adjoint operator Nx~ for the spectral interval 
[0, 1]. 
If 0~(x) is a C~ function equal to one on X0, then ~j(x)=$(x+]) equals one on X~ 
and 
By (3.3.6 (a)) in the case ~ = 0, 
Nxj <~ No. r 
~On (Nx~) <~ M~. (4.5) 
The constant ~r 1 is independent of n and of ?'. In the following, we introduce constants 
M s ..... independent of n and of C in ~[. 
From (4.5) we have ~On (I - Pl.j) ~< M11-1. (4.6) 
We use this fact to construct the approximate vacuum w~, by keeping a finite number of 
particles in each interval Xp For some constant Ms to be chosen later, we define 
1 = l(j) = M~e-~(1 + ~3). (4.7) 
We define the projection P = ~ Pztj~.j, (4.8) ~[= - OO 
and we define the linear functional o)~(. ) on ~[ by 
co~ (C) = o9,) (PCP). (4.9) 
By (4.8) and the fact that the Pl.j are commuting projections, we have 
Thus

Note that [COn (A* B)[ 2 ~ COn (A'A) con (B'B). (4.13)

Thus from (4.11) we conclude that

We now study an operator CE ~o(B). Thus 
J 
C = ~ cge ~(rp+~(hj). (4.15) 
The test functions/j and hj are smooth and their support is contained in B. For such a C, 
it is obvious what an expansion in terms of field operators means. First we expand C in 
terms of annihilation and creation operators A and A*. We write 
co 
C = ~.~.0 C~, (4.16) 
where Cap is a Wick ordered monomial of degree a in creation operators A* and of degree fl 
in annihilation operators A. Thus 
c~a = fc~a(xi ..... x~, X~r ..... Xa+fl) A*(xl)... A*(xa) A(xa+i)... A(x~,+#) dx. (4.17) 
The kernel cap(x ) is symmetric in the ~r creation variables x x ..... x~ and in the fl annihilation 
variables xa+x, ..., xa+ B. We note several properties of the operators C~p, the kernels cap(x), 
and the corresponding operator caa from ~p to ~a. 
Suppose that the kernel cap(x ) has support in the region

We want to show that cap(x ) is exponefitially small at infinity in each of the variables 
x~. For this purpose we define a localization multi-index L= {L1; L 2, ..:, L~+~}. We let ~L~ 
be an integer corresponding to the localization of the coordinat@ xk in the interval X~. 
We use the localization indices L to localize the operator Cap. We define 
~+~ ,L c~ (x) = Sym. c~ (x) ~I E(XLt), L = {Lk}, (4.24) k=l 
where E(Xj) is the characteristic function for the interval Xj. The symmetrization in (4.24) 
symmetrizcs the kernel in the u creation variables (xl ..... xa) and in the ~ annihilation 
variables (x~+ 1 .... , x~+p). The corresponding localized operator c~ from ~p to ~ has the 
kernel c~(x). We denote by C~ the localized, quantized-operator arising from c~.

We note that the kernels cap(x ) from operators CEg~0(B ) are functions in $(Ra+P). 
Thus each term in (4.24) before symmetrization is a bounded operator from L~(RP) to 
L~(R ~) with a norm bounded by I[c~pll. Hence the same holds for c~ (x) and

C is expanded in terms of the fields ~(y) and ~(y), only points yEB enter the expansion. 
The expansion (4.17) approximately preserves this localization, and (4.31) is a quantitative 
estimate of the loss of locality that results from using the A*, A expansion. 
We now study the operator PC~P where P is the projection defined in (4.8). By 
definition P projects onto a subspace of ~ with a finite number 10") of particles in each 
interval Ej. Since the localization L restricts the kernel c~ (x) to have compact support, 
the operator C~ creates or annihilates particles in a bounded region. Hence by (4.25), 
PC~P (4.32) 
is a bounded operator.

Our next estimate bounds D(L) from below. 
LEMMA 4,5. I~ P and C~ are defined as in (4.8) and (4.25), and i/ 
PC2p P :~ O, (4.34) 
then there is a constant M 7 such that 
D(L) + 1 >i M~ (o:~ + fl~). (4.35) 
Proo/. For fixed values of a and fl, we can minimize (4.30) by choosing the IL~I as 
small as possible. However, (4.34) will hold only if C~ both creates and annihilates no more 
than l(j) particles in each region X r For this reason it is convenient to count the number 
of particles created and annihilated in the region Xj for the localization L. We define L+(j) 
and L(j) to be these numbers: 
L+(j) =the number of L~=j, for k~l, 2 .... , :r 
L_(j) = the number ofLk=?" , for k=~+l ..... ~+fl. 
These numbers must satisfy 
L+ (j) = ~, and ~ L_ (j) = ft. (4.36) 
In addition, (4.34) will be valid only if 
L+ (j)  l(j ) = M 2 e -2 (l -~ 12), (4.37) 
and L_ (j) <~ l(j) = M2 e -2 (1 + 1~). (4.38) 
In order to minimize D(L) consistent with (4.34), we choose 
L if [jl<J~= (4.39) 
to , if I~l>J~. 
The maximum value J+ or J_ of any localization index ILk l in L, and the number of indices 
with this maximum value, are fixed by the requirements (4.36). Using (4.39) we conclude 
that there is a constant M s (approximately equal to M~e-~/3) such that (excluding the 
trivial case J+ = 0) 
= It1<~1+M2 e -2 (1 + j ~) + L+(J+) <. Ms ja+, (4.40)

We next study the convergence of the sequence {cot} of approximate states applied

As a first reduction, we restrict our attention to the Foek space of a bounded region.

With this decomposition we write 
P= (Po|174 (4.56) 
We now study the local number operator N~. x~ defined in (3.2.19). 
Here we choose B---Xj and we restrict T to be less than ~. Since the Friedrichs extension 
(N~.xj)p of N~.x~ ~ Oo commutes with the projection onto ~(X~) for all i, it follows that 
the various (Nv.x~)~ commute. Also (N~, x~)p commutes with each Nx~ and with the spectral 
projections Pz, e Thus (N~.xj)F commutes with Po| with I| and with P. We now 
let N~. xj denote the Friedrichs extension of N~. x~ ~ ~0. 
As a consequence of the commutativity with P, 
~o~ (N~.+) = co, (PN,.+ P) = co,, (N~.x~PN~.xj) <~ con (N~.+). 
We choose ~> 0 sufficiently small so that (3.3.6a) is valid. (See Remark 3 following 
Theorem 4.1.) Hence 
eo~ (Nr.x~) ~< const. 
We now choose M as in (4.42)- (4.44) and define 
N~.M= ( ~ N~.xj)p. (4.57) Ilk<M 
Thus ~ (NT.M) ~ const. (4.58) 
We note that Nv, M commutes with each Po| and with I| 1. Also Nv, M leaves ~(Z) 
invariant, and by Corollary 3.2.2 e, 
.~.~, J~ y(z) 
has a compact resolvent. 
We now study the sequence {eo~} of functionals restricted to ~(Z), the algebra of all 
bounded operators on the Hiibert space ~(Z). Each functional co~ is normal, since con is 
normal by assumption in Theorem 4.1, and P is a projection. The normal functional 
has the form eo~ (A) = Tr (A,A), A r ~(Z), (4.59) 
where A, is a positive trace class operator in ~(Z) with 
II,,~ l ~ ~(z)ll = Tr (~) < 1. (4.60)

The desired convergence of the eo~ (C ~) now follows from 
LEMMA 4.7. Let ~ be the algebra o/ all bounded operators on some Hilbert space ~t, 
and let N be a positive (unbounded) operator with N -1 a compact element o~ ~. Then the set 
(A: AE~, 0~<A~<I, Tr (AN)~I}=ff N 
is compact in the trace norm. 
Proo/. Choose an orthonormal basis (e~} for ~/consisting of eigenvectors of N and let 
b~ be the corresponding eigenvalues. For A in ~rN, we have 
Tr (AN) = Tr (N~AN t) = ~ )tu b~ t 
if (2~j) is the matrix representing the operator A. If P = A 89 and if ~j~ is the corresponding 
matrix, then 
Tr (AN)= ~ (b, + b~)]~,A2+~b, [e~,] 2. 
t<1 
Let An be a sequence in 9'N and let Pn -An+. Since b~ oo as i-~ ~, we see that a subsequenee 
P~ of the P's converge to a limit P in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. For a trace class operator 
.4, the trace norm HAIls is given by 
[[A[[~ = sup Tr (UA), U 
where the supremum runs over all unitary operators. Thus if A = P~, 
][An - AI]~ = sup Tr (U(A~ - A)) = sup {Tr (U(P, - P) Pn) + Tr (UP(P, - P))} U u

We apply this lemma to the case ~ = ~(~)and ~ = ~(Z). We use the operator N~.M 
of (4.57) to give an 
N= (N~.M + I) 
for Lemma 4.7. The states co~ ~ ~(Z) satisfy the hypotheses of the lemma by (4.59)- 
(4.61). By (4.58) and Corollary 3.3.2 (e) the operator N has the desired properties. Thus 
there is a norm convergent subsequence r satisfying 
I(~.,- %) (PC~P)I < o(1)IIPc~ell < o(1)Ilcll 
by (4.45). For this subsequenee 
1(o9~,- oJ~,) (Ce)l ~< o(1)Ilcll, (4.62) 
which is the announced bound (4.4). 
In order to complete the proof of Theorem 4.1, we write for CE 9A0(/] ).

Here we have chosen n~, nj to belong to the convergent subsequence in (4.62), and we 
used (4.14), (4.46) and (4.62) to dominate (4.63). Since 
I1(o~,,,. ~,,,) i" ~ (~)11 = II(o-,.,- o-,,,,) I" ~(~)11, 
we conclude that the subsequence in (4.63) is norm convergent on ~(B). 
It is known and easy to prove that the norm limit of a sequence of normal states is 
normal. Thus any norm limit to of the w, is normal on ~(B), and Theorem 4.1 is established. 
We now return to prove Lemma 4.3. We analyze the expansion of CE20(]B) in terms of 
the local, time zero fields. We start by proving a useful lemma.

The kernels b~(y) are symmetric in the fl variables Yl ..... y~ corresponding to the ~'s, 

244 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
and also in the v variables Y~+I ..... y~+~ corresponding to the zr's. For fixed /~+v=y, 
there are exactly y + 1 different B~'s and for fixed ~ § fl =y, there are exactly y § 1 different 
C~p's. We now specify the relation between them. First we inspect the simple case ~ +fl =

c10 (x) = ~ ~u; 89 blo (x) i 89 + ~ #~ b01 (x) (4.64) 
and Col (x) = ~2/~; 89176 i -- ~-~ ~ box (x). (4.65) 
We also have the inverse relation

-i 89 i -t- and bol (x) = ~ ju; clo (x) + ~-~ #x col (x). (4.67) 
The transformations (4.64)-(4.67) by themselves are valid for a wide variety of b01(x), 
b10(x); they are defined, for instance on tempered distributions. These relations do not 
require that the bol(x ) and blo(X) be local. We now make the locality explicit by means of 
a C~ function ~(x) which has its support in X 0 and which equals one on a neighborhood of B. 
We rewrite (4.66) as 
blo(x) = ~2 ~ (x) #~ clo(x) + ~ ~(x) #~ col (x), (4.68) 
and similarly for bol(x ). We note that the operators/~, which were introduced in Section 
3.1 have integral kernels k~(x) satisfying (3.1.5)-(3.1.6). 
(/~ /) (x) = f b~ (x- z)/(z) dz. 
By substituting (4.68) into (4.64) - (4.65), we obtain the equations 
10 (X) = (K+ clO ) () -}- (g_ cOl ) (x) 
and c01 (x) = (K_ Clo ) (x) + (K+ c01 ) (x),

We note that the locality requirement 
supp bl0 (X) c B, supp b01 (x) c B, 
imposes implicit restrictions on--and relations between--c0z(x ) and cz0(x); for instance, if 
either one is nonzero, they must both be nonzero. Thus we cannot expect, and we do 
not find, that the identity transformation (4.69)-(4.70) yields the identity on all functions 
as in (4.64)-(4.67). In fact for the kernels of (4.71), we have 
k+(x,z)#-~(x-z), and k_(x,z)~=O. 
We now define localized kernels and estimate their norms. Let 
k~(x, z) = { ko Z),, xE X,otherwise, (4.73) 
and let K~ be the operator with kernel k~. 
LEMA. 4.9. For some constant Mz5 , the operator norm o/Ki+ is bounded by

Proo/. If i =~ 0, the bound (4.72) immediately yields 
IIK~II < [[k~Hu < Mia exp (- m0[i[), 
so we need only consider the ease i = 0. Since 
~;~ ~ = ~ + ~;~ [~, ~$ ], 
the lemma follows from (4.71) and an estimate on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the operator 
A =~;~[~,/~]. 
Let a(x, z) be the kernel of A. The Fourier transform of a(x, z) is

cfo(x) = (KL+'Clo) (x) + (KL-'col) (x) (4.76) 
and @t (x) = (KL_'Clo) (x) + (KL+'col) (x). (4.77)

We now generalize this method to deal with any c~, and we need an expansion sim- 
ilar to (4.76)- (4.77). We first obtain such an expansion for operators Cv which have 
the form 
C~, = ~+~= C~p = : CI~:, (4.79)

We now apply (4.69) to the creation variables, expanding c~0(Xl) ..... clO(X~). We apply 
(4.70) to the annihilation variables, expanding Co~(X,~+~ ) ... c01(xa+~). The kernels ca~(x ) 
for (4.79) 
(:)~ c~(~)= ~ ~ I-Ic~0(~) l~I c0~(~) (4.83) J~l /=a+l 
can be written 
c~p(x)= ~ t~ {(K+c~o)(xj)+(K_co~)(xj)} ~ {(K+co~)(xs)+(K_c~o)(Xj) }. 1=or 
(4.84) 
In a more compact form 
f c  (z)dz, (4.85) 
where the kernel lap. $~ (x, z) is a sum of tensor products of the kernels b~ (x, z) times some 
numerical factors. We can write 
where the symmetrization operation symmetrizes the kernel in the ~ creation variables 
x 1 ..... x~ and in the ~ annihilation variables x~+ 1 ..... x~+p. 
We note some properties of the monomials contributing to the sum (4.86). In each 
kernel k+(xj, zj) that occurs, either zj is a creation variable for ce~ and xj is a creation variable 
for c~p, or else zj is an annihilation variable for ce~ and xj is an annihilation variable for 
c~p. In other words, the K+ operators in (4.86) do not connect creation variables to anni- 
hilation variables. On the other hand, the kernels/c_(xs, z~.) connect an annihilation (crea- 
tion) variable in ce~ to a creation (annihilation) variable in c~p. In majorizing (4.86) we will 
later use the operator norm to dominate k+ kernels, and Lemma 4.8 to deal with the /~_ 
kernels. 
The next step in our argument is to prove that the transformation (4.85)-(4.86) 
which we derived for a class of c=p(x) defined in (4.83), is correct for any c=p(x) that might 
occur in the expansion of an operator C E O~o(B). We note that by a generalized polarization 
identity, (4.85)-(4.86) is valid for kernels arising from operators

Kernels that are finite sums of kernels of the operators (4.87) are the only kernels 
c=p(x) that occur in the expansion of operators C Eg~0(B). Hence the identity transformation 
(4.85)-(4.86) holds for all our kernels. 
We now return to the localized kernels c=p(x) and the proof of Lemma 4.3. Using 
(4.85) we can write 
e~(x)= ~ II~ o~(x,z)c,~(~)dz, (4.90) 
~+8==+/~ J ' 
where the localized kernel l~. ~ (x, z) is defined by 
l~.~(x,z)=Sym Z e_ F[ kL+J(xt, zj) I-I lcL-J(xj, zy) 1-I kL+J(xt, zs) #=0 6~ [$ t=1 1=#+1 i=(~+~-#+1 
(4.91) 
and L = (L z ..... L=+p} is the localization multi-index. Each kernel (4.91), before symmetriza- 
tion, is the sum of ~ + 1 terms with a numerical coefficient dominated by 2~+e=2 =+p. The 
kernels from one term, obtained by fixing #, are a tensor product of k+ kernels and of k_ 
kernels. The k_ factor 
I] ~(xj, zi.)= I~I k-~J(xt, zj+~-#) I-I k~-'(x.z.~-=) 1=~+1 j=#+l t==+1 
is the tensor product of Hilbert-Schmidt kernels and has the form of a tensor product of 
kernels kck~ of Lemma 4.8. The first product in (4.91) of k+ kernels is a bounded operator 
O= on ~= and the second product in (4.91) of k+ kernels is a bounded operator O# on ~. 
Thus applying Lemma 4.8 to the/Cek A kernels and using the operator norm on the ]r kernels, 
we find that each term l~.ae(X, z)~ in (4.91) with fixed F is a kernel such that 
fl~, ~ (x, z)~ c6~ (z) dz 
is the kernel of an operator from L~ (R ~) to L~ (R =) with a norm dominated by

5. The vacuum self energy per unit volume is finite 
The lower bound E~ on the operator/t(g) = H o § Hz. g is called the vacuum energy, 
because 
(g) ~g = E~g, (5.1) 
and Eg = (~g,/~(g) ~g) 
is the value of the energy operator ~(g) in its vacuum state. This actually represents the 
shi# in vacuum energy between the problem with and without interaction, 
E o = E~ - Eo, 
where E o = 0 is the lower bound of H o. The scale of/~(g) is arbitrarily specified so that 
(~0, H(g) ~0) = 0. (5.2) 
It is customary and convenient to add a constant to the Hamiltonian/t(g) so that 
its vacuum energy is zero 
and 
H(g) = I:I(g) - Eg, (5.3) 
H(g) ~ = 0. (5.4) 
This shift is one of the standard renormalizations of quantum field theory, and we shall 
call H(g) the renormalized Hamiltonian. We omit the renormalization to the mass m e and 
to the coupling constant ~ since perturbation theory indicates that they are finite for our 

250 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
(~4)2 model, even in the limit g(x)-* 1. We note that it is the renormalized ttamfltonians 
H(g), and not the unrenormalized Hamiltonians/~(g) that have a limit as g(x)-~l. In Sec- 
tion 2 we proved that as g(x)-~l, e- tH(o)L __> e-iH~ 
in a certain weak sense, and 0 ~ H. 
In this section, we bound the rate at which Eg can diverge. According to perturbation 
theory, Eg is proportional to the volume of space in which the particles interact. However, 
the perturbation expansion for Eg can be shown by methods such as [18] not to converge 
and at best to be asymptotic. Thus we cannot get a rigorous bound on E o from perturbation 
theory. Instead, we use a modification of Nelson's method [22]. It is this method which 
produced the estimates (cf. II, (2.1.16-18)) stating that the vacuum self energy for a fixed 
volume cutoff is finite [22, 8, 4]. 
THEOREM 5.1. Let O <~g(x) <~1 and/or some constant 3/0, 
dg(x)[ <<. Mo" 
dx I 
Then - M < Eg < O, (5.5) 
where M is a positive constant proportional to the volume o/the set (supp g)~, that is the set 
o/points within distance one o] (supp g). 
Remarks 1. This theorem states that the average vacuum energy density, namely the 
vacuum self energy per unit volume, is finite for the theory with g(x) = 1. Thus it shows that 
perturbation theory, though inapplicable, actually predicts the correct answer. 
2. Furthermore, the theorem assures us that the expected number of (bare) particles 
per unit volume and the expected free energy per unit volume are both finite in the vacuum 
~. We define these expectation values as limits as g(x)-+ 1 of the expectation value in g2g. 
Since 
~< ~00 (~g' H~ ~2g)' (5.6) (~, N~g) 
it is sufficient to bound the free energy per unit volume. Since H o = 2 ~(g)-/t(2 g), 
(~g, H0~g ) ~< (~g, (2/~(g) - E2g ) ~g) = 2 E~ - E~g. (5.7) 
In particular, if we choose 9 to be gn(x) defined in (2.3), then (5.5) says that for M in- 
dependent of n, 
-nM <~ E2g. (5.8)

3. A similar result holds for the Hamiltonians Hv defined in II, (2.1.7). Namely, there 
is a positive constant M independent of V, such that as V-~ r162 
- MV <~ Hv. (5.13) 
Our proof yields (5.13) as well as (5.5), although a somewhat easier proof may be based on 
a modification of Federbush's proof for V fixed [4, 19]. 
4. The theorem also holds for any interaction Hamiltonian in two dimensions of 
the form 
Hz.g = |: P@(x)): g(x) dx, 
J 
where P is a polynomial of even degree whose leading coefficient is positive. 
5. The same proof also shows that for g(x) satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem, 
and for e >0, there exists a constant M proportional to (supp g)x such that 
O<~eN + Hz.O + M. 
Proo/o/ Theorem 5.1. We use a partition of unity ~(x) constructed from a positive 
C ~ function ~(x) with support in the interval I x l < 1, such that 
~ (x) = t(x- i),

kernel (5.32) has five localization indices. If the indices are incompatible, that is, if any of 
the differences ]i-izl is large, then the kernel must be small. We need the same result 
for a somewhat more general kernel. For k z ~ I~v, let

Here the norm [[-H2. v refers to the Fourier series L 2 norm, which equals (V/2~) 2 times 
the usual L 2 norm of (5.26) with each kl replaced by kzv. 
Before proving this lemma, we make some general remarks. Let/(x) be a function with 
a smooth Fourier transform. That is, assume that for all ~, 
lID"Ill2< ~. (5.35) 
This corresponds to a rapidly decreasing f(x). Now let 
/v(x) e L2( [- V/2, V/2]) (5.36) 
be a periodic function with Fourier coefficients 
V-89 /~e r~. 
Then fv(X) = ~ /(x+nV), (5.37) 
as can be checked by computing the Fourier coefficient of the right side of (5.37). In fact 
(5.37) is valid for /EL 1. Using the rapid decrease of/(x), we have for any integer r, a bound 
on the norms, 
I1(  + )r&ll .v (5.38) 
in L~([V/2, V/2]), which is independent of V, as long as V is bounded away from zero. 
Furthermore, the norms (5.38) can be estimated in terms of the norms (5.35).

which is independent of j and K. This is an estimate of the form (5.35), so the corresponding 
norms (5.38) satisfy similar bounds. The rapid decrease of these functions could be written 
as the estimate (5.34), which completes the proof. 
We now bound [Eg] through the formula

(5.41) 
Since lim Eo. x,v = Eo, K0 V--) oo 
it is sufficient to bound [Eo. K, v[ uniformly in K and V. We use the Feynman Kae formula 
to represent the operator exp (-tH(g)K. v) on :~K. v- For 0, ZE :~K. v 
(O,e-t~(~ g)= fcK.vexp [- f~ Ht, o,~:.v(q(s)) ds] O(q(O)) i~(q(t))dq(" ). (5.42) 
Here Cx,v is the path space corresponding to ~x, v. It consists of continuous paths q(. ) 
taking values q(s) in a Euclidean space of high dimension--one dimension for each mode 
permitted by the cutoffs K and V. The integral is a Wiener type integral on CK.v coming 
from Ho,K. v. The transition probabilities of the Wiener process are the kernel of 
exp (- ~Ho.K,V). We bound the inner product (5.42) with H61der's inequality, as in [22, 8]. 
For some sufficiently large numbers p and t chosen independently of g, K and V, we have 
[Eo, K.v[ <~(Pt)-l log {fcK, vexp-- [P flHLo.K,v(q(s))ds] dq( " )} 9

Let us for the moment assume Lemma 5.3 and derive the bound on (5.37). We represent 
CK, V as a disjoint union of measurable subsets X~, and we estimate the integral by the 
maximum of its integrand on each X~.

Let us assign to each path q(- ) E CK. v a sequence of integers ~j with j E ~. We define 
~j(q(.)) = ~j (5.51) 
as the smallest integer in the interval [d 1, K] such that 
I I(~, , ])(q('))l < 1. (5.52) 
Here d 1 > 2 is a constant which we choose depending only on the c and d in Lemma 5.3. 

258 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
We take d I and K to be integers. Since I(K, j) = 0, there is a smallest integer vj with the 
required property. 
For each sequence of integers (~s}, namely 
let X((vj}) be the set of all paths in CK. v which, by (5.51), correspond to the sequence 
{r j}. Then CK. v is a disjoint union of measurable sets 
cK.~= O x({,j}), (5.53) 
where the various ~ range over [dl, K]. 
Furthermore, we note that 
and by (5.45) 1 - c I (log vs) ~ ~< Hz(~j, j) (q(s)) ds. 
Therefore for q(. ) e X({~j}), (5.54) yields 
/: -- 61 ~ (log vj) ~ < Hl.o. ~:.v (q(s)) ds. (5.55) 
To each path q(. ) $ CK.V we now assign a second sequence of integers {Aj}, where ?" 
ranges over a subset 30 of 3. Let 30 consist of those k for which 
~ > d 1 + 1, (5.56) 
and for k E 30 define Ak = vk- 1. 
and so 
Thus using

number of elements of Jo, leaving (M-M0) of the vj equal to d r Since there are 2 M subsets 
of y, Y0 can be chosen in 2 M different ways. Restricting the sum (5.58) to (vi} which give 
one fixed subset ~o, this restricted sum is bounded by 
exp [(M - Mo) cap log ~ dx] ~ l-I [exp (log c + c~p log s vj - dA~-")]

We approximate the Riemann integral defining /(At, j) by Riemann sums. In order to 
bound (5.60) it is sufficient to do so with I(Aj, j) replaced by a Riemann sum. We replace 
all L = ~lj factors by Riemann sums and then expand. The result will be a sum of M r 
terms, if each Riemann sum has M terms. Each term is a product of L factors, and each 
factor occurs at a sharp time. To write down a typical term, we choose mesh times sl, ..., sL, 
and for the ~th factor we choose an index ~(a). The index ~ is chosen exactly l~ times. Then 
(5.60) is replaced by 
~< ~ sup I_ 0H(Am), i(1)) (q(sl))... ~H(Aj(~), i(L)) (q(sL)) dq(. ), (5.61) P({A~}) 
dc K,V 
where the supremum is taken over all choices of mesh times, mesh lengths and all choices 
of ~(~) consistent with the lj. We can rearrange the factors in the integral, so that is no 
loss of generMity to assume that

By the definition of the Wiener integral, (5.61) equals the no particle expectation value

... exp ( -- (8 L -- 81._1) He. x.v) @H(AI(L), j(L) ) s (5.62) 
The next step is to evaluate (5.62) as a sum of elementary terms. Each elementary 
term will itself be a sum of explicit functions. This reduction of (5.62) is accomplished by 
repeated application of the commutation relation 
' f 1 if - k = k' 
[av( - k), a~(k')] = 0( - k; k ) = 0 otherwise % 
and [av( - k), av(k')] = O, 
for k, k'6 Fv. We use this relation to bring all the annihilation operators av(k) to the right 
and the creation operators av(k ) to the left. Furthermore, these commutation relations 
yield the relations for k 6 F~. v, 
av(k) exp ( - sHo.,~.v ) = exp ( - sHo.x.v) av(k) exp [ - s/z(k)], 
which are used to bring the annihilation operators to the right past the factors 
exp (--SHo.K.v). Since 
av(k) ~o = O, 
moving the annihilation operators to the right does reduce (5.62) to the desired sum of 
elementary terms. Furthermore, each variable k must occur in a delta function 0(- k; k') 
in any non zero term. 
In order to keep track of the distinct terms and the commutation rules used, we 
introduce a graph O for each term. The value of the term will be a number N(G) assigned to 
G. Thus we shall write 
L 
(~/o, I-[ {exp [ - (s~ - s~_,) Ho.K.v] OH(Aj(~,, j(a))} no) = ~ N(G), 
~=1 G 
(5.63) 
where s o = 0, and where the product of noncommuting operators is defined by 
L 
[I {A~} = A 1 A2... A L, 
We construct O as follows. We start with L vertices, labeled by the index ~, 1 ~< ~ ~<L. 
From each vertex we draw four lines (called legs), labeled by (e, ~), 1 ~<~ ~<4. Each factor 

THE ~(~4)I l QUANTUM FIZLD THEORY WITHOUT CUTOFFS. III 261 
~H(Aj(a), j(a)) in (5.63) is the difference between two interaction Hamiltonians, and as 
such is the sum of five monomials as in (5.27). For each factor we choose one such monomial 
with va creators and 4-va annihilators. This monomial will correspond to a vertex in G, 
and we draw va legs from the ~th vertex to the left, and 4- va legs pointing to the right. 
Each leg (a, 9) corresponds to a momentum variable/ca~ in the kernel B(A~(a), j(a)) at vertex 
~. Since our factors are noncommuting, we order the vertices linearly from left to right, as 
in (5.63), with vertex 1 on the left and vertex L on the right. Each time that the use of the 
commutation relations introduces a delta function, we say that the variables -k~o and 
k~. 0, occurring in it are contracted. Graphically we join together the annihilation leg (~, 0) 
and the creation leg (g', ~') which correspond to these variables. We have already noticed 
that for a nonzero term, each variable occurs in exactly one delta function, and so for the 
corresponding graph each creating leg (pointing left) is connected to a unique annihilating 
leg (pointing right). Thus only terms with vl =0, vL=4 will contribute. Since annihilating 
legs all moved to the right, the annihilating legs at vertex ~ are always contracted with 
creating legs on their right. 
The possible graphs are all graphs which can be constructed in this manner. Each 
graph consists of L vertices and 2L lines (each line being two joined legs). Each vertex is the 
endpoint of four lines and each line joins two distinct vertices. This last fact results from 
Wick ordering the interaction. Evidently there are fewer than 
(4L) !! = (4L- 1) (4L-3) ... 3-1 
possible graphs. 
We let N(G) denote the contribution to (5.63) from a given graph G and this is obtained 
as follows: To the vertex g of G we assign the kernel 
B(Aj(~), j(g); ~al ..... ]r = bK.j(a) (kal ..... ka 4) -- bAj(~),j(~) (]Cal ..... ]r (5.64) 
where bg.j is defined in (5.26). We write down the product of the L kernels (5.64) for G 
and multiply this by a product of 2 L delta functions 
one delta function for each line, obtained by pairing the annihilator (~, 0) with the creator 
(~r 0'), ~' > ~. We then multiply by a product of 2L energy factors 
exp [ - (s~,- s~)p(kaq)], 
one for each line, which ariso from the commutations past exp (- 8Ho.x.r factors. These 
factors could actually be included in the kernels B(A~(~), j(g)) by defining for each graph 6~

Let us now motivate the type of bound we expect (in the simple case s 1 .... = SL = 0). 
We expect that different regions of localization will be independent, by the localization 
property of free fields (cluster property). Since each localization index ] must be chosen 
exactly I s times, exact localization would mean for s I ..... s L = 0 that (5.63) equals 
I-I (~0, ~H(As, J)~0), (5.67) J e :Jo 
which can be shown to be dominated by 
1-[ [cZS(2/s)! A;l~'~], (5.68) 
,JeYo 
for some constant c independent of K, V, :#0, As and 1 s. In fact, we will show that although 
the localization is not exact, it is approximate in the sense that (5.68) actually bounds 
(5.63), and this holds even in the case that the s s are nonzero. In other words, the action of 
exp (-silo) does not destroy, in any essential way, the localization of the particles. 
L~MMA 5.4. The expectation value (5.63) is dominated by

Let us assume this lemma and complete the proof of Lemma 5.3. We apply Lemma

by Lemma 5.2. However, we need a sharper bound (5.82) which reflects the localization 
of particles. Thus we classify the graphs in a way which reflects this property. 
For a particular graph G, each vertex ~, 1 ~< ~ ~<L, has an associated localization num- 
ber ](0r E Y0. For Q = 1, 2, 3, 4, let us define ?'(a, ~) by 
i(~, e) = i(G; a, e) = J(a'), (5.69) 
where the oth leg at vertex ~ is connected in G to the o'th leg at vertex :r We can also 
define 
(~(a, ~) = i(a) -i( :r e), (5"70) 
which measures the difference in configuration space locahzation between the two vertices 
connected by the pair of legs (a, ~), (:d, ~') corresponding to a line in G. 
The functions (5.69) uniquely specify the functions (5.70) and vice versa, for any 
graph G contributing to (5.63). However, (5.69) does not uniquely specify the graph. We 
now show that there are at most 
YI W'(2ls)!] (5.71) 
out of the (fewer than (4L) !!) different graphs G with the same function ~(G, a, ~). 
Let us suppose that in G there are 
l,j = l,j(G) 
lines connecting a j-localized vertex to an/-localized vertex, and to simplify the following 
formulae, we count each line with i = ~ twice. Thus 
l~j = 4 li, (5.72) 
JEY0 

264 JAMES GLIMM AND ARTHUR JAFFE 
and ~ l~, = 4L. (5.73) 
Note that the G's which contribute to (5.65) are exactly those for which the off diagonal 
/~j's vanish, and ltj=41~j. 
With the functions ~(~, ~) given and with i and ] held fixed, there are two sets of l~j 
legs specified, and for the graphs we are considering each leg in the first set must be con- 
tracted to a leg in the second set. For a vertex ~ of a leg in the first set, ](a)=j and for a 
vertex a' of a leg in the second set, j(a') = i. If i :~j then these two sets of legs are disjoint 
and the contractions can be made in at most (l~j)! ways. If i=~ then the two sets of legs 
coincide and the contractions can be made in at most (l~)!! ways. Once the contractions 
have br made for all i ~< j, the graph G is uniquely determined, and so there are at most 
1-I [/,, !] 1-[ [1, !!] (5.74) t<J icY0

graphs with given functions j(~, ~). 
If l is even ! < 2' [(89 l) !]~ 
l !! -<< 2z/2 (89 l) ! 
and there are similar estimates for l~j odd. 
Using (5.72) - (5.73), we thus have that (5.74) is dominated by 
YI [2'"/2(89 !] = 4' YI { [I [(89 !]} < 4 L [I [(21j)!], LJeYo JeYo te:I, je:lo

Here the supremum is over all graphs G with fixed ](G, ~, ~)=](:r Q), or fixed ~(~, ~), 
and the sum is over all possible integers ~(~, ~) of graphs contributing to (5.63). We now 
bound N(G) in (5.66). 
Each of the 2L independent sums over momentum variables k:Q E Fv can be regarded 
as an inner product in the one particle space :~v. 1, or the equivalent inner product in the 
space of Fourier series on [- V/2, V/2]. We now make an expa~asion bywriting the inner 
product on :~v.t as a sum of inner products on the :~v.l,~, using (5.28). Because of the
