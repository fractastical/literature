Abstract 
Here we build on recent findings which show that greater alignment between our subjective experiences (how we feel) and physiologi-
cal states (measurable changes in our body) plays a pivotal role in the overall psychological well-being. Specifically, we propose that the 
alignment or ‘coherence’ between affective arousal (e.g. how excited we ‘feel’) and autonomic arousal (e.g. heart rate or pupil dilation) 
may be key for maintaining up-to-date uncertainty representations in dynamic environments. Drawing on recent advances in inte-
roceptive and affective inference, we also propose that arousal coherence reflects interoceptive integration, facilitates adaptive belief 
updating, and impacts our capacity to adapt to changes in uncertainty, with downstream consequences to well-being. We also highlight 
the role of meta-awareness of arousal, a third level of inference, which may permit conscious awareness, learning about, and inten-
tional regulation of lower-order sources of arousal. Practices emphasizing meta-awareness of arousal (like meditation) may therefore 
elicit some of their known benefits via improved arousal coherence. We suggest that arousal coherence is also likely to be associated 
with markers of adaptive functioning (like emotional awareness and self-regulatory capacities) and discuss mind–body practices that 
may increase coherence.

Introduction
Under the active inference framework (Friston 2010, 2013), sur-
vival 
is achieved through inferences about the causes of sensa-
tions and about how to optimally act in order to maintain pre-
ferred states. The ability to detect changing levels of uncertainty 
in these inferences is critical for optimally adapting and learning 
in dynamic environments (Note: For the brain, the environment 
includes both the body and the external world.) In the present 
paper, we discuss how subtle changes in our bodies [measurable 
changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) arousal, like heart 
rate and pupil dilation] and interoceptive inferences thereof relate 
to changes in uncertainty. We suggest how that (interoceptive) 
integration of these signals, particularly in affective arousal and 
meta-awareness of arousal, may impact our capacity to optimally 
adapt and thrive.
Interoception refers to the bidirectional relationship between 
the brain and the body through which an organism senses, inter-
prets, and integrates signals from within itself (Desmedt et al. 
2023). It is argued to be the foundation of both mental and 
physical health 
(Tsakiris and Critchley 2016, Khalsa et al. 2018,
Quadt et al. 2018, Herbert et al. 2020). Recently cast in terms 
of active inference (Barrett and Simmons 2015, Allen and Fris-
ton 2018), interoception (i.e. perceiving embodied conditions) and 
allostasis (i.e. adaptively enacting embodied changes) have been 
proposed to be inextricably linked, at the very core of the brain’s 
inferential processing (Kleckner et al. 2017, Katsumi et al. 2022). 
To put it simply, whatever else your brain is doing it is also reg-
ulating and tracking the (inferred) states of your body (i.e. your 
ANS, among other systems; Barrett 2017), and these inferences 
contextualize other inferences, like what we attend to or are moti-
vated toward. As we will discuss later, inferences about allostatic-
interoceptive conditions and rhythms may also be central to how 
changes in uncertainty are processed in the brain–body system 
(e.g. Allen 2020, Allen et al. 2020, 2022).
Most interoce
ptive-allostatic processing happens outside con-
scious awareness. For example, you do not need to be aware of 
your ANS for it to keep beating your heart. At the conscious level, 
what we need mostto know about allostatic-interoceptive infer-
ences (i.e. anticipated consequences for allostasis) are proposed to 
be mostly experienced implicitly, as changes in lower-dimensional 
2 Biddell et al.
affects (Barrett 2017). Affects, typically (but not exclusively; e.g., 
Panksepp 2011 , Solms and Panksepp 2012 .) described in terms 
of feelings of pleasure or displeasure (valence) and high or low 
arousal, are basic features of consciousness (Wundt 1902, Dama-
sio 1999). They have long been considered some form of mental 
‘representation’ of bodily signals (James 1884, Wundt 1902, Barrett 
and Russell 1999, Damasio et al. 2000, Barrett and Simmons 2015, 
Seth and Friston 2016 ), though the exact relationship remains 
subject to debate. Under recent active interoceptive inference 
accounts, affect is thought to guide the predictive system (via pre-
cision weighting) to improve; by representing anticipated conse-
quences for allostatic efficiency (Barrett and Simmons 2015, Seth 
and Friston 2016, Barrett 2017) or fluctuations in error dynamics 
(Kiverstein et al. 2020), inferences about valence (basically, confi-
dence in how well your system thinks it is set up to handle life; 
Hesp et al. 2021) can guide gradual overall model improvement 
across time. While these formulations of affect as inference focus 
primarily on valence, here we focus on arousal.
Affective arousal is a low-dimensional inference, phenomeno-
logically felt as low or high energy, activation, and/or tension. 
It can be either pleasant or unpleasant and inform higher-level 
inferences, for example in the ‘construction’ of emotional expe-
rience ( Barrett 2017 ). As we will discuss later, affective arousal 
is suggested to serve orienting function, responding to impor-
tant error signals, and shaping how much they are felt/integrated 
into conscious affective feelings (Solms and Friston 2018). For 
example, we can see this in the bidirectional information flow 
between heart and brain during emotional processing. After ini-
tiating the experience, the coupling of heart and brain activity—
particularly ascending heart-to-brain signalling—is moderated by 
self-reported affective arousal (Candia-Rivera et al. 2022). At least 
in emotional experiences, confidence (precision) over signals aris-
ing from the ANS may be modulated by affective arousal.
Autonomic arousal refers to changes in the activation of 
the ANS, mediated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic 
branches of the ANS. For example, pupil dilation is impacted by 
both the pupil sphincter, under parasympathetic control, and the 
pupil dilator, under sympathetic control ( Barbur 2003 ). In this 
paper, we refer to increasing autonomic arousal, without spec-
ifying whether the increase is driven by increasing sympathetic 
or decreasing parasympathetic tone. Under Active Inference ANS 
states are hidden to the brain, both inferred and enacted through 
a veil of inferences. As we will discuss, changes in uncertainty are 
inherently impacted by and reflected in the hidden dynamics of 
the ANS e.g., pupil dilation trackstrial-by-trial changes in predic-
tion errors, environmental volatility, and learning rates; Nassar 
et al. 2012, Browning et al. 2015, Lawson et al. 2017), and inferences 
thereof. The extent to which arousal responses track changes in 
uncertainty also predicts better ability to learn in dynamic envi-
ronments (de Berker et al. 2016). Uncertainty defines the degree of 
confidence (or precision; Feldman and Friston 2010) with which 
a prediction can be made, based on available information, and 
it determines when to update beliefs. Accurately inferring the 
dynamics of the ANS may help the system to represent, respond to 
and enact changes in uncertainty (cf. interoceptive self-inference; 
Allen et al. 2020), and to learn the statistical regularities (in its 
predictive model) of the environment more optimally.
Changes in uncertainty also play a fundamental role in driv-
ing affective arousal (Majumdar et al. 2023), and here, we unpack 
whether the capacity to accurately represent and account for 
changes uncertainty dynamics in higher affective arousal may 
involve interoceptive inferences over autonomic arousal. Though 
the exact nature of the relationships between autonomic and 
affective arousal is a matter of debate, they do tend to covary, and 
there does appear to be a privileged relationship between them. 
For example, emotions associated with high affective arousal 
relate to increases in autonomic arousal (i.e. increased heart 
rate; Ketonen et al. 2023 ), regardless of their valence ( Kreibig 
2010). It is also clear that beliefs (about affective and interocep-
tive states) impact this relationship. For example, self-reported 
affective arousal is better predicted by beliefs about interocep-
tive states (e.g. beliefs about heart rate) than actual physiological 
(autonomic) changes (Blascovich 1990, 1992, Wild et al. 2008, Trot-
man et al. 2019). Through precision optimization, affective arousal 
is likely to play a role in integrating (‘optimizing’) interoceptive 
inferences about autonomic arousal.
We will suggest that inferred affective arousal informs infer-
ences about inferred physiological arousal, and vice versa, and 
that this relationship plays a role in the brain’s capacity to track 
changing levels of uncertainty and to harness these changes in 
adaptive updating of model beliefs. Practically speaking, dysfunc-
tion in the coupling between autonomic arousal and affective 
arousal may reflect a wider dysfunction in representing changing 
levels of uncertainty, leading not only to learning deficits but also 
to emotional dysfunction.
Dysfunctional interoceptive beliefs—particularly an inability 
of the brain to update its beliefs about the body in the face of 
errors—have previously been proposed as an important transdiag-
nostic factor within mental and emotional disorders (Paulus et al. 
2019, Smith et al. 2020a). In the present paper, we look deeper at 
the role that affective arousal may play in the ability (or inabil-
ity) to update beliefs about the body in the face of change and the 
implications of this ability for adaptive functioning and other indi-
cators of well-being. We also extend our understanding of arousal 
to incorporate the implications of meta-awareness, and how a 
higher level of self-reflective awareness of changes in felt affec-
tive arousal, may impact awareness, regulation, and ultimately 
coherence between lower-level representations of arousal.
Please note we are not saying that autonomic arousal is ‘nec-
essary’ for self-reported affective arousal and nor does auto-
nomic arousal account for ‘all’ changes in self-reported affective 
arousal. The same is also true—though perhaps more obviously—
in reverse. Changes in affective or meta-awareness of arousal 
are neither necessary for, nor account for, all changes in auto-
nomic arousal. For example, changes in affective arousal can 
be felt even when changes in autonomic arousal are pharma-
cologically suppressed (Ali et al. 2017 ). However, critically, this 
pharmacological suppression also blocks pupillary and cardiac 
responses to changes in uncertainty, increases the effects of prior 
beliefs on behaviour, and reduces learning when the environment 
changes (Lawson et al. 2021). We will argue that the strength of 
the relationship between changes in self-reported affective and 
autonomic arousal is reflective of a kind of ‘affective-interoceptive 
integration’ and plays an important role in adaptive learning 
under conditions of changing uncertainty. On the other hand if 
affective arousal is not informed by physiological arousal, then 
affective inferences will be unable to optimally adapt to changes 
in uncertainty dynamics.
We begin with an informal (non-mathematical) introduction 
to the active inference framework, with an emphasis on the 
embodiment of survival imperatives and on the optimization of 
uncertainty in interoceptive inferences. We discuss recent liter-
ature highlighting that uncertainty (or its inverse, precision) is 
both impacted by and estimated according to changes in auto-
nomic arousal conditions. We then discuss affective arousal, in 
terms of its impact orienting feelings, through belief updates in 
Arousal coherence, uncertainty, and well-being  3
response to changes in uncertainty. We then extend these two lev-
els of arousal to include a third level, namely, meta-awareness 
(cf. Schooler et al. 2011 , Sandved-Smith et al. 2021 ) of arousal. 
Experience (i.e. feeling affective arousal) is not necessarily the 
same as being able to access or report on that experience ( Amir 
et al. 2023 ). The capacity to report on experiences of affective 
arousal entails this higher (meta-aware) level of inference ‘about 
lower-level arousal’. Because these high-order inferences are also 
informed by inferences about the contextual and learned reli-
ability of affective and downstream autonomic signals, meta-
awareness may be more or less attuned with actual changes 
in lower-order arousal. Meta-awareness both determines (con-
trols) and is determined by (emerges from) these lower-order 
levels and the interplay between them. Crucially, meta-awareness 
of arousal is also the conscious integrative level of representa-
tion that permits an organism to make informed choices about 
how to monitor and manage lower-order sources of affective
arousal.
Put simply, we will suggest that when subjectively reported 
affective arousal and autonomic arousal (e.g. heart rate and pupil 
dilation) correlate positively over time (arousal coherence), the 
organism is more accurately tracking changes in its uncertainty, at 
multiple levels of interoceptive and affective processing, impact-
ing its capacity to appropriately adapt to change, and to be well. 
We discuss the implications of this coherence in terms of the 
veracity and responsiveness of precision estimates, interoceptive 
abilities, emotional awareness, self-regulation, and well-being. 
Among several other concrete predictions, we suggest that certain 
practices may improve the veracity of meta-awareness (and opac-
ity) of arousal. We suggest that these practices may elicit some 
of their known benefits by supporting interoceptive-affective inte-
gration or coherence between affective feelings and physiology. We 
argue that the otherwise unconsidered role of higher-order meta-
awareness of arousal (e.g. in the case of mindfully intervening 
to monitor and regulate arousal levels) may be key to improv-
ing arousal coherence, to training the capacity to adaptively learn 
about and intentionally regulate arousal and ultimately to more 
functionally adaptive responses to changing uncertainty.
Everything is inference
Brains have no direct access to the world. Instead, they inter-
act with the world through bodies, receiving sensory signals that 
can often be ambiguous, noisy, and multifaceted. So, how do 
brains form a meaningful representation of the world and guide 
adaptive actions based on these unclear signals? The active infer-
ence framework (Friston 2009, 2010
, 2013) posits that everything 
our brain does—including perception, learning, and action—is 
the result of inferences which minimize ‘variational free energy’. 
Every perception or action is a hypothesis tested against the 
unfolding reality. When predictions match the actual sensory 
inputs, everything is fine. But to the extent that there is mismatch 
(and there always is), there is uncertainty. Put very simply, varia-
tional free energy is grounded in Bayesian probability theory and 
quantifies the mismatch or uncertainty between current beliefs 
about the state of the world (including the body) and their true 
state, and the brain is always trying to reduce this ‘free energy’ 
through perception and action.
Like previous formulations applying Bayesianism to the brain 
(e.g. predictive coding; Rao and Ballard 1999), the active inference 
framework conceptualizes brains as instantiating generative mod-
els. These models encode and/or generate probabilistic expecta-
tions about the causal structure of the environment (the likelihood 
of states) and about how observations are generated (the relation-
ships between observations and states). Key to this encoding is 
‘precision’, the inverse variance (width) of the probability distri-
bution of expectations ( Feldman and Friston 2010). Beliefs about 
precision can be considered a kind of higher-order prediction, 
a prediction not about states themselves but about the uncer-
tainty of (or confidence in) the model in relation to these states. 
Precision acts to selectively enhance (or attenuate) signals accord-
ing to their relative confidence. The sum of precision-weighted 
prediction errors, akin to ‘variational free energy’ (assuming Gaus-
sian distributions), can thus be understood as a kind of sum of 
generalized noteworthy and/or trustworthy prediction errors.
By minimizing ‘variational free energy’, the model updates its 
beliefs over the question of current experience. These (approxi-
mately Bayesian) updates minimize both the sum of discrepan-
cies (between what is expected and what is observed) and the 
magnitude of change in beliefs required (maximizing accuracy 
while minimizing complexity; Friston 2009), thus maintaining a 
pragmatically true and computationally tractable model of the 
(hidden) world. The result of these updates is known as ‘state esti-
mation’ or perceptual inference. The process of minimizing vari-
ational free energy operates across multiple nested layers, where 
higher-level beliefs both guide and are simultaneously refined by 
inferences at lower levels. Higher levels of the hierarchy gener-
ate a cascade of descending predictions, with each level aiming 
to best explain the process that gives rise to the observations at 
the level immediately below. This hierarchical structure can be 
described in terms of increasing conceptual ( Smith et al. 2019, 
Heins et  al. 2020), temporal (Friston et  al. 2017 ), or paramet-
ric depth ( Hesp et al. 2021, Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). In other 
words, higher-level inferences inform lower-level ones, with lower-
level outcomes feeding back to inform subsequent higher-level 
belief updates. For instance, basic perceptual inference (or state 
estimation) is both informed by and informs higher-level infer-
ences about how states are expected to change over time. These 
expectations about state transitions are further informed by (and 
inform) even higher-level inferences about the action policy, or the 
sequence of state transitions, that the agent is most likely to be 
following.
When it comes to action selection, the most likely policy must 
be ‘expected to’ minimize free energy in subsequent observations. 
Like the process of state estimation, by minimizing variational 
free energy, prior beliefs about action policies are updated, or 
‘selected’, accounting for both the anticipated consequences of 
action (quantified by ‘expected free energy’) and the incoming 
evidence for the perceptual priors (quantified by variational free 
energy). These updates then descend to shape precision-weighted 
expectations (i.e. probability distributions) of subsequent state 
transitions and state estimations. In other words, through action, 
expected free energy is minimized, in anticipation, and in reverse. 
Unlike perceptual inference, where errors can lead to adjustments 
in expectations by moving ‘upward’ through cognitive processes, 
active inference involves expectations ‘descending’ or influencing 
lower levels of processing. This descending influence can lead to 
actions like physical movements or covert mental (e.g. precision) 
adjustments, such as focussing attention, all aimed at minimising 
future surprises or uncertainties (i.e., the free energy ‘expected’ 
in future sensory observations). Through cycles of perceptual and 
active inferences, free energy can be continually, dynamically, and 
proactively minimized, both by changing the model and by acting 
to change the input.
Active inference reveals the architecture of bidirectional infor-
mation flow, between the brain and its environment, between 
4 Biddell et al.
expectations of the future and observations in the moment, and 
between action and perception. It is these bidirectional relation-
ships that result in the synergistic whole. Each new observation 
from the (bodily or ambient) environment enables beliefs about 
states to be updated. Beliefs about action policies and precision 
can then be updated, and these revised beliefs are then used 
to select actions and sample new observations, and the cycle 
repeats. This bidirectionally causal perception-action cycle allows 
the model to adaptively seek out (Friston 2010, 2013) and self-fulfil 
(Friston 2011) the evidence for its own existence (Hohwy 2016).
Uncertainty dynamics in embodied active 
inference
Living organisms are ‘embodied’ inference machines. This means 
that they carry expectations about their survival. These expecta-
tions (or ‘prior preferences’), shaped by phylogenetic (Allen and 
Tsakiris 2018) and ontogenetic (Veissière et al. 2019) evolution, are 
privileged in the inferential architecture (Pezzulo et al. 2015, Allen 
and Tsakiris 2018). Simply put, our brains expect us to be in states 
conducive to survival and they act accordingly. For instance, our 
brain maintains that body temperature should stay within certain 
limits. Through interoceptive and allostatic inferences, the brain 
can closely monitor and control internal bodily states (cf. Seth and 
Friston 2016), minimizing deviations from (homeostatic) expecta-
tions both in the moment (e.g. through autonomic reflexes) and 
(e.g. through learned relationships between proprioceptive/exte-
roceptive events and likely interoceptive trajectories) proactively 
before they arise (this is allostasis; Sterling and Eyer 1988, Pezzulo 
et al. 2015, Stephan et al. 2016). Through interoceptive-allostatic 
inferences, which are posited to be at the core of this predictive 
architecture, our actions and perceptions are always closely tied 
to our survival instincts.
Importantly, however, interoceptive inferences need not nec-
essarily be concerned only with maintaining homeostatic states. 
Minimizing expected free energy is equivalent to maximizing 
expected Bayesian model evidence (Friston 2010), which includes 
both extrinsic (or instrumental) and epistemic terms (Friston et al. 
2015, 2016, 2023, Parr and Friston 2017). Maximizing the extrinsic 
value of policies encodes their alignment with prior preferences 
(like ‘preferred’ homeostatic or goal states), while maximizing 
epistemic value also encodes the ‘expected information gain’ 
under predicted outcomes (mutual information expected between 
hidden states and observations). The precision-weighted balance 
between these two imperatives helps the organism avoid getting 
stuck in suboptimal conditions and promotes continual learning 
and improvement, leading to long-term (epistemic) uncertainty 
reduction that ultimately maximizes extrinsic value (see also 
Kiverstein et al. 2019, Tschantz et al. 2020).
Here, we also consider how interoceptive inferences mon-
itor and mitigate sources of uncertainty via the dynam-
ics of the ANS. [Note, the primary neurotransmitters of the 
branches of the ANS, noradrenaline (sympathetic) and acetyl-
choline (parasympathetic; LeBouef et al. 2023), are also pro-
posed to act as neuromodulatory precision systems in the brain
(Parr and Friston 2017).] Fluctuations in ANS activity can cause 
changes in model uncertainty, both in lower-order sensory motor 
inferences and in higher-order meta-cognitive representations 
(Allen et al. 2016 ). For example, the rhythmic contraction of 
the heart muscle (systole) causes pulsatile blood flow across the 
retina, affecting the certainty with which the brain can rely on 
incoming (visual) signals. There is also a substantial literature 
demonstrating how baroreceptor firing (arising from vagal affer-
ents to the brain) influences cognition and behaviour (i.e. Allen 
et al. 2016, Critchley and Garfinkel 2018, Azzalini et al. 2019).
The ‘interoceptive self-inference’ model (Allen et al. 2020, 2022) 
proposes that by inferring expected autonomic conditions, active 
inference agents can better estimate changes in expected uncer-
tainty (e.g. caused by increased sensory noise) and thus modulate 
the expected precision of incoming signals (the impact of sensory 
errors on belief updates and action selection) accordingly. This 
may explain why changes in the frequency or rhythm of auto-
nomic cycles impact higher-order estimates of uncertainty. For 
example, why heart rate increases are associated with changing 
confidence in exteroceptive judgements; Allen et al. 2016 ). ANS 
dynamics are intertwined with uncertainty and used in inferences 
about uncertainty throughout the hierarchy. Put simply, by intero-
ceptively (self-)inferring what the heart (or other activity of the 
ANS) is going to do and when, the brain can improve its overall 
sensitivity to changes in bodily mediated uncertainty dynamics, 
and account for these expected fluctuations through optimizing 
precision.
In line with the enactive implications of active inference, the 
same bodily mediated precision mechanisms (e.g. autonomic 
mechanisms like cardiac regulation) may also be used to optimize 
action in response to changes in expected sensory uncertainty. 
That is, certain dynamics of the ANS may be enacted (though 
active inference) to respond to changes in uncertainty, because 
of the learned impacts of those dynamics on uncertainty and pre-
cision. One recent proposal suggests that heart rate changes ( like 
respiratory cycles and gastric waves) are central in shaping the 
precision dynamics and fine-tuning the balance between percep-
tion and action, according to situational demands (Skora et  al. 
2022). Under perceptual uncertainty, heart rate slows, increasing 
the amount of time and predictability of time spent in diastole 
and, by extension, the amount of and predictability of opportuni-
ties for high-precision sensory sampling (Corcoran et al. 2021). The 
implication is that active interoceptive self-inference may not only 
predict (monitor) autonomic conditions and ‘account for’ their 
effects on sensory precision but also enact (control) autonomic 
changes to ‘utilize’ these expected effects in future inferences. 
Interoceptive self-inferences help agents to monitor and control 
their precision trajectories ‘through’ monitoring and controlling 
their interoceptive (particularly autonomic) rhythms (see Allen 
et al. (2020, 2022) for more detailed accounts).
Autonomic conditions also respond to ‘unexpected’ changes 
in uncertainty. For instance, while baseline pupil dilation has 
been shown to reflect expected uncertainty (roughly the inverse 
of expected precision), rapid changes in pupil dilation are also 
momentarily evoked by uncertainty that is not expected (i.e. 
violations of precise expectations, volatility, or surprise; Dayan 
and Yu 2003, Nassar et al. 2012, Browning et al. 2015, de Berker 
et al. 2016, Reimer et al. 2016, Harris et al. 2022, Pajkossy et al. 
2023). The magnitude of these momentary autonomic deviations 
(i.e. from baseline to evoked pupil dilation, reflecting estimates 
of expected to unexpected uncertainty) suggests that the pro-
cess generating observations has changed. Prior estimates may no 
longer be reliable. Depending on the magnitude or consistency of 
these deviations, they may drive belief updates about expected 
uncertainty. These updates will depend on the level of confi-
dence assigned to interoceptive beliefs relative to error signals or 
interoceptive precision.
Interoceptive precision estimates are vital for the uncertainty 
dynamics in embodied active inference to operate effectively. 
Under sudden changes in autonomic conditions, the precision of 
Arousal coherence, uncertainty, and well-being  5
interoceptive error signals usually increases—facilitating updated 
estimates of these states. For example, precise tracking of 
heartbeats improves during heightened physiological arousal (i.e. 
Smith et al. 2020a, 2020b, 2021), enabling more rapid updat-
ing of expected autonomic states. As described earlier, inferred 
autonomic states helps to shape precision estimates through-
out the inferential hierarchy. If an agent fails to update preci-
sion estimates in line with changing bodily signals (i.e. despite 
surmounting error signals), it may subvert precision weighting 
mechanisms throughout the hierarchy. Indeed, failure to adapt 
interoceptive precision in response to autonomic changes has 
been associated with poorer mental and physical health out-
comes, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders
(Smith et al. 2021).
In the next section, we discuss how affective arousal may 
assist in adaptively updating interoceptive precision estimates 
by acting as an orienting function, enabling the system to 
focus on particularly strong indicators of changes, and guid-
ing the system in when to prioritize updates of interoceptive
precision.
Affective arousal and precision optimization
Under the active inference framework and other implementations 
of predictive coding, affective states have been associated with 
inferences about the causes or consequences of interoceptive con-
ditions (i.e. Seth 2013, Barrett and Simmons 2015, Seth and Friston 
2016), or with changes in prediction error dynamics or uncertainty 
(i.e. Joffily and Coricelli 2013 , Kiverstein et al. 2019 , Hesp et al. 
2021). Through the lens of deep active inference, affect is proposed 
to represent changes in ‘lower-level’ uncertainty. The experience is 
an abstraction—a minimal form of meta-cognition over changes 
in how well the model is doing at life (subjective model fitness) 
across time (Hesp et al. 2021). Being ‘tuned’ by this higher-level 
affective abstraction of fitness guides the system to become a bet-
ter predictor over time. For example, the feeling of momentary 
subjective happiness is thought to signal that the model is improv-
ing in its predictions (i.e. that prediction errors are reducing across 
time). This feeling can thus be used to guide overall improvement 
(Miller et al. 2022).
When affective arousal is discussed in the current active infer-
ence literature (often in passing), it is generally suggested to 
be inferred based on unexpected or unexplained changes, such 
as residual interoceptive ( Barrett and Simmons 2015 ) or homeo-
static (Solms and Friston 2018 ) errors. Inferences about affective 
arousal are proposed to be evaluative, resulting from the mag-
nitude of changes in uncertainty (e.g. Solms and Friston 2018, 
Solms 2019, Hesp et al. 2021), and also directive, acting to fine-
tune the precision of certain ascending error signals, according 
to those evaluations (i.e. shifts in expected free energy associated 
with homeostatic deviations; Solms and Friston 2018). Rather than 
proposing a specific computational account for affective arousal 
here, we instead draw on the ideas offered in previous perspectives 
under the active inference framework.
Under active inference accounts, affective arousal has been 
proposed to serve as a signal for the need to learn or adapt 
in response to significant changes in interoceptive-allostatic 
uncertainty ( Barrett and Simmons 2015). It orients belief 
updates towards reliable cues of affective states (Hesp et al. 
2021
)—including, presumably, interoceptive-allostatic errors—
through precision optimization ( Solms and Friston 2018 ). Sur-
prisingly, large or unrelenting deviations (e.g. homeostatic errors 
(Solms and Friston 2018 ) or residual interoceptive errors (Barrett 
and Simmons 2015)) can serve as evidence for high (or increased) 
affective arousal. Inferences about affective arousal optimize the 
precision of those ascending signals, upregulating those that are 
expected to resolve future uncertainty. In non-affective domains, 
this might be considered bottom-up attention/salience. That is, 
affective experiences (like valence or other affective qualities 
resulting from homeostatic deviations) are proposed to be aroused 
or to consciously change (Solms and Friston 2018, Solms 2019), 
only when there is a need to prioritize or learn from changing 
conditions. The arousal into consciousness (or in reverse, atten-
uation) of affective stimuli and qualities—and we suggest, partic-
ularly interoceptive changes—may also play an important role in 
monitoring and regulating changes in uncertainty.
Interoceptive prediction errors and precision may play a unique 
role in monitoring, responding to, and utilizing changes in uncer-
tainty and precision dynamics. Recall that interoceptive self-
inference is proposed as a core mechanism through which organ-
isms implicitly and preconsciously infer and actively shape their 
own expected precision trajectories (Allen 2020, Allen et al. 2020). 
If affective states recruit bodily signals (or the outcomes of intero-
ceptive inferences) to model the current state of affairs (Critchley 
and Garfinkel 2017) and changes in autonomic arousal reflect 
and enact changes in uncertainty and precision (as discussed ear-
lier in ‘Uncertainty dynamics in embodied active inference’), then 
inferred affective arousal may reflect a (minimally) meta-cognitive 
mechanism through which the precision and error dynamics of 
interoceptive self-inference are consciously represented and reg-
ulated.
Again, note that we do not mean to imply that affective arousal 
is ‘only’ informed by the outcomes of interoceptive predictions. 
As discussed earlier, affective arousal is also informed by error 
and uncertainty dynamics not necessarily exclusive to interocep-
tion. The precision optimization process reflected that affective 
arousal is dynamic and continuous, shaped by prior beliefs (like 
past affect), higher-level beliefs, and other learned contextual 
factors, and responsive to both external and internal changes, 
ensuring that the organism remains adaptable and responsive to 
evolving environmental and physiological conditions. What we are 
suggesting is that interoceptive self-inferences—particularly con-
cerning changes in ANS arousal—may be one mechanism through 
which the precision dynamics of affective arousal are monitored 
and enacted. This relationship is depicted in the bottom half of 
Fig. 1.
Given beliefs about the (low) reliability of interoceptive errors, 
ascending error signals may be suppressed, leading to affective 
arousal that is out of synchrony with the changes in uncertainty 
encoded by the ANS. On the other hand, if inferred affective 
arousal is responsive to the magnitude of (particularly unex-
pected) changes in autonomic arousal, the resulting affectively 
driven orienting processes will also be more responsive to changes 
in uncertainty. This suggests a sensitive bidirectional relation-
ship between inferences about autonomic and affective arousal, 
with both acting as different kinds of device for monitoring and 
controlling uncertainty through precision, and where the relation-
ship (or integration) between them may be particularly important 
for maintaining up-to-date uncertainty estimates in affectively 
oriented processing.
Meta-awareness
Felt affective experiences, as a minimal form of meta-cognition, 
are proposed to guide actions towards uncertainty reduction over 
time (Hesp et al. 2021). However, importantly, felt experience (i.e. 
6 Biddell et al.
Figure 1. From bottom to top: autonomic arousal fluctuates with sensory and probabilistic uncertainty (cf. de Berker et al. 2016, Allen et al. 2020, 
2022). Affective arousal reflects and influences organismic (affectively relevant) uncertainty, which entrains descending precision estimates over 
interoceptive error signals. In reverse, inferences about affective arousal are also informed by ascending (precision-weighted) interoceptive error 
signals. Meta-awareness monitors and regulates the precision of affective-level precision estimates, enabling intentional monitoring and regulation of 
changes in arousal. With increasing meta-awareness of arousal, inferences about affective arousal may become more responsive to subtle changes in 
ascending interoceptive errors, over time resulting in higher arousal coherence. On the other hand, continually affectively suppressing these 
interoceptive errors leads to discoherence
phenomenal affective arousal) is not necessarily the same as being 
able to access or report on that experience ( Amir et  al. 2023 ). 
Here, we extend our conception of arousal beyond autonomic 
and affective, to a third level of meta-cognitive awareness. We 
suggest that higher-order meta-cognitive awareness over affective 
arousal (i.e. reflected in the capacity to explicitly notice and report 
on current affective arousal experiences) monitors and regulates 
lower-level inferences about affective arousal. Through learning 
and deploying action policies to monitor and regulate momentary 
felt affective arousal, this awareness can facilitate uncertainty 
reduction over longer timescales.
Meta-cognitive awareness and control ( Sandved-Smith et al. 
2021) have recently been modelled under deep parametric active 
inference. Parametrically deep models exhibit a nested, fractal-
like structure where each generative model of perception and 
action exists under an identical structure above it. At higher 
parametric levels, inferences monitor and regulate lower-level 
inferences. The ascending signals are related to prediction out-
comes across time, and descending signals entrain expected states 
and their precision. For example, in a model of attention with 
three levels of parametric depth, third-order meta-awareness both 
monitors and controls (or entrains the expected states and pre-
cisions of) second-order attentional states, which subsequently 
entrain the expected states and precisions of first-order percep-
tion and action (Sandved-Smith et al. 2021).
In line with this conceptualization of meta-awareness of atten-
tion, we suggest that meta-awareness of arousal may be the 
result of similar inferences, particularly concerning the con-
textual and learned reliability of various lower-level sources of 
affective arousal. This level of representation permits an organ-
ism to make informed choices about how to monitor and reg-
ulate lower-order sources of affective arousal, through mon-
itoring and entraining changes in precision estimates. This 
may also include enhancing/attenuating the impact of ascend-
ing interoceptive (autonomic) errors upon updates of affective 
arousal. Meta-awareness of arousal may be both determined 
by (monitor) and determine (control) the strength and sensitiv-
ity of inferred affective arousal to fluctuations in interoceptive
inferences.
Recent empirical findings show that ascending heart-to-brain 
information flow in affective processing (presumably reflective of 
interoceptive precision) is modulated by self-reported affective 
arousal. In brief, there is an initial cardiac response (sympa-
thovagal/heartbeat activity) to emotion elicitation that precedes 
and prompts a specific response in the brain related to affec-
tive arousal. This initial response is followed by a continuous 
interaction between brain and heart. Importantly, self-reported 
subjective affective arousal specifically influences the strength of 
the continuous signals flowing from the heart to the brain (Candia-
Rivera et al. 2022). In a similar vein, arousal focus—the tendency to 
emphasize felt changes in affective arousal when reporting emo-
tional experiences—is also associated with stronger interoceptive 
sensitivity (Barrett et al. 2004). Thus, self-reported (read: meta-
aware) experiences of affective arousal also appear to be involved 
in shaping interoceptive precision.
We propose that meta-awareness of arousal may entrain the 
precision and expected states of lower-order sources of affec-
tive arousal, shaping their responsiveness to ascending sources 
of error, including interoceptive errors. That is, meta-awareness 
of arousal monitors and controls the responsiveness of inferred 
affective arousal to changes in ascending errors. We show an 
example of this relationship in Fig. 1, specifically for interocep-
tive/autonomic errors. Facilitating affective arousal that is more 
responsive to ascending interoceptive errors may allow agents to 
update and refine their inferred arousal states with more accuracy. 
As such, meta-awareness of arousal across time may contribute to 
a more sensitive and responsive relationship between feelings of 
affective arousal and measurable changes in autonomic arousal. 
This would not only allow for a more accurate conscious repre-
sentation of changes in uncertainty, but also, over time, allow 
for learning about contextual changes in arousal. As a result of 
this higher-order learning, agents could deploy action policies to 
Arousal coherence, uncertainty, and well-being  7
create future circumstances which purposely regulate and utilize 
(changes in) arousal and coherence.
Arousal coherence and well-being
An extension of this is that arousal coherence may also be an 
inferred state or thing to track in the model’s estimations of its 
own allostatic control. Does my subjective state match up with 
the (inferred) state of my body? Should I expect it to? Conflict 
between levels may suggest inefficient allostatic control and self-
efficacy (i.e. reduce confidence that the model is a good regulator 
of action), which may manifest phenomenologically as lower sub-
jective well-being. In contrast, coherence between levels may 
increase confidence in allostatic control estimates. Phenomenally 
feeling of allostatic control estimates in subjective well-being may 
adaptively guide the system—again, through feelings—towards 
better allostatic control (e.g. prediction error minimization) over 
time. However, these inferences can become pathological. For 
example, pathologically inferring low/lost allostatic control and 
self-efficacy are also thought to be involved in clinical symptoms 
and phenomenology across fatigue, depression, and depersonal-
ization (Stephan et al. 2016 , Deane et al. 2020 , Ramstead et al. 
2023
). In brief, high-level inferences about arousal coherence may 
inform inferences about allostatic control (i.e. how well the sys-
tem is doing at budgeting energy resources) and thus impact 
subjective feelings of well-being. (We thank reviewer 1 for help-
fully drawing our attention to this interpretation.) Indeed, stronger 
arousal coherence (as indexed by the intra-individual relationship 
between physiologically and affectively aroused states) has pre-
viously been associated with higher self-reported psychological 
well-being (e.g. Sommerfeldt et al. 2019).
While noting that this is an interesting avenue for further con-
sideration, we propose that beyond informing high-level allostatic 
control estimates and related inferences about well-being, arousal 
coherence may also be involved in updating precision estimates, 
with implications for the veracity and adaptability of all affectively 
informed inferences. Through its role in precision optimization, we 
suggest that arousal coherence is also likely to be associated with 
self-awareness and self-regulation and through these to facili-
tate more adaptive functioning and ultimately well-being. We also 
suggest that this kind of coherence may shape responsiveness to 
changing levels of uncertainty in the (bodily and ambient) envi-
ronment. The focus of our remaining discussion pertains to the 
functions, implications, and potential measurement of arousal 
coherence itself (rather than high-level inferences about arousal 
coherence).
Optimizing affective arousal according to changes (or errors) 
in inferred autonomic arousal (which we suggest is reflected in 
arousal coherence) presumably impacts the dynamics of higher-
order affectively informed inferences, like inferences about emo-
tions. Dysfunctional emotional perception—particularly percep-
tions of stress—are associated with various psychiatric symptoms 
(Thorsén et al. 2022). Keeping emotional perception broadly in 
tune with embodied changes in uncertainty (i.e. through arousal 
coherence) may help both by preventing emotion beliefs and per-
ceptions from becoming rigid and by facilitating opportunities for 
regulation. Indeed, arousal coherence is associated with less use 
of maladaptive coping strategies, like repressive and suppressive 
coping, and with significantly higher psychological and physi-
cal well-being, particularly seen in lower depression and anxiety 
(Sommerfeldt et al. 2019).
Importantly, while in most circumstances, integrating inte-
roceptive and affective arousal is presumably adaptive (under 
conditions of changing uncertainty), this is not necessarily always 
so (i.e. under stable uncertainty). For example, in cases of unre-
lenting or overwhelming distress with an inability to resolve it, 
such as in intense grief or prolonged conflict, it may be more 
adaptive to be able to dissociate from (or attenuate) overwhelm-
ing signals arising from the body (at least for a time). In line with 
this, repressive and suppressive coping, which have been shown 
to help with grief adjustment in the short term (Coifman et  al. 
2007), have also repeatedly been tied to reduced coherence (Coif-
man et al. 2007, Sommerfeldt et al. 2019, Brown et al. 2020). As we 
will discuss further later, the capacity to appropriately connect 
to a coherent mapping of arousal (to promote responsiveness to 
uncertainty dynamics) and the (higher order) capacity to override 
momentary discoherence in the short term, where necessary, may 
both serve important functions.
However, with prolonged discoherence (for example, given suf-
ficient overwhelm) beliefs may form about how valuable bodily 
signals are, leading to sustained attenuation and an inability 
to access and utilize these signals. Recent findings suggest that 
beliefs about the value and safety of bodily signals may also 
predict this kind of arousal coherence (interestingly though, not 
explicit interoceptive accuracy), such that the less valuable or 
more dangerous bodily signals are perceived to be, the lower 
the coherence between subjective/affective and objective/auto-
nomic markers of arousal ( MacCormack et al. 2024 ). In other 
words, if one has a strong expectation that bodily signals are 
unreliable or untrustworthy (learned over longer timescales), one 
may systematically underweight ascending interoceptive errors in 
affective arousal. This is likely to have detrimental impacts on
well-being.
Indeed, decoupling between physiological and subjective 
streams of affective experiences has been proposed to be one of 
the mechanisms by which early life adversity predicts later life 
health (Petrova et al. 2021). This decoupling may also help to 
explain seemingly contradictory lines of thinking about disorders 
of presence (like depersonalization or dissociation) which have 
previously been associated with deficits in successful prediction 
of interoceptive signals (Seth et al. 2012), particularly due to sys-
tematic (Saini et al. 2022 ) and pathological down-regulation of 
interoceptive error signals (Seth 2013 , Seth and Critchley 2013), 
despite people with these disorders showing normal performance 
on explicit interoceptive accuracy tasks (Michal et al. 2014). Per-
haps disorders of presence are affected by pathological affective 
down-regulation of interoceptive signals rather than explicit inte-
roceptive attention or regulation.
Interestingly, when interoceptive signals are processed as 
anticipated, this is proposed to increase the ability to trust body 
signals (Herbert and Pollatos 2012 , Owens et al. 2018 ), suggest-
ing that arousal coherence may not only reflect but also impact 
the capacity of a person to trust their bodily signals. Embod-
ied contemplative practices like meditation also emphasize pur-
poseful attention to and acceptance of bodily signals, facilitating 
meta-awareness and control of arousal states. If maladaptive inte-
roceptive integration is a key factor across many psychological 
disorders, contemplative practice may work by attenuating these 
dysfunctions.
In their predictive coding model of mind–body integration, 
Farb et al. (2015)  suggest that non-judgementally attending to 
or ‘sitting with’ unexpected feelings of arousal during medita-
tion may reduce over-dependence on top-down expectations and 
facilitate learning or ‘insight’ about the self in the environment 
rather than knee-jerk arousal regulation strategies. Indeed, these 
practices have been shown to improve elements of self-reported
8 Biddell et al.
interoceptive sensibility, particularly trust in bodily signals and 
how the body is used for self-regulation and emotional insight 
(Bornemann et al. 2015 , Lima-Araujo et al. 2022 ). Interestingly, 
while meditation practice shows no effect on enhancing explicit 
interoceptive accuracy measures (Khalsa et al. 2020, Lima-Araujo 
et al. 2022), it does relate to increased interoceptive sensibility 
(Lima-Araujo et al. 2022 ) and to an index of increased arousal 
coherence (Sze et al. 2010).
Increasing arousal control and coherence
More recent active inference models of meditation (e.g. Laukkonen 
and Slagter 2021) indicate that one way in which contempla-
tive practices may increase coherence between mind and body 
generally but also specifically for arousal is by temporarily flat-
tening hierarchically deep processing. By reducing the precision 
of temporally extended models (e.g. thinking) and increasing the 
expected precision of here-and-now bodily signals (e.g. through 
shifting attention to the breath; Lutz et al. 2019), one may increase 
the coherence between affective and autonomic arousal by tuning 
expectations more precisely to bodily data (e.g. ANS arousal indi-
cators). Consequently, the organism may become more responsive 
to unexpected changes in environmental uncertainty through bet-
ter integration of changes in physiological arousal. Put metaphori-
cally, connecting affective and autonomic arousal through orient-
ing feelings (optimizing precision, Feldman and Friston 2010, Lutz 
et al. 2019) ‘grounds’ more abstract beliefs to the more volatile and 
direct connection that exists between the body and the world. By 
maintaining a connection between higher-order and lower-order 
systems of arousal (e.g. through increasing meta-awareness of 
arousal, like in specific kinds of meditation practices), the organ-
ism may be better tuned to uncertainty throughout all levels of 
the mind (i.e. the generative hierarchy).
Crucially, the capacity to be meta-aware of changes in arousal 
is also key to Buddhist meditation practice (Britton et al. 2014 , 
Dunne et al. 2019). For example, to achieve ‘samatha’ (tranquil-
lity, serenity, and/or concentration), one needs to maintain a 
‘balanced’ energy that is neither too aroused [e.g. restless or agi-
tated, known as ‘uddhacca’ in Pali (the liturgical language of early 
Buddhism)] nor too drowsy (associated with sloth or ‘thīna’ in 
Buddhism). The capacity to consciously monitor arousal states 
corresponds to the high-order level of inference described ear-
lier. Moreover, in classical Buddhist meditation, this high-order 
monitoring allows one to consciously apply certain ‘antidotes’ to 
shift arousal levels back to balance in a top-down way—e.g. in 
the case of mental dullness a meditator is encouraged to apply 
belief (‘ ́sraddh ̄a’), aspiration (‘chanda’), effort (‘vyayama’), and 
suppleness (‘pra ́srabdhi’). Indeed, a review of evidence showed 
that meditators do appear to possess meaningful control over 
their levels of wakefulness and arousal (in some cases even during 
sleep) with increasing prowess as expertise increases (Britton et al. 
2014
). Awareness and gradual ‘opacification’ of arousal processes 
through practices like meditation may increase the capacity to 
regulate these states, for example, via reducing autonomic or 
‘knee-jerk’ arousal regulation strategies.
We propose that this is because of the bidirectional relation-
ships between meta-awareness, affective arousal, and autonomic 
arousal, where meditation exerts its control (initially) through 
high-order inferential mechanisms, followed by temporal flatten-
ing effects described earlier (see also Laukkonen and Slagter 2021 
for an extreme example of how meditation can control arousal 
and wakefulness levels to the point of cessation). An interesting 
implication of this view is that simple ‘awareness’ of arousal levels 
and intentions to affect them (e.g. through determined effort) may 
have substantial effects on both affective and autonomic arousal 
levels, possibly helping to both control and integrate uncertainty 
inferences throughout the system.
Speaking more broadly, any activity that prioritizes aware-
ness of bodily information over other more abstract processes 
(e.g. yoga, dancing, and other forms of exercise, as opposed 
to less-embodied contemplative practices, like reciting prayers) 
may increase coherence between affective, autonomic, and self-
reported arousal (cf. Sze et  al. 2010), thereby extending already 
known benefits to the organism’s capacity to respond to uncer-
tainty in the world (e.g. possibly improving the capacity to update 
maladaptive beliefs about uncertainty and to learn under condi-
tions of changing uncertainty; Mrazek et al. 2013, Laukkonen et al. 
2020, McGovern et al. 2022).
The kind of interactions that occur between affect and auto-
nomic processes in embodied practices (like meditation and sport) 
involves a healthy amount of appropriate and intentional atten-
uation (e.g. ignoring physical distress during intense exercise or 
meditation in favour of perceptual inference or long-term error 
reduction). The ideal scenario may therefore be one where the 
organism can appropriately connect to a coherent mapping of 
arousal to promote responsiveness to uncertainty dynamics (cf. 
Miller et al. 2022) while also possessing higher-order (meta) capac-
ities to override autonomic signals (momentary discoherence) in 
the short term, where necessary. Nevertheless, baseline arousal 
coherence is likely to remain a useful marker of many factors 
associated with healthy well-being and is an exciting path for 
future work. Likewise, the capacity to increase meta-awareness 
of arousal levels and to direct attention to autonomic changes 
is promising as a clinical intervention for disorders character-
ized by arousal discoherence (e.g. dissociation and anxiety) or 
other common but less severe forms of decoupling. Such inter-
ventions may be especially effective when physical movement 
is included to ensure bottom-up and top-down information pro-
cessing across all levels of arousal (physiological, affective, and
reportable).
Conclusion
Computation of uncertainty is crucial for self-organizing infer-
ence machines (like Bayesian brains) to learn about and adapt to 
dynamic and only-indirectly-observable environments. Affect is 
part of the mechanism that brains use to become better predic-
tion machines. Where previous work on affective error dynamics 
has focussed primarily on valence (in terms of patterns of chang-
ing uncertainty, i.e. Kiverstein et al. 2019, Hesp et al. 2021, Miller 
et al. 2022), here we have focussed on arousal in monitoring the 
magnitude of and enacting changes in uncertainty. We have seen 
how uncertainty processing is distributed across both affective 
and autonomic arousal, and the role that affective-interoceptive 
integration, or arousal coherence, may play in responding to changes 
in uncertainty, both internally and externally. In practice, this 
means that the correlation between subjective reports of affec-
tive arousal and physiological markers of autonomic arousal (i.e. 
changes in heart rate, respiration, or pupil dilation) might be used 
to index the capacity to adjust interoceptive precision, particu-
larly in response to changing levels of uncertainty in the bodily 
and external environment.
Difficulties integrating interoceptive information into higher-
order processes are established to have wide-ranging implications, 
from emotional awareness and regulation (Price and Hooven 2018, 
Schultchen et al. 2019), to the sense of self ( Damasio 2003, Seth 
Arousal coherence, uncertainty, and well-being  9
et al. 2012), to intuitive (Dunn et al. 2010) and rational decision-
making (Kirk et al. 2011), and from the aetiology of several psychi-
atric conditions (Khalsa and Lapidus 2016), to mental and physical 
health more broadly (Critchley and Garfinkel 2018, Khalsa et al. 
2018, Quadt et al. 2018 , Herbert et al. 2020 ). The emphasis in 
the present paper is not explicit interoception, like accurately 
reporting on your heartbeat, but rather ‘integrating’ certain intero-
ceptive information into felt experience (cf. Solms 2019). We have 
suggested that the within-person correlation between measures 
of autonomic and affective arousal may be a useful index of the 
level of this integration. We also suggested that practicing meta-
awareness of changes in arousal (like in meditation) may facilitate 
improvements in coherence.
If unexpected changes in autonomic arousal (i.e. interoceptive 
errors) are not effectively integrated into affective arousal over 
time, then pathological decoupling (discoherence) can occur. If 
discoherence between arousal systems occurs (e.g. owing to fail-
ures to update interoceptive precision, via affective inference), 
then there are likely to be broad negative outcomes for the 
organism in the long term, particularly in terms of the ability 
to update beliefs appropriately in response to fluctuating uncer-
tainty. Updating uncertainty estimates is crucial for well-being, as 
discussed earlier. Indeed, a range of affective disorders are asso-
ciated with reduced sensitivity to changes in uncertainty ( Pulcu 
and Browning 2019). Under active inference, failures to update 
estimates of uncertainty particularly negatively impact the capac-
ity for learning because the system cannot optimally recognize 
opportunities for reducing uncertainty. Therefore, our take on 
the role of arousal coherence yields further hitherto untested 
predictions, as discussed later.
Presumably, difficulties with affectively integrating informa-
tion about one’s own autonomic states will also have negative 
impacts on emotional awareness and regulation. Dysfunctional 
affective arousal is suggested as a contributing factor in alex-
ithymia (Bermond 1997, Vorst and Bermond 2001), which is also 
a risk factor for affective disorders via emotional regulation diffi-
culties (Preece et al. 2022). We suggest that emotional awareness 
difficulties, like in alexithymia, are likely associated with dys-
functional arousal coherence. Further, if discoherence represents 
failures to integrate information about uncertainty, we hypothe-
size that it will be associated with intolerance of uncertainty and 
psychological inflexibility. Notably, discoherence has also previ-
ously been associated with the use of avoidant coping strategies 
(Sommerfeldt et al. 2019), which are strongly predictive of intoler-
ance of uncertainty (Sahib et al. 2023). Meanwhile, mindfulness, 
an adaptive and non-avoidant coping strategy, is associated with 
both increased coherence (Sze et al. 2010) and increased tolerance 
of uncertainty (Sahib et al. 2023).
Beyond emotional awareness and regulation, arousal coher-
ence is also likely to have implications for autonomic regulation 
(i.e. recovery from stress), as well as learning under more complex 
conditions, with changing levels of uncertainty (e.g. safety sig-
nal learning). Anxiety has been proposed to reflect rigid learning 
of uncertainty estimates (McGovern et  al. 2022), and individuals 
with high-trait anxiety (also associated with low arousal coher-
ence index; Sommerfeldt et al. 2019) indeed show difficulties 
learning in changing environments, with less ability to adjust and 
update expectancies when environments change between sta-
ble and volatile conditions (Browning et al. 2015). Finally, given 
recent findings that ANS synchrony (e.g. heart rate or respiration 
co-variation) ‘between’ individuals is associated with feelings of 
connectedness, co-operation, and empathy (Levenson and Ruef 
1992
, Marci et  al. 2007, Palumbo et  al. 2016, Coutinho et al. 
2021), the inability to access or reflect upon changes in one’s own 
autonomic signals consciously (affectively) may contribute to dif-
ficulties in social contexts, with possible detriments in empathic 
abilities, detecting social cues, and diminished feelings such as 
connectedness.
The relationships between inferences about physiological 
arousal, affective arousal, meta-awareness of arousal, and uncer-
tainty estimation may be central to understanding not only our 
emotional experiences but also our capacity to learn and adapt 
to the world around us. We have seen that physiological (auto-
nomic) and psychological (affective) arousal both respond to shifts 
in uncertainty, and that changes in inferences about these states 
influence precision estimates across the inferential architecture. 
Although multiple factors influence inferred affective arousal, 
including past affect (cf. Asutay et al. 2021) and higher-order infer-
ences (i.e. meta-awareness of arousal, as discussed earlier), we 
have proposed that incorporating information about the mag-
nitude of errors or changes in inferred autonomic states into 
experienced affective arousal is beneficial for maintaining current 
estimations of uncertainty. Moreover, meta-awareness regarding 
these arousal processes may play a significant role in the respon-
siveness of inferred affective arousal to lower-level changes, pre-
cluding (or enhancing) the impact of ascending interoceptive 
errors on updates of affective arousal. Increasing meta-awareness 
also permits organisms to make decisions about if and how to 
potentially intervene where there might be decoupling or disco-
herence between lower-order arousal systems.
Ultimately, we have suggested that the interplay between affec-
tive, autonomic, and self-reported arousal within an individual 
over time may reflect their ability to adapt to evolving uncertainty 
dynamics. We outlined why, theoretically, this would have pro-
found implications for estimates of uncertainty, for higher-order 
affective awareness, for self-regulation, and ultimately for well-
being. Encouragingly, certain mind–body practices seem to have 
potential to enhance baseline arousal coherence across all lev-
els, thus improving integration and responsiveness to changes 
in uncertainty. Nevertheless, future research may also investi-
gate whether it is possible to isolate the level of arousal in the 
hierarchy where intervention might be most impactful for dif-
ferent conditions. In a world that is increasingly complex and 
unpredictable, interventions that improve multi-layered arousal 
coherence (and awareness therein) may offer a promising path-
way to help us dance in step with the ever-changing music of
uncertainty.
