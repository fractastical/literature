Abstract
Product motion is a crucial design element, blending functiona lity with aes-
thetic appeal. Such motions establish an emotional bond bet ween the product
and its user. Engaging with the product stimulates curiosity an d interest in its
motion, encouraging repeated use. This study aims to formulate i ndicators for
curiosity and interest in motion and to implement a computatio nal system to
generate motions that provoke inquiry. This study situates curi osity and inter-
est as emotions crucial to the inquiry cycle, proposing that opt imal prediction
error (deviation from expected motion patterns) cultivates inte rest, while ﬂuctu-
ations in prediction error spark curiosity. Our analysis is based on the inquiry
cycle, a mathematical model of emotions rooted in the free energy principle of
brain function. We developed curiosity, motion, and interest me asures from the
model based on prediction error variation and reduction. The deve loped sys-
tem can independently control prediction errors and their variati ons for a given
open-loop mechanism. This system generates motions that con trol the magni-
tude of prediction errors by deviating from the trajectory of energy-mi nimizing
motions. Using the semantic diﬀerential method and eye-track ing experiments
measuring gaze duration, we found that interest correlates with pre diction error
in an upward-convex manner, and its variability induces curiosi ty. These results
align with our model. The novelty of this study lies in experim entally verifying
that applying moderate prediction errors and ﬂuctuations in predi ction errors is
eﬀective in increasing interest and curiosity in motion design . This research con-
tributes design insights for engineers and designers seeking to e nhance the appeal
of product motions.

1 Introduction
Industrial product design closely links the behavior and structu re of a product to its
function (
Umeda et al., 1990). For example, the movement of a door panel, set at the
boundary between the exterior and interior, facilitates passage betwe en these spaces.
This behavior and structure, collectively referred to as “motion,” also contribute to
the product’s aesthetic quality. Hopson (2009) considers product motion an aesthetic
element on par with shape, color, and material. Additionally, Nam et al. (2007) sug-
gest that product motion can strengthen the emotional connection betwee n the user
and the product. Attractive motions in products enhance user expe rience, promoting
continued use and affection. This enhancement can improve a company’s brand image
and differentiate its products from competitors. In examining the enduring enrichment
provided by motion design, this study focuses on the philosophical concept of eudaimo-
nia, which denotes a higher form of happiness involving the developme nt of personal
potential, self-realization, and growth (Deci and Ryan, 2008). In contrast, hedonia cen-
ters on pleasure and temporary satisfaction ( Deci and Ryan, 2008). The realization of
eudaimonia involves intellectual curiosity, interest, and a spir it of exploration ( Kash-
dan et al. , 2008), with curiosity driving the pursuit of novelty and problem-solv ing
(Berlyne, 1966), and interest rewarding the resolution of uncertainties triggered by
curiosity (Graf and Landwehr, 2015). Curiosity and interest motivate the acquisition
of new knowledge and foster personal growth through exploration. Objects in daily
life often incorporate motions designed to invoke curiosity and intere st. For exam-
ple, the ‘Evolution Door’ by Klemens Torggler (2012) presents an innovative motion
with four panels rotating in three dimensions. The ‘Dislocation Clo ck’ by PoeticLab
(2010) displays a clock with hands that revolve around a fixed point, challe nging con-
ventional notions of time display. These examples demonstrate motions that deviate
from standard actions, stimulating user curiosity and interest upon understanding the
underlying mechanisms. Case studies on motion design that aim to foste r emotional
connections have focused on jewelry with motion ( Fayazi and Frankel, 2017, Octo-
ber), educational toys with linkage mechanisms ( Park, 2016, October ), and devices
mimicking antennae ( Nam et al. , 2007). However, these studies are product-specific
and lack a general methodology for designing motions across a broad range of prod-
ucts. In robotics research, the generation of robot arm motions has been exp lored
to express emotions and enhance human interaction (Fernandez et al.
2023; Hagane
and Venture 2022; Li and Zhao 2023), and in human–computer interaction (HCI),
emotions estimated from speech have been used to guide avatar gesture s (Qi et al. ,
2023). While these approaches detail methods for integrating emotional exp ressions
into motion, they primarily aim to convey predefined emotions from robots to humans
rather than inducing specific emotions in users through motion design. This study
seeks to mathematically model curiosity and interest as derived from product motions
and to explore conditions that enhance these emotions. Using the inqui ry cycle pro-
posed by the authors (Yanagisawa and Honda, 2023), which focuses on maximizing the
reduction of perceived prediction error, with curiosity motivating changes and interest
serving as a reward for decreased prediction error, this study repr esents a mathemat-
ical model of emotions based on the free energy principle, the unifyi ng brain principle
(Friston et al., 2006). Identifying conditions that amplify curiosity and interest offer s
2
valuable design insights for designers and mechanical engineers seeki ng to increase
product value through motion. Furthermore, this study aims to devel op a computa-
tional system to generate motions that evoke curiosity and interest, enabling both the
general public and non-experts to create effective motions akin to thos e designed by
professionals. The objectives of this study are threefold:
1. Mathematically model curiosity and interest through uncertainty fl uctuations and
identify conditions that amplify these emotions.
2. Develop a system that generates motions based on identified conditions to enhance
curiosity and interest.
3. Validate the model and system effectiveness through experiments involving sub-
jects’ reactions to the generated motions.
The paper continues as follows: Chapter 2 formalizes curiosity and interest. Chapter
3 explains the algorithm of the motion generation system based on the formali zation.
Chapter 4 details the experimental conditions and results, and Chapt er 5 discusses
the experiments.
2 Method
2.1 Formulation of curiosity and interest
This section delineates conditions for motion design that elicit user interest and
curiosity. Curiosity propels behaviors geared toward discovering novelty and finding
solutions, prompting actions that modify predictive errors (Berly ne
1966; Berlyne
1954; Berlyne 1962). Berlyne (1954) described the drive for novel experiences that ele-
vate predictive errors as diversive curiosity and the drive to alle viate predictive errors
for problem solving as specific curiosity. Interest, characterized as a positive emotion,
emerges from problem resolution and the diminution of predictive err ors (Graf and
Landwehr 2015; Yanagisawa and Honda 2023).
The discussion in this section progresses by scrutinizing cogniti ve predictive errors
observed when individuals interact with objects. Initially, the chapter concentrates
on modeling predictive errors and their variations during percept ion. Subsequently, it
outlines factors indicative of curiosity and interest, as inferred from these predictive
errors. Finally, the conditions that optimize these contributory fac tors are discussed.
2.1.1 Prediction Error Formulation
This study employs the variational free energy (VFE) principle (
Friston et al., 2006)
as a metric to model the prediction error encountered during objec t observation. VFE
quantifies the discrepancy between anticipated outcomes and actual re cognition by
biological systems, including humans, thus reflecting cognitive load . VFE serves as a
loss metric within the context of variational Bayesian estimation in th e brain ( Fris-
ton et al. , 2007). This estimation represents an approximation of Bayesian inferenc e,
wherein the hidden state s is inferred from observed data o. The prior distribution
p(s) = D denotes the likelihood of s prior to the observation of o, and the posterior
distribution p(s|o) indicates the probability of s as inferred from o. The likelihood,
3
or observation model p(o|s) = A, elucidates the manner in which o is derived from s.
Generative models incorporate probabilistic frameworks for s and o, represented by
A and D. In variational Bayesian estimation, the recognition distribution q(s) aims
to approximate the posterior p(s|o) by adjusting variables. This adjustment process
unfolds through three iterative steps:
1. Prediction: Align the recognition distribution with the prior distribution p(s).
q(s) ∼p(s) (1)
2. Recognition: Adjust the recognition distribution to match the posterior distrib u-
tion. The posterior distribution is the probability density funct ion normalized by
the product of the prior distribution p(s) and the likelihood function p(o|s).
q(s) ∼p(s|o) ∝p(s)p(o|s) (2)
3. Belief Update : Adopt the posterior distribution as the new prior distribution.
p∗ (s) ←p(s|o) (3)
We define VFE, denoted as F, as follows:
F = DKL [q(s) ∥p(s|o)]
 
KLD
+ (−ln p(o))  
S
(4)
= DKL [q(s) ∥p(s)]  
BS
+ ⟨−ln p(o|s)⟩q(s)
  
UN
(5)
DKL represents the Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD), which quantifies the dif-
ference between two probability distributions. We define Kullb ack–Leibler divergence
using the following operation.
DKL [q(s) ∥p(s|o)] =
∫ ∞
−∞
q(s) ln q(s)
p(s|o) ds (6)
Equation (4) delineates that the first term, KLD, between the posterior distribution
p(s|o) and the recognition distribution q(s), is minimized via recognition. The sec-
ond term, Shannon surprise S, corresponds to VFE F minimized through recognition
(Yanagisawa, 2021).
Equation (5) characterizes the first term as Bayesian surprise (BS), the divergence
between the recognition distribution q(s) and the prior distribution p(s), which is
minimized through the update of beliefs. The second term, uncertai nty (UN), evalu-
ates the plausibility of explaining observational data via the recognit ion distribution
(Yanagisawa, 2021).

2.1.2 Prediction Error Variation Formulation
VFE decreases during “recognition” and “belief updating” in the percep tion pro-
cess (
Yanagisawa and Honda , 2023). This section outlines VFE reduction during
perception.
Recognition: Initially, q(s) aligns with the prior distribution p(s). Upon receiving
observation o, q(s) equals p(s), leading to an initial VFE F0 calculated as follows:
F0 = DKL [p(s) ∥p(s|o)] + (−ln p(o)) (7)
Subsequently, q(s) aligns with the posterior distribution p(s|o). The VFE post-
recognition, FR, becomes
FR = −ln p(o) (8)
Hence, recognition reduces F by
F0 −FR = DKL [p(s) ∥p(s|o)] = KLD (9)
Belief Updating: The VFE post-recognition, FR, is expressed as
FR = DKL [p(s|o) ∥p(s)] + ⟨−ln p(o|s)⟩p(s|o) (10)
After updating beliefs, p(s) updates to p(s|o), resulting in VFE FL:
FL = ⟨−ln p(o|s)⟩p(s|o) (11)
Thus, belief updating reduces F by
FR −FL = DKL [p(s|o) ∥p(s)] = BS (12)
Figure 1 depicts the reduction in VFE resulting from recognition and the updating
of beliefs, detailing each component. After completing recognition wi th observation
o, VFE diminishes by the KLD value. The KLD measures the immediate inf orma-
tion gain achieved through recognition. The reduced VFE, denoted as FR, equates to
the Shannon surprise S, which is further decomposed into BS and UN components.
Following the update from the prior distribution p(s) to the posterior p(s|o), VFE
undergoes another reduction. The final VFE, FL, after belief updating, aligns with the
UN component. The process of belief updating, which involves repeate d observations,
occurs more gradually than the process of recognition. Consequently, B S represents
information that is expected in the future, rather than being acquired instantaneously.
The decrease in VFE through both processes signifies the information gain ed through
inference.
The total VFE reduction from recognition and belief updating equals the s um of
KLD and BS that is termed information gain (IG).
IG = KLD + BS (13)
5
Fig. 1 The decrease in VFE involves two key phases. First, recognit ion shifts from q(s) to p(s|o),
reducing KLD. Next, belief updating moves from p(s) to p(s|o), reducing BS.
2.1.3 Prediction Error and Information Gain
The reduction in VFE is contingent upon the parameters of the generativemodel (per-
taining to prediction and observation accuracy) and the magnitude of prediction error.
Utilizing a normal distribution for the generative model, the authors (
Yanagisawa
and Honda , 2023) undertook an analysis of VFE components. They conceptualized
the prior distribution p(s) as a normal distribution N(η, s p), characterized by mean η
and variance sp. The likelihood function pε(o|s) is represented as a combination of a
normal distribution (with mean ¯o, variance sl) and uniform noise ε.
pε(on|s) = N(¯o, s l) + ε (14)
This analytical framework demonstrated that KLD, BS, and IG manifest as con -
vex functions relative to the surprise S. Figure 2 exemplifies the decline in VFE
components KLD, BS, IG as functions of S, indicating that stimuli with low levels
of surprise do not facilitate significant information gain. Similarly, hi ghly unexpected
stimuli also fail to enhance information gain due to a high UN component in S. The
level of surprise that optimizes IG, termed the optimal arousal level SIG , corresponds
with Berlyne’s theory. This theory posits an inverted U-shaped rel ationship between
affective valence and arousal, where a moderate level of arousal optimizes valence.
Yanagisawa’s research (Yanagisawa H . 2021) provides mathematical backing for this
theory by associating arousal potential with the level of surprise.
Yanagisawa and Honda(2023) presented a model that connects exploratory behav-
ior with changes in VFE, referred to as the exploration cycle model. Figure 3 delineates
the conceptual framework of this model, proposing that ideal exploration entails fluc-
tuations of surprise around the optimal arousal level SIG . This state is attained by
oscillating between maximizing KLD to cater to specific curiosity an d enhancing BS
for diversive curiosity.

error, followed by a decrease, and eventually, they converg e to zero. ( sp = 1 . 0, s l = 1 . 0)

reduction along the vertical demonstrate how alternating m aximization of KLD and BS achieves an
optimal arousal level with surprise ﬂuctuations.
2.1.4 Curiosity and Interest Formulation
This study delineates interest as the positive emotion associated w ith diminished pre-
diction error. The IG resulting from refreshed perceptions and be liefs is posited as the
foundation of interest.
Curiosity prompts variations in prediction error, striving for a cond ition in which
error oscillates around an optimal arousal level, supporting exemplary ex ploratory
behavior. Research by Koelsch et al. (
Koelsch, 2014)Koelsch et al. (2019) suggests that
these fluctuations could augment aesthetic appreciation in arts and musi c. Further-
more, Daikoku et al. (2023) experimentally demonstrated that temporal fluctuations
in the tempo of music evoke physical sensations related to aesthetic evaluation.The
measurement of curiosity is conducted through the variance of surpris e VS utilizing
time-series data on surprise and is articulated as follows:
VS = ⟨S2⟩−⟨S⟩2 (15)
7
2.1.5 Optimizing Conditions for Curiosity and Interest
Having delineated interest as IG and curiosity through the variance of s urprise VS ,
we now explore the conditions that intensify these emotions. Our fo cus centers on
two main areas: (1) the precision of predictions and observations, and (2) conditions
associated with observation.
(1) Prediction and Observation Accuracy Interest, quantified as IG, is shaped
as a convex function with respect to surprise. The authors (
Yanagisawa and Honda,
2023) investigated the relationship between the maximum value of IG and the variances
of the prior distribution (sp) and the likelihood’s variance (sl). Their analysis revealed
that IG reaches its peak when sp is elevated and sl minimized. Figure 4 illustrates
the maximum IG as it corresponds to sp and sl, implying that users should eschew
strong preconceptions (high sp) and pay close attention to the observed targets (low
sl). For designers, this highlights the necessity of ensuring that motions are perceptible
to users, particularly when those motions are novel, unexpected, or presumed to be
static.
Fig. 4 Occurrence of maximum IG under varying sp and sl.
(2) Observation
Observations that yield surprises proximate to the optimal arousal le vel SIG are
most effective in maximizing interest. In motion design, this impl ies creating motions
that slightly diverge from the expected, up to SIG , to enhance interest.
To maximize the variance of surprise VS , it is essential to increase the temporal
diversity of surprises from observations. In motion design, alternating between motions
that cause minor and major prediction errors can effectively boost curi osity. However,
these surprise fluctuations should be centered around SIG , maintaining the average
level of surprise close to this optimal point.
From this discussion, the following theoretical hypotheses are form ulated, which
Section 4 will empirically examine:
• H1: Interest exhibits an inverted U-shape relationship with respect to surprise S.
• H2: Variations in surprise VS enhance curiosity.
• H3: A reduced variance in the likelihood function sl elevates interest.

2.2 Motion Generation System for Curiosity and Interest
2.2.1 System Requirements
This study introduces a system designed to compute indicators cr ucial for gauging
interest and curiosity, namely surprise S and its variance VS , based on motions. Sub-
sequently, it can craft motions that individually modulate these in dicators. Users
specify their preferred S and VS values, and the system then generates motions align-
ing with these criteria. The optimization process concentrates on t he motion itself,
with structural elements supplied by the user.
2.2.2 Problem Deﬁnition
Structure: The system operates as an open-loop mechanism with N elements con-
nected by rotational or translational joints, each featuring an actuator to fac ilitate
any desired posture. The generalized coordinates for each joint are den oted as qi
(i = 1, 2, ..., N ).
Generation of motion: The system models motion from time t = 0 to t = T .
Initial and final positions of qi are qi,s at t = 0 and qi,e at t = T , respectively. The
position of qi at any given time t (0 ≤t ≤T ) follows the function gi(t):
qi(t) = qi,s + gi(t)(qi,e −qi,s ) (16)
The function gi(t), bound between 0 and 1, starts at 0 and ends at 1. By modifying
gi(t), the system produces diverse motions using B-splines for inte rpolation with C
control points. The system adjusts the y coordinate yi,k for each control point to
optimize motion, as shown in Figure
5.
Fig. 5 Control points and their trajectory over time with C = 2 illustrate varied paths by adjusting
yi,k .
Dynamic Perception: This study integrates the concept of dynamic perception
(Smith et al. 2022) to deduce surprise from motion, which involves esti mating the
state sτ from momentary observations oτ . Here, t represents the current time, and τ
the estimated time, aiming to infer sτ for all τ at each t. The generative model and
probability distributions are described using linear algebra term s.
9
s ≜ q(s), A ≜ p(o|s), D = p(s) (17)
where s represents the estimated state (perception), A the observation model, and D
the prior distribution.
This system is designed to infer the actual motion state based on observed motions,
considering the position qi, velocity ˙qi, and acceleration ¨qi of each element. For N ele-
ments, this results in a total of 3N states. The inference process specifically highlights
the position qi as an illustrative example.
The procedure entails observing motion over T seconds at a specific frame rate
(fps), thereby inferring sτ for all T ×fps steps. It employs the state transition model
Bτ = p(sτ |sτ − 1) to account for changes in qi. The factor graph, which encompasses
state transitions, is depicted in Figure 6. This perception process, which involves
both the state s and the observation o, is classified as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP).
Fig. 6 Dynamic perception’s generative model updates the state sτ via the transition model B and
captures observation oτ through A.
The motion states are discretized into Ns levels, with both sτ and oτ represented
as column vectors comprising Ns elements. For oτ , one element is assigned a value of
1, while the remaining elements are set to 0. The observation model, d enoted as A,
is an Ns ×Ns matrix. Each element within this matrix follows a normal distribut ion
characterized by a variance sl and exhibits peak values at the diagonal elements. The
formula for each Aij is
Aij = 1√2πsl
exp
[
−(i −j)2
2sl
]
(18)
The state transition model, Bτ , also an Ns ×Ns matrix, follows a normal distribu-
tion with variance sp, peaking at diagonal elements. The formula for Bij is provided.
Bτ remains constant over time:
Bij = 1√ 2πsp

2.2.4 Algorithm Details
The algorithm’s steps are outlined below, with Section 4.3 providing motion equations
and generative model examples.
Deﬁning Structure, Motion Equations, and Motion Start/End Points
For a given structure, we define the system’s Lagrangian L, representing kinetic
minus potential energy, and the external force fi applied by actuators. The Euler-
Lagrange equation describes the motion:
d
dt
( ∂L
∂ ˙qi
)
−∂L
∂qi
= fi (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) (20)
Define starting (qi, s at t = 0) and ending ( qi,e at t = T ) points of motion.
Prior Distribution of Motion P
Defining a prior distribution is crucial for determining surpris e in the context of
motion recognition. This distribution reflects pre-existing beli efs about the state of
the observation target. Motions that are intuitively considered by hum ans based on
the structure of the object serve as the basis for the prior. Hypothese s suggest that
human kinematics, such as walking or arm bending, are optimized to minimize muscle
work (Alexander, 1997)(Maalouf et al., 2016)(Miller et al., 2012). Therefore, motions
that are energy-efficient and minimize muscle exertion are perceiv ed as natural. In
this research, motions that minimize the total actuator work from the begi nning to
the end of the motion sequence are selected as the prior. Work W is calculated using
the formula:
W =
∑
i
( ∫
fidqi
)
(21)
To ascertain the motion qi(t) and compute the left side of equation (20), the
external force fi required by the actuator for the motion qi(t) is identified. The work is
then calculated from fi and qi(t) using Equation (21). MATLAB’s fminunc function
(requiring the Optimization Toolbox), which employs the quasi- Newton method, is
used to find the local minimum that determines the yi,k array minimizing the work
W . Based on yi,k , the motion qi(t) is calculated to construct the prior motion P .
Calculating State sP,τ for Motion P
For motion P , the state sP,τ is calculated for all time steps (1 ≤τ ≤T ×fps).
Marginal Message Passing (MMP) ( Parr et al. , 2019) is utilized for the state calcu-
lation. MMP updates the state sτ using the observation oτ at time t to minimize
variational free energy. After iterating MMP Ni times with observations over T ×fps
steps, the resultant state sτ is established as sP,τ .
Achieving Target Surprise and Variance of Surprise with Desired
Motion L∗
(a) Generating motion K from Control Points
motion K is generated by interpolating control points. Initially, the y coordinates
of control points yL
i,k are set randomly. In subsequent iterations, these points adjust
to minimize loss.
Using motion P as the prior, we calculate the surprise S from observing motion
K. We derive sP,τ for motion P from the calculations in step 3. For motion K, the
12
likelihood at each observation oL,τ is AT oL,τ +ε, where ε is a vector of a small constant
ε. The surprise Sq,τ is computed for each τ (1 ≤τ ≤T ×fps).
Sq,τ = −ln(sP,τ ·(AT oL,τ + ε)) (22)
For each element i, the surprises for velocity S ˙q,τ and acceleration S¨q,τ are cal-
culated. Upon adding these with the surprise for position Sq,τ , we obtain the total
surprise for element i, Si,τ :
Si,τ = Sq,τ + S ˙q,τ + S¨q,τ (23)
Consider the sum of the surprise for all elements i as Sτ :
Sτ =
∑
i
Si,τ (24)
The sum of the surprise for all times τ is used as the surprise S for motion K:
S =
∑
τ
∑
i
Si,τ (25)
The variance of surprise VS is calculated using the formula below, where S is the
average surprise over time:
VS = 1
T ×fps
∑
τ
(Sτ −S)2 (26)
Additionally, the system calculates KLD and BS using sτ, post, determined by the
softmax function σ(·):
KLD = DKL (sP,τ |sτ, post) (27)
BS = DKL (sτ, post|sP,τ ) (28)
The post-observation state sτ, post is derived as follows, incorporating the softmax
function for normalization:
sτ, post = σ(ln sP,τ + ln(AT oL,τ + ε)) (29)
(c) Loss Function Calculation
To measure the difference between the calculated and target values for surprise S
and variance of surprise VS , the loss function E is calculated as follows:
E =

⏐
⏐
S −S∗

⏐

where RS and RVS denote the ranges of possible values forS and VS , reflecting their
maximum and minimum values. The aim is to adjust the control points of mot ion K
to minimize E. Optimization employs MATLAB’s particleswarm function (requiring
the Optimization Toolbox), starting with randomly determined particle positions. The
optimized control points yield the motion L∗ .

3 Experiment
3.1 Objective
The aim of this study is to validate the formulations of curiosity and interest proposed
through a subject experiment. This experiment leverages motions ge nerated by the
system and is divided into two parts: a subjective evaluation sess ion (Session 1) and
an eye-tracking session (Session 2).
3.2 Linking Experimental and Theoretical Hypotheses
3.2.1 Subjective Evaluation Session
This session assesses ”interestingness” and ”clarity” as measures for interest, with
”engagement” serving as the metric for evaluating curiosity. Graf (2015) pos its that
interest arises from uncertainty that can be resolved, whereas unre solved uncertainty
results in confusion. Observations characterized by high uncertainty are likely to induce
confusion (
Graf and Landwehr, 2015)(Yanagisawa et al., 2023). Therefore, both ”inter-
estingness” and ”clarity” are critical in assessing interest. The geometric mean of these
two factors is utilized to evaluate interest in this experiment.
3.2.2 Eye-tracking Session
The hypothesis for the eye-tracking session (S2-H1) posits a correlati on between
gaze duration and ”interestingness” as assessed in the subjective ses sion. Participants
are presented with a choice between two motions, with the underly ing assump-
tion that gaze duration reflects preference (
Shimojo et al. , 2003)(Krajbich et al. ,
2010)(Glaholt and Reingold , 2011). Motions regarded as ”interesting” will attract
longer gaze durations, thereby establishing gaze duration as a reliable me asure of
”interestingness.”
3.3 Experimental Hypotheses
The experimental hypotheses are in harmony with the theoretical hypotheses outlined
in Section 2.5, designed to empirically test the concepts of curiosit y and interest as
formulated.
3.3.1 Subjective Evaluation Session
• S1-H1: For surprise S in motion,
1. ”Interestingness” evaluation monotonically increases with surpris e.
2. ”Clarity” evaluation monotonically increases with surprise.
3. The geometric mean of ”interestingness” and ”clarity” evaluations show s an
inverted U-shape, indicating a peak interest level.
• S1-H2: Motions with greater variance in surprise ( VS ) are perceived as more
engaging than those with less variance.
14
• S1-H3: Motions under conditions of low variance in the likelihood function ( sl)
receive higher ratings in ”interestingness” and ”clarity,” compared with those under
high variance conditions.
3.3.2 Eye-tracking Session
• S2-H1: Gaze duration monotonically increases with surprise.
3.4 Sample
Leveraging the system delineated in Chapter 3, we generated 16 motion anim ations
spanning eight surprise levels ( S, ranging from 1 to 8) and under two surprise vari-
ance conditions ( VS , high and low). These motions, presented with either a large or
small observation variance (sl), yielded a total of 32 variations. The process of sample
generation conforms to the algorithm specified in Section 3.3.
3.4.1 Deﬁnition of Target Values for Surprise and Variance of
Surprise
This study sets the target values for surprise S by dividing the interval from Smin =
3. 9 ×105 to Smax = 4. 0 ×105 into eight equal parts, ranging from levels 1 to 8. It
establishes the minimum and maximum surprise values as follows:
(a) To generate motion K, this study adds a pseudo-random number from a normal
distribution N(0, σ ), with mean 0 and variance σ, to each control point yP
i,k from
motion P , as detailed in Section 4.3.4. The formula for the control points yL
i,k of
motion K is:
yL
i,k = yP
i,k + N(0, σ ) (31)
(b) It calculates the surprise for changes in σ from 0.01 to 0.5, with increments of
1. 0 ×10− 3.
(c) The range of surprise values is rounded to two significant figures.
Figure
8 displays the plot of surprise S, KLD, BS, and IG for motion K, fol-
lowing the methodologies previously outlined. The study segments the target values
for the variance of surprise VS into eight equal parts, extending from VS, min,s = 40 to
VS, max,s = 200 under low-variance conditions, and from VS, min,l = 60 to VS, max,l = 400
under high-variance conditions. Figure 9 depicts the plot of surprise S and the vari-
ance of surprise VS , with the target values for the variance of surprise delineated by a
blue line for low variance scenarios and a red line for high variance condi tions.
Additionally, the study defines the range of surpriseRS utilized in the loss function
E, as shown in equation (32):
RS = Smax −Smin = 4. 0 ×105 −3. 9 ×105 = 1. 0 ×104 (32)
and for the range of variance of surprise RVS , we use
RVS = VS, max,l −VS, min,s = 400 −40 = 360 (33)

3.4.2 Deﬁnition of Structure and Motion Equations
This experiment focuses on the motion of a two-degree-of-freedom mani pulator, illus-
trated in Figure
10. This mechanism comprises two rigid rods, designated as 1 and
2, connected by a rotational joint that permits movement within a plane . In this
experiment, we generate motions with various surprises. These range from simple to
complex, originating from a single structure. We required the stru cture to be sim-
ple yet capable of allowing complex motions when selecting it. We cons idered the
two-degree-of-freedom manipulator suitable for this requirement. Al though this is a
complex system with nonlinear dynamics characteristics, it has a re latively simple
structure.
Rod 1 is characterized by a length l1 and mass m1, whereas rod 2 has a length
l2 and mass m2. The orientation of rods 1 and 2 relative to the horizontal plane
is denoted by angles θ1 and θ2, respectively. Motors positioned at the base of each
rod, with origin O for rod 1 and its counterpart for rod 2, exert torques τ1 and τ2.
16
Disregarding the effect of gravity, the equations governing the motion of this system
are delineated as follows:

3.4.3 Deﬁnition of the Start and End Points of the Motion
This study sets the motion’s starting angles at θ1,s = θ2,s = π
2 and the ending angles
at θ1,e = θ2,e = −3π
2 . The motion spans T = 5 s, aiming for a complete clockwise
rotation from the 12 o’clock position within this duration. The analysis u ses a 30 fps
frame rate.
3.4.4 Determining the Prior Distribution of Motion
For the system outlined, the experiment adopts a uniform circular m otion as the
basis for the prior distribution of motion P . It discretizes the potential states and
observations of the motion into 30 levels ( Ns = 30). Utilizing MATLAB’s fminunc
function, the initial y coordinates of the control points array (encompassing 9 points ×
2 elements) were derived using pseudo-random numbers. The values at the extremities,
specifically 0 and 1, were set as fixed points.
y1 = [0 0. 5508 0. 7081 0. 2909 0. 5108 0. 8963 0. 1256 0. 2072 1] (36)
y2 = [0 0. 0515 0. 4408 0. 0299 0. 4568 0. 2785 0. 6763 0. 5909 1] (37)
17
3.4.5 Determining the State for motion P at All Times
For motion P , the state (perception) sP,τ is determined at each time step over a
duration of 5 s at 30 fps, resulting in 150 steps. Figure
11 illustrates the generative
model for dynamic perception and the computed states sP,τ . The observation model
A = p(o|s), shown in (a), aligns states s with its columns and observations o with its
rows. The state transition model Bτ = p(sτ |sτ − 1), depicted in (b), organizes previous
states sτ − 1 in its columns and subsequent states sτ in its rows. The depiction of
state sP,τ in (c) arranges time in columns and states at specific times in rows. Th e
observation model A’s variance for computing P ’s state is set at slP = 1, and the state
transition model Bτ ’s variance is sp = 1.

and (c) the state sP,τ
3.4.6 Determining the Desired motion with Speciﬁc Surprise and
Variance of Surprise
Figure 12 demonstrates motion L∗ , which results from modulating the surprise S
across eight levels and the variance of surpriseVS across two levels. The level of surprise
S is at its lowest at level 1 and reaches its peak at level 8. A high level of s urprise
in motions signifies notable departures from the baseline motion P , characterized by
unconventional alterations in the joint angles and positions.

eight levels and the variance of the surprise VS to two levels.

3.4.7 Diﬀerences in Display Methods According to the Variance of
Observation
This study alters the animation display method based on the variance of observation
sl. Table1 presents the differences in the display methods. For lowsl (less uncertainty),
the rod appears black for better visibility, includes markings for e asier position recog-
nition, and uses a higher frame rate for clearer motion tracking. For high sl (greater
uncertainty), the rod turns gray to diminish visibility, lacks markings, and adopts a
lower frame rate. Figure 13 displays these variations.
Figure 14 illustrates the S and VS values for motion L∗ under different sl condi-
tions. For high sl conditions (red), it recalculates these values using a variance slL = 2
in the observation model, contrasted with low sl conditions (blue) that use a set
variance slL = 1, aligning the S and VS values with their target ranges.

the size of the variance sl of an observation

3.6 Environment
The experiment was conducted in rooms 72B2 and 72A4 of the Engineering Bui lding
No. 2, Hongo Campus, University of Tokyo, within the Department of Mechani-
cal Engineering’s Design Engineering Laboratory. The setup featured a c hair and
desk, housing a notebook computer (Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 with a 15.0-i nch,
W1920× H1080 resolution display). A partition was placed to separate participants
from the experimenter. An eye tracker (Tobii Pro Nano) was positioned be low the
computer’s display, aligned with desk markers. Participants were seated in a chair
positioned using floor markers, ensuring a distance of 60 cm between their eyes and the
eye tracker. Earmuffs were provided to participants to minimize d istractions. Figure
15 provides an illustration of the setup.
Participants interacted with a webpage on the laptop, which was develop ed using
React.js, for all procedures. Tasks were guided via automated voice pr ompts.

3.7 Procedure
3.7.1 Overview
Participants underwent Sessions 1 and 2 consecutively, with the e ntire experiment
lasting approximately 60 minutes. The presentation order of samples was randomized,
and counterbalancing was employed in Session 2 to determine the placement of samples
on the screen.
1. Session 1
(a) Introduction of procedure and guidelines.
(b) Conduct 3 practice and 16 main trials as per the steps below. To red uce partic-
ipant fatigue, a 1-min break is provided after the first eight trials of t he main
trials.
(i) Display two motion types (P and one with high surprise) for 5 secon ds. Use
the same two motions for all trials.
(ii) (ii) After the screen changes and the evaluative stimulus fhas b een observed
or 5 s, rate the motion on a 5-point scale based on
(A) Predictability (ease of trajectory anticipation)
(B) Confusion (difficulty in comprehension)
(C) Engagement (desire to continue watching)
(D) Monotony (lack of variety)
(E) Interest (memorability and appeal)
2. Intermission (5 minutes)
3. Session 2
(a) Procedure briefing.
(b) The eye tracker is calibrated. The functions provided by Tobii Pro Lab are
used for the calibration. During calibration, the experimenter ins tructs the
participants to focus on the points that appear sequentially on the scr een.
(c) Conduct eye-tracking for 3 practice and 60 main trials. To reduce p articipant
fatigue, a 30-s break is provided every 10 trials during the main trial s. Conclude
eye-tracking post all trials.
(i) Compare the two motions displayed on the left and right sides of the screen
and select which one feels more “interesting” by pressing a key on th e key-
board (press F for the left option or J for the right). Because the duration
of each motion is 5 s, participants can respond after the motions have been
displayed for 5 s.
4. Survey
(a) Following the presentation of 16 motion types, answer questions regar ding:
(i) Non-clockwise motion associations.
(ii) If applicable, describe the motion(s) and the associated thought s.
(iii) Indicate if such associations influenced your evaluations.
21
3.7.2 Instructions
Participants were informed that the sample motions replicated ”motions of a vir-
tual needle on a wristwatch,” as illustrated in Figure
16. This instruction aimed to
refine their interpretations to the intended motions and mitigate un intended associa-
tions. This approach served two purposes: first, to ensure that motions were perceived
as intended, and second, to minimize the impact of personal preferen ces stemming
from unfamiliarity with ”a virtual needle on a wristwatch.” Familiar ob jects are often
preferred, a phenomenon known as the mere exposure effect ( Moreland and Zajonc ,
1982).

3.8 Analysis
3.8.1 Session 1
In Session 1, a 5-point Likert scale following the Semantic Differenti al (SD) method
(
Osgood et al. , 1957) was used to evaluate ”predictability,” ”clarity,” ”engagement,”
”monotony,” and ”interest” of motions. The evaluative terms and corresponding emo-
tions are detailed in Table 2. Subjective evaluations were normalized (Z-score) within
each participant.
For step 4 of the questionnaire, evaluations influenced by associations were
excluded, and these responses were treated as missing data. MATLAB’s mvregress
function (requiring the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox), utilizing the ’mvn’
algorithm for multivariate normal maximum likelihood estimation, was used to impute
missing values.
3.8.2 Session 2
In Session 2, the analysis focused on measuring gaze duration towards the displayed
samples on both sides until participants pressed a key. Gaze times w ere calculated for
specified hatched areas on each side separately, as depicted in Figure
17. Gaze point
coordinates time series data (averaging left and right eyes) were col lected using Tobii
Pro Lab software. To exclude the results of trials where gaze points coul d not be
22
measured, trials where the total gaze time on the left and right mesh part s was less
than 4 s were excluded from the aggregation.
Analysis in both sessions was conducted using SPSS Statistics softwar e.

emotions, and the format of the scale (bipolar or unipolar)

the left and right of each sample, with coordinates recorded in pixels.
4 Results
Error bars in the figures represent the 95% confidence interval. The C I is calculated
by multiplying the standard error of the data (using normalized 5-poin t rating values
per subject in Session 1 and the proportion of gaze time on the left and righ t sides
of the screen in Session 2) by 1.96. The symbols ”*”, ”**”, and ”***” in figures and
tables indicate significance levels at p < . 05, p < . 01, and p < . 001, respectively.

4.1.1 S1-H1: The Eﬀect of Surprise on Interest Evaluation
S1-H1(a) Relationship between Surprise and ”Interestingness” Evalu ation
Figure
18 presents a scatter plot of motion surprise levels (1–8) along the x-axis against
the ”interestingness” evaluation on the y-axis, categorized by the vari ance of surprise
(high/low).
23
A three-way ANOVA was conducted for a between-subjects design on these evalu-
ations, considering surprise level S (1–8), variance of surprise VS (high/low), and the
likelihood function variance sl (high/low) as factors. Table 3 presents the ANOVA
results for ”interestingness.” The findings reveal a significant main effect where ”inter-
estingness” increases with surprise (F = 42. 4, p < . 001). Additionally, a trend indicates
higher ”interestingness” under highVS and low sl conditions, suggesting an interaction
between VS and sl (F = 7. 4, p < . 01), further explored in hypothesis S1-H1(a) and
illustrated in Figure 22. No significant effects or interactions were noted for VS alone.
Post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s method was applied to the surpris e levels exhibiting
significant main effects. In this experiment, surprise was definedusing eight levels. The
Tukey test is a method that does not reduce the power of detection e ven with com-
parisons of five or more groups, and it is consistent with the assumptions of ANOVA
(homogeneity of variances, normality), making it an appropriate method for post-hoc
testing.
Table 4 organizes levels of surprise into subsets based on the absence of signi ficant
differences in ”interestingness” evaluations within each subset. Levels within a subset,
such as 3 and 5 in subset 3, show no significant difference in ”interest ingness,” while
levels across different subsets, such as 2 and 3, differ significantly. The subsets, ranked
by increasing ”interestingness,” are 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 4, 8, 6, and 8, 6, 7, derived fr om
”homogeneous subgroups” identified by SPSS. This grouping supports the hypothesis
S1-H1(a) that ”interestingness” increases with surprise.

Table 4 Subsets of Levels of Surprise for the Evaluation of
”Interestingness.”
A three-way ANOVA was conducted to examine these evaluations, with fac tors
including surprise level S, variance of surprise VS , and likelihood function variance
sl. Table 5 demonstrates that ”clarity” decreases as surprise increases ( F = 71. 7, p <
. 001), with greater variance in surprise further reducing ”clarity” (F = 29. 8, p < . 001).
Additionally, an interaction suggests a decline in ”clarity” with surprise that intensifies
at higher VS levels (F = 12. 9, p < . 001). This interaction between S and VS was an
unexpected result considering our hypothesis. Table 6 lists the surprise level subsets,
ordered by decreasing ”clarity,” as 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1.
Simple main effects tests, using the Bonferroni method, were performed to examine
the variance of surprise at specific levels of surprise, with findin gs detailed in Table 7.
These tests revealed significant differences in ”clarity” evaluations: at surprise levels 3,
7, and 8, low variance conditions yielded higher ”clarity” than high variance conditions
(p < . 001 for levels 3 and 8;p < . 01 for level 7). Interestingly, at level 4, a high variance
of surprise led to higher ”clarity” than a low variance ( p < . 05).
This result underscores the main effect that ”clarity” evaluations de crease with
increasing surprise, aligning with hypothesis S1-H1(b).
S1-H1(c) Geometric Mean of ”Interestingness” and ”Clarity” Evalua-
tions Relative to Surprise Figure 20 illustrates the geometric mean of ”interest-
ingness” and ”clarity” evaluations plotted against surprise levels. A q uadratic simple
regression analysis, with surprise level as the independent variab le and the geometric
mean of evaluations as the dependent variable, was conducted. The derived regression
equation, Y = −0. 402 + 0. 312X −0. 039X2, explains a significant portion of vari-
ance (R2 = . 79), as shown in Table 8. ANOVA confirmed the regression’s significance
25

ance of Surprise.
Table 5 The Three-Way ANOVA Table for the Evaluation of ”Clarity.”
(F = 9. 4, p < . 05), with the quadratic term b2 being notably negative and significant
(p < . 05).
These findings validate the significant regression relationship and theimpact of the
quadratic term, supporting hypothesis S1-H1(c) on the relationship be tween surprise
and the combined evaluations of ”interestingness” and ”clarity.”
4.1.2 S1-H2: Impact of Surprise Variance on Curiosity Evaluation
Figure
21 illustrates ”engagement” (a measure of curiosity) plotted against motion
surprise levels, distinguishing between high and low variance of s urprise. A three-way
ANOVA assessed the effects of surprise ( S), variance of surprise ( VS ), and variance
of the likelihood function ( sl) on ”engagement.” According to Table 9, ”engagement”
increases with surprise (F = 38. 9, p < . 001); however, no effects were observed for the
variance of surprise alone.
The absence of significant effects or interactions concerning the variance of surprise
leaves hypothesis S1-H2’s support uncertain.

4.1.3 S1-H3: Likelihood Function Variance’s Impact on the
Evaluations of Interest and Curiosity
This analysis explores how the variance of the likelihood function aff ects “interesting-
ness” and “clarity.”
(a) ”Interestingness” (Interest) Evaluation Figures 22 and 23 display ”inter-
estingness” evaluations against surprise levels under high and low variance of surprise
conditions, further categorized by the likelihood function’s vari ance (high/low). Table
3, from section S1-H1(a), indicates that ”interestingness” increases wi th surprise
(F = 42 . 5, p < . 001). An interaction suggests that under high variance of surprise,
lower variance of the likelihood function enhances ”interestingness” (F = 7. 4, p < . 01).
This interaction between S and VS was an unexpected result consideri ng our hypoth-
esis. No effects were found for the variance of the likelihood functi on alone or its
interactions with surprise.
Simple main effects tests, using the Bonferroni method, explored the impact of the
likelihood function’s variance at established levels of surprise variance, as detailed in
Table 10. These tests indicated that lower variance of the likelihood func tion notably

”Interestingness” and ”Clarity” in Relation to Surprise.
enhances ”interestingness” evaluations under high variance of surprise conditions (p <
. 01), as depicted in Figure 24.
This finding, demonstrating the likelihood function’s variance eff ect on ”interest-
ingness” in scenarios of high surprise variance, lends partial support to hypothesis
S1-H3(a).
(b) ”Clarity” Evaluation (Interest)
Figure

(high/low). Similarly, Figure 26 plots ”clarity” evaluations under the conditions of low
variance of surprise.
The previously mentioned ANOVA for ”clarity” evaluation, shown in Table5 from
S1-H1(b), did not identify any significant main effects or interactions in volving the
likelihood function’s variance and other factors.
The absence of clear effects or interactions with the likelihood fun ction’s variance
leaves the support for hypothesis S1-H3(b) uncertain.

significant main effect of surprise on gaze duration ( F = 22. 9, p < . 001), supported by

with higher levels of surprise, aligning with hypothesis S2-H1.

5 Discussion
5.1 Correlation of Results with Hypotheses
This study sought to investigate the impact of motion design on user curi osity and
interest. Theoretical hypotheses proposed were:
• H1: Interest in surprise S follows an inverted U-shaped curve.
• H2: Variations in surprise VS around the optimal arousal point SIG enhance
curiosity.
32
Table 11 The Two-Way ANOVA Table for Gaze Duration.
Table 12 Subsets of Levels of Surprise for Gaze Duration.
• H3: Lower variance in the likelihood function sl heightens interest and curiosity.
The experimental findings for each hypothesis are reviewed below, e xamining their
alignment with the initial hypotheses.
5.1.1 H1: Optimal Surprise Maximizes Interest
Experimental hypotheses S1-H1 and S2-H1 tested the theoretical hypoth esis H1, sug-
gesting that interest in surprise S peaks at an optimal level, forming an inverted
U-shaped curve.
Subjective evaluations of interest combined ”interestingness” and ”clarity” into a
geometric mean. The findings showed ”interestingness” increases wi th surprise lev-
els, confirming S1-H1(a), and ”clarity” decreases with surprise, supp orting S1-H1(b).
These results align with studies by
Silvia (2005) and Berlyne (1970), which found
that interest evaluations increase with high novelty or complexity i n visual stimuli
(polygons). Moreover, the combined mean of ”interestingness” and ”clari ty” exhib-
ited a significantly upward-convex function against surprise levels, affirming S1-H1(c)
and indicating that an optimal level of surprise maximizes interest. This outcome
is consistent with research by G¨ u¸ cl¨ ut¨ urk et al.(2016), Hung and Chen (2012), and
Hekkert et al. (2003), confirming that preference evaluations form an inverted U-shape
in response to the novelty and complexity of visual stimuli.
Eye-tracking results mirrored the subjective findings on ”intere stingness,” with
increased gaze duration correlating with heightened surprise. Eye t racking, known for
its objective reflection of participants’ internal states, further reinforces the support
for H1.
33
5.1.2 H2: Optimal Surprise Level Enhances Curiosity
Experimental hypothesis S1-H2 investigated theoretical hypothesisH2, proposing that
curiosity peaks at the optimal surprise level SIG .
Subjective evaluations of “engagement,” indicative of curiosity, show ed no sig-
nificant effects or interactions with surprise variance, leaving th e support for H2
ambiguous. The absence of clear findings might be due to individual diffe rences in
evaluation.
5.1.3 H3: Reduced Likelihood Variance Elevates Interest and
Curiosity
Experimental hypothesis S1-H3 examined theoretical hypothesis H3, su ggesting that
a reduced variance in the likelihood function sl enhances interest and curiosity.
Regarding “interestingness,” an interaction was observed between su rprise vari-
ance VS and likelihood function variance sl, with significant effects at high surprise
variance levels indicating that reduced sl enhances evaluations, partially supporting
S1-H3(a). To the best of our knowledge, no existing research has directly addressed the
effect of observational accuracy on the evaluation of interest. Through both our devel-
oped mathematical model and experiments, our results partially indi cate that higher
accuracy in the observation of motions tends to increase the evaluation of i nterest.
However, ”clarity” evaluations revealed no significant effects or inter actions con-
cerning sl, echoing the ambiguity in H2’s support. This inconsistency could again b e
due to individual differences in evaluation.
5.2 Analysis of Individual Diﬀerences
Individual differences, such as emotions, experiences, and cultu ral backgrounds, sig-
nificantly influence subjective evaluation outcomes (
Paulhus and Vazire, 2007). These
variations might account for the lack of main effects or interactions in hypot heses
H2 and H3. Cluster analysis was used to categorize participants according to their
response patterns, reassessing the existence of main effects and in teractions. The
analysis also considers factors in evaluative terms where interaction s were noted.
Using hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward’s method) ( Borgen and Barnett , 1987),
we classified participants based on their responses to ”interesting ness,” ”clarity,” and
”engagement” for hypotheses S1-H2 and S1-H3. The analysis was conducted separately
for odd and even-numbered participants, aligning with the between -subjects design,
to group participants by response tendencies.
5.2.1 Participant Classiﬁcation by “Interestingness” Evaluation
Tendency
Figure
28 illustrates a dendrogram organizing participants based on their “intere st-
ingness” evaluation tendencies. Clusters divided by the red lin e denote majority and
minority groups, with corresponding subjective evaluation plots against surprise levels
depicted in Figures 29 (high variance of surprise) and30 (low variance of surprise). The
34
minority cluster, identified by wider error bars (95% confidence int ervals), indicates
greater individual response variability compared with the majority c luster.
An ANOVA conducted solely on the majority cluster, considering the fac tors
surprise S, variance of surprise VS , and variance of the likelihood function sl, as pre-
sented in Table 13, reveals an amplified main effect of surprise ( F = 54. 4, p < . 001).
Furthermore, a new interaction suggests heightened “interestingne ss” evaluations at
lower surprise levels with increased variance of surprise ( F = 2 . 4, p < . 05). The
interaction between variance of surprise and likelihood function v ariance diminishes
(F = 5. 4, p < . 05), with no confirmed main effect observed for the likelihood functi on
variance.

5.2.2 Classiﬁcation of Participants Based on “Clarity” Evaluation
Tendency
Figure 31 displays a dendrogram organizing participants based on their “clarity” eval-
uation tendencies, with clusters divided at the red line. The re lationship between
surprise level and “clarity” evaluation for both majority and minority c lusters is
depicted in Figures 32 (high variance of surprise) and 33 (low variance of surprise).
The minority cluster, indicated by broader error bars (95% confidence i ntervals),
demonstrates a wider range of individual responses than the majority c luster.
Focusing on the majority cluster, a three-factor ANOVA was conducted , consid-
ering surprise S, variance of surprise VS , and likelihood function variance sl. Table
14 presents the results of the “clarity” evaluation ANOVA, highlighting a s tronger
main effect of surprise ( F = 54 . 4, p < . 001) compared with the findings from pre-
cluster analysis (Table 5). A new interaction indicates that higher variance of surprise
at lower surprise levels (levels 1, 2, 3, 4) tends to enhance “clarity” evaluations
(F = 2. 4, p < . 05). The interaction between variance of surprise and likelihood fun c-
tion variance is less pronounced ( F = 5 . 4, p < . 05), with no significant main effect
observed for the likelihood function variance.

5.2.3 Participant Classiﬁcation by “Engagement” Evaluation
Tendency
Figure 34 depicts a dendrogram categorizing participants based on their “engagement”
evaluation tendencies. Subjective evaluations against surprise levels for both majority
and minority clusters are illustrated in Figure 35. Focusing on the majority cluster,
a three-factor ANOVA assessed the effects of surprise S, variance of surprise VS , and
likelihood function variance sl. Table 15 presents the results of the “engagement” eval-
uation for the majority cluster. This analysis reveals a stronger main e ffect of surprise
(F = 46. 7, p < . 001) compared with the initial ANOVA findings (Table 9), along with
a newly confirmed main effect indicating that variance of surprise enh ances “engage-
ment” evaluations ( F = 3. 9, p < . 05). These results provide support for hypothesis
S1-H2, suggesting that variations in surprise significantly impact engageme nt.

5.3 Surprise and Variance of Surprise Interaction
Post-cluster analysis identified specific interactions influenci ng “interestingness” and
“clarity” evaluations concerning surprise levels and variance. Regard ing “interest-
ingness,” greater variance of surprise amplified evaluations in low-su rprise zones,
indicating heightened engagement. Conversely, “clarity” evaluations in high surprise
zones improved with a lower variance of surprise, suggesting reduced confusion. These
observations align with the exploration cycle model introduced in Se ction 2.

group based on the evaluation tendency of ”engagement.”

surprise. (a) Represents the evaluation of participants be longing to the majority (right side) cluster,
while (b) represents those in the minority (left side) clust er.
Figure 36, adapted from Section 2’s exploration cycle model (Figure 3), illustrates
the roles of diffusive and specific curiosity across varying surprise levels. This model
portrays diffusive curiosity, which favors increased surprise,as dominant in low surprise
regions, while specific curiosity, which prefers reduced surprise, prevails in high surprise
zones. The diagram highlights the range of fluctuation in surprise based on its variance,
demonstrating that a larger variance introduces broader surprise dyn amics during
motion appreciation.
In terms of “interestingness,” the preference for heightened surprise in low-surprise
zones leads to motions with greater variance being perceived as more engaging, offering
potential for peak surprise moments. However, in high surprise zones , the “interest-
ingness” evaluation tends to stabilize, suggesting a plateau effect regardless of surprise
variance.
39
For “clarity,” the desire for reduced surprise in high-surprise z ones implies that
excessive variance may introduce confusion due to abrupt peaks in s urprise. In con-
trast, in low-surprise zones where increased surprise is desirable, the impact of variance
on “clarity” evaluation appears negligible, as evaluations generally remain l ow.

5.4 Variance of Surprise and Likelihood Function Variance
Interaction
An interaction between the variance of surprise VS and the likelihood function vari-
ance sl significantly influenced “interest” evaluations, both before and after cluster
analysis. Particularly, under high VS conditions, a reduced sl variance correlated with
higher “interest” ratings. This section delves into the factors cont ributing to this
phenomenon.
Initial analysis highlights responses related to “predictability” across varying levels
of surprise, as depicted in Figure 37. Findings from a three-way ANOVA (as shown
in Table 16) reveal a significant increase in “unpredictability” with rising s urprise
levels ( p < . 001), enhanced “unpredictability” with greater VS (p < . 001), and a
notable interaction where “unpredictability” sharply rises with surprise under high VS
conditions (p < . 001). The focus here lies on the observation that a higher VS renders
motions more unpredictable.
To elucidate this interaction, two key observations are considered: 1. Predictable
motions, characterized by fewer abrupt changes, allow for some level of an ticipation
even with lower observational accuracy. 2. Unpredictable motions, fille d with intri-
cate or sudden movements, challenge prediction efforts under reduc ed observational
accuracy.
High observational accuracy enables accurate motion anticipation, regardless of
surprise variance. However, as observational accuracy diminishes, acc urately predict-
ing motions with high surprise variance becomes challenging, impactin g the perceived
“interestingness” of the motion. In contrast, motions with low surprise variance main-
tain their predictability even under lower observational accuracy, demonstrating no

significant change in perceived “interestingness.” Table 17 outlines these dynamics,
highlighting how observational accuracy impacts motion inference differently based on
surprise variance.

5.5 Limitations
In discussing the limitations of our experiment, we must acknowle dge potential biases
and methodological constraints.
5.5.1 Biases
Selection Bias in Participants : Our participant pool was limited to students from
the University of Tokyo. These students may have different levels of education and
knowledge than the general population. This difference could affect the ir subjective
evaluation standards. The results might reflect the characteristics of a younger age
group. This group consists only of individuals in their late teens to tw enties. Future
studies should include participants with diverse attributes. This diversity will enhance
the generalizability of the findings. Sample Selection Bias : There are many motions
that achieve the same level of surprise. These motions are generated bas ed on opti-
mization parameters. The parameters include initial values and adjust ment weight
coefficients. In this experiment, we used motions from specific in itial values as evalua-
tive stimuli. Future studies should increase the sample size. T hey should also conduct
evaluation experiments. These experiments should use motions generated with varying
initial values. Structural Selection Bias : This study was conducted using a two-
degree-of-freedom manipulator. It should be explored whether the system can generate
interesting motions in other structures, such as continuous beams or spring-loaded
mechanisms.
5.5.2 Constraints
Determining the Optimal Surprise Level : The optimal level of surprise for
maximizing interest can only be experimentally determined. Howe ver, based on the
assumption that the mathematical model is correct, the optimal surprise can be deter-
mined according to the variance in observations and predictions within the generative
model. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 20, the maximum evaluation of inter est occurred
at level 4 (S = 3. 94×105). Therefore, values for sp (variance of the prior distribution)
and sl (variance of the observation) can be determined to maximize the curve in Fig.
8 at S = 3. 94×105. By setting these parameters set in advance, it becomes possible to
predict the optimal level of surprise in other structures. Presentation of the Struc-
ture: In this study, we presented the motions of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator
as clockwork (designed motions). However, we did not explored respons es to motions
presented as human or character-like with implied intentions. System Dynamics :
When generating motions, it is necessary to describe the system’s equation of motion.
Consequently, users of the system need to have knowledge of Newtoni an mechanics.

6 Conclusion
6.1 Comprehensive Discussion
In this study, we aimed to model the curiosity and interest elici ted by motions and
identify the conditions under which curiosity and interest are he ightened. The exper-
imental results revealed that motions with a moderate level of surpr ise (prediction
error) maximize interest, motions with a high variance in surprise i ncrease curiosity,
and higher observational accuracy enhances interest evaluations even wh en the same
motions are shown. These results are consistent with the predicti ons of the developed
model.
Additionally, this study introduces a motion generation system capabl e of inde-
pendently adjusting surprise and its variance, tailored to specifi c structures and
constraints. Reflecting on the experimental outcomes, we outline ke y considerations
for the system’s future enhancement.
6.1.1 Estimation of the Optimal Arousal Level
The system necessitates users to define the surprise target for gen erated motions,
prompting a search for the optimal level of arousal that maximizes intere st relative to
the structure.
Our interest model indicates that the optimal arousal level depends on the vari-
ance of the prior distribution sp and the likelihood function variance sl. Assuming
sl remains constant across various structures and motions, the optimal arousal level
primarily fluctuates with sp. This variance likely mirrors the observer’s familiarity or
comprehension of the structure during motion observation. For well-known or straight-
forward structures, the prior distribution’s variance might be smal l (indicating strong
beliefs), whereas for novel or complex structures, it could be large r (indicating weaker
beliefs).
Developing a model to predict how structure influences sp could facilitate the
estimation of the optimal arousal level based on structure alone. Such advan cements
would enable the creation of motions designed to optimally engage interest, leveraging
the estimated optimal arousal level.
6.1.2 Integrating Structure into Automatic Motion Generation
This research conceptualized motion design as the crafting of behavior and structure
to meet both functional and emotional objectives. We emphasized the s ignificance of
designing motions that evoke curiosity by prompting users to questi on the motion
mechanism. This approach highlights the crucial role of structure in au gmenting the
emotional impact of motion design. Initially centered on optimizing beh avior within
predefined structures, expanding the system to include structural design is anticipated
to widen the spectrum of attainable motions.
6.2 Future Work
As mentioned in Section 5, the developed system and experiments cond ucted in this
study have biases and constraints. Gathering participants with div erse attributes and
43
conducting larger-scale experiments on various behaviors and struct ures can reduce
biases and strengthen the validity of the experimental results. To extend the sys-
tem’s application from industrial products to motions involving comm unication, such
as dance and character animation, it is desirable to theoretically and exp erimentally
determine which factors (such as lifelikeness or empathy with a mot ion) generate
interest and curiosity when presenting samples as biological motions. Deviations from
the predicted results should also be considered. To formulate the empathy felt from
a motion that involves the transmission of intentions, it is necessary to consider
generative models of both the self and the other.
6.3 Summary
Experimental findings suggest that to engender interest among users, motions should
deviate slightly from those typically associated with a given struct ure. To ignite user
curiosity, generating motions characterized by notable variations in prediction error is
beneficial. This motion generation system empowers designers to craft product motions
that optimally surprise users, guided by a clear goal.
The insights on curiosity and interest gleaned from this study provide a framework
for designers and engineers in product motion design, aiming to captivate user interest.
Furthermore, based on these insights, the developed system is env isioned as a sup-
portive tool for designers, promising the generation of emotionally engagin g motions,
accessible even to those with limited design experience or motion d esign expertise.
