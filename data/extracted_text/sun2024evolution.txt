Abstract: How did the complex structure of the telencephalon evolve? Existing explanations are
based on phenomena and lack a first-principles account. The Darwinian dynamics and endogenous
network theory—established decades ago—provides a mathematical and theoretical framework
and a general constitutive structure for theory–experiment coupling for answering this question
from a first-principles perspective. By revisiting a gene network that explains the anterior–posterior
patterning of the vertebrate telencephalon, we found that upon increasing the cooperative effect
within this network, fixed points gradually evolve, accompanied by the occurrence of two bifurcations.
The dynamic behavior of this network is informed by the knowledge obtained from experiments
on telencephalic evolution. Our work provides a quantitative explanation for how telencephalon
anterior–posterior patterning evolved from the pre-vertebrate chordate to the vertebrate and provides
a series of verifiable predictions from a first-principles perspective.

1. Introduction
As the material basis of cognitive abilities, the telencephalon results from hundreds of
millions of years of evolution [1–3]. A series of events, like genome duplication and the
emergence of new genes [4,5], the segregation of brain functions and the establishment of
effective connectivity [6–8], increases in core gene network interconnectivity [9], and neu-
ropathway duplication [2], provide phenomenological explanations for how the complex
structure of the telencephalon has evolved to this day. However, just like the research on
celestial motion before the introduction of Newtonian mechanics, these phenomenon-based
explanations lack a fundamental component: a first-principles account.
The free energy principle guides the brain to achieve cognitive optimization through
minimizing prediction errors, providing an explanation for specific instances of brain
function [6,7,10,11]. Recently, some researchers have expressed concerns that research in
the life sciences pays more attention to the experiment, rather than theory–experiment
coupling [12–14], or even features a circling back aspect, at least in cancer research, after
half a century [15]. Indeed, the phenomena of life are full of complexity, and complexity
science itself is a newborn area. The discovery of a first principle in life is bound to be
difficult. Nonetheless, there are fruits borne in this “circle”. Decades after the introduction
of Boolean dynamics into the gene network [16,17], the analysis of the dynamical structure
of the hydrogen model in life science, the phage-λ gene switch [18], provided an example
of the application of a general law, along with a mathematical framework for the evolution
dynamics [19,20]. Following this approach, the ensuing theory provides a general constitu-
tive structure of evolution dynamics at the gene network level. The endogenous network

theory [21] was established years after the introduction to system biology [22] of the land-
scape concept raised by Wright and Waddington, allowing qualitative and quantitative
comparisons between theories and experiments [23,24]. Under these theoretical constructs,
a series of efforts were made to address questions about cancer and development [25]. Now,
we may have an apt mathematical and theoretical framework—as well as the knowledge
obtained from experiments—to address the question of how our brains evolved at the gene
network dynamics level in a first-principles way.
In this work, an attempt is made, by revisiting a pre-constructed model [ 26–28] of
telencephalic anterior–posterior patterning in vertebrates containing 5 nodes and 10 edges,
to demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of such a relatively small network can answer a
key question in evolutionary neurodevelopment, under the mathematical and theoretical
framework described above.
Specifically, based on the above theories and frameworks, we establish a method-
ology to reconstruct plausible evolutionary trajectories, with a focus on the interactions
between the expression of genes relevant to the anterior–posterior patterning of the te-
lencephalon. We used a well-validated theoretical model constructed by Giacomantonio
and Goodhill [26–28], which exhibits relatively clear dynamic behavior. From a dynamical
perspective, we expect a system capable of generating anterior–posterior telencephalon
patterning to have at least two stable attractors, representing the gene-expression profiles at
each of the poles of this axis. In this work, we use Boolean dynamics and modified equation
forms to explore different variants of gene-expression interactions. We find that there are
always two attractors in all variants, which are robust to the equation form, indicating
that small variations in evolution can lead to similar phenomena, with the formation of
anterior–posterior patterning in the telencephalon. Furthermore, through an analysis of
bifurcation patterns in a continuous dynamical system approximating the Boolean dynam-
ics, the evolutionary trajectory is extrapolated back to the telencephalon formed by the
absence of anterior–posterior patterning. Specifically, we assume that evolution changed
the parameters of the gene-expression interaction dynamics and that, at some stage in
evolution, there must have been a bifurcation in these dynamics from one to two stable
attractors to explain the transition to a telencephalon with anterior–posterior patterning.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Boolean Dynamics
For the unaltered function set, we used “AND” to represent activating interaction,
and “NOT” to represent inhibitory interaction. These interactions define causal dynamics
among gene expression. Some examples are given below:
A = Fgf8 A (t + 1) = D (t)
B = Emx2 B (t + 1) = NOT A (t)
C = Pax6 C (t + 1) = A (t) AND (NOT B (t)) AND (NOT E (t))
D = Sp8 D (t + 1) = (NOT B (t)) AND (NOT E (t))
E = Coup-tfi E (t + 1) = (NOT A (t)) AND (NOT C(t)) AND (NOT D (t))
For genomic variants, a variable affected by 1, 2, and 3 variables will result in 1, 2, and
8 equations, respectively. Thus, we generated 1 × 1 × 8 × 2 × 8 = 128 sets of functions. All
variants are presented in the Supplementary Materials.
We iterated the function set with initial vectors until stable, then collected and counted
attractors, attractor types, and basin of attraction sizes. The detailed results are presented
in the Supplementary Materials.
2.2. ODE
The ODE function we used is as follows:
x(1) =Fgf8; dx(1)
dt = −x(1) + k ∗ x(5)h
1 + k ∗ x(5)h

x(5) =Sp8; dx(5)
dt = −x(5) + 1
1 + k ∗

x(3)h + x(4)h

We used Newton’s iteration to obtain fixed points; determined the stability of the fixed
point using the real part of the eigenvalue of its Jacobian matrix; and used Euler’s method
to verify the stable fixed points.
For the vanilla parameter set (h = 3, k = 10), we first used 1000 random initial vectors,
followed by 100,000 random initial vectors, and both resulted in the same fixed points, so
1000 random initial vectors were used to explore the parameter space.
The connection between transition states and stable states was obtained by perturbing
the transition state with a small random vector; in this work, the number of such small
random vectors was 100.
3. Results
3.1. A Coarse-Grained Core Endogenous Network for Telencephalon Already Exists
A Boolean five-node network was constructed, which reproduced the experimentally
observed gradients of the anterior–posterior patterning of early cortical development in
mammals [26,28]. From the perspective of data fitting, the existing experimental data were
not sufficient to uniquely specify the interactions of a base network. And if such a base
network exists, how the latent factors regulate the base network is not clear [26–28].
By way of comparison, Giacomantonio and Goodhill constructed a network with
robust dynamic behavior, which is one of the most important features of the “backbone”
or “core” structure of an endogenous network—shaped by evolution—that we argued
in 2008 is conserved among species during evolution [21,25]. We found that an ortholog
exists in amphioxus, one of the closest living vertebrate relatives that diverged from
the vertebrate lineage around 550 million years ago, in all five genes [ 5,29,30] in this
network. Nevertheless, Benito-Gutiérrez et al. discovered the resemblance of the expression
pattern between the mature amphioxus cerebral vesicle and the developing vertebrate
telencephalon [31]. These facts indicate that the network Giacomantonio and Goodhill
constructed is conserved in the pre-vertebrate chordate and the vertebrate during evolution.
To further confirm the robustness of the model, we generated 128 Boolean function
variations based on the network (Figure 1A) described by Goodhill in 2018 [28] by using
a combination of replacing “AND” with “OR”. With the default operators, two point
attractors which correspond to the expression pattern of the posterior (boole_p1) or anterior
(boole_p2) telencephalon separately, and 2 limit cycles (boole_li7 and boole_li18), were gen-
erated by traversing all initial vectors (Figure 1B). For all Boolean variations, we obtained
26 attractors with 4 point attractors and 22 linear attractors (Figure 1B). Among them, two
attractors, the posterior-like attractor boole_p1 and the anterior-like attractor boole_p2,
were obtained in all Boolean variations (Figure 1E). The proportions of boole_p1 and
boole_p2 were equivalently the most common with more than 36% (Figure 1C–E). These
results further confirmed the robustness of the Boolean dynamic behavior of this network.

3.2. Bifurcations Observed with Evolving Hill Coeﬃcient 
Complex dynamic behavior, like transition states and bifurcation, cannot be obtained 
in Boolean dynamics [17,25 ,32]. Thus, we turn our a ttention to the ordinary di ﬀerential 
equation (ODE) model. In this work, we used the double-normalized Hill equation, which 
has been described in detail previously [17,25]. The details of the direct interactions among 
genes in the current network are still unclear, let alone their dynamic parameters. In order 
to extract insights from such limited empi rical constraints, a set of dimensionless 
mesoscopic parameters, h and k, were used in this work. 
We chose h = 3, k = 10 for the ﬁrst trial of the parameter set (the vanilla set) based on 
our previous modeling experience [25]. Under this set, we obtained three ﬁxed points, 
with two stable ones (stable state) and an unstable one (transition state) (Figure 2A,B). The 
expression patterns of the two stable states (Figure 2A,B; vanilla_sta1, vanilla_sta2) are 
consistent with the point a ttractors in the Boolean Dynami cs (Figure 2A,B; Boole_p1, 
Boole_p2). The transition state is also consistent with the average of all the limit cycles in 
the Boolean dynamics with the unaltered func tions (Figure 2A,B; Boole_li_allme: the av-
erage of Boole_li_7 and Boole_li_18 in Figure 1B). 
In a nonlinear system, bifurc ations may occur as the parameters change. Oster and 
Alberch argued that mathematical bifurcations could be an important mechanism behind 
development and evolution 40 years ago [33, 34]. We therefore explored the parameter 
space in order to ﬁnd such bifurcations. 
Fitting an elephant with a wiggling trunk was not our goal; therefore, the number of 
free parameters needed to be reduced. The number of arbitrary parameters in this model 
was set to 20 (2n, n = edge number). Given that the empirical details of these dynamical 
parameters are not clear, and genes in the core network level should be considered equally 
important—as we argued before [21,25]—we used the same parameters for all edges, 
thereby reducing the free parameter number from 20 to 2. Considering that the concen-
tration/function of genes was already normalized to [0, 1]—i n order to center the S shape 
part of the sigmoid function—we let k = 2
h, therefore reducing the number of free param-
eters to 1.

3.2. Bifurcations Observed with Evolving Hill Coefficient
Complex dynamic behavior, like transition states and bifurcation, cannot be obtained
in Boolean dynamics [17,25,32]. Thus, we turn our attention to the ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model. In this work, we used the double-normalized Hill equation, which
has been described in detail previously [17,25]. The details of the direct interactions among
genes in the current network are still unclear, let alone their dynamic parameters. In
order to extract insights from such limited empirical constraints, a set of dimensionless
mesoscopic parameters, h and k, were used in this work.
We chose h = 3, k = 10 for the first trial of the parameter set (the vanilla set) based
on our previous modeling experience [25]. Under this set, we obtained three fixed points,
with two stable ones (stable state) and an unstable one (transition state) (Figure 2A,B).
The expression patterns of the two stable states (Figure 2A,B; vanilla_sta1, vanilla_sta2)
are consistent with the point attractors in the Boolean Dynamics (Figure 2A,B; Boole_p1,
Boole_p2). The transition state is also consistent with the average of all the limit cycles
in the Boolean dynamics with the unaltered functions (Figure 2A,B; Boole_li_allme: the
average of Boole_li_7 and Boole_li_18 in Figure 1B).
In a nonlinear system, bifurcations may occur as the parameters change. Oster and
Alberch argued that mathematical bifurcations could be an important mechanism behind
development and evolution 40 years ago [ 33,34]. We therefore explored the parameter
space in order to find such bifurcations.
Fitting an elephant with a wiggling trunk was not our goal; therefore, the number of
free parameters needed to be reduced. The number of arbitrary parameters in this model
was set to 20 (2n, n = edge number). Given that the empirical details of these dynami-
cal parameters are not clear, and genes in the core network level should be considered
equally important—as we argued before [ 21,25]—we used the same parameters for all
edges, thereby reducing the free parameter number from 20 to 2. Considering that the
concentration/function of genes was already normalized to [0, 1]—in order to center the S
shape part of the sigmoid function—we let k = 2h, therefore reducing the number of free
parameters to 1.

There is an increase in the h (h = 10, 25; k = 2 h) results in two stable states and one 
transition state, which is similar to the dynamic behavior under the vanilla parameter set 
(Figure 2A,B). Since the Hill equation is equivalent to its Boolean form, when h takes the 
limit, we expected that the dynamic behavior would not change signiﬁcantly with further 
increases in h. 
We then explored a parameter space with a smaller h, and discovered two bifurca-
tions (1.6 < h < 1.65; 2.325 < h < 2.35; k = 2 h). When h < 1.6, there is only one stable state, 
which has pattern similar to the transition state with the vanilla parameter set. The pattern 
gradually evolves from the vanilla transition state-like pa ttern to a vanilla stable state1-
like pattern with increasing h. Passing over the ﬁrst bifurcation (1.6 < h < 1.65), a transition 
state emerges, which then evolves to a transition state-like pattern similar to vanilla (1.65 
< h < 2.325). Except for one situation (when h = 2), there is only one stable state. The second 
bifurcation (2.325 < h < 2.35) gives birth to the second stable state (Figure 2C). 
3.3. Evolution of the Telencephalon Anterior Posterior Patterning by Bifurcations of the Network 
Dynamic Behavior 
Remarkably, the dynamic behavior of this network is highly consistent with the facts 
we know about the evolution of the telencephalon. 
A telencephalon-like structure has been identiﬁed recently in amphioxus with a low 
level of Pax4/6 and a high level of EmxA, EmxB [31], and Fgf8 [36] (Figure 2A; amphi-
oxus). Only one stable state exists with weak or negative cooperativity in this network (0 
< h < 1.6), with a low level of Pax6 and an intermediate–high level of Emx2 and Fgf8, which 
is consistent with the expression pa ttern of the telencephalon-like structure identi ﬁed in 
amphioxus. The expression pa ttern of this solitary stable state gradually evolves into a 
posterior telencephalon-like pattern with increasing h. 
Figure 2. (A) Comparison between computation results of different parameters and experimental data.
All fixed points under all parameters (h) we tried are displayed in the middle table. The four columns

mice [49–51]. The two columns on the right show the results obtained under the vanilla parameter
set (h = 3, k = 10) and using unaltered Boolean functions (h→ + ∞), and the others are arranged from
small to large for h. (B) Heatmap of all ODE fixed points demonstrated after hierarchical clustering.
(C) Bifurcations occur with the growth of h. Arrows point to the stable states from the transition state
(N/A: related experimental data not found; sta: stable state; tra: transition state).
There is an increase in the h (h = 10, 25; k = 2h) results in two stable states and one
transition state, which is similar to the dynamic behavior under the vanilla parameter set
(Figure 2A,B). Since the Hill equation is equivalent to its Boolean form, when h takes the
limit, we expected that the dynamic behavior would not change significantly with further
increases in h.
We then explored a parameter space with a smaller h, and discovered two bifurcations
(1.6 < h < 1.65; 2.325 < h < 2.35; k = 2h). When h < 1.6, there is only one stable state, which has
pattern similar to the transition state with the vanilla parameter set. The pattern gradually
evolves from the vanilla transition state-like pattern to a vanilla stable state1-like pattern
with increasing h. Passing over the first bifurcation (1.6 <h < 1.65), a transition state emerges,
which then evolves to a transition state-like pattern similar to vanilla ( 1.65 < h < 2.325).
Except for one situation (when h = 2), there is only one stable state. The second bifurcation
(2.325 < h < 2.35) gives birth to the second stable state (Figure 2C).
3.3. Evolution of the Telencephalon Anterior Posterior Patterning by Bifurcations of the Network
Dynamic Behavior
Remarkably, the dynamic behavior of this network is highly consistent with the facts
we know about the evolution of the telencephalon.
A telencephalon-like structure has been identified recently in amphioxus with a low
level of Pax4/6 and a high level of EmxA, EmxB [31], and Fgf8 [36] (Figure 2A; amphioxus).
Only one stable state exists with weak or negative cooperativity in this network (0 < h < 1.6),
with a low level of Pax6 and an intermediate–high level of Emx2 and Fgf8, which is
consistent with the expression pattern of the telencephalon-like structure identified in
amphioxus. The expression pattern of this solitary stable state gradually evolves into a
posterior telencephalon-like pattern with increasing h.
With a further increase in h (1.65 ≤ h ≤ 2.325), the first bifurcation occurs, giving birth
to a stable state and a transition state. The expression pattern of the stable state is consistent
with the posterior part of the telencephalon, and the expression pattern of the ‘popping-out’
transition state is similar to the anterior part of the telencephalon.
Entropy 2024, 26, 631 6 of 10
This model results in two stable states consistent with telencephalon anterior–posterior
patterning in vertebrates after the second bifurcation (h ≥ 2.35), and one transition state,
which shares a similarity in expression pattern with the telencephalon-like structure in
amphioxus as well as the stable state with weak or negative cooperativity in this network.
These observations remind us of the biogenetic law [52].
In the validation data of lampreys, zebrafish, and mice, molecular patterns consistent
with the theoretical results were identified. For lampreys, there exist two molecular patterns:
one is characterized by a high level of Pax6 and Emx2, accompanied by a low level of
Fgf8 and Sp8, while the other displays a low level of Pax6, with a high level of Fgf8,
Emx2, and Sp8 (Figure 2A; lamprey). For zebrafish, three patterns have been identified:
one that exhibits a high level of Emx2 and Coup-tfi as well as a low level of Pax6 and
Sp8; another where Fgf8, Emx2, and Coup-tfi are expressed highly, with Pax6 expressed
at lower levels; and finally, a third pattern where Fgf8, Pax6, and Sp8 are expressed at
high levels, whereas Emx2 and Coup-tfi are expressed at low levels (Figure 2A; zebrafish).
For mice, there exist two molecular patterns: one is characterized by high expression of
Coup-tfi and Emx2, accompanied by low expression of Fgf8, Pax6, and Sp8, while the other
displays low expression of Emx2 and Coup-tfi, with high expression of Fgf8, Pax6, and Sp8
(Figure 2A; mice).
We did not observe any significant variation in the dynamic behavior of this network
after the second bifurcation (h ≥ 2.35). On the biological side, no matter how complex the
brain evolves, the binary patterning of the pallium/subpallium or olfactory bulb/olfactory
cortex can always be observed in the vertebrate telencephalon [1].
3.4. Predictions
Based on the results above, we can make the following predictions (Figure 3A,B):

possible animals. 
4. Discussion 
The aim of this work is to employ this well-validated model in order to validate a 
ﬁrst-principles-based approach to reconstructing an evolutionary trajectory. For the evo-
lution of telencephalon anterior–posterior patterning, we found that such a ﬁve-node net-
work alone is suﬃcient to draw an answer. Still, it is not enough to explain the evolution 
of the whole central nervous system, let alone the entire vertebrate body plan. Genes not 
included in this mode, such as BMP [53–55], Wnt [56,57], Cadherin-11 [58], Otx2 [59], and 
Foxg1 [60], are also important in early tele ncephalic development. This network can be 
expanded by adding new nodes and edges, wh ich have the potential to expand into the 
global decision-making network for the evolution and development of the central nervous 
system or even the entire vertebrate body plan, as shaped by evolution. 
Preliminary evidence suggests that the hypothesis that the network described in this 
work is conserved during evolution from the pre-vertebrate chordate to the vertebrate is 
plausible. The results obtained by Giacom antonio and Goodhill [26,27]—and the results 
described in this work—further validated this hypothesis at the computational level. 
As knowledge of the real parameter dynamics is limited, if not non-existent, we used 
a set of dimensionless mesoscopic parameters and made the parameter sets equal within 
the core network level, based on a set of working hypotheses previously postulated in 
[21,25]. This work showed that useful predictions can still be drawn even under such little 
knowledge. However, exploring the range of these parameters in real biological systems 
is still a non-trivial task. 
In response to the growing emphasis on theory–experiment coupling in the life sci-
ences [11–14,23,24], our work suggests that the combination of existing experimental facts 
and the aforementioned mathematical and theoretical frameworks, although not perfect, 
has been able to engender new insights and veriﬁable predictions.

possible animals.
The topological structure of the core endogenous network—which determines the
telencephalic anterior–posterior patterning—had already evolved in the ancestral chordate
550 million years ago.

The expression pattern of the telencephalon-like structure—in this ancestral chordate
550 million years ago and in the amphioxus today—is consistent with the stable states we
obtained before the first bifurcation (0 < h ≤ 1.6).
An ancestral organism with a primitive telencephalic structure would develop an
expression pattern consistent with the anterior part of the vertebrate telencephalon and
the transition state we obtained under the parameter range of 1.65 ≤ h ≤ 2.325 during
development, which then matured into an expression pattern consistent with the posterior
part of the vertebrate telencephalon and the stable state we obtained under this parameter
range of 1.65 ≤ h ≤ 2.325.
Experiments that reduce the cooperative effect in the network described above in
vertebrates would entail a series of events: the vanishing of the anterior–posterior pattern-
ing of the telencephalon; the observation of a structure in which the expression pattern is
consistent with the posterior part of the telencephalon; and the observation of a structure in
which the expression pattern is consistent with the amphioxus telencephalon-like structure.
4. Discussion
The aim of this work is to employ this well-validated model in order to validate a first-
principles-based approach to reconstructing an evolutionary trajectory. For the evolution
of telencephalon anterior–posterior patterning, we found that such a five-node network
alone is sufficient to draw an answer. Still, it is not enough to explain the evolution of
the whole central nervous system, let alone the entire vertebrate body plan. Genes not
included in this mode, such as BMP [53–55], Wnt [56,57], Cadherin-11 [58], Otx2 [59], and
Foxg1 [60], are also important in early telencephalic development. This network can be
expanded by adding new nodes and edges, which have the potential to expand into the
global decision-making network for the evolution and development of the central nervous
system or even the entire vertebrate body plan, as shaped by evolution.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the hypothesis that the network described in this
work is conserved during evolution from the pre-vertebrate chordate to the vertebrate is
plausible. The results obtained by Giacomantonio and Goodhill [26,27]—and the results
described in this work—further validated this hypothesis at the computational level.
As knowledge of the real parameter dynamics is limited, if not non-existent, we
used a set of dimensionless mesoscopic parameters and made the parameter sets equal
within the core network level, based on a set of working hypotheses previously postulated
in [21,25]. This work showed that useful predictions can still be drawn even under such
little knowledge. However, exploring the range of these parameters in real biological
systems is still a non-trivial task.
In response to the growing emphasis on theory–experiment coupling in the life sci-
ences [11–14,23,24], our work suggests that the combination of existing experimental facts
and the aforementioned mathematical and theoretical frameworks, although not perfect,
has been able to engender new insights and verifiable predictions.
5. Conclusions
The current results speak to the following picture:
The ancestral chordate 550 million years ago evolved a five-node core endogenous
network—described above—with weak or even negative cooperative effects, which devel-
oped a telencephalon-like structure with a similar expression pattern to the developing
telencephalon during early embryonic stages in the vertebrate, but without the anterior–
posterior patterning.
Between 550 and 500 million years ago, new genes emerged from genome duplication
and mutations. As a result, cooperative effects within the five-node core endogenous
network increased so that a primitive telencephalon structure gradually evolved to the
expression pattern of the posterior part of the vertebrate telencephalon, and during de-
velopment, developed an expression pattern similar to the anterior part of the vertebrate
telencephalon. With the further increase in the cooperative effect during evolution, a

telencephalon with anterior–posterior patterning emerged, which, like the biogenetic law
suggests, would undergo a development stage with an expression pattern similar to that of
the ancestral telencephalon-like structure. In short, we addressed how the telencephalon’s
anterior–posterior patterning evolved quantitatively in a first-principles manner.
