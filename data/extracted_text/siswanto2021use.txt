Introduction 
This research exclusively focuses on active and passive sentences, the active and passive sentences 
to know on students’ writing recount text. The first one is to describe the active sentences. The second is 
about the passive sentences. The third is about writing. The fourth is about the recount text. The active 
and passive sentences are to use the students on writing and say something about recount text . E very 
student must learn the active and passive sentences we ll to refer to the correct writing on recount text. 
Language is an integral part of communication. It serves as a conduit for people to communicate what 
they are thinking. They pose questions, share their feelings, opinions, and emotions, and express 
themselves verbally. 
To communicate with people worldwide, the requirement is not only for oral communication 
abilities, but also for written proficiency.  Written mass media are the most  influential parts of our life 
today. Moreover, the existence of the internet enables  worldwide connections for people worldwide to 
communicate, get, and give the recent information in all aspects of lives,  which emerges a great  demand 
of having writing ability in Eng lish. Thus, in order to communicate with people worldwide, not only oral 
communication skills are needed, but also written proficiency. The internet enables people worldwide to 
interact, obtain, and distribute current knowledge. 
The active and passive sent ences are imperative in this lesson because not all students can 
understand well, particularly for Private Vocational high school English. To improve our English bits of 
knowledge, not only always read the text, speak, or take a conversation but write the text is essential, 
especially for students to improve their English skills. In this context, to develop in English, we can learn 
English by writing the text.  The active and passive sentences in writing are essential because the writing 
of the sentences to know and remember what we will  talk about our experiences that we had done in the

past. For m any people who practice English , one of the ways is using the writing way. This way is 
significant because the advantage is to sharpen and develop foreign language writing skills.  
On the other side, we do not only sharpen the writing but also to know and sharpen English 
grammar correctly. The active and passive sentences in writing the text in English can also make the feel 
of meaning and create each word to the sentence’s faster knowledge of English. The way can also make 
our skill faster to know English correctly because in writing the text we know the false and the correct in 
each word. It can also increase our sharpen of thin king to be good in English writ ing. Writing also has a 
good potential to give information to other people and  increase many abilities to our writing skill. By 
writing, we can also apply the foreign language, grammar, and vocabulary by thinking of words. 
Active and passive sentences are in writing not only for communicating but also for expressing our 
idea or thinking to create  many words. Expressing is not only using a speech or talking but also 
expressing with someone by writing the text on the paper, note , email, and letter. To communicate with 
someone is also the same way; we can create our expressing by writing the text into good communication. 
These statements of communicating and expressing to other people by writing are simple way s for 
communication. In other words, the use of a ctive and passive sentences are in writing not only for 
communicating but also for expressing our idea or thinking. Expressing is not only using a speech or 
talking but also expressing with someone by writing the text on the paper. 
In this context of active and passive sentences on students’ writing recount text, we will  learn 
some active sentences and passive sentences . T he learners must understand well the writing of 
communication of an active sentence and passive sentence. The active sentence is the subject acts as the 
verb, while the passive sentence is the subject of the sentence has an action done to it by someone or 
something else. The writer of active and passive sentence s must be c areful of writing into good 
communication to the other people. If our interlocutors smarter or understand well than us to 
communicate, it makes us lousy knowledge in front of them.  Regarding the focus of the research above, 
the problem in this research needs to be formulated as follows: 
1.  How to use the active and the passive sentences in writing the text? 
2. How is the use written in writing on students’ recount text?

Students make some error s in using active sentences in the students’ writing recount text. Based 
on Dulay’s Strategy Taxonomy, there are four types of error: omission, addition, misinformation, 
misordering. The results of the students’ errors are the total error in using active sentences are 171 errors 
that consist of 34 errors or 19,88% error of misinformation, 92 errors or 53,88% error of omission, 43 
errors or 25,14% error of addition, two errors or 1,66% error of misordering. According to the data above, 
the lowest error in using active sentences is in misordering two errors, or 1,66%. Then, the highest errors 
in using active sentences are in omission 92 errors or 53,88%. It means that almost all students have 
errors in omission. The error is mainly because the students forgot and were confused when using the 
active sentence in writing recount text. They are still confused in arranging the sentences and sometimes 
forget to change the present into a past participle, still lacking vocabularies.  
According to  the sample analysis, students have some error s in using  passive sentences on 
students’ writing recount text. Based on Dulay’s Strategy Taxonomy, there are four types of error: 
omission, addition, misinformation, misordering. The result s of the students’ error s are the total error in

errors or 35,29% error of omission, six errors or 35,29% error of addition, 0 errors or 0% error of 
misordering. According to the data above, the lowest error in using passive sent ences is in misordering 0 
errors or 0%. Then, the highest errors in using active sentences are omission and addition six errors or 
35,29%. It means that almost all students have errors in omission and addition.  The error is mainly 
because the students forgot and were confused when using passive sentences in writing recount text. They 
are still confused in arranging the sentences because not familiar with the passive sentences,  and the 
students still lack vocabularies and the grammatical of passive sentences. 
The results of this research are theoretically and practically expected to give a contribution to 
educational institutions. Theoretically , the active and the passive sentences of the text both the sam e of 
the identifying avoided the plain of the sentences of the writing text. (to increase and make the writing of 
the sentences, the text become s faster must the writer's ability  to be accustomed and make it in a habit in 
the daily life of the writing in t he text). When writing  the recount text , the students use the active 
sentences and passive sentences by the verb, adjective, adverb to write the text.

Practically, to make a quick test to help you and make you understand the difference between the 
active and the passive sentences, it is a must analyze the sentences and paragraph carefully of the active 
and passive sentences (to implement the analyzing of the active and passive sentences have to be careful 
of every word until to correct sentences and paragr aph of the text)  because the text must analyze the 
active and the passive sentences on students’ writing recount text to make the sentences into good and 
correct sentences of the experience of the writing recount text of the students . I t also makes them 
understand how to use the active and the passive sentences.
