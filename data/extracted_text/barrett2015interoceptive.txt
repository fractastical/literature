Box S1 | Strengths of the structural model 
In 1991, Felleman and Van Essen proposed a hierarchical model of feedforward, lateral , and 
feedback connectivity between cortical regions based on visual cortex anatomy 1. They 
classified each connection on the basis of termination site : feedforward connections  were 
thought to terminate in mid layers (preferentially l ayer IV) of less differentiated visual 
regions (moving sequentially from primary visual cortex towards the front of the brain) , 
whereas feedback connections were thought to predominantly avoid layer IV, terminating 
mostly in superficial layers  of more differentiated visual regions (moving  sequentially from 
the front of the brain towards primary visual cortex) . Although the Felleman and Van Essen  
model is still widely used, the visual system is not an ideal prototype for building a general 
model of corticocortical communication because large swaths of cortex (e.g.,  frontal, 
temporal, and parietal association cortices) do not have a strict , linear posterior to anterior 
lamination gradient (cf. 2). Even the visual system contains many violations of Felleman and 
Van Essen’s hierarchy 3.   
In contrast, Barbas and colleagues’ structural model for corticocortical connections, 
which was developed analyzing patterns of connection within the prefrontal and temporal 
cortices of the macaque brain 4, 5, does not suffer from these problems.   Importantly, the 
structural model not only predicts the flow of information between prefrontal and temporal 
cortices 6, 7 and between prefrontal and parietal areas of the macaque brain 8, but it also 
predicts patterns of connections in visual cortices of the cat 9.  
The structural model better describes the flow of predictions and prediction errors 
across cortical areas that do not show a anterior –posterior lamination gradient in the macaque 
brain, which other models cannot account for 10.  Most hierarchical models of the cortex are 
predicated on some form a distance rule, w here there is a linear relation between the distance 
between two areas and the percentage of cells that send projections to deep layers (if feedback 
connections) or to superficial layers (if feedforward connections) 11, p. 697.  For example, the

distance rule model proposed by Kennedy and colleagues 12-14 was developed analyzing 
patterns of connection in visual areas of the monkey brain  and works well for describing 
information flow in visual cortex because there is a relatively linear  posterior to anterior 
laminar gradient: V1, the cortical area with the highest laminar differentiation, is located at 
the occipital pole  and moving anteriorly visual cortex becomes increasingly less granular and 
more dysgranular. Therefore, in the occipital lobe, laminar differentiation and distance go in 
parallel.  But laminar differentiation and distance do not go in parallel in the rest  of the brain 
15. For example, in a recent paper on the distance rule m odel, Markov et al. excluded the 
prefrontal cortex from their analyses because the data did not fit their model.  In a footnote to 
Table 6 in their paper, they stated “The prefrontal areas were excluded from the source and 
target list due to their tendency  to overrun the distance and hierarchy rules”  (pg. 243) 14. The 
distance rule model may not be equally applicable to the entire cerebral cortex, while the 
structural model, by contrast, has successfully predicted patterns of connections 
independently of distances in frontal, temporal parietal and occipital cortices 6-9.
