According to the free energy principle, all sentient beings strive to minimize surprise or, 
in other words, an information-theoretical quantity called variational free energy. 
Consequently, psychosocial “stress” can be redefined as a state of “heightened expected 
free energy,” that is, a state of “expected surprise” or “uncertainty.” Individuals experiencing 
stress primarily attempt to reduce uncertainty, or expected free energy, with the help of 
what is called an uncertainty resolution program (URP). The URP consists of three 
subroutines: First, an arousal state is induced that increases cerebral information 
transmission and processing to reduce uncertainty as quickly as possible. Second, these 
additional computations cost the brain additional energy, which it demands from the body. 
Third, the program controls which stress reduction measures are learned for future use 
and which are not. We refer to an episode as “good” stress, when the URP has successfully 
reduced uncertainty. Failure of the URP to adequately reduce uncertainty results in either 
stress habituation or prolonged toxic stress. Stress habituation reduces uncertainty by 
flattening/broadening individual goal beliefs so that outcomes previously considered as 
untenable become acceptable. Habituated individuals experience so-called “tolerable” 
stress. Referring to the Selfish Brain theory and the experimental evidence supporting it, 
we show that habituated people, who lack stress arousals and therefore have decreased 
average brain energy consumption, tend to develop an obese type 2 diabetes mellitus 
phenotype. People, for whom habituation is not the free-energy-optimal solution, do not 
reduce their uncertainty by changing their goal preferences, and are left with nothing but 
“toxic” stress. Toxic stress leads to recurrent or persistent arousal states and thus increased 
average brain energy consumption, which in turn promotes the development of a lean 
type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype. In conclusion, we anchor the psychosomatic concept 
of stress in the information-theoretical concept of uncertainty as defined by the free energy 
principle. In addition, we detail the neurobiological mechanisms underlying uncertainty 
reduction and illustrate how uncertainty can lead to psychosomatic illness.

INTRODUCTION
In psychosomatic medicine, it is very well known that people 
who feel uncertain—not knowing what will happen next—are 
more likely to develop somatic diseases such as myocardial 
infarction, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity (Heraclides 
et al., 2011; Kubera et al., 2022). In 1956, the first psychosomatic 
workshop was held “On the mysterious leap from mind to 
body. ” Some participants argued that “there is no separation 
between psyche and soma” and therefore “no leap, no mystery” 
(Greco, 2019 ). However, it was not until the beginning of the 
21st century that new insights from theoretical neuroscience 
and internal medicine emerged that may now provide an 
explanation of how mental states and physical illness are related. 
The theoretical frameworks and experimental results underlying 
these explanations are presented in this article.
Stress, as redefined by Peters et  al. (2017) , is grounded in 
the concept of uncertainty. According to this novel stress 
definition people ask themselves on occasion, “Which of my 
policies should I select to safeguard my future physical, mental, 
and social well-being?” Those people who are uncertain in 
answering this question experience stress. Uncertainty is used 
here as ‘entropy’ in terms of information theory ( Shannon, 
1948) and means, in the context of stress, that even when 
people choose their most promising policy, they expect surprises, 
i.e., they remain uncertain about what will happen next (Hartwig 
et  al., 2022 ).
The question of how the brain deals with uncertainty in 
general is at the center of modern theoretical neuroscience. 
The psychiatrist and physicist Karl Friston of the University 
College London has developed the so-called free energy principle 
according to which all sentient beings strive to reduce uncertainty 
or, in other words, to minimize an information-theoretical 
quantity he  calls free energy ( Friston et  al., 2006 ; Friston, 
2010). This variational free energy is measured in bits and 
corresponds to the information that an agent could still need 
to make better predictions about things in the world. So a 
high free energy is something unfavorable, indicating that the 
agent has a too complex model of reality and/or makes 
inaccurate predictions.
So far, the free energy principle has been successfully applied 
to explain various brain processes such as perception, action, 
attention, learning, decision making, exploration, and social 
cooperation ( Hohwy, 2013; Schwartenbeck et  al., 2013 ; Clark, 
2016; Hartwig and Peters, 2021 ). Here we apply the free energy 
principle to stress, it being a state where all available policies 
of the agent display a heightened expected free energy ( Hartwig 
et  al., 2022 ).
The term “policy” has a special meaning in the free energy 
principle, specifically in the process called active inference. In 
active inference, beliefs about the hidden states of the world 
optimize model evidence, allowing to find the ‘best’ model 
(one that makes accurate predictions but is not too complex). 
In contrast to classical formulations, active inference makes a 
distinction between “action” as a physical state of the real world 
and‚ “policies” , which are beliefs about (future) actions—the 
latter are what constitute a sense of agency ( Friston et  al., 
2013). The essence of active inference, namely the brain’s predictive 
capacity, becomes particularly evident when the agent has to 
make decisions under uncertainty or stress.
There are three outcomes of dealing with stress, i.e., with 
high expected free energy: good stress, tolerable stress and 
toxic stress, where the uncertainty can be  reduced completely, 
partially or not at all ( McEwen and Gianaros, 2011 ). Good 
stress is when a so-called uncertainty resolution program (URP) 
successfully ends the uncertainty phase so that it becomes a 
completed episode. Tolerable stress occurs in people who 
habituated to stress. Toxic stress occurs in people for whom 
stress habituation was not a free-energy-optimal solution and 
who therefore did not habituate (Hartwig et al., 2022). Compared 
to people who experience good stress, people with tolerable 
or toxic stress can develop prolonged changes in cerebral 
energy metabolism.
The characteristic of the brain to prioritize its own energy 
metabolism is described in the Selfish Brain theory ( Peters 
et al., 2004 ). The Selfish Brain theory is based on the postulate 
that the brain actively demands energy from the body when 
needed, rather than just being passively supplied from the 
blood. Such prioritization of cerebral energy metabolism has 
been shown, at least in mammals, to be  an inherent metabolic 
feature that ensures the maintenance of cerebral function, energy 
homeostasis and mass on short and long time scales ( Sprengell 
et al., 2021a ,b,c). Accordingly, in times of uncertainty, the brain 
demands additional thermodynamic energy from the body.
Cerebral energy metabolism changes in divergent directions 
during tolerable versus toxic stress. The cerebral energy need 
is decreased after stress habituation and increased during toxic 
stress. After stress habituation, people typically tend to develop 
the corpulent-but-waisted phenotype and, under toxic stress, 
the lean-but-narrow-waisted phenotype, the latter being 
associated with a high risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular 
complications. Both phenotypes have a high risk for type 2 
diabetes mellitus ( Peters and McEwen, 2015 ; Peters et al., 2017 ; 
Hartwig et  al., 2022 ).
This article highlights biological mechanisms that may explain 
how the mental state of feeling uncertain is related to the 
development of different body shape phenotypes (lean, obese, 
narrow or wide waisted) and somatic diseases (such as type 
2 diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and stroke).
GOOD STRESS
Agents’ beliefs about their preferred goal states play a key role 
in understanding stress. In this paper, the term belief is 
understood in the Bayesian sense as a prior probability 
distribution over states. Goal beliefs denote the “states that 
the agent believes they should hold. ” Typical goal states are, 
for example, physical integrity or a certain social status. For 
human agents, the goal state landscape is of course very complex. 
It has been shown that goal priors (beliefs) are encoded in 
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; Bechara et  al., 
2000; Roesch and Olson, 2004 ; Barron et al., 2015 ), specifically 
as Gaussian probability distributions, where not only the mean 
Peters et al. Obesity, Type-2-Diabetes and Free Energy
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931701
but also the variance of the distribution is encoded ( Lebreton 
et  al., 2015 ). These goal or prior preferences provide a point 
of reference for goal directed behavior—but can also be updated, 
as will be  shown below.
The beliefs about the “states that can be attained” (attainable 
states) are represented in brain regions such as the 
pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA; Rushworth et  al., 
2004; Nguyen et  al., 2014 ). For example, an attainable state 
for an athlete is to jump  2.00 m in the upcoming competition. 
Athletes’ beliefs about attainable states indicate the probabilities 
with which the athlete believes they can attain certain jump 
heights. According to the free energy principle the prediction 
of attainable states is based on a so-called generative model 
(Friston et  al., 2006 ). Past experiences—such as early life 
adversity or failed attachment to parents—strongly influence 
which future events are anticipated when choosing a particular 
policy. In a long-lasting iterative process, the amygdala- and 
hippocampus-dependent emotional and declarative memories 
shape the generative model, which allows the prediction of 
the attainable states. In this regard, no person is free from 
such biographical biases toward the prediction of new events.
In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the risk of each 
available policy is assessed, allowing to deal with uncertainty 
in decision making ( Paulus et  al., 2002 ; Feinstein et  al., 2006 ; 
Behrens et  al., 2007 ; Sarinopoulos et  al., 2010 ; Karlsson et  al., 
2012; Liljeholm et  al., 2013 ). The policy risk assessment is 
based on the comparison between the predicted attainable 
states and the agent’s goal states ( Friston et  al., 2013 ; Peters 
et al., 2017). If there is a large divergence between the attainable 
states and the goal states (given a particular policy is considered), 
the policy in question is classified as high risk for not attaining 
the goal.
If all of the policies available to the agent are high risk, 
the ACC starts the URP . The URP’s primary function is to 
reduce uncertainty. To this end, the ACC activates the amygdala, 
which is at the top of a hierarchically organized stress system, 
involving top-down activation of brainstem nuclei, sympathetic 
nervous system (SNS), hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) 
axis, and bottom-up feedback of cortisol to all levels ( Peters 
et  al., 2007 ; Weidenfeld and Ovadia, 2017 ).
The URP uses information to identify a policy from the 
available repertoire that appears promising after all, or even 
to creatively find a new policy that offers a way to reduce 
uncertainty. Once the URP is initiated, the agent infers a stress 
state based on the interoceptive inputs described next. URP 
activation is accompanied by numerous changes in the internal 
milieu of the human organism (increased vigilance, faster 
heartbeat, sweating, and change in gastrointestinal peristalsis). 
The agent experiences themselves wide awake, with strong 
palpitations and a queasy feeling in the stomach, and interprets 
these changes, along with perceived external circumstances, as 
most consistent with feeling uncertain ( Barrett and Simmons, 
2015; Barrett, 2017 ). Although URP activation leads to an 
emotionally unpleasant state, it is of vital importance because 
it can safeguard survival by resolving uncertainty. People who 
succeed in resolving uncertainty by the URP experience this 
episode as good stress, resulting in a boost of self-esteem and 
a sense of mastery ( Kirschbaum et  al., 1995 ; Pruessner and 
Hellhammer, 1999 ; Pruessner et  al., 2005 ).
The URP has three subroutines: enhancement of cerebral 
information processing, procurement of the necessary energy, 
and learning of successful measures. The first subroutine increases 
cerebral information transmission to reduce uncertainty. It thus 
increases the probability of quickly finding a promising policy. 
It was Claude Shannon who first showed that it requires 
information to reduce uncertainty (i.e., entropy; Shannon, 1948). 
Information facilitates the selection of states or policies under 
consideration, allowing the virtual reality model to make more 
accurate predictions, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding 
a successful policy.
In this first subroutine, the amygdala activates locus coeruleus 
(LC) neurons in the brainstem ( Figure  1). Tonic activation 
of these neurons produces an arousal state with increased 
vigilance. The arousal state results from the noradrenergic LC 
neurons sending multiple projections throughout the brain, 
particularly to the cerebral cortex, where they release 
norepinephrine at cortical synapses ( Berridge and Waterhouse, 
2003; Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 ). The neuromodulatory 
influence of norepinephrine accelerates information transmission 
at these synapses, allowing more information to be transmitted 
per time (bits per second). In this way, more information is 
immediately available, reducing uncertainty about what to do 
next—making it possible to find the most promising policy 
as quickly as possible.
The second subroutine procures the energy needed for 
speeding up cerebral information processing. For without energy, 
no information can be  obtained ( Tribus and Mcirvine, 1971 ; 
Toyabe et  al., 2010; Berut et  al., 2012 ). Indeed, experimentally 
induced stress arousals (i.e., states with high expected variational 
free energy) have been shown to be  highly thermodynamic-
energy costly; even a mild mental laboratory stressor results 
in a 12% increase in global cerebral metabolic rate of glucose 
(Madsen et  al., 1995 ). In this second subroutine for energy 
procurement, the amygdala stimulates the SNS and the HPA-axis. 
In this way, the amygdala activates so-called brain-pull 
mechanisms with which the brain can actively demand energy 
from the body ( Peters and Langemann, 2009). While the Selfish 
Brain theory postulates that the brain actively demands energy 
from the body when needed ( Peters et  al., 2004 ), the rival 
theories, i.e., the glucolipostatic theory and its modern variants, 
reject such an active energy demand by the brain ( Kennedy, 
1953; Mayer, 1953; Chaput and Tremblay, 2009; Schwartz et al., 
2017). In fact, three systematic reviews have shown that the 
Selfish Brain theory was able to predict and coherently explain 
all the data examined, which covered caloric restriction, cerebral 
artery occlusion, and type 1 diabetes mellitus ( Sprengell et  al., 
2021a,b,c). In contrast, the predictions of the glucolipostatic 
theory and its modern variants were violated. This systematic 
theory test showed that the postulate of an actively energy-
demanding brain is probably true ( Sprengell et  al., 2021a ,b,c).
Three of the most important brain-pull mechanisms are 
cerebral insulin suppression, brain-induced ketogenesis, and 
brain-induced heart rate acceleration. Cerebral insulin 
suppression involves activation of SNS and HPA-axis, both of 
Peters et al. Obesity, Type-2-Diabetes and Free Energy

which strongly suppress insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells 
(Woods and Porte, 1974 ; Billaudel and Sutter, 1982 ; Ahren, 
2000; Hitze et al., 2010). Decreased insulin release limits insulin-
dependent storage of glucose in muscle and adipose tissue. 
Instead, the circulating glucose is available to the brain, which 
requires virtually no insulin for glucose uptake ( Hom et  al., 
1984; Hasselbalch et  al., 1999 ; Seaquist et  al., 2001 ). In short, 
insulin-independent glucose-transporter-1 (GLUT-1) uptake 
safeguards basal energy supply of vital organs, like brain and 
immune cells ( Deng et  al., 2014 ), while insulin-dependent 
glucose-transporter-4 (GLUT-4) allows the storage of surplus 
energy in muscle and fat cells ( Shepherd and Kahn, 1999 ). 
Put simply, enhanced cerebral insulin suppression provides the 
brain with extra energy when it needs it.
Brain-induced ketogenesis involves SNS stimulation of visceral 
adipose tissue to release free fatty acids, which travel via the 
portal vein to the liver, where they are converted to ketone 
bodies. Finally, ketone bodies are provided to the brain as 
alternative substrates when needed (e.g., during psychosocial 
stress or caloric restriction; Kubera et  al., 2014 ).
Brain-induced heart rate acceleration also involves activation 
of the SNS. Amygdala activity is associated with heart rate 
variability in healthy subjects, showing a link between the 
processing of emotional stimuli and the corresponding adaptation 
of the autonomic system ( Y ang et  al., 2007). The accelerated 
heart rate increases cardiac output and thus makes more energy 
per time available to the brain ( Jones et al., 2011 ). Thus, brain-
induced heart rate acceleration also procures the brain with 
energy-on-demand.
The third subroutine, learning of uncertainty-resolving 
measures, involves activation of the HPA-axis and cortisol 
feedback effects via brain glucocorticoid receptors. In 
hippocampus and amygdala, cortisol binds with high affinity 
to brain mineralocorticoid receptors and with low affinity to 
brain glucocorticoid receptors ( De Kloet et  al., 1998 ). A high 
cortisol concentration indicates that the URP has not yet been 
effective. In this case, the low-affinity brain glucocorticoid 
receptors are fully occupied, promoting processes such as 
synaptic long-term depression, thereby opposing the consolidation 
of declarative memory and the learning of measures ( Pavlides 
et  al., 1995 ; Peters et  al., 2018 ). This makes sense, because 
the measures that have just been used have not been able to 
resolve the uncertainty, after all. In contrast, low cortisol 
concentrations after a stressful episode indicate that the 
FIGURE 1 |  The uncertainty resolution program (URP). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes beliefs about goal states. Under uncertainty, i.e., when 
all available policies carry a high risk of not attaining the goal states, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activates the URP . The URP involves three subroutines: (1) 
The amygdala via descending pathways activates neurons of the locus coeruleus, which via ascending projections to the cerebral cortex release norepinephrine at 
cortical synapses. Norepinephrine boosts cortical information processing, making information available to reduce uncertainty. (2) The amygdala demands energy 
from the body to support increased cerebral information processing. Via sympathetic efferents, the amygdala strongly suppresses the pancreatic β-cells so that 
insulin secretion is reduced (dashed arrow). This process is called cerebral insulin suppression. At low insulin concentrations, less glucose is available to the muscle 
and fat tissue (which take up glucose in an insulin-dependent manner) than to the brain (which takes up glucose in an insulin-independent manner). (3) The 
amygdala via adrenocorticotropin activates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which feeds back to the cerebral cortex and helps decide which uncertainty 
resolution measures to learn for the future and which not to.

uncertainty could be  resolved and thus, under the influence 
of high-affinity brain mineralocorticoid receptors, consolidation 
of measures is favored, for example, by means of synaptic 
long-term potentiation ( Maggio and Segal, 2007 , 2009). In this 
way, successful measures for eliminating uncertainty are learned 
for use in similar future situations. Overall, the third subroutine 
of the URP is decisive for which measures or strategies will 
continue to be  used in the future and which will not.
In sum, an effective URP searches for and finds a best and 
promising policy, provides the brain with the energy needed 
for the search by drawing on the body stores, and learns the 
selected policy, if it proves successful, for future use ( Peters 
et  al., 2017 ). But if the URP fails, the brain still has a last 
option up its sleeve to reduce uncertainty.
TOLERABLE STRESS
If our goal beliefs cannot be  met, then as a last resort, the 
goal itself may be  changed. It has been shown that changing 
goal priors can indeed reduce uncertainty ( Hartwig et al., 2022). 
However, changing goal priors comes at a significant cost, as 
we have to sacrifice our deepest preferences. There is a growing 
body of evidence that what we  call stress habituation is based 
on this kind of goal-belief change.
Flattening/broadening the probability distribution that reflects 
our goal beliefs, reduces the risk or, in other words, the expected 
variational free energy of the available policies ( Hartwig et  al., 
2022). Here’s how that can be  understood: In the situation 
where all policies fail to meet the preferred states (as indicated 
by the goal prior), the uncertainty for the agent is still high. 
Flattening the goal prior distributes the preferences (probability 
mass of the goal prior) over more states. Thus, there is a 
tendency that flattening the goal prior increases the preference 
of the states attainable by the available policies, in other words, 
the attainable states appear more acceptable to the agent. The 
overall shape of the goal prior is often considered as a Gaussian 
distribution but that is not mandatory for the concept of stress 
habituation (Hartwig et al., 2022). If habituation leads to policies 
being assessed as low risk, the uncertainty of the agent decreases. 
Acceptable states do not require any change or any action. 
Nor is there any longer a need to initiate the URP . Therefore, 
a flattening/broadening of goal priors leads to a lack of stress 
arousals and hormonal responses.
The omission of arousals and hormonal responses is exactly 
what characterizes stress habituation (Peters and McEwen, 2015). 
Stress habitation is defined as a repetition-induced response 
attenuation—neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, neuroenergetic and 
emotional—when agents are exposed to the same (homotypic) 
stressor. Importantly, after habituation to a homotypic stressor, 
the ability to provide a hormonal response to other different 
stressors (heterotypic stressors) is preserved ( Hill et  al., 2010 ).
In the classic habituation experiment, Kirschbaum et  al. 
(1995) exposed probands to a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) 
five times in succession. They found that two-thirds of the 
probands showed a steep cortisol response on the first TSST, 
but had virtually no cortisol response on the second to fifth 
repetitions. These subjects were the ones who habituated to 
stress. The remaining third of the probands showed no such 
response attenuation, and they still showed a potent cortisol 
response even on the fifth occasion. These subjects did not 
habituate. Kirschbaum’s findings indicate that stress habituation 
produces discrete outcomes, i.e., all-or-nothing responses. 
Interestingly, those who habituated (compared to those who 
did not) considered themselves more attractive, had higher 
self-esteem, and were less likely to be  depressed ( Kirschbaum 
et  al., 1995 ). Obviously, people have a different propensity to 
habituate. Whether or not stress habituation occurs depends 
on several factors, for example, the peak cortisol levels during 
the stress event, genetically determined sensitivity of 
glucocorticoid receptors or endocannabinoid receptors ( Fride 
et  al., 2005 ; Malcher-Lopes et  al., 2008 ; Hill et  al., 2011 ; 
McKlveen et  al., 2013 ). Accordingly, habituators show a high 
propensity and non-habituators a low propensity to habituate. 
We have shown recently, that habituation itself is a free-energy-
optimizing process ( Hartwig et  al., 2022 ). Since the propensity 
to habituate varies among people, for some the habituation is 
the free-energy-optimal solution, for others the non-habituation.
The processes of goal preference encoding and stress 
habituation are colocalized in the brain. Experimental findings 
showed that where the goal priors are encoded, namely in 
the vmPFC and orbitofrontal cortex ( Bechara et  al., 2000 ; 
Gottfried et  al., 2003 ; Roesch and Olson, 2004 ; Barron et  al., 
2015), the process of stress habituation is also localized; to 
be  more precise, stress habituation is located in a subdomain 
of the vmPFC, that is, in the mPFC ( Weinberg et  al., 2010 ). 
Because the vmPFC has also been shown to encode the precision 
(inverse variance) of goal priors ( Lebreton et  al., 2015 ), it is 
plausible that habituation by reducing the goal prior’s precision 
leads to the absence of the cortisol responses upon re-exposure 
to the homotypic stressor.
The variational free energy of information theory has a 
pendant in physics, the Helmholtz thermodynamic free energy. 
The two have practically the same mathematical derivation. 
The variational free energy consists of an accuracy term and 
a complexity term.
Complexity costs arise when an update of prior beliefs leads 
to a new posterior belief. These complexity costs are closely 
related to the thermodynamic costs, i.e., the energy consumption 
of the brain ( Sengupta et  al., 2013 ). Sengupta and colleagues 
were able to show that if the information-theoretic variational 
free energy has a minimum (the agent has learned a great 
deal about the world), then the Helmholtz thermodynamic 
free energy has a minimum too (the brain operates in its 
most economical mode; Sengupta et al., 2013). Further theoretical 
work supports the tight entanglement of variational and 
thermodynamic free energy ( Kiefer, 2020 ; Parr et  al., 2020 ). 
Simply put, the better the predictions of the agent’s virtual 
reality model are (as accurate as possible, but not too complex), 
the fewer calories their brain burns.
People who have habituated are prone to exhibit sub-average 
brain energy consumption ( Peters et  al., 2017). This is because 
they experience fewer or no brain-energy-costly stress arousals. 
In contrast, for people who live a good and vibrant life, stressful 
Peters et al. Obesity, Type-2-Diabetes and Free Energy
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931701
episodes that occur from time to time are quite normal. They 
are a manifestation of the activated URP , which helps to 
immediately resolve (sometimes unavoidable) uncertainty. Thus, 
compared to people who live a vibrant and good life, people 
who have habituated to stress hardly show any arousal states, 
which leads to a sub-average energy need of the brain.
To understand what a reduction in brain energy consumption 
means for energy metabolism in the body, it is helpful to 
look at the brain’s energy supply chain. The cerebral supply 
chain is a formalized representation of the Selfish Brain theory 
(Peters and Langemann, 2009). Accordingly, the brain is viewed 
as an end consumer of a supply chain, in which energy flows 
from the environment through the body to the brain. In logistics 
and economics, the mathematical laws of supply chains have 
been known for 70 years ( Slack et  al., 2004 ). These principles 
are applied here to human energy metabolism. The key feature 
of this cerebral supply chain is the brain-pull. The brain-pull 
is the function that enables the brain to actively demand energy 
from the body when needed. The theory test mentioned above 
used three systematic reviews to examine all possible bottlenecks 
within the cerebral supply chain, one bottleneck affecting inflow 
to the whole organism (caloric restriction), one to the brain 
(cerebral artery occlusion), and one to muscle and adipose 
tissue (type 1 diabetes mellitus); the test result was that a 
brain-pull function was indispensable for making accurate 
predictions ( Sprengell et  al., 2021a ,b,c). As examples of 
neuroendocrine mechanisms that take over brain-pull function, 
we  have already mentioned cerebral insulin suppression and 
brain-induced heart rate acceleration. Body-pull is known from 
conventional metabolic models and refers to the function that 
enables the body to demand energy from the environment 
when needed. Body-pull is commonly called ingestive behavior.
When the brain needs less energy, a supply chain build-up 
can occur ( Peters and McEwen, 2015 ). If customers do not 
buy, the shelves stay full. In terms of human energy metabolism, 
this means that if the brain consumes less energy, a corresponding 
reduction in brain-pull function will occur. When cerebral 
insulin suppression is attenuated, β-cells secrete more insulin 
at a given blood glucose level, blood insulin levels rise 
inappropriately, and more glucose is stored in muscle and 
adipose tissue (because peripheral glucose uptake is insulin-
dependent). In this way, hyperinsulinemia promotes the 
accumulation of energy in body stores, and when this occurs 
over years, obesity is likely to result ( Odeleye et  al., 1997 ).
When the body stores are already heavily filled, further 
uptake of glucose into the stores becomes increasingly difficult, 
for two reasons: insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. 
Insulin resistance develops when energy accumulation in muscle 
and fat cells increases the concentration of O-linked 
β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a marker of total cell energy 
content (Ong et al., 2018). O-GlcNAc inhibits insulin-dependent 
glucose uptake via GLUT-4 ( Vosseller et  al., 2002 ).
Relative insulin deficiency occurs when increased O-GlcNAc 
concentrations in muscle and adipose cells stimulate leptin 
release from these tissues ( Wang et  al., 1998 ; Einstein et  al., 
2008); increasing leptin concentrations activate the SNS via a 
hypothalamic circuit, thereby leading to SNS-mediated insulin 
suppression ( Mizuno et  al., 1998 ). SNS-mediated insulin 
suppression, in turn, leads to a relative decrease in blood 
insulin concentration. The combination of insulin resistance 
and relative insulin deficiency makes it difficult for glucose 
to be  stored further in muscle and fat tissue. Of note, both 
insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency are considered 
here to have a common cause, a central nervous event, namely 
a reduction in brain energy consumption induced by stress 
habituation. In this way, habituation can cause energy to 
accumulate in the body, first in adipose tissue and then as 
glucose in the bloodstream. Just as shelves stay full when 
customers do not buy, energy builds up in the body when 
the brain needs less energy. If the blood glucose concentration 
rises above a certain level, type 2 diabetes mellitus is diagnosed.
In summary, stress habituation—by eliminating stress arousals 
and thus lowering brain energy consumption—can lead to a 
build-up in the cerebral supply chain: energy accumulating in 
the body stores in the form of triglycerides promotes the 
development of obesity; energy accumulating in the bloodstream 
in the form of glucose promotes the development of type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Thus, people who habituated are prone to 
develop an obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype.
Acceptable conditions, even if they are hostile to life, do 
not necessarily prompt action to change the situation, as noted 
earlier. For habituated people, their lack of need-for-change 
(resulting from their acceptance of conditions) may contribute 
to their being stuck in precarious circumstances such as poverty 
or low social status. It should be  noted that stress habituation 
is a learning process that identifies situations that can be survived 
without taking action. Stress habituation is a subconscious 
free-energy-optimizing process. Therefore, people who had to 
give up their goal preferences due to stress habituation cannot 
be held responsible for their obese phenotype or their precarious 
social condition. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are also known 
to be associated with poverty and low social status ( Mohammed 
et  al., 2019 ). Experimental evidence has shown that the 
opportunity to move out of poverty areas reduces participants’ 
uncertainty and the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes 
(Ludwig et al., 2011, 2012). On this background, it is conceivable 
that uncertainty and stress lead to stress habituation (in those 
who have a propensity to habituate), with habituation being 
a common cause of staying put in adverse social circumstances 
on the one hand and developing the obese type 2 diabetes 
phenotype on the other.
TOXIC STRESS
If uncertainty cannot be resolved by either the URP or habituation, 
toxic stress arises (Peters et al., 2017). When uncertainty persists 
and expected free energy remains high, the person enters a 
state of recurrent or permanent stress arousal, even at night, 
and this can manifest as insomnia. The agent under toxic 
stress searches for a promising policy, cannot find it, and gets 
frustrated. Unlike a person who habituates and consequently 
becomes passive, the person suffering from toxic stress remains 
in search and still has the chance to find a primary solution, 
Peters et al. Obesity, Type-2-Diabetes and Free Energy
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931701
i.e., a successful measure. Y ou  could also say non-habituators 
bet everything on one card—win or perish. This distinguishes 
them from habituators, who compromise between reducing 
uncertainty and accepting precarious conditions.
People who suffer from toxic stress are prone to exhibit 
an above-average brain energy consumption. In toxic stress, 
the recurrent and permanent brain energy-consuming arousal 
states during the day and the lack of brain energy-saving deep 
sleep at night contribute to the overall increase in total brain 
energy consumption. This is because normally cerebral energy 
consumption is lowered by 40% during deep sleep ( Maquet 
et  al., 1990 ; Boyle et  al., 1994 ). Thus, in a prolonged state of 
high expected free energy, the brain incurs high thermodynamic 
energy costs.
A recurrent or permanent increase in brain energy need 
has far-reaching consequences for energy metabolism in the 
body. Increased cerebral energy need corresponds with increased 
activity of brain-pull mechanisms, especially the aforementioned 
cerebral insulin suppression, brain-induced ketogenesis, and 
brain-induced heart rate acceleration (Peters and McEwen, 2015).
When cerebral insulin suppression is enhanced, β-cells secrete 
less insulin at a given blood glucose level, blood insulin levels 
become inappropriately low, and less glucose is stored in muscle 
and adipose tissue (since the peripheral glucose uptake requires 
insulin). Such limitation of peripheral glucose uptake makes 
sense because the glucose circulating in the blood is now 
available to the brain with its high energy requirements. When 
this preferential allocation of energy to the brain rather than 
to the body continues for longer periods of time, weight loss 
occurs, resulting in a more or less pronounced lean phenotype.
During toxic stress, when glucose uptake into peripheral 
energy stores is severely limited, a build-up of energy in the 
supply chain may occur, but this is different from that which 
occurs after habituation. Under toxic stress, energy accumulates 
in the form of glucose in the bloodstream because glucose 
can hardly enter the peripheral stores. Once the blood glucose 
concentration exceeds a certain level, type 2 diabetes mellitus 
is diagnosed. That psychosocial stress is a cause of type 2 
diabetes mellitus is supported by numerous randomized 
controlled trials: anti-stress interventions such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy lower blood glucose concentrations or 
glycosylated hemoglobin ( Chapman et  al., 2015 ; Xu et  al., 
2021). Taken together, people experiencing toxic stress tend 
to develop a lean type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype.
When toxic stress lasts longer, it leads to the accumulation 
of visceral fat, a hallmark of chronic stress ( Bjorntorp, 2001 ). 
Under the influence of chronic glucocorticoid excess, abdominal 
fat cells divide and become able to take up more glucose ( Kuo 
et  al., 2007 ; Peters and McEwen, 2015 ). In this way, energy 
is stored in the visceral fat tissue in the form of triglycerides. 
Whenever the brain needs extra energy, which is often the 
case under toxic stress, it can draw on this energy store in 
the abdomen. This cerebral energy demand occurs through 
brain-induced ketogenesis, which can be summarized as follows: 
the SNS stimulates visceral adipose tissue to release free fatty 
acids, which are converted in the liver into ketones, serving 
as alternative fuels for the brain. In light of these findings, 
visceral adipose tissue can be  viewed as an outsourced 
extracerebral energy depot that the brain can draw upon when 
it needs energy. Epel et  al. demonstrated in a habituation 
experiment that in women who underwent repeated TSSTs, 
there was a stronger cortisol response in those with increased 
abdominal fat than in those without. This was particularly the 
case in lean women who did not habituate to repeated stress 
(Epel et  al., 2000 ). In all, chronic toxic stress can lead to the 
development of the lean-but-wide-waisted type 2 
diabetes phenotype.
When the brain-induced heart rate acceleration persists 
under toxic stress, it can have detrimental effects on the 
cardiovascular system ( Peters et  al., 2017 ). Blood circulating 
at high velocity through the vascular system can cause 
turbulences, especially at the arterial bifurcations ( Malek et  al., 
1999). At these predilection sites, turbulences can trigger 
mechanisms that can lead to plaque formation, atherosclerosis, 
and, in the worst case, myocardial infarction or stroke ( Stone 
et  al., 2012 ). There is strong evidence that people with the 
lean-but-wide-waisted phenotype have the greatest cardiovascular 
risk and the obese-but-narrow-waisted phenotype have the least 
(Berentzen et  al., 2010 ; Petursson et  al., 2011 ; Cameron et  al., 
2012; Hamer and Stamatakis, 2012; Ortega et al., 2013; Krakauer 
and Krakauer, 2014 ; Hu et  al., 2018 ; Berglund et  al., 2019 ; 
Kim et  al., 2019 ; Kubera et  al., 2022 ). That psychosocial stress 
is a cause of myocardial infarction is supported by two 
randomized controlled trials: an anti-stress program, i.e., cognitive 
behavioral therapy, could lower the incidence of cardiovascular 
events and mortality ( Orth-Gomer et  al., 2009 ; Gulliksson 
et  al., 2011 ).
Non-habituated and habituated individuals show the 
following differences.
While stressed non-habituated individuals are more likely 
to exhibit the wide waisted phenotype (accumulation of visceral 
fat), habituated individuals do not display glucocorticoid excess, 
which would promote visceral fat accumulation, and therefore 
more likely retain the narrow waisted phenotype ( Peters and 
McEwen, 2015). In addition, stressed non-habituated individuals 
lose subcutaneous fat and tend to become lean, whereas 
habituated individuals accumulate subcutaneous fat and tend 
to gain weight. In short, non-habituators are prone to develop 
the lean-but-wide-waisted phenotype, habituators the obese-
but-narrow-waisted phenotype. Because habituation is specific 
and only ever relates to a particular homotypic stressor, 
someone may habituate to one stressor at work but not to 
another homotypic stressor at home. Such a case would result 
in a mixed phenotype, obese with a wide waist (i.e., body 
mass and waist circumference increased). That is, interaction 
between a complex environment and a non-homogeneous 
population (consisting of habituators and non-habituators) can 
result in a wide range of phenotypes: at one end of the 
spectrum, the lean-but-wide-waisted phenotype with high 
cardiovascular risk; at the other end, the obese-but-narrow-
waisted phenotype with low cardiovascular risk; at the two 
ends, the lean and obese phenotypes, respectively, both with 
an equally high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( Feller 
et  al., 2010 ).

CONCLUSION
In this article, we  understand stress as a state of uncertainty 
or, in technical terms, a state with heightened expected 
variational free energy. We  outlined how the brain has two 
options to reduce uncertainty or expected free energy. First, 
the brain can use an URP (stress arousal, SNS and HPA-axis 
response, control of learning) to immediately reduce uncertainty 
and learn successful measures. If the URP is successful, the 
agent experiences good stress. When the URP fails, stress 
habituation is an alternative for some—but not all—people 
to reduce uncertainty. We  show evidence that habituation 
minimizes free energy by a flattening/broadening of goal 
preferences. Reducing the precision of goal preferences (i.e., 
goal priors) means that the agent accepts adverse (previously 
untenable) states, such as lower social status or poverty. People 
who habituated experience tolerable stress. We  detailed how 
habituation decreases the average brain energy consumption, 
what in the long run may lead to the development of the 
obese type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype. In some stressed 
people, no habituation occurs because for them habituation 
itself is not the free-energy optimal solution; in these cases, 
toxic stress results. Toxically stressed people have been searching 
in vain for a way out of their uncertainty, but at least they 
still have a chance to find that way out, e.g., through the 
help of others. Toxic stress increases the average brain energy 
consumption, what in the long run can lead to the development 
of lean-but-wide-waisted type 2 diabetes mellitus. An increased 
brain energy consumption, by overloading the cardiovascular 
system, can also lead to the development of myocardial infarction 
and stroke.
By linking the free energy of information theory with that 
of thermodynamics, brain energy need comes into focus. 
Cerebral energy metabolism can be  understood as bridging 
the gap between uncertainty and metabolic disease. In the 
conventional models of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
cerebral energy need was not even considered as a factor. 
However, systematic theory testing revealed that the postulate 
of a brain that actively demands energy according to its needs 
is probably true ( Sprengell et  al., 2021a ,b,c). Future research 
should clarify the extent to which the newly identified factor 
of erebral energy need contributes (completely, partially or 
not at all) to the observed increases in body mass and blood 
glucose concentrations.
In summary, using the principle of free energy, we  have 
shown three different ways in which the brain can deal with 
uncertainty and what consequences this can have for the body, 
such as obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus.
