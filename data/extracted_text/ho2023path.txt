Conﬂicts are increasingly intensiﬁed among the members of the community,
making it almost impossible to extend compassion—deﬁned as a wi sh to relieve
others from suﬀering—from one side to the other, especially wh en both sides
believe that “life is a battle of us the good vs. them the evil.” Is compassion
even relevant to conﬂicts? The answer depends on how a conﬂict is fr amed in
one’s perception. If a conﬂict is perceived in a frame of zero-sum co mpetition,
then compassion is meaningless in such a “tug-of-war” mindset. C onversely, if
perceived in a non-zero-sum frame—as demonstrated in reiter ated prisoner’s
dilemma (rPD) in which two players may interdependently render win–win, lose–
lose, win–lose, or lose–win scenarios by their actions—then comp assion can help
achieve the most preferable outcomes for all in a “dyadic dance” m indset. In this
article, we present a path of intuitive compassion by pointing t o symmetry across
three distinct domains of rPD, dyadic active inference, and Mahayan a Buddhism. In
each of these domains, conﬂicts serve as points of bifurcation on a bidirectional
path, and compassion as a conﬂict-proof commitment to carrying out the best
strategies—even if assessed for one’s own sake only—that cons istently produce
optimal payoﬀs in rPD, minimal stress in dyadic active infere nce, and limitless joy of
ultimate enlightenment in Mahayana Buddhism. Conversely, a lack of compassion
is caused by invalid beliefs that obscure the nature of reality i n these domains,
causing conﬂicts to produce even more conﬂicts. These invalid beli efs are
produced by mistakes of over-reduction, over-separation, and o ver-compression
in the mind, and therefore, a person’s mindset is overly compr essed from a
multidimensional frame to a one-dimensional frame. Taken to gether, intuitive
compassion is not about how to balance one’s self-serving goals with altruistic
ones. Rather, it is a conﬂict-proof commitment to transforming co nﬂicts into
enduring peace and prosperity according to the ultimate nature of reality. The
work presented here may serve as a preliminary science-informe d introduction
to a genre of time-tested compassion meditations, i.e., lojong mind training, for
the world laden with conﬂicts, starting from the conﬂicts in close re lationships to
those in geopolitics.

/one.tnum. Introduction
From two kids competing for a toy to two countries competing
for land, conﬂicts are ubiquitous in communities, either big or
small. By conﬂict, we focus on any zero-sum competition between
two sides in which a gain for one side means a loss for the other
(so the sum for both is equal to zero). By community, we refer
to a group of interdependent entities living together in a speciﬁc
sphere of existence, ranging from a household to the whole planet.
Of course, conﬂicts are only the tip of the iceberg of deeper systemic
problems in a community, and therefore, conﬂicts will not cease
until the underlying problems are addressed and cease to exist.
Unfortunately, eﬀorts to create social and economic conditions that
favor cooperation and care over dominance and control are often
met with great diﬃculty (
Gilbert, 2021 ). There are many threats
to the unity of a community, either coming from inside, such as
a few elites exploiting the rest of the community in a winner-
takes-it-all manner (
Giridharadas, 2019 ), or from outside, such as
disinformation campaigns by hostile foreign entities weakening the
cohesion and unity at home (
U. S. Department of State et al., 2022 ).
When more people are frustrated by various systemic problems,
people will look for quick solutions to ﬁx the problems in polarizing
ways. However, actions to ﬁx outer problems may originate from
problems within our mind such that conﬂicts may be proliferated
by those actions. Unfortunately, when community members are
too occupied in in-ﬁghting, they fail to be united against their
common threats and, conversely, their common threats will exploit
any in-ﬁghting to further weaken their community. For example,
people in the United States are overexposed to disinformation-
saturated social media to the extent that there is no consensus
on almost all public aﬀairs, e.g., abortion right, gun right, climate
change crisis, universal healthcare, vaccination, mask wearing, or
even the legitimacy of the results of the 2020 Presidential election
in the society. Polarization is at a historical high with deep and
extensive partisan antipathy (
Pew Research Center, 2014 ), and such
divide grows even wider when facing the COVID-19 pandemic—
the supposedly common threat that should have united the people
(
Pew Research Center, 2020 ). Public trust in the government
has been eroding over decades, and ironically, a political party
member’s trust in government can go higher or lower, depending
on whether the president is one of us or them, respectively (
Pew
Research Center, 2022 ). Many people in the United States seem to
be inﬂuenced by the meme of “ life is a battle of us the good and them
the evil ”. As this meme is a mixture of “good intention” (caring for
others) and “bad idea” (at the expense of the opponent’s humanity)
(
Lukianoﬀ and Haidt, 2018 ), a ﬁrm grip of it may proliferate, rather
than eliminate, conﬂicts.
As problem-solving requires a community to weather
through one conﬂict after another until underlying problems
are appropriately addressed and uprooted, each conﬂict in the
community is like a steppingstone on a bidirectional path (refer to
Figure 1 for an illustration). How community members walk on
each steppingstone will decide which direction they are heading on
the path, either forward to a future with fewer conﬂicts and more
peace and prosperity or backward to the opposite. To strengthen
the capacity of members in a community to move in a desirable
direction on the path is to give the community a ﬁghting chance to
uproot its problems underlying conﬂicts.
FIGURE /one.tnum
An illustration of a path for a dyadic relationship like reitera ted
prisoner’s dilemma. The central double-arrow ribbon symbolizes
the bidirectional path for movement of a dyadic relationship suc h as
that between players in a reiterated prisoner’s dilemma. Insi de the
ribbon, irregular shapes symbolize conﬂicts as stepping stones on
the path, wherein each conﬂict means that there is a win–lose or
lose–win scenario happening in the reiterated prisoner’s dile mma.
The footprints on those stepping stones symbolize a player’s
movement in a direction from bottom to top, showing that the
conﬂict density would decrease along the way, probably due to his
or her practice of Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness strategy. The icon on
the upper left corner indicates that the nature of the reiterat ed
prisoner’s dilemma is non-zero-sum, like a multidimensional dan ce.
The icon on the lower right corner indicates that the nature of the
reiterated prisoner’s dilemma is misattributed to zero-sum, l ike a
one-dimensional tug-or-war.
Along this line, previously, we postulated the neural basis
underlying the bifurcation of conﬂict response in a dyadic
active inference framework and introduced compassion as an
intervention that aims to ensure that each conﬂict response is
heading in the right direction (
Ho et al., 2021 ).
In this article, we add the Game Theory of reiterated prisoner’s
dilemma (rPD) ( Poundstone, 1992 ) to our previous work and
present a path of intuitive compassion (PIC) that points to a
symmetry across three distinct domains, namely, rPD, dyadic active
inference, and Mahayana Buddhism. We describe these domains
in the following order, with a geometric form, i.e., a regular
tetrahedron, to represent their theoretical and practical symmetry
in
Figure 2.
The ﬁrst domain is the theory and practice of rPD. rPD
demonstrates that mutual cooperation is not only evolutionarily
plausible but also preferable under certain circumstances.
In practice, a strategy, i.e., Tit-for-Tat with forgiveness
(TTF), is mathematically proven to yield the most favorable
outcomes in rPD. The theory and practice aspects of rPD are

FIGURE /two.tnum
A regular tetrahedron as a geometric representation of the
symmetry across domains of rPD, dyadic process, and Mahayana
Buddhism. There are six sides of equal length in a regular
tetrahedron, with three sides that form the bottom (A/one.tnum, B/one.tnum, and
C/one.tnum)—representing the theoretical aspects of rPD, dyadic processes,
and Mahayana Buddhism, respectively—and three sides that p oint
toward the apex of the regular tetrahedron (A/two.tnum, B/two.tnum, and
C/two.tnum)—representing the practical aspects of rPD, dyadic processes,
and Mahayana Buddhism, respectively. The symmetry in the
theoretical aspects is represented by the basal regular trian gle that is
formed by A/one.tnum, B/one.tnum, and C/one.tnum: A/one.tnum refers to interactive payoﬀ matrices
and associated mathematical requirements in rPD; B/one.tnum refers to
dyadic processes modeled as two strongly coupled active inferenc e
engines; and C/one.tnum refers to the wisdom that directly realizes the
ultimate nature of reality according to Mahayana Buddhism.
Likewise, the symmetry in the practical aspects is represen ted by
those apex-oriented sides, A/two.tnum, B/two.tnum, and C/two.tnum: A/two.tnum refers to the best
winning TTF-like strategies in rPD; B/two.tnum refers to the methods to
maintain a conﬂict-proof intersubjectivity in strongly coupled dyads;
and C/two.tnum refers to a path that inseparably combines compassion and
wisdom. The unity of the regular tetrahedron is made possible
because all three domains are fundamentally based on the same
ultimate nature of reality, i.e., eﬀects are the interactiv e products of
causes by conditions.
represented as the sides A1 and A2 of the regular tetrahedron in
Figure 2, respectively.
The second domain is the theory and practice of dyadic
processes. We re-introduce our dyadic active inference
model and explain how invalid beliefs can hijack a person’s
active inference engine. In practice, we introduce key dyadic
concepts underlying intersubjectivity and stress reduction
that are highly analogous to TTF-like strategies in rPD.
The theory and practice aspects of dyadic processes are
represented as the sides B1 and B2 of the regular tetrahedron in
Figure 2, respectively.
The third domain is the theory and practice of Mahayana
Buddhism. We introduce classic texts by two co-founders of
Mahayana Buddhism, i.e., Aryas Nagarjuna and Asanga, in the
context of rPD and dyadic active inference. In practice, we
introduce a genre of meditations, i.e., lojong mind training. Like
a peacock that feeds on poisons to transform poisons into splendor,
a well-versed lojong practitioner feeds on conﬂicts to transform
conﬂicts into peace. We identify key premises underlying lojong
practices. The theory and practice aspects of Mahayana Buddhism
are represented as the sides C1 and C2 of the regular tetrahedron in
Figure 2, respectively.
/two.tnum. Theory and practice in reiterated
prisoner’s dilemma
The art of transforming conﬂicts starts from developing the
discernment of zero-sum vs. non-zero-sum mindsets in which one
perceives conﬂicts. We use a one-dimensional tug-of-war as the
working metaphor for the former and a multidimensional dyadic
dance for the latter. In a tug-of-war (and many sport games),
the outcome of the game (winner and loser) is decided by the
diﬀerence between two opposing teams’ performances, so the best
strategy is to conquer (out-perform) the opponent. In contrast, in a
dyadic dance, the outcome of the game depends on the interaction
between two players’ games, as demonstrated in the prisoner’s
dilemma (
Poundstone, 1992).
In prisoner’s dilemma, two gang members, namely, Alice and
Bob, are caught by the police, and the police do not have suﬃcient
evidence to convict both of them on the principal charge, so they
oﬀer Alice and Bob a binary choice, either betraying their partner
(Defect) or remain silent (Cooperate). The outcomes (payoﬀs) of
Alice and Bob’s plays consist of two scenarios that are fair to
both Alice and Bob (a win–win and a lose–lose scenario) and two
scenarios that are unfair to either Alice or Bob (a win–lose and a
lose–win scenario) as follows.
(1) The win–win scenario: If both Alice and Bob remain silent
(Cooperate), they will receive an equal amount of payoﬀ, e.g.,
both serving 1 year in prison on a lesser charge. In this case,
the Payoﬀ for Alice and Bob is denoted as (R, R), respectively,
where R = −1.
(2) The lose–lose scenario: If both of them betray the partner
(Defect), Alice and Bob will receive an equal amount of payoﬀ,
e.g., both serving 2 years in prison, denoted as (P , P), where P
= −2.
(3) The win–lose scenario (unfair to Bob): If Alice defects but Bob
cooperates, Alice will receive a greedy payoﬀ (G) (e.g., be set
free, G = 0) and Bob will receive an unfairly punishing payoﬀ
(U) (e.g., serve 3 years in prison, U = −3). The payoﬀ for Alice
and Bob is denoted as (G, U), respectively, where (G, U) =
(0, −3).
(4) The lose–win scenario (unfair to Alice): If Alice cooperates but
Bob defects, Alice will serve 3 years in prison (U) and Bob will
be set free (G), denoted as (U, G), where (U, G) = (−3, 0).
The generalized payoﬀ matrix is listed in
Table 1. The values in the
payoﬀ matrix follow the order:
G > R > P > U
Note that in the example given above, the payoﬀ is measured as
(−1) times the number of years to serve in prison, i.e., (G, R, P , U)
= (0, −1, −2, −3).
When the same two players play PD repeatedly over time and
they can remember the opponent’s immediately preceding play, as

in a Markov chain, rPD is at play. An additional requirement
2R > G + U
is needed to make rPD in favor of the win–win scenario relative
to other scenarios. This additional requirement “makes the pie
bigger” for the win–win scenario than that in the win–lose and
lose–win scenarios, as the sum of the payoﬀs for Alice and Bob
in the win–win scenario (2R) is greater than those in the win–lose
and lose–win scenarios (G + U). For each player, this additional
requirement can make the repetition of mutual cooperation (i.e.,
expected payoﬀ = R) more preferable to alternating between win–
lose and lose–win indeﬁnitely [i.e., expected payoﬀ = (G + U)/2].
This additional requirement is the key that leads to enduring peace—
meaning that there is no cyclic conﬂict between Alice and Bob—and
prosperity— meaning that both Alice and Bob will gain more than
otherwise—in rPD .
In the prisoner’s dilemma, the payoﬀ is not solely determined
by one’s own play unilaterally, as Axelrod stated:
“...what is best depends in part on what the other player is
likely to be doing. Further, what the other is likely to be doing
may well depend on what the player expects you to do. ”(Axelrod,
1984)
Essentially, a player’s payoﬀ in rPD is consistent with the notion
in Madhyamaka Buddhist Philosophy that eﬀect is an interactive
product of cause by condition (
Ho et al., 2022 ), denoted as follows.
Eﬀect = Cause×Condition
Here, the eﬀect is one player’s payoﬀ, the cause is the player’s own
play (Cooperate or Defect), and the condition is the opponent’s play
(Cooperate or Defect). So, the payoﬀ for Alice and Bob is denoted as
Payoﬀ(Alice) = Play(Alice)×Play(Bob)
Payoﬀ(Bob) = Play(Bob)×Play(Alice)
In practice, there are several archetypical strategies in playing
rPD, including Random, Cooperator, Defector, Alternator, Nice-
unless-Grumpy, and Tit-for-Tat. In Random, the play of Cooperate
or Defect is chosen randomly. In Cooperator, the player always
cooperates. In Defector, the player always defects. In Alternator,
the player alternates between cooperating and defecting. In Nice-
unless-Grumpy, the player defects only after a certain level of
grumpiness that increases when the opponent defects and decreases
when the opponent cooperates. In Tit-for-Tat, the player starts
with a cooperative play and, starting the second trial, its current
play (“tit”) simply mimics what the opponent did the last time
(“tat”). When diﬀerent strategies are pitted against each other
in tournaments repeatedly, Tit-for-Tat robustly emerges as the
winning strategy over and over again, demonstrating the value of
(1) not being the ﬁrst to defect, (2) being somewhat forgiving, and
(3) being provokable in the sense that the opponent’s ﬁrst defection
will be surely retaliated by choosing the play of Defect (
Axelrod,
1980a,b).
However, even if both players jointly adopt the Tit-for-Tat
strategy, they are prone to a “death spiral” where a one-time, single-
bit error in either player’s play, e.g., when one agent defects and
the opponent cooperates, will lead to a never-ending alternating
scenario between cooperation and defection, yielding a lower
expected payoﬀ, (G + U)/2, than the expected payoﬀ, R, of repeated
mutual cooperation. To escape this “death spiral”, a strategy called
“Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness” (TTF) can be employed. In this
modiﬁed strategy, when the opponent defects, a player employing
this TTF strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next play
despite the opponent’s play on the previous trial, and the exact
probability that a player will forgive the opponent’s defection
depends on his or her opponent’s behaviors. To maintain the
reciprocity, the opponent’s very ﬁrst defection will not be forgiven
in TTF.
TTF-like strategies in rPD appear to have the following features
(
Axelrod, 1984):
1. Nice: A successful player shall not be the ﬁrst to defect.
This feature prevents the player from getting into
unnecessary trouble.
2. Reciprocating: A successful player must reciprocate both
cooperation and defection, and therefore, it should be provoked
by the very ﬁrst defection by the opponent and consequently
retaliate against the opponent’s defection in the previous play,
except occasional forgiveness. This feature discourages the
opponent from persistently trying to defect.
3. Forgiving: A successful player must also be forgiving sometimes,
despite the fact that the opponent just defected in the previous
play. This feature helps restore mutual cooperation and reduce
the likelihood that both parties will get into long runs of revenge
and counter-revenge.
4. Non-envious: A successful player is not envious of the other
player’s success, i.e., not striving to score more payoﬀ than
the opponent.
Due to the clarity of the behaviors of a player employing TTF, other
players in a tournament will come to adapt to TTF as well (
Axelrod,
1984). The contagiousness of TTF has been corroborated in rPD
tournaments that used machine-learning algorithms to simulate the
evolution of rPD (
Surma, 2019).
In summary, when conditions are suitable (i.e., G > R > P > U
and 2R > G + U in the payoﬀ matrix), TTF-like strategies are not
only evolutionarily plausible but also robustly preferable for both
players to earn as much payoﬀ as possible in practicality, as noted
in the book “the evolution of cooperation” (
Axelrod, 1984):
“If a nice strategy, such as TIT FOR TAT, does eventually
come to be adopted by virtually everyone, then individuals using
this nice strategy can aﬀord to be generous in dealing with
any[sic] others. In fact, a population of nice rules can also protect
Frontiers in Psychology /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
itself from clusters of individuals using any other strategy just as
well as they can protect themselves against single individuals...
These results give a chronological picture for[sic] the evolution
of cooperation. Cooperation can begin with small clusters. It
can thrive with rules that are nice, provocable, and somewhat
forgiving. And once established in a population, individuals
using such discriminating strategies can protect themselves from
invasion. The overall level of cooperation tends to go up and
not down. In other words, the machinery for the evolution of
cooperation contains a ratchet. ”
(Axelrod, 1984)
Based on the analysis described earlier, we postulate the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: When two players are engaged in an rPD-like
relationship, a player’s commitment to following TTF-like
strategies will ensure the possibility to transform conﬂicts
(alternating between win–lose and lose–win scenarios) into
enduring peace and prosperity (repeated win–win scenarios).
/three.tnum. Theory and practice in dyadic active
inference
Symmetrically, the four properties of TTF-like strategies,
namely, nice, reciprocate, forgiving, and non-envious, are highly
consistent with the principles that we have identiﬁed in our active
inference framework for dyadic interactions, i.e., maintaining
symbiotic benevolence and mitigating problems of under-coupling
and over-mentalizing to promote stress reduction, compassion, and
intersubjectivity, and we have elucidated underlying neural and
theoretical bases in a series of articles (
Ho et al., 2020 , 2021, 2022).
For a very brief introduction of dyadic active inference, refer to
Box 1. We hereby summarize the take-home messages from our
previous work and then refute the validity of the meme of “us the
good vs. them the evil” accordingly.
/three.tnum./one.tnum. Summary of take-home messages from
our previous work
/three.tnum./one.tnum./one.tnum. A person is an active inference engine
An active inference model is a formal model postulating
that a living entity, e.g., a person, is functionally an active
inference engine that strives to adapt to the environment by
minimizing variational free energy that arises through surprises
during person–environment interactions. In its simplest form, the
person–environment interactions can be modeled as interactions
between external states and the person, and the person can be
modeled as an active inference engine consisting of sensory states,
active states, and internal states. The sensory and active states of an
active inference engine serve as an interface with the environments,
including another person in dyadic interaction. The internal state
does not directly interact with the environment and contains prior
beliefs, plans, policies, or strategies that are updated and optimized
through a surprise minimization process (
Ho et al., 2022 ). Refer to
Figure 3A for an active inference model of a person and Figure 3B
for a heuristic application of this model to a player in PD.
/three.tnum./one.tnum./two.tnum. Dyadic coupling between active inference
engines and emerging conditional independence
between self and other
Parent–child interactions are essential for the development
of a person, which means that dyadic processes (person–person
interactions) are key to the development of an active inference
engine. Although the duality of self and others emerges as a result
of apparent conditional independence between two active inference
engines, all persons and their environments are functionally
connected interdependently when they are placed in a strongly
coupled state. Thus, the apparent duality—a person who exists
independently of the rest of the world—is just an illusion (
Ho et al.,
2022). As it is explained later, not realizing the illusory conditional
independence between self and others in dyadic interactions is a
mistake of over-separation.
/three.tnum./one.tnum./three.tnum. Two states of an active inference engine
Active inference engines can appear to function in two distinct
states, namely, a strongly coupled state and a weakly coupled state
(
Ho et al., 2022 ). When two persons’ active inference engines are
entangled in the strongly coupled state, the input to one person’s
sensory states is predominantly coming from the output from the
other person’s active states, and vice versa. When the surprise is
minimized during this strongly coupled state, one person’s internal
states are approximating the other person’s internal states, reaching
a high level of intersubjectivity—subject–subject understanding of
covert events of one’s intentions or feelings (
Ho et al., 2022 ). A high
level of intersubjectivity enables two persons to understand one
another’s internal beliefs, plans, policies, or strategies underlying
their overt behaviors. Notably, due to the strong coupling, the dyad
will imitate one another’s actions in a way that is the hallmark
of TTF-like strategies in rPD. Refer to
Figure 4 for a heuristic
model of two active inference engines that are strongly coupled in
the context of rPD. Conversely, when an active inference engine
is not strongly coupled with another active inference engine, it
will reside in a weakly coupled state. In the weakly coupled state,
an active inference engine will perceive the world from a self-
centered, egoistic perspective, as if the observer were independent
of the observed objects that are not relationally interacting with the
observer (
Ho et al., 2022 ).
/three.tnum./one.tnum./four.tnum. The active inference engine is hijacked by
invalid beliefs in dyadic processes
While it is normal for an active inference engine to alternate
between a strongly coupled state and a weakly coupled state,
it would be a problem if a person fails to establish suﬃcient
intersubjectivity during its strong coupling with another person.
If an active inference engine fails to maintain the strong coupling
in a dyadic interaction, the surprise, which is proportional to the
stress perceived by an active inference engine (
Peters et al., 2017 ),
will become excessive and, therefore, harmful to the dyad ( Ho

BOX /one.tnum Dyadic active inference framework.
As described with more details previously ( Ho et al., 2022 ), according to Free-Energy Principle (FEP), a living organism is a self-organizing system that maintains its
characteristic phenotypic states and avoids surprising devia tions from these expected states by generative processes that are self-organizing and self-evidencing ( Friston,
2013; Ramstead et al., 2020 ; Friston et al., 2022 ). As the physical, biological processes of an organism embody it s “best guess” about its environments, on average and
over time, the organism tends be attracted to a limited number of attractor states in the space of all possible states, with low en tropy or spread in the probability density
over the space of possible states, i.e., low variational free ene rgy. Variational free energy is a measure of the upper bound of s urprise or prediction error—the diﬀerence
between the organism’s “best guess” beliefs about what cause d its sensory states and what it observes. The FEP leverages th e principle of surprise minimization to
optimize the prior beliefs in the active inference engine by min imizing variational free energy—the upper bound of surprise. T here are two ways to minimize variational
free energy, namely, perceptual inference and active inferenc e. In perceptual inference, agents strive to update their prior b eliefs, while in active inference, agents change
their environment (or their sampling of information from the e nvironment) by selecting a plan or policy in a set of prior beliefs tha t would yield the least expected free
energy (Peters et al., 2017 ). Notably, in FEP , the variational free energy is more of a fun ction of beliefs and expectations in the internal states, rath er than a function of the
environments hidden from the internal states ( Ramstead et al., 2020 ). In such processes, internal and active states’ dynamics ar e a function of, and only of, a variational
free energy bound on surprise, and the belief optimization is im plicitly done in the minimization of variational and expected fr ee energy ( Friston et al., 2022 ).
The notion of active inference emphasizes that actions solici t a sensory outcome that informs approximate posterior beliefs a bout external states of the world. Such
generative process in FEP renders a living organism to be partic ipatory, or enactive in soliciting and, therefore, co-creati ng its perception of the external states, which is
very diﬀerent from a representationalist process by which exte rnal states generate sensory states exclusively ( Friston et al., 2022 ). Heuristically, one may consider that an
active inference engine is actively self-evidencing what the world should be (known as an enactive account), rather than pass ively learning to represent what the world
seems to be (known as a representationalist account)—a distin ction that has been elaborated in the literature ( Ramstead et al., 2020 ).
Inspired by FEP ( Friston, 2013 ), we suggest that a person can be formally modeled as an active inf erence engine in a multi-level network consisting of four node s,
namely, nodes of sensory states (S), active states (A), inter nal states (I), and external states or events (E). This netwo rk is partitioned into an external state (E) and an
active inference engine that consists of the nodes (S) and (A ) at a lower level and node (I) at a higher level (see Figure 3.
We need a dyadic active inference model of two agents that are strongly coupled to model dyadic interactions. Just like ice and water are two phases of the same H /two.tnumO
molecules that behave distinctly (solid and liquid, respectively), the same active inference engine can behave very diﬀerently b etween the phases of weakly coupled and
strongly coupled states—while an active inference engine maint ains conditional independence between its internal and exte rnal states in a weakly coupled state, such
conditional independence is diminished in a strongly coupled st ate, when its external states are no longer a unitary node (E), but rather another active inference engine,
such that one engine’s active states (A) serve as a primary sou rce of input to the other engine’s sensory states (S), and vice versa. In the most strongly coupled state, one
person’s active states will become total environmental inputs for the other person’s sensory states, and vice versa (see Figure 4).
According to our previous work ( Ho et al., 2020 , 2022), we have identiﬁed three inter-related problems that that may impair dyadic interactions that, fortunately, can be
mitigated by eﬀective dyadic interventions: (1) deﬁcient relational benevolence due to invalid beliefs, (2) under-coupli ng, and (3) over-mentalizing, as follows:
1) Deﬁcient relational benevolence: invalid beliefs prevents the awareness of relational benevolenc e. As depicted in Figure 4, when two persons (e.g., Alice and Bob as
Players 1 and 2 in rPD) are strongly coupled ( A1 ≈ S2 and A2 ≈ S1), the variational free energy is minimized collectively if, and only if, the surprise (prediction errors)
in one person is minimized without increasing the other’s. Th erefore, Player 1 can achieve intersubjectivity by minimizi ng his or her variational free energy through
communicative interactions with Player 2, wherein Player 1’s prior belief would approximate Player 2’s prior beliefs ( I1 ≈ I2). We have postulated that invalid beliefs
(Vikalpas) will diminish the awareness of relational benevolence and of t he prior beliefs of each person’s active inference engine ( Ho et al., 2021 ).
2) Problem of under-coupling: Under-coupling increases variational free energy . As depicted in Figure 5, when Player 1 engages Player 2’s overt behaviors only, Player 1
may reduce Player 2, who serves as Player 1’s external states, t o a unitary object without its own inner states such as feeling s and prior beliefs. Thus, Player 1 would fail to
achieve intersubjectivity and ﬁnd it diﬃcult to reduce stres s in either party. For example, when Alice neglects to see that her pla ys cause Bob to feel negatively and only
focuses on how to out-perform Bob, Alice would fail to recognize Bob’s attempts to reduce Bob’s own variational free energy and therefore Alice’s variational free energy
during dyadic interactions would increase.
3) Problem of over-mentalizing: Over-mentalizing can perpetuate impairments of dyadic interac tions. Over-mentalizing can happen
when cyclic conﬂicts render players
defensive against one another repeatedly and, therefore, mis attributing the other player’s defections to malice or charact er ﬂaw rather than his or her ignorance of the
best strategies that involve reciprocal benevolence. Conceptu al thoughts ( Vikalpas) are responsible for the problem of over-mentalizing.
when they hijack the active inference engine, causing problems of
under-coupling and over-mentalizing during the time of dyadic
interactions (
Ho et al., 2022 ). We postulated that invalid beliefs
are nothing but invalid conceptual thoughts ( vikalpas in Sanskrit)
that are enshrouded in our systems by the working of mental
fabrication/proliferation ( prapañca in Sanskrit) (
Ho et al., 2021 ),
described later.
/three.tnum./one.tnum./five.tnum. A hijacked active inference engine is
burdened with excessive stress and weariness
It has been established that chronic stress can accelerate
mental and physical weariness and aging (
McEwen, 2012 ).
Furthermore, stress can be conceived as a result of excessive
variational free energy in an active inference engine (
Peters
et al., 2017 ). Stress arising in dyadic interactions can become
excessive if an active inference engine is hijacked by invalid
beliefs (
Ho et al., 2020 ). Although stress in dyadic interactions
can interfere with decision-making ( Ho et al., 2014 ) and caring
behaviors ( Kim et al., 2015 ), it can also be mitigated through
dyadic interventions, as supported by our neuroimaging studies
(
Swain et al., 2017 ; Ho et al., 2020 ) and systematic review
on the eﬃcacy of parenting interventions on parenting stress
(
Ho et al., 2022 ).
/three.tnum./one.tnum./six.tnum. The post-conﬂict bifurcation between two
incompatible paths
Previously, we identiﬁed an entry point of bifurcation between
two incompatible post-conﬂict responses for an individual: (a)
attuning to the counterparts’ perspectives and needs despite the
conﬂicts and (b) blocking the attunement to the counterparts due
to the conﬂicts. The post-conﬂict paths diverge depending on the
presence or absence of the valid view of the ultimate nature of
reality—that the conﬂict and its solution are eﬀects of an interactive
product of cause by condition. In our previous work, we described
the potential neural basis underlying these two paths (
Ho et al.,
2021). We describe the post-conﬂict bifurcation in the context of
rPD later.

(A) An active inference model and its environments: in an active in ference model, an adaptive person functions as an active inferen ce
engine—consisting of nodes Active State (A), Sensory State (S), and Internal State (I) (solid circles)—interacting with ext ernal events in the
environments, node External State (E) (dashed circle). In a hi erarchical network, (E) represents events from environments at a n external level, (S)
represents the person’s aﬀerent sensory state, and (A) represe nts the person’s eﬀerent active state, both at a lower level, and ( I) represents the
person’s prior beliefs at a higher level. Nodes (E) and (I) do not have direct eﬀects on one another, as they are separated by nodes (A) an d (S). The
double-arrowed line between (A) and (S) indicates the notion of a ctive inference, that actions solicit a sensory outcome that infor ms approximate
posterior beliefs in the internal states (I) about the external s tates (E). This is done by minimizing variational free energy—th e upper bound of surprise

/three.tnum./two.tnum. Refuting “life is a battle of us the good
vs. them the evil”
Here we conduct a logical analysis to refute the notion of
“life is a battle of us the good vs. them the evil ”. According to
the work by Arya Asanga (circa 380 CE), there are eight types
of conceptual thoughts ( vikalpas in Sanskrit) and three kinds of
mental fabrication/proliferation processes ( prapañcas in Sanskrit)
that obscure the realization of ultimate reality (
Asanga, 2016 , p.
89–96), as follows.
The eight types of invalid conceptual thoughts ( vikalpas) are
as follows:
Type 1. The conceptual thought that conceives of an
essential nature.
Type 2. The conceptual thought that conceives of a
distinguishing characteristic.
Type 3. The conceptual thought that grasps a collection (of
distinguishing characteristics) as a separate entity.
Type 4. The conceptual thought that conceives of an “I”.
Type 5. The conceptual thought that conceives of entities as
being “mine”.
Type 6. The conceptual thought that conceives of entities as
being agreeable.
Type 7. The conceptual thought that conceives of entities as
being disagreeable.
Type 8. The conceptual thought that conceives of entities as
being neither agreeable nor disagreeable, thus leading
to an attitude of indiﬀerence toward it.
The three levels of mental fabrication/proliferation processes
(prapañca) are as follows:
Level I. This level of substance provides a basis for the ﬁrst
three types of vikalpas (Types 1–3). These three
types are beliefs that property exists
deterministically in a speciﬁc form, identical to its
observed appearance, independent of speciﬁc
circumstances. This substance serves as the basis of
prapañca, a proliferating process that
superimposes ego onto an impersonal process,
through which the next levels of substances, and
the vikalpas supported by them, develop.
Level II. This level of substance is the basis of the next two
types of vikalpas (Types 4–5). The view of ego is
one that erringly grasps a self that is separate from
a collection of perishable events, i.e., the “I” who
aﬃrms itself to exist, which is the root of all
egoistic views. The egoistic views feed an egoistic
conceit—a sense of entitlement to justify an event’s
value as “good” or “bad” according to one’s own
views, self-aﬃrmingly, e.g., “It’s good or bad
(because I think so)”.
Level III. This level of substance is the basis of the last three
types of vikalpas (Types 6–8)—which evaluate
entities as being agreeable, disagreeable, or neither
and give rise to craving, hatred, or ignorance
according to circumstances, respectively.
We postulate that the notion of “ us the good vs. them the
evil” may be caused by three major mistakes corresponding to the
three levels of prapañcas, namely, over-reduction, over-separation,
and over-compression , which obscure the direct realization of the
ultimate nature of reality, described below.

FIGURE /four.tnum
Dyadic active inference model in reiterated prisoner’s dilemm a: when two players (Alice as Player /one.tnum and Bob as Player /two.tnum) are strongly coupled, one
person’s active states outputs become the total inputs of the other person’s sensory states, and vice versa, i.e., (A /one.tnum) causes (S /two.tnum) and (A /two.tnum) causes (S /one.tnum),
the surprise in Persons /one.tnum and /two.tnum are also coupled and thus the strategies in their internal states (I /one.tnumand I /two.tnum) are optimized collectively. The results (S /one.tnumand
S/two.tnum), i.e., payoﬀs, are determined by the interaction between th e players’ plays (A /one.tnumand A /two.tnum), i.e., Payoﬀ Alice = PlayAlice × PlayBob and Payoﬀ Bob = PlayBob
× PlayAlice, as if they are performing a multidimensional dyadic dance.
/three.tnum./two.tnum./one.tnum. Over-reduction
In accordance with the ﬁrst level of prapañca and the
ﬁrst three types (types 1–3) of vikalpas, over-reduction is
the most subtle mistake among the three major mistakes
discussed here. Over-reduction results from the failure
to recognize as many variables as there are operating
in dyadic interactions, which makes it impossible for a
person to perceive the dependent origination nature of the
dyadic interactions.
/three.tnum./two.tnum./two.tnum. Over-separation
In accordance with the second level of prapañca and the middle
two types (types 4–5) of vikalpas, over-separation dichotomizes all
phenomena into categories of “I/mine” vs. “not I/not mine”. The
two categories are overly disjointed because the inter-dependent
relationship between them is ignored. An over-separation will
mislead a player in rPD to think that his or her own payoﬀ will
not be an eﬀect of the interactive product of one’s own play by the
opponent’s play.
/three.tnum./two.tnum./three.tnum. Over-compression
In accordance with the last level of prapañca and the last
three types (types 6–8) of vikalpas, over-compression confounds
multiple dimensions of ownership, actions and feelings, and the
outcomes (payoﬀ) in rPD. Over-compression will mislead a player
to erroneously think that his or her payoﬀ is a function of a linear
contrast between two competing players, pursuing the maximal
diﬀerence. Obviously, this kind of zero-sum thinking is contrary to
the “non-envious” quality in TTF-like strategies. As the diﬀerential
payoﬀ of own vs. opponent’s is positive in the win–lose scenario
and zero in the win–win scenario, the player would overestimate
the expected payoﬀ of the unfair win–lose scenarios (I win vs.
opponent loses), thinking “ what if I can just exploit the opponent
and then run away from it ”, and, at the same time, the player would
underestimate the expected payoﬀ of the win–win scenario if he or
she would choose to employ TTF-like strategies.
This logical refutation can be expressed formally based on the
fact that, as described above, the payoﬀs in rPD are the eﬀects of
the non-additive interaction between two players’ actions. If Alice
and Bob are trapped by the misbelief of “ us the good vs. them the
Frontiers in Psychology /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
evil”, they will misperceive their payoﬀs to be an additive function
of their plays, denoted below:
Payoﬀ(Alice) = Play(Alice) − Play(Bob)
Payoﬀ(Bob) = Play(Bob) − Play(Alice)
If laden with such a misperception, Alice and Bob would compete
to conquer one another in a zero-sum frame, that is,
Payoﬀ(Alice) + Payoﬀ(Bob) = 0
Such a “tug-of-war” mindset leads them to either cyclic conﬂicts
or endless lose–lose scenarios in rPD. Refer to
Figure 5 for a
heuristic model of two active inference engines in the “tug-of-war”
mindset. Being trapped in cyclic conﬂicts, worn-out players would
not value the utility of being nice, reciprocating, forgiving, and non-
envious of others’ success and, therefore, forsaking any possibility
of employing TTF-like strategies.
Taken together, we postulate the second hypothesis of the
present study:
Hypothesis 2: As a result of the mistakes of over-reduction,
over-separation, and over-compression, a player in rPD may
mistakenly believe that payoﬀ is a linear function of the
players’ plays.
/three.tnum./three.tnum. Practical dyadic concepts in dyadic
processes
Previously, we have applied our dyadic active inference
framework to make sense of the eﬃcacy of parenting interventions
for reducing parenting stress (
Ho et al., 2022 ), wherein we
suggested that the strong coupling state between two active
inference engines can parsimoniously explain nine dyadic concepts
that have emerged in the practice of dyadic processes (
Provenzi
et al., 2018 ), as follows:
Mutuality: Mutual contribution of the
interactive partners.
Reciprocity: Reciprocal inﬂuence between
interactive partners.
Attunement: Recognition of one another’s intentions
underlying actions.
Contingency: Timely, reciprocal adjustment of aﬀective and
behavioral signals.
Coordination: Bidirectional rhythmic exchanges
characterized by speciﬁc timing and
turn-taking, which facilitates the reciprocal
prediction of future behavioral states.
Matching: Simultaneous exhibition of the same aﬀective
and/or behavioral state.
Mirroring: Exaggerated/marked imitation of trans-modal
aﬀective quality in a temporally
contingent way.
Reparation: Transforming unmatched dyadic states to
matched dyadic states producing an
opportunity to learn interactive strategies and
to achieve better stress and emotion regulation.
Synchrony: Degree of congruence between trans-modal
behaviors of two partners that lagged in time.
All of these dyadic concepts are applicable to rPD. First and
foremost, because the requirements of rPD’s payoﬀ matrix
favor mutual cooperation, rPD is consistent with Mutuality
and Reciprocity outright. Furthermore, the recognition of the
opponent’s strategy in rPD reﬂects Attunement (to one another’s
intentions). When both players in rPD adapt to employ TTF-like
strategies, their “Tit for Tat” can be described as the dyadic concepts
of Mirroring (imitation of the partner’s last play), Contingency
(between the opponent’s last play and one’s own current play),
and Synchrony (as the coherence between plays on both sides
over time). When their plays are identical in the win–win or
lose–lose scenarios, it is consistent with Matching (the same
play simultaneously). The retaliation of a player against the
opponent’s surprising defection and the return to cooperation if
the opponent renews his or her cooperation are consistent with
Reparation (by discouraging defections in the future), Reciprocity,
and Contingency. The occasional forgiveness of the opponent’s
defections facilitates the reinstatement of mutual cooperation,
which is key to Reparation.
/three.tnum./four.tnum. Two examples of rPD in close
relationships
Here we discuss two examples of rPD analysis in partner–
partner relationships. We discuss the application of Mahayana
Buddhist meditation to partner–partner relationships later.
For example, Alice and Bob are partners. They will be happy if
their daily interactions yield win–win scenarios most of the time,
with the sporadic win–lose or lose–win scenarios that may happen
from time to time. In general, a happy partnership will be sustained
by both partners if they will exhibit behaviors that are nice,
reciprocating, forgiving, and non-envious (or non-dominating), all
of which are consistent with TTF-like strategies. Conversely, they
will be unhappy if they often ﬁnd themselves trapped in lose–
lose scenarios or constantly alternating win–lose and lose–win, but
rarely experience win–win scenarios together due to the lack of
forgiveness and reciprocity that are crucial to the reparation of an
ongoing relationship.
We assume that Alice and Bob’s relationship can be simpliﬁed
to have a payoﬀ matrix that meets the two requirements, G > R > P
> U and 2R > G + U, to qualify their intimate relationship as rPD.
Each of them has two binary plays, Conjoin and Dissociate, which
are mutually incompatible, with the former deﬁned as any actions
that will strengthen their togetherness or shorten their distance and
the latter deﬁned as any actions that will weaken their togetherness
or lengthen their distance.
There are two versions of rPD for Alice and Bob as partners,
depending on how the payoﬀ matrix is deﬁned in their relationship.
In the ﬁrst version, Conjoin is functionally equivalent to Cooperate,
and Dissociate is functionally equivalent to Defect, such that the

An under-coupling ensues in a dyadic system when the players b ecome blind to one another’s active inference engine, especially those covert,
sensory, and internal states (S /two.tnum) and (I /two.tnum). Due to the under-coupling, the players tend to misattribute that the results are determined by the linear
contrast between their plays, i.e., misbeliefs of Payoﬀ Alice = PlayAlice – Play Bob and Payoﬀ Bob = PlayBob – Play Alice, as if they are competing in a
zero-sum one-dimensional tug-of-war.

that the payoﬀ of win–win scenario [Payoﬀ (Alice), Payoﬀ (Bob)] =

Whether the win–win scenario means that both players do
the same action of one kind (Conjoin) or the other (Dissociate)
depends on whether both players agree to consider union or divorce
to be their win–win scenario. Thus, although these two examples do
not have the same outcome in terms of union or divorce, they are
the same in terms of yielding robustly favorable win–win scenario’s
payoﬀ (R, R) for the dyad.

/four.tnum. Theory and practice of Mahayana
Buddhism
Mahayana Buddhism (a.k.a. Great Vehicle Path to
Enlightenment) represents a path to transform conﬂicts into
enduring peace and prosperity, with a commitment to the
fulﬁllment of self and others’ aims equally. The combination of
compassion and wisdom is a common quality throughout the
base, path, and ultimate attainment of Mahayana Buddhism, as
stated by one of the greatest Tibetan Buddhist teachers, Gelek
Rimpoche (1939–2017):
“The essence of compassion is wisdom.
The essence of wisdom is compassion.”
Accordingly, we hereby coin the term intuitive compassion
to refer to wisdom that is not separate from compassion and
compassion that is not separate from wisdom. Mahayana Buddhism
cultivates intuitive compassion gradually in the following order:
1. Compassion (and benevolence),
2. Great compassion,
3. Conventional enlightenment-oriented mind, and
4. Ultimate enlightenment mind.
According to Buddhist deﬁnitions, compassion ( karun. ¯a in
Sanskrit) refers to the wish that others be free from suﬀering,
and benevolence ( maitri in Sanskrit) refers to the wish that others
be happy (
Buswell and Lopez, 2013 ). Compassion is a seed for
great compassion ( mah¯akarun. ¯a in Sanskrit), which is deﬁned
as the wish to free all sentient beings from suﬀering, which is
distinguished from compassion by its scope (all sentient beings)
and its agency (one personally seeks to alleviate the suﬀering of
all other beings) (
Buswell and Lopez, 2013 ). Great compassion
is a seed for a conventional enlightenment-oriented aspiration
(bodhicitta in Sanskrit) that propels those so-called enlightenment-
oriented sentient beings ( bodhisattvas in Sanskrit) to attain the
wisdom that can enable them to fulﬁll self and others’ aims equally
(
Buswell and Lopez, 2013 ). The combination of suﬃcient wisdom
and conventional bodhicitta will enable the practitioner to attain the
ultimate bodhicitta (param¯arthabodhicitta in Sanskrit), which refers
to the bodhisattva’s direct realization of the ultimate truth ( Buswell
and Lopez, 2013 ). Ultimately, the practitioner who completes
this path will attain the inseparable union of compassion and
wisdom—intuitive compassion. We consider intuitive compassion
a functional synonym to ultimate bodhicitta, for the reasons
provided later.
One way to understand this developmental process is to note
that the ever-broadening scope of compassion in this graded path
parallels the ever-broadening scope of one’s identiﬁcation— treating
someone’s conditions as if one’s own without discrimination . In the
beginning, a practitioner can only identify with those near and
dear to him or her, such as a parent’s natural compassion and love
for his or her child, which is supported by neurobiological factors
(
Swain and Ho, 2017 ; Swain et al., 2019 ; Eslinger et al., 2021 ).
Then, progressively, he or she can identify with those “ friends”who
support his or her interest, then with those “strangers” who seem
unrelated to his or her interest, then with those “enemies” who are
in conﬂict with his or her interest. Thus, eventually, the practitioner
identiﬁes with all sentient beings equally. With each and every
person that he or she identiﬁes with additionally, the practitioner
maintains a commitment to attaining self and other’s aims through
his or her own work of compassion (when the aim is to be free from
suﬀering) and benevolence (when the aim is to be happy). As such
commitment continuously calls for more know-how to solve more
problems that are brought on by identifying with an ever-increasing
number of people, the practitioner aspires the total enlightenment
to ensure that he or she can complete the path. In this way, the ever-
expanding identiﬁcation with others will propel the practitioner to
accumulate more merits conducive to intuitive compassion along
the way.
From this perspective, it becomes clear that the practitioners
who are committed to developing intuitive compassion will accept
a premise that is not accepted otherwise, which is stated in the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: A PIC practitioner will identify with every sentient
being that he or she engages, seeing them as someone with
whom he or she has been playing rPD indeﬁnitely, together with
an invariant commitment to transform conﬂicts into enduring
peace and prosperity, regardless of their current relationship as
friends, strangers, or enemies.
This hypothesis can ﬁnd support in a pithy summary of Mahayana
Buddhism composed by Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen (1147–1216),
entitled Parting from Four Attachments
, as follows:
“If you are attached to this life, you are not a true
spiritual practitioner
If you are attached to sam. s¯ara, you have no renunciation
If you are attached to your own self-interest, you have
no bodhicitta
If there is grasping, you do not have the (proper) view.”
The attachment here refers to the eighth or ninth of the twelve links
of dependent origination ( pratityasamutp¯ada in Sanskrit), namely,
craving ( tr.s.n. ¯a in Sanskrit) or clinging/attachment ( up¯ad¯ana in
Sanskrit), respectively, and it is followed by the tenth link,
becoming ( bhava in Sanskrit). Craving is deﬁned as the desire to
keep a feeling of pleasure or to separate from a feeling of pain, or
as a non-diminution of a neutral feeling. Clinging/attachment is
a stronger and more sustained type of attachment, which is said
to be of four types: (1) clinging to sensuality ( r¯aga in Sanskrit),
which is a strong attachment to pleasing sensory objects; (2)
clinging to false views and speculative theories ( dr.s.t.i in Sanskrit);
(3) clinging to faulty disciplinary codes and superstitious modes
of conduct ( ´silavratapar¯amar´sa in Sanskrit); and (4) clinging to
mistaken beliefs in a permanent self ( ¯atmav¯ada in Sanskrit), i.e., the
attachment to the transitory mind and body as a real I and mine. In
the context of dependent origination (PRATITYASAMUTP ¯ADA),
craving (tr.s.n. ¯a) leads to the clinging (up ¯ad¯ana) that nourishes the
actions that will serve as the cause of “becoming/existence” (bhava),
i.e., the next lifetime (
Buswell and Lopez, 2013 ).
Here we interpret these four attachments in the context of rPD.
With regard to the ﬁrst attachment, if an rPD has an end, then
Frontiers in Psychology /one.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
players anticipating the end may defect in the last trial to gain
even more payoﬀ, thinking that there would be no future trial for
the opponent to retaliate. Likewise, the failure of thinking beyond
the end of this lifetime will not value the basis of life, let alone
a commitment to help one’s enemy. Thus, thinking relationships
beyond this lifetime is a necessary condition to uphold the TTF-
like strategies in rPD for PIC practitioners; otherwise, he or she is
not really on this path.
With regard to the second attachment, accepting that one is
playing rPD with a number of others indeﬁnitely, if a practitioner
sees an rPD in an invalid frame of zero-sum tug-of-war, the
practitioner will misattribute the optimal strategy to those who
would not work in non-zero-sum dyadic dances, resulting in cyclic
conﬂicts i.e., sam. s¯ara. Thus, the renunciation of sam. s¯ara requires
the refutation of the tug-of-war mindset and conquering-oriented
strategies in the endless continuation of the dyadic relationships.
With regard to the third attachment, if one ignores the aims
of the other player in rPD, he or she will over-compress a
multidimensional dyadic dance into a one-dimensional tug-of-war.
If a PIC practitioner is not committed to self and others’ aims
equally (as in conventional bodhicitta), he or she will not try to
reframe self and others’ mindset to seek the possibility of win–win
scenarios in their rPD-like relationships.
With regard to the fourth attachment, as described above
based on the Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (
Buswell and
Lopez, 2013 ), any clinging will entrap someone in cyclic conﬂicts,
which are full of wrong conduct codes (e.g., conquering-oriented
strategies) and wrong views (e.g., seeing rPD as tug-of-war, based
on the misbeliefs of “ us the good vs. them the evil ” and an “I” that
is permanent and impervious to the consequences of one’s past
actions in rPD).
/four.tnum./one.tnum. Arya Asanga’s classic summary of
Mahayana Buddhism
To relate dyadic active inference to Mahayana Buddhism,
we introduce a relatively more elaborated summary of
Mahayana Buddhism, excerpted from Arya Asanga’s
classic text Bodhisattvabhumi
(Asanga, 2016 ), as follows
(with the bracketed numbering added, to be referred
to later):
“A bodhisattva who abides in the Great Vehicle’s
spiritual lineage generates the thought to achieve [1]
unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment . The bodhisattva
who has generated that thought applies him- or herself to [2]
the attainment of one ’s own aim and that of others . The person
who is applying him- or herself to the attainment of one’s
own aim and that of others ﬁnds the means by which to [3]
avoid becoming aﬄicted . The person who remains unaﬄicted
ﬁnds the means by which to [4] remain free of weariness . The
person who is unwearied ﬁnds the means by which to [5]
increase his or her roots of virtue . The person who increases
his or her roots of virtue ultimately achieves unsurpassed true
and complete enlightenment. The person who is pursuing the
practices that will accomplish one’s own aim and that of others,
pursuing the means by which one can avoid becoming aﬄicted,
the means by which one will remain free of weariness, the means
by which one will increase one’s roots of virtue, and ultimately
pursuing the attainment of enlightenment, at the very outset ﬁxes
his or her devotion upon the profound and extensive subjects.
The person who has ﬁxed his or her devotion upon those subjects
will seek them. Having sought them, one will both teach them to
others and strive to achieve them by[sic] one’s own practice.
As one strives to achieve them, one practices in whatever
way, in relation to whatever object, and for the sake of
whatever purpose one ought to practice. While proceeding
in that way, in relation to that object, and for that
purpose, one practices in whatever way will bring about [6]
the accumulation of merit and the accumulation of wisdom .
The person who has accumulated merit and wisdom
practices the means by which to avoid abandoning samsara.
While practicing in that way, one undertakes to [7]
avoid developing the[sic] mental aﬄictions while remaining in
samsara. While practicing in that way, one undertakes to avoid
becoming attached to one’s own happiness. While practicing in
that way, one undertakes to avoid being made weary by the
suﬀering of samsara. While avoiding being made weary by that
suﬀering, a bodhisattva relies upon the inner and outer bodies
of teachings and becomes one who is proﬁcient in all the bodies
of teachings.
Having become a person who knows
the various bodies of teachings, [8] one
learns what should be taught to whom and how to go about doing
so, thereby becoming one who knows the world . The person who
knows the bodies of teachings and who knows the world in this
way seeks the Dharma in a proper manner. The person who is
seeking the Dharma in this way develops the ability to remove
all doubts possessed by all sentient beings. As the person who
possesses this ability increases his or her merit through[sic]
removing the doubts of others, he or she will complete the
accumulation of merit. By increasing one’s knowledge, one will
also complete the accumulation of wisdom. While completing the
two accumulations, one will apply oneself in a genuine manner
to the practice of meditating upon the spiritual qualities that are
conducive to enlightenment.
One will also know [9]
the proper method of engaging in meditation . The person
who has applied him- or herself in this manner will dedicate his
or her meditation practice to the attainment of the Great Vehicle’s
form of complete nirvana, not to the attainment of the form of
complete nirvana that is pursued in the vehicles of the listeners
or the solitary realizers. The person who possesses this kind of
skillful means will retain in his or her mind those teachings
that were uttered by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and that
were previously heard. Through the power of meditation, every
aspect of the Dharma teachings that one has not previously
heard will also become clear. The person who possesses this
power of retention and this clarity of understanding will practice
the three doors to liberation with the aim of abandoning
all the obscurations. The person who practices in this way
will become one who is established in[sic] the aim of [10]
abandoning one’s own forms of erring belief and exaggerated

pride as well as those of others . This constitutes a bodhisattva’s
form of practice that is excellent in every respect.” (Asanga, 2016,
p. 665–667)
/four.tnum./two.tnum. Interpreting the virtuous practices of
Mahayana Buddhism in the contexts of rPD
and dyadic active inference
Now we try to interpret Asanga’s excellent summary of
the path to enlightenment, focusing on the phrases that are
underlined and numbered in the texts quoted above, to support the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: The virtuous practices in Mahayana Buddhism
will cultivate a practitioner’s commitment and capacity to
steadfastly employ TTF-like strategies in rPD-like relationships.
1) “unsurpassed[sic] true and complete enlightenment”
Arya Asanga used this term to refer to the direct realization of
the reality of any observed object without obscurations (
Asanga,
2016), which can be referred to as intuitive compassion or ultimate
bodhicitta, as described later. The mind that allows the direct
realization of reality is primordially unborn, formless, and knowing
(
Tenzin Gyatso the 14th Dalai Lama, 2020 ). Since the nature
of the mind is no diﬀerent between the unenlightened and the
enlightened, the path to attain unsurpassed true and complete
enlightenment is not a path to manufacture something that is not
already present in the nature of the mind. Rather, it is a path to
remove all kinds of obscurations, created by vikalpas and prapañca,
which prevent the mind from seeing reality.
2) “attainment[sic] of one’s own aim and that of others”
There are two modes of “knowing” ( jñ¯ana in Sanskrit or yeshe
in Tibetan ) that are relevant to how we interpret the attainment
of one’s own aim and that of others in Arya Asanga’s work. The
ﬁrst mode of “knowing” is intuition, which is direct knowing
unmediated by any form of light, sound, molecule, or other media.
The primordial nature of the mind, which is clear and knowing,
makes intuition possible. Similar to non-local information that is
shared immediately and directly between the interacting events in
quantum entanglement, intuitive knowledge ( vidy¯a in Sanskrit or
rigpa in Tibetan ) is directly shared between one’s own mind and
that of others—for examples of a quantum approach to the brain
and mind, refer to
Atmanspacher (2017). Nevertheless, although
intuition already aﬀords the information necessary for someone
who strives to attain his or her own aim and that of others, it is
mostly obscured by mental aﬄictions. When a bodhisattva practices
attaining one’s own aim and that of others, he or she will need to
perfect his or her intuition of self and other’s aims in the process
by removing all obscuring aﬄictions. This is one way to interpret
Arya Asanga’s notion that “the bodhisattva who has generated that
thought applies him- or herself to the attainment of one’s own aim
and that of others. ”
The second mode of “knowing” is mediated by physical forms
that are imputed through dependent designation (prajñaptisat).
According to the Madhyamaka school of Buddhist philosophy,
the existence of a phenomenon is conceptually dependent
on the designation, imputation, or convention relevant to
the phenomenon under consideration. Madhyamaka Philosophy
deﬁnes a person as a mere concept based on ﬁve aggregates,
namely, aggregates of forms, feelings, discriminations, actions, and
consciousness. The active inference framework is one of many
possible approaches to model and make sense of the mediated,
imputed knowledge possessed by a living organism. We speculate
that there may be a functional correspondence between the notions
of a person as ﬁve aggregates and that of a person as an active
inference engine. In our dyadic active inference framework, when
two persons (as active inference engines) are strongly coupled
in dyadic interactions, the driving force of each active inference
engine is to minimize its variational free energy, which can
only be minimized collectively in the strongly coupled state (
Ho
et al., 2022 ). The distinction between self and other is eﬀectively
diminished in the strongly coupled state as well. As presented
previously, organized life forms emerge in symbiotic ecology in
which all entities are symbionts in a “community” (
Ho et al.,
2021, 2022). In this perspective, the application of oneself to the
attainment of one’s own aim and that of others is already occurring
naturally during the strongly coupled dyadic interaction between
any symbionts in symbiotic ecology. Besides, the strong coupling
between symbionts enables the plays of cooperation and defection
in a myriad of rPD-like situations to be occurring naturally in
symbiotic ecology.
3) “avoid[sic] becoming aﬄicted”
For an active inference engine, to avoid becoming aﬄicted
during dyadic interactions is to avoid being obscured by invalid
beliefs in a strongly coupled state. According to Arya Asanga, erring
beliefs and exaggerated pride are generated by mental fabrication
or proliferation ( prapañca) of conceptual thoughts ( vikalpas). We
have discussed the types of conceptual thoughts and levels of
mental fabrication or proliferation above. Before one can actually
help others attain their aims, one should ﬁrst liberate him- or
herself from aﬄictions by putting a stop to the mental fabrication
of conceptual thoughts. Refer to Ch. 18 V. 5 (
Nagarjuna, 1995 ) as
quoted below.
Therefore, if one wishes to avoid aﬄictions, he or she ought
to put a stop to actions driven by the fabrication of conceptual
thoughts supported by an active inference engine, and the cessation
of aﬄictions is accomplished by (1) preventing these conceptual
thoughts from obscuring the realization of the ultimate nature of
reality and (2) properly understanding that eﬀects are an interactive
product of causes by conditions.
In facing someone on the other side of a conﬂict, if one can stop
his or her own fabrication of conceptual thoughts that conceive the
self vs. other antagonisms in the death spiral of a zero-sum conﬂict,
then one has a chance to transform conﬂicts into enduring peace
and prosperity by choosing to employ altruistic TTF-like strategies
to meet conﬂicts in rPD-like interactions.
4) “remain[sic] free of weariness”
When one wants to avoid becoming aﬄicted during dyadic
interactions, even if he or she is strongly coupled with
someone from the other side of a conﬂict, this person’s
active inference engine can maintain the strong coupling and
minimize the stress that is proportional to the variational free
energy generated in the dyadic interactions. This will deﬁnitely
protect the person from chronic stress and weariness without
Frontiers in Psychology /one.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
disconnecting from others during dyadic interactions. Besides,
when more and more conﬂicts are transformed into a series of
interactions following altruistic TTF-like strategies, the rewards
resulting from win–win scenarios will also diminish the sense
of weariness.
5) “increase[sic] his or her roots of virtue”
By minimizing stress and weariness, one can strive to attain an
understanding of others, including someone from the other side,
and thus come to understand that one can increase the chance
to ﬁnd a win–win scenario as part of post-conﬂict reparation. By
strengthening the skill and capacity to repair the relationship with
someone from the other side of a conﬂict, one increases his or
her roots of virtue. Here virtue refers to the potential to realize an
outcome desirable for one and others alike.
6) “the[sic] accumulation of merit and the accumulation
of wisdom”
The accumulation of merit can be interpreted as the
accumulation of capacity and potential to attain win–win scenarios
in social interactions. The accumulation of wisdom can be
interpreted as a successive eradication of (a) the conceptual
thoughts and (b) mental fabrication/proliferation that obscure the
ultimate nature of reality.
7) “avoid[sic] developing the[sic] mental aﬄictions while
remaining in samsara”
We interpreted this phrase as meaning that one can prevent
invalid beliefs ( vikalpas) from hijacking one’s active inference
engine while remaining strongly coupled with other active
inference engines that are laden with invalid beliefs. Here,
samsara ( sam. s¯ara in Sanskrit) refers to cyclic rebirth, which
is interpreted as the continuity of invalid beliefs and mental
fabrication/proliferation in cyclic conﬂicts.
8) “one[sic] learns what should be taught to whom and
how to go about doing so, thereby becoming one who knows
the world”
At this stage, the PIC practitioner on the path to enlightenment
learns how to transform conﬂicts into altruistic peace in numerous
kinds of rPD-like situations in the “real” world. She or he will
become one who knows the world because she or he cannot
accomplish the transformation of the conﬂicts without knowing
what his or her counterpart’s intents and plays are.
9) “proper[sic] method of engaging in meditation”
According to Arya Asanga:
“It is a virtuous one-pointedness of mind that is possessed
by bodhisattvas and is preceded by listening to and reﬂecting
upon the collection of bodhisattva scriptures. It can be either
‘mundane’ or ‘transcendent’ in nature. [Moreover] it is a state
of mental stability that pertains to quiescence or insight, or both
of them in that it constitutes a path in which the two [forms
of meditation] are practiced in combination. This should be
understood as the essence of the ‘meditative absorption’ that is
practiced by bodhisattvas .” (
Asanga, 2016, p. 343)
Here, “meditative absorption” refers to a state in which the
practitioner meditates correctly on an object and steadfastly
holds the recollection of the object single-pointedly; “mundane”
meditation refers to a form of insight meditation that reﬁnes
the level of consciousness from being coarser to being more
tranquil and it results in “freedom from attachment” to any
form of illusory egoistic existence (as if one only existed in a
weakly coupled state independent of others and the world);
“transcendental” meditation refers to a non-conceptual state
of mind that is free of both conceptual thoughts ( vikalpas)
and mental fabrication/proliferation ( prapañca); thus, such
transcendental meditation is an antidote for all forms
of the illusory egoistic notion of existence (
Asanga, 2016 ,
p. 343).
A seminal example of proper meditation for a bodhisattva’s
practice is known as lojong (or blo sbyong in Tibetan). According
to the Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, lojong is a form of
intuitive compassion meditation that speciﬁcally trains ( sbyong)
a practitioner to comprehend ( blo) the ultimate nature of
the mind and all phenomena. Lojong emphasizes how to see
conﬂicts (and other circumstances that are ordinarily upsetting
or depressing) as occasions for happiness in the perspective of
dependent origination, e.g., thinking that adversities or diﬃculties
are exhausting negative karmic results of one’s own non-virtuous
actions in the past. Speciﬁc practices include how to transform
self-cherishing attitudes into cherishing others, by contemplating
the illusory nature of the self, the faults in self-cherishing, and
the beneﬁts that ﬂow from cherishing others (
Buswell and Lopez,
2013).
Lojong training is based primarily on the techniques for (1)
equalizing the attunement to self and others and (2) exchanging
self and others by taking other’s suﬀering and giving them
self’s happiness (
Buswell and Lopez, 2013 ). The ﬁrst meditative
technique refers to three levels of equality that a lojong practitioner
has to cultivate ﬁrst as prerequisites ( Rimpoche, 2007), as follows:
1. First, dwelling on equality in wishing all beings to be happy and
free from suﬀering
2. Second, dwelling on equality in developing equanimity to
friends and enemies in one’s own responses, i.e., inhibiting one’s
attraction to friends and repulsion from enemies
3. Third, dwelling on equality in identifying with friends and
enemies equally as if their suﬀerings are one’s own
The second meditative technique refers to the give-and-take
(tonglen, or gtong len in Tibetan) to take others’ suﬀering and
give one’s own happiness. It aims to transform how one relates to
the suﬀering that he or she experiences, from seeing adversities
as unwanted stressors to welcoming them as treasury, because
these suﬀerings can (a) exhaust negative consequences of past
non-virtuous deeds, (b) enhance one’s renunciation of such non-
virtues, (c) open one’s mind to change, (d) cultivate compassion
for others who shared the same experiences, and (e) strengthen
the aspiration for realizing the ultimate nature of mind and all
phenomena for the beneﬁts of all—as stated in Arya Shantideva’s
Guide to a Bodhisattva’s Way of Life
(Bodhisattvacharyavatara in
Sanskrit), Ch. 6, V.21:
Furthermore, suﬀering has good qualities: through being
disheartened with it (cyclic existence is renounced), arrogance
is dispelled, compassion arises for those in cyclic existence, evil
(non-virtue) is shunned, and joy is found in virtue. (Shantideva,
c. 700/1979)
Frontiers in Psychology /one.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
The single-pointed “mundane” and “transcendental”
meditations can be described according to Geshe Chekawa’s
Mind Training in Seven Points (
Tulku, 1998 ), as follows
(original texts in italics, with some interpretive notes added
in parentheses):
Training in relative bodhicitta
Put all the blame on the one (eradicate ego-grasping vikalpas).
Meditate on everyone as kind (as in symbiotic relationships).
Train alternately in the two, taking and
giving (tonglen).
Begin taking with yourself (taking one’s own suﬀering as a
valuable steppingstone on the path).
Mount the two upon the breath (this would need to be taught
by a qualiﬁed teacher).
There are three objects (friend, enemy, and stranger),
three poisons (greed, hatred, and wrong view), and three
roots of virtue (virtuous practices that can transform
the poisons).
The following are brief instructions for the post-meditation
period (during everyday activities):
Be mindful in order to admonish yourself (the tug-of-war
mindset in perceiving conﬂicts).
Train yourself with the verses during all activities (especially
when arriving at a conﬂict).
Training in ultimate bodhicitta
Having attained stability, be shown the secret (of the ultimate
nature of reality).
Consider phenomena to be like a dream
(dependent origination).
Analyze the nature of unborn awareness (the nature of mind as
clear and knowing).
Even the antidote itself is naturally free
(of vikalpas).
Focus on the nature of the basis of all, the entity of the path
(the basis of all refers to emptiness, i.e., Eﬀect = Cause ×
Condition, as we postulated here)
Between sessions, be an illusionist (all phenomena are eﬀects of
interactive products of cause-by-condition interactions).
We further discuss the symmetry between lojong meditation and
rPD later.
10) “abandoning[sic] all the obscurations... abandoning one’s
own forms of erring belief and exaggerated pride as well as those
of others”
Arya Asanga suggested that erring beliefs and exaggerated
pride eﬀectively obscure the ultimate nature of reality. Thus,
to achieve unsurpassed enlightenment, one has to completely
abandon any forms of erring belief and exaggerated pride. The
erring beliefs are interpreted here as those invalid beliefs that
hijack one’s active inference engine. The exaggerated pride is
interpreted here as the self-centered beliefs about oneself that
are impervious to the updating of the prior beliefs despite being
strongly coupled with another person’s active inference engine,
resulting in zero-sum conﬂicts with others and the attitude of
conquering others, rather than transforming conﬂicts into enduring
peace and prosperity.
/four.tnum./three.tnum. Symmetry across the domains of rPD,
dyadic active inference, and Mahayana
Buddhism
We postulate that intuitive compassion is an inherent
function—therefore a functional synonym—of ultimate bodhicitta,
for the following two reasons. First, in Madhyamaka Philosophy,
ultimate bodhicitta refers to the direct realization of emptiness
(´sunyat¯a in Sanskrit) as the ultimate truth (
Buswell and Lopez,
2013). A direct realization is, by deﬁnition, intuitive, i.e., direct
perception unmediated by any form of media. According to
Arya Nagarjuna (circa 150–250 CE), the emptiness that ultimate
bodhicitta directly realizes is the dependent origination in
all phenomena:
“Neither from itself,
Nor from another,
Nor from both,
Nor without a cause,
Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.” (Nagarjuna,
1995) Ch. 1 V. 1
Previously, we explained how Arya Nagarjuna’s reasoning on
emptiness is equivalent to a formal expression of the notion that
“eﬀect is an interactive product of cause by condition” (
Ho et al.,
2022):
Eﬀect = Cause×Condition
Notably, this expression is also compatible with the interactive
payoﬀ matrix in rPD, supporting the conjecture that realizing the
ultimate nature of reality will help a player to play optimally in rPD.
Second, the direct realization of the ultimate truth is
compassionate in nature because it automatically eradicates
vikalpas and prapañcas that cause all aﬄictions, according to
Arya Nagarjuna:
“Action and misery having ceased, there is nirvana.
Action and misery come from conceptual
thought (vikalpas).
This comes from mental fabrication ( prapañca).
Fabrication ceases through emptiness ( ´sunyat¯a).”
(Nagarjuna, 1995) Ch. 18, V. 5
To highlight intuitive compassion as a functional synonym
of ultimate bodhicitta, we refer to the preamble and Verses 59–
70, in italics, of Arya Nagarjuna’s Commentary on the Bodhicitta
(Bodhicittaviv¯aran. a in Sanskrit) ( Nagarjuna, 2006 ), with our own
interpretive notes added in brackets, as follows:
“Devoid of all real entities; Utterly discarding all objects
and subjects, such as aggregates, elements, and sense-ﬁelds; due
to sameness of selﬂessness of all phenomena, one’s mind is
primordially unborn; it is in the nature of emptiness. Just as
the blessed Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas have generated
the mind of great awakening, I too shall, from now until I
Frontiers in Psychology /one.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org
Ho et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/nine.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum
arrive at the heart of awakening, generate the awakening mind
in order that I may save those who are not saved, free those
who are not free, relieve those who are not relieved, and help
thoroughly transcend sorrow [in] those who have not thoroughly
transcended sorrow. Those bodhisattvas who practice by means
of the secret mantra, after having generated awakening[sic]
mind in terms of its conventional aspect in the form of an[sic]
aspiration, must [then] produce the ultimate awakening mind
through the force of meditative practice. ”
(Nagarjuna, 2006)
Verse 59.
Starting with ignorance and ending with aging
All processes that arise from
The twelve links of dependent origination
We accept them to be like a dream and an illusion.
[The ignorance here refers to the obscuration of the ultimate
nature of reality; the twelve links of dependent origination,
therefore, can be understood as the working of vikalpas and
prapañcas that hijack an active inference engine to cause
malfunctioning in dyadic interactions.]
Verse 60.
This wheel with twelve links
Rolls along the road of cyclic existence
Outside this, there cannot be sentient beings
Experiencing the fruits of their deeds.
[A person whose vikalpas and prapañcas obscure the nature of
rPD-like dyadic interactions will be trapped in cyclic conﬂicts due
to the misbelief of “ us the good vs. them the evil .”]
Verse 61.
Just as in dependence upon a mirror
A full image of one’s face appears
The face did not move onto the mirror
Yet without it, there is no image [of the face].
[Here, the relationships among (a) a person, (b) one’s face, (c)
the mirror, and (d) the image of the face serve as a metaphor for the
relationships among (a
′
) an observer (subject), (b
′
) an object to be
observed, (c
′
) an interaction between the observer and the object
being observed, and (d
′
) what the observer perceives the observed
object to be like (qualia), respectively. This verse is a metaphoric
expression of the notion that Eﬀect = Cause × Condition, wherein
Eﬀect refers to “the image of a face, ” i.e., the qualia that the observer
perceives the face to be like (“face-ness”), Cause refers to the person
in “one’s face, ” i.e., the observer, Condition refers to the “face” to
be observed, and the operation “X” refers to “the mirror, ” i.e., the
interaction. This metaphoric expression describes the nature of
the mind, as further discussed later. The metaphor also implicates
the meaning of intuition in intuitive compassion, as the observer’s
perception of the observed (“the image of face”) is directly caused
by the interaction (“mirror”) between the observer and the object
to be observed (“the face”), unmediated by any third-party media.]
Verse 62.
Likewise, aggregates recompose in a new existence
Yet the wise always understand
That no one is born in another existence
Nor does someone transfer to such existence.
[In the context of conventional phenomena, such as dyadic
interactions between two active inference engines in rPD, this verse
may be understood in the following way: the re-composition of
aggregates in a new existence refers to a new state of a player, i.e., an
active inference engine after a dyadic interaction is neither causeless
nor the same as the original state before the interaction. Thus,
in the context of rPD, this particular verse is consistent with the
expression of Payoﬀ (Alice) = Play(Alice) × Play(Bob), wherein the new
state of Alice is an interactive product, not a linear transformation,
of Alice’s or Bob’s original state.]
Verse 63.
In brief, from empty phenomena
Empty phenomena arise
Agent, karma, fruits, and their enjoyer –
The conqueror taught these to be [only] conventional.
[One may interpret this verse as suggesting that from
one dyadic interaction, the next arises, with all parts of the
interactions following the expression of emptiness, i.e., Eﬀect
= Cause × Condition. In the context of rPD, agent, karma,
fruits, and their enjoyer in this particular verse refer to the
active inference engine of a player Alice (agent), her action
Play(Alice) (karma), her Payoﬀ (Alice) (fruits), and the operation
“X” (enjoyer) in the expression of Payoﬀ (Alice) = Play(Alice) ×
Play(Bob), respectively. Each element in this expression exists
conventionally according to its name and form from the perspective
of dependent designation, without having any non-relational,
intrinsically independent essence.]
Verse 64.
Just as the sound of a drum as well as a shoot
Are produced from a collection [of factors]
We accept the external world of dependent origination
To be like a dream and an illusion.
Verse 65.
That[sic] phenomena are born from causes
Can never be inconsistent [with facts]
Since the cause is empty of cause
We understand it to be empty of origination.
[These two verses point out that in the expression of Eﬀect
= Cause × Condition, any Cause and Condition themselves are
the interactive products of the previous Cause and Condition, and
therefore, none of them are born without interactions between their
own cause and condition, and “empty of origination” refers to the
fact that they do not exist intrinsically.]
Verse 66.
The non-origination of all phenomena
Is clearly taught to be emptiness
In brief, the ﬁve aggregates are denoted
By [the expression] “all phenomena.”
[Five aggregates of a person [forms, feelings, discriminations,
actions, and consciousness] may refer to the active inference

processes that constitute person–environment interactions. When
an active inference engine (the observer) interacts with an object
in a strongly coupled state, both the observer and the observed
(the object) become the interactive products of causes by conditions
involved in their interaction. The same principle is applied to those
interactions among the sensory, active, and internal states within
the active inference engine. In this sense, all information processed
in person–environment interactions is relational in nature. Using
the metaphor described above in Verse 61, the appearance (qualia)
of the observed object (i.e., “the image of the face in the mirror”) is
the information extracted from the object (i.e., “one’s face in front
of the mirror”) by the observer (i.e., “the person seeing the image”)
after the interaction (e.g., “the mirror” between the observer and the
observed object) occurs. For detailed discussion based on Physics,
Biology, and Psychology on this notion, refer to our previous work
(
Ho et al., 2022 ).]
Verse 67.
When the [ultimate] truth is explained as it is
The conventional is not obstructed
Independent of the conventional
No [ultimate] truth can be found.
[One way to interpret this verse is that due to the unity of
conventional truth and ultimate truth based on Eﬀect = Cause ×
Condition, the wisdom realizing the ultimate truth and compassion
traversing the conventional truth are inseparably united in the
ultimate bodhicitta —intuitive compassion—that directly realizes
such unity, as described in the following three verses 68–70.]
Verse 68.
The conventional is taught to be emptiness
The emptiness itself is the conventional
One does not occur without the other
Just as [being] produced and impermanent.
Verse 69.
The conventional arises from aﬄictions and karma
And karma arises from the mind
The mind is accumulated by the propensities
When free from propensities it’s happiness.
Verse 70.
A happy mind is tranquil indeed
A tranquil mind is not confused
To have no confusion is to understand the truth
By understanding the truth, one attains freedom.
/four.tnum./four.tnum. Summarizing the symmetry in Eight
Verses
The symmetry across the three domains of Mahayana
Buddhism, dyadic active inference, and rPD can be summarized
in terms of Eight Verses of lojong Mind Training ( lojong
tsikgyema
in Tibetan) composed by Geshe Langri Thangpa (1054–1123),
as follows (with our own interpretive notes added in brackets
following each verse):
1. By thinking of all sentient beings
As more precious than a wish-fulﬁlling jewel
For accomplishing the highest aim,
I will always hold them dear.
[Generating the conventional bodhicitta to fulﬁll the
aims of self and others equally.]
2. Whenever I’m in the company of others,
I will regard myself as the lowest among all,
And from the depths of my heart
Cherish others as supreme.
[Whenever in dyadic relationships, give up any
self-centered unidimensional view to make it possible
to frame all dyadic interactions in an
rPD-compatible multidimensional frame. This is
the basis of the ﬁrst level of equality.]
3. In my every action, I will watch my mind,
And the moment destructive emotions arise,
I will confront them strongly and avert them,
Since they will hurt both me and others.
[Refrain from being inﬂuenced by any conceptual
thoughts that misperceive conﬂicts in terms of the
tug-of-war metaphor. Prepare to identify with others
without being carried away by self or others’
conceptual thoughts and negative emotions. This is
the basis of the second level of equality.]
4. Whenever I see ill-natured beings,
Or those overwhelmed by heavy misdeeds or suﬀering,
I will cherish them as something rare,
As though I’d found a priceless treasure.
[Prepare to perform TTF-like strategies when facing
conﬂicts with a stranger with equality in fulﬁlling
the aims of self and others. This is the ﬁrst
one-third of the basis of the third level of equality.]
5. Whenever someone out of envy
Does me wrong by attacking or belittling me,
I will take defeat upon myself,
And give the victory to others.
[Prepare to perform TTF-like strategies when facing
conﬂicts with an enemy with equality in fulﬁlling the
aims of self and others. This is the second one-third
of the basis of the third level of equality.]
6. Even when someone I have helped,
Or in whom I have placed great hopes
Mistreats me very unjustly,
I will view that person as a true spiritual teacher.
[Prepare to perform TTF-like strategies when facing
conﬂicts with a friend with equality in fulﬁlling
the aims of self and others. This is the last one-third
of the basis of the third level of equality.]

7. In brief, directly or indirectly,
I will oﬀer help and happiness to all my mothers,
And secretly take upon myself
All their hurt and suﬀering.
[Without announcing in any way what would
undermine the deployment of TTF-like strategies
in rPD, practice a single-pointed meditation to
identify with others’ suﬀerings arising in the
conﬂicts and use the conﬂicts to eradicate conceptual
thoughts and suspend mental fabrication with a
steadfast commitment to beneﬁtting self and
others equally.]
8. I will learn to keep all these practices
Untainted by thoughts of the eight worldly concerns.
May I recognize all things as like illusions,
And, without attachment, gain freedom from bondage.
[Keep the practice of conventional bodhicitta free of
the tug-of-war metaphor in which zero-sum
conﬂicts are bound to happen on a single
dimension with positive and negative payoﬀs
measured in the forms of experiencing
pleasant/unpleasant feelings, getting
gain/loss of resources, being liked/disliked in
relationships, and having good/bad reputations,
due to the misperception of the payoﬀ matrix based
on the diﬀerence between the players’ plays, e.g.,
PayoﬀSelf = PlaySelf – PlayOther. Instead, focusing
on the ultimate nature of the dyadic relationships
in rPD-like dances, one can rest with the
understanding of the payoﬀ being the eﬀect
of the interactive product of cause by condition,
e.g., Payoﬀ Self = PlaySelf × PlayOther.]
/four.tnum./five.tnum. A summary of the path of intuitive
compassion
We summarize the opposite directions on PIC as two
incompatible paths in
Table 4. The gist of these opposing directions
can be captured in the two sets of verses as follows, either
Love ﬁrst.
Inquire later.
Inquire to love,
Not to conquer.
Or
Exploit ﬁrst.
Manipulate later.
Manipulate to exploit,
Not to love one another.
There is no doubt that conﬂicts are unpleasant and that no one
would enjoy any aversive experiences in suﬀering. Whenever a
conﬂict happens in a dyadic relationship, a person guided by PIC
would realize that the conﬂict serves as a stepping stone on a
bidirectional path and he or she will decide which direction to go
on the path. The foundation for treating conﬂicts as stepping stones
to enduring peace lies in the recognition of the nature of suﬀering

and the values thereof. When a conﬂict occurs, a practitioner of
PIC will see suﬀering in the conﬂict as a blessing in disguise. Of
course, many inquiries would need to be conducted and they will
have to be answered pointedly and properly, if one wants to ﬁgure
out how to transform conﬂicts into enduring peace by properly
engaging one’s counterparts in conﬂicts in a series of interactions,
realizing that we are all playing non-zero-sum rPD, rather than
zero-sum games.
For partners in rPD-like relationships, such as close
relationships, practicing PIC can help repair the relationships
by (1) transforming win–lose or lose–win conﬂicts into win–win
scenarios and (2) reducing their resentment toward each other
after encountering defections. For example, lojong meditation can
strengthen the commitment to employing TTF-like strategies to
strive for win–win scenarios, such that the partners will be nice
(start the rPD with cooperation and never defect ﬁrst) and learn
how to suspend his or her conceptual thoughts so that they can
recognize that the best practice in their relationship is to follow
TTF-like strategies. By practicing tonglen (self-other exchange by

taking other’s suﬀering to oneself and giving one’s own happiness
to others), one will take in his or her partner’s defection by
reciprocating with either retaliation (to defect without generating
any resentment or blame) or forgiveness (to cooperate without
acting out of ignorance or greed) in the following trial.
/five.tnum. Conclusion
Conﬂicts are ubiquitous, and they entail suﬀerings for all parties
involved. Compassion, i.e., a wish to relieve others from suﬀering,
is a commitment to face conﬂicts and suﬀerings in a mindset
that makes it possible to transform them into enduring peace
and prosperity. We introduced PIC to highlight the symmetry
across the domains of (a) rPD, (b) dyadic active inference, and (c)
Mahayana Buddhism, in their theoretical and practice aspects alike,
as geometrically represented in
Figure 2.
In the theoretical aspect, the symmetry lies in the recognition
that the elements of interest operating in these domains are
the eﬀects of the interactive product of cause by condition: in
rPD, the elements—the players’ payoﬀs—are the eﬀects of an
interactive product of their actions; in dyadic active inference, the
elements—intersubjectivity and stress-reduction—are the eﬀect of
an interactive product of two strongly coupled active inference
engines; in Mahayana Buddhism, the elements—all phenomena
including the actor, the receiver, and the object/energy being
exchanged between them—are the eﬀects of an interactive product
of causes and conditions.
In the practice aspects, the symmetry lies in those strategic
techniques that are commonly shared in the proven strategies
that can yield optimal outcomes in each of these domains:
in rPD, the technical features are being nice, reciprocating,
forgiving, and non-envious in TTF-like strategies; in a dyadic
active inference, the strategic techniques are dyadic concepts,
e.g., mutuality, reciprocity, attunement, contingency, reparation,
matching, mirroring, coordination, and synchrony in dyadic
interactions, which can be boosted to become conﬂict-proof by
dyadic interventions targeting problems that may allow conﬂicts
to impair dyadic interactions ( deﬁcient relational benevolence,
under-coupling, and over-mentalizing); in Mahayana Buddhism, the
strategic techniques are often described as virtuous practices of
generosity, ethics, patience, non-weariness, and meditations, with
wisdom being the inseparable companion of these practices.
Conﬂict as a point of bifurcation, like a stepping stone, is also
embedded in the symmetry across these domains. In rPD, conﬂicts
are those win–lose or lose–win scenarios to be transformed
into an enduring win–win or lose–lose scenarios depending on
the strategies. In dyadic active inference, conﬂicts are collective
surprises between two strongly coupled active inference engines
that would need to be minimized. In Mahayana Buddhism, conﬂicts
and suﬀerings of one’s own or others’ are equally valuable for
the practitioners to transform, like the poisons that can make
a peacock even more splendorous. Likewise, compassion in the
face of conﬂicts is also part of the symmetry. We postulated that
compassion reﬂects the conﬂict-proof commitment to choosing a
non-zero-sum frame, as opposed to a zero-sum one, to fulﬁll self
and others’ aims equally in all these domains.
A caveat is that this commitment to compassion is not the same
as unconditional cooperation with the opponent. The reciprocity,
as one of the strategic techniques in these domains, cannot be
overly diminished by always cooperating unconditionally even after
the opponent’s defection in the last move. Most of the time, the
opponent’s defection should be retaliated by defections, except for
occasional forgiveness that comes at an auspicious timing (to be
discerned and determined by someone with intuitive compassion).
While such reciprocity means that retaliation is part of the optimal
TTF-like strategies, it does not mean that the retaliation must
be violent in nature. For example, Mahatma Gandhi led the
successful campaign for India’s independence from British rule by
holding a steadfast non-violence principle in retaliating against
the opponent’s oppression with a non-violent movement of non-
cooperation. In a way, the UK–India interactions at that time may
serve as a good case for demonstrating that two players in conﬂicts
can ﬁnd an enduring win–win solutions in the real world. When
all things considered, both parties saw that the “pie” of mutual
cooperation, in the form of India’s independence, is bigger than
what it was otherwise at the time of post-World War II.
Thus, though violence is common in the time of conﬂict,
especially when one side wants to exterminate the other side for
good, this only calls for more intuitive compassion to creatively
make the pie of mutual cooperation bigger than cyclic conﬂicts
(i.e., 2R > G + U) and to persistently take the time for conﬂicts
to be transformed into enduring peace eventually. In doing so, the
retaliation part of TTF-like strategies, seemingly violent or not,
should be done with a steadfast commitment to eventual mutual
cooperation and enduring peace.
“Non-violence takes a long time, ” said the 14th Dalai Lama.
“Do we have the time, Holiness? ” his bodyguard asked.
“I’ve never known,” said the 14th Dalai Lama.
∼ Kundun, the ﬁlm (Scorsese, 1997)
Indeed, no one would know whether humanity has enough
time to dissolve all the conﬂicts that we face today. Nevertheless,
Bodhisattvas seem not concerned about time because their great
compassion enables them to be willing to spend three inﬁnite
eons or longer to complete the path to enlightenment (
Buswell
and Lopez, 2013 ). Perhaps in their intuitive compassion, they
can see the transient nature of conﬂicts and the destined peace
and prosperity all along, just like playing rPD games with a
proven winning strategy steadfastly. In dedicating their virtuous
practices, Bodhisattvas would pray as what Arya Shantideva did in
Bodhisattvacharyavatara
(Shantideva, c. 700/1979 ), Ch. 10, V.55,
For as long as space endures
And for as long as living beings remain,
Until then may I too abide
To dispel the misery of the world.
