Abstract: Background: The sense of agency (SoA)—the subjective experience of controlling
one’s own actions and their consequences—is a fundamental aspect of human cognition,
volition, and motor control. Understanding how the SoA arises and is disrupted in neu-
ropsychiatric disorders has significant implications for human–machine interface (HMI)
design for neurorehabilitation. Traditional cognitive models of agency often fail to capture
its full complexity, especially in dynamic and uncertain environments. Objective: This
review synthesizes computational models—particularly predictive coding, Bayesian infer-
ence, and optimal control theories—to provide a unified framework for understanding the
SoA in both healthy and dysfunctional brains. It aims to demonstrate how these models
can inform the design of adaptive HMIs and therapeutic tools by aligning with the brain’s
own inference and control mechanisms. Methods: I reviewed the foundational and contem-
porary literature on predictive coding, Kalman filtering, the Linear–Quadratic–Gaussian
(LQG) control framework, and active inference. I explored their integration with neuro-
physiological mechanisms, focusing on the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN) and
its role in sensorimotor integration, intention encoding, and the judgment of agency. Case
studies, simulations, and XR-based rehabilitation paradigms using robotic haptics were
used to illustrate theoretical concepts. Results: The SoA emerges from hierarchical infer-
ence processes that combine top–down motor intentions with bottom–up sensory feedback.
Predictive coding frameworks, especially when implemented via Kalman filters and LQG
control, provide a mechanistic basis for modeling motor learning, error correction, and
adaptive control. Disruptions in these inference processes underlie symptoms in disorders
such as functional movement disorder. XR-based interventions using robotic interfaces
can restore the SoA by modulating sensory precision and motor predictions through adap-
tive feedback and suggestion. Computer simulations demonstrate how internal models,
and hypnotic suggestions influence state estimation, motor execution, and the recovery of
agency. Conclusions: Predictive coding and active inference offer a powerful computational
framework for understanding and enhancing the SoA in health and disease. The SCAN
system serves as a neural hub for integrating motor plans with cognitive and affective
processes. Future work should explore the real-time modulation of agency via biofeedback,
simulation, and SCAN-targeted non-invasive brain stimulation.

1. Introduction
How does the brain seamlessly integrate external feedback and internal action plan-
ning to learn the subjective feeling of controlling one’s own actions and their effects on
the external world, i.e., the sense of agency (SoA), in uncertain environments? The SoA
is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and volition [ 1,2]. While several cognitive
models have been proposed to explain the SoA, including the comparator model [3] and
multifactorial frameworks [4], a comprehensive neurocognitive synthesis has remained
elusive. This is largely due to the SoA’s complex nature, encompassing both low-level
sensorimotor processes and high-level reflective judgments, as well as inconsistencies in
terminology and conceptual boundaries across studies. For the purposes of integrating
predictive coding and adaptive control in human–machine interfaces (HMIs), I will define
the SoA as the outcome of a dynamic, hierarchical inference process in which the brain
integrates sensorimotor signals (bottom–up) with contextual priors (top–down) to estimate
the probability that oneself is the causal agent of an action and its outcomes. This process
unfolds along two partially dissociable levels: the feeling of agency (FoA)—an implicit,
pre-reflective experience of control—and the judgment of agency (JoA)—an explicit, reflec-
tive attribution of agency [2,4,5], where I postulate that internal action simulation plays a
key role.
Emerging evidence highlights that disturbances in the SoA are a shared feature across a
range of brain disorders—including schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, autism
spectrum disorders, corticobasal syndrome, functional neurological disorders—yet cur-
rent treatment approaches lack specificity due to an insufficient understanding of the
underlying cognitive mechanisms [ 5]. To address this gap, Malik et al. [ 5] proposed
the Agency in Brain Disorders Framework, a novel model that integrates bottom–up
and top–down cues, organized along prospective and retrospective timelines, to eluci-
date the diverse manifestations of SoA impairments in neuropsychiatric conditions. This
framework also introduces standardized nomenclature and emphasizes the interplay be-
tween the FoA and the JoA as distinct but interacting components of agency experience.
I focus on the process of SoA learning that often involves balancing uncertainty in ex-
ternal feedback—such as sensory feedback or instructional cues—with uncertainty in
internal action simulation for preparatory action planning. In everyday life, the SoA
underpins activities from driving a car to using a smartphone, where the brain uses
internal action simulation to attribute outcomes to one’s own actions in complex human–
technology interactions [6]. In HMIs—such as brain–computer interfaces, prosthetic limbs,
or assistive automation—preserving and enhancing the SoA is vital so that users feel
“I did that” rather than “the system did that”. Achieving this requires integration of
neuroscience theory and engineering design, ensuring that HMIs align with the brain’s
predictive processes [ 7]. This literature review provides an overview of computation
models as they relate to brain–body–behavior analysis. I first outline the principles of
predictive coding, Bayesian brain theories, and active inference. I then discuss how these
frameworks explain SoA mechanisms and survey their application in HMI design—from
seminal theoretical works to recent advances—focusing on peer-reviewed studies and
computer simulations.
2. Computational Models and Neurophysiological Mechanisms
Predictive coding is a prominent framework in cognitive and computational neuro-
science that views the brain as a Bayesian inference machine, constantly generating predic-
tions about sensory inputs and updating its internal models based on prediction errors—the
difference between the expected and actual input [8]. This theory suggests that perception,
cognition, and action arise from the brain’s effort to minimize uncertainty by aligning
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 3 of 41
top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory evidence. This section traces the evolution
of predictive coding from early theoretical foundations to advanced computational and
hierarchical Bayesian models, particularly in the context of perception–action coupling that
subserves the SoA. Emphasizing theoretical and simulation-based approaches, it outlines
key model architectures and assumptions and provides a comprehensive summary of major
predictive coding models [9].
The historical development of predictive coding traces back to Helmholtz’s 19th-
century idea of perception as unconscious inference [10], later echoed by Gregory’s view of
perception as hypothesis testing [8]. These early ideas laid the foundation for a Bayesian
view of brain function, where perception combines prior expectations with sensory evi-
dence. Barlow’s principle of efficient coding introduced the notion that neurons should
encode only unexpected information, aligning with predictive coding’s focus on transmit-
ting prediction errors [ 8]. In the 1980s, empirical models like Srinivasan et al.’s retinal
circuit showed how neurons could subtract predicted input, reducing redundancy [11]. In
the 1990s, Mumford proposed a cortical architecture where top–down predictions meet
bottom–up errors, and machine learning models like the Helmholtz Machine illustrated
similar principles in unsupervised learning [ 8]. A major advance came with Rao and
Ballard’s hierarchical model of predictive coding in vision, explaining neural responses
through prediction-error signaling [ 12]. By the early 2000s, these ideas coalesced into
the “Bayesian brain” hypothesis, establishing predictive coding as a central theory for
perception and broader brain function [8]. Here, predictive coding was recognized as a
key algorithmic motif for implementing such Bayes-optimal perception [13]. Chris Frith
and colleagues introduced the comparator model of the SoA in the early 2000s [3]. In their
paper [3], Frith et al. proposed the experience of control through two internal compar-
ison processes that operate on different aspects of action monitoring. One comparator
compares the desired state—the internally represented goal of an action—with the actual
state informed by sensory feedback. When these two states match, the system gener-
ates a JoA. In contrast, another comparator compares the actual sensory consequences
of an action with the predictions by the forward model based on the efference copy. A
match between the actual and predicted sensory consequences leads to the FoA. Together,
these two comparator processes integrate sensorimotor and predictive information to
shape both the prospective and retrospective dimensions of the SoA. This work built on
motor control theories but was seminal in applying computational motor prediction to self-
awareness and agency in both health and neuropsychiatric conditions. Table 1 summarizes
the significant predictive coding models, highlighting their key features and applications.
Despite differences in implementation, they share a common thread: the use of predic-
tion and error signals to drive information processing in a way that aligns with Bayesian
inference [8].

Hierarchical generative models allow higher brain regions to predict activity in lower
sensory areas, while only unexpected residuals (prediction errors) propagate upward—this
framework has deep roots in the Helmholtzian idea of the brain as inferring causes of
sensations [23], updated in modern form as the free-energy principle [18]. Early models
like that of Srinivasan et al. [ 11] demonstrated predictive coding in the retina by show-
ing how neurons transmit only residuals between actual and predicted inputs, reducing
redundancy. This principle extended to hierarchical models from Mumford [ 14,15] to
Rao and Ballard [16] in the visual cortex, where higher cortical areas predict lower-level
activity, and only error signals are passed forward. Later refinements by Spratling in-
troduced more biologically plausible mechanisms, integrating attention and nonlinear
dynamics [9]. In the 2000s, Friston’s free-energy framework expanded predictive cod-
ing into a general theory of brain function, modeling cortical inference as minimizing
variational free energy and incorporating anatomical constraints [18]. This evolved into
active inference, unifying perception and action by treating behavior as a process of min-
imizing the expected prediction error, with applications in motor control, robotics, and
social cognition [19,24,25]. The core assumptions included that every cortical area encodes
a probability distribution over hidden causes (not just point estimates) [ 19], and neural
dynamics perform a gradient descent on free energy, which is equivalent to Bayes-optimal
perception [8]. More recently, deep learning models like PredNet [20] and Active Predictive
Coding (APC) [ 22] have merged predictive coding with modern AI, enabling complex
tasks like video prediction, part–whole learning, and hierarchical planning, demonstrating
the scalability and generality of the predictive coding framework across neuroscience and
artificial intelligence. APC represents a convergence of ideas: it draws from the original
Rao–Ballard scheme [ 16], the active inference idea of policy selection by the expected
free energy [ 24,26], and deep learning methods for function approximation [ 20]. This
reflects a broader trend in the field to integrate predictive processing theories with ad-
vanced computational tools, to tackle complex behavior and cognition. Several models
offered complementary insights, e.g., the forward and comparator models explain agency
through motor command prediction and sensory feedback comparison [27]. The compara-
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 6 of 41
tor model posits that agency arises when predicted outcomes match actual feedback [3].
Then, the free-energy principle [ 18] extended predictive coding by proposing that the
brain minimizes surprise (free energy) to maintain equilibrium. The sense of agency
arises from successful prediction–action alignment. The embodied cognition and Enac-
tivism models [28–30] argue that agency emerges through real-time interaction with the
environment—not internal models alone—i.e., agency is enacted, not inferred. The Dynam-
ical Systems Theory model describes behavior as the emergent product of a self-organizing,
multicomponent system evolving over time [31] which has been applied to understand
human behavior, suggesting that agency arises from the self-organization of neural dynam-
ics [32]. Ecological psychology [33], grounded in the work of James and Eleanor Gibson,
offers a non-representational, action-oriented framework for perception and cognition,
emphasizing the direct perception of affordances in the environment through dynamic
agent–environment interactions.
My literature review within the context of design of HMIs using a Bayesian cue inte-
gration model of the SoA reframes agency as a cognitive inference about causality, rather
than a purely sensorimotor phenomenon. In this model, the brain integrates bottom–up
sensory signals (e.g., proprioception, action–effect timing) with top–down beliefs (e.g.,
prior expectations, intentions) to compute the probability that one’s action caused an out-
come [34,35]. Each cue is weighted by its reliability or precision, allowing the brain to make
a trial-by-trial inference about self-causation. This probabilistic approach explains how the
SoA can vary across contexts, tasks, and individuals and accounts for its disruption in brain
disorders [5]. Table 1 outlines five major predictive coding accounts of agency, showing
how they implement the brain’s hypothesized ability to perform probabilistic inference
by minimizing prediction error. Here, the exact Bayesian inference is computationally
impractical for the brain due to the complexity of real-world generative models. Instead, it
is proposed that the brain uses predictive coding as an approximate inference method, and
this approach is grounded in the variational free-energy principle, where the brain does
not apply Bayes’ rule directly. Instead, it aims to minimize a cost function (free energy),
which includes a term based on Kullback–Leibler divergence [17]. This allows the brain to
approximate posterior beliefs efficiently by reducing the difference between the predicted
sensory input and the actual input, rather than computing exact probabilities. Implemented
through hierarchical message passing (prediction and error units), this framework offers a
neurophysiologically plausible account of perception, learning, and motor control that is
reflected in cortical responses [17].
Early anatomical studies suggested that the primary motor cortex (M1) was not an
isolated “motor strip” but included structural bridges (“plis de passage”) linking mo-
tor and sensory areas [36]. Although Penfield’s famous motor homunculus depicted the
M1 as a continuous, body-mapped strip, even his own stimulations sometimes evoked
complex sensations or urges rather than direct movements, hinting at a more integrative
role [37]. Later studies in primates revealed that the M1’s somatotopy is overlapping and
fragmented, with body part representations intermingled rather than neatly separated.
This led to the idea that the M1 supports complex, coordinated actions through functional
groupings and horizontal connectivity. These insights laid the groundwork for identify-
ing the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN)—a set of integrative motor regions that
link bodily control with cognitive processes like intention and agency [ 38]. The SCAN
consists of three distinct cortical nodes located within the motor cortex, interrupting the
traditional motor homunculus. These inter-effector regions lie between the classic zones
for the foot, hand, and mouth along the precentral gyrus, forming an alternating pattern:
foot–SCAN–hand–SCAN–face–SCAN. Rather than a smooth map, SCAN nodes intersperse
the effector areas and are highly connected to higher-order brain networks—a key “nexus
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 7 of 41
between body and mind” due to their integrative role. Anatomically, SCAN regions align
with the classic “plis de passage” described by Gratiolet and Broca [39], now confirmed
through MRI and cadaver studies as transverse gyri bridging motor and sensory cortices.
These nodes blur the M1–S1 boundary and show distinct features: a thinner cortex, higher
intracortical myelin, and unique connectivity patterns, including local and interhemi-
spheric tracts. Found in both hemispheres and across species—including macaques and
human infants—the SCAN appears to be a conserved and specialized part of the primate
motor system.
In principal accordance, it is postulated that descending signals from the motor cortex
resemble the feedback (modulatory) projections in sensory hierarchies rather than classic
feedforward commands [40]. This leads to the active inference reinterpretation of motor
commands—that the brain issues motor instructions by sending predicted propriocep-
tive signals to the muscles, and reflex arcs then fulfill these predictions. In other words,
instead of commanding a muscle directly, the brain predicts the sensory state (e.g., of
body, limb position) it wants, and the body responds to minimize the error. This per-
spective casts even basic reflexes as mechanisms to cancel out prediction errors, unifying
perception and action under one predictive control scheme [40]. Such neural implementa-
tions make predictive coding a powerful model for understanding brain–body–behavior
relationships. It explains phenomena like sensory attenuation: when we produce a move-
ment, the brain’s prediction of the expected sensory consequences (via an internal forward
model) attenuates the actual sensation [41]. For instance, self-generated touch or sounds
feel less intense than external ones because the brain anticipated them. If the actual
feedback deviates from prediction (e.g., a delay or perturbation is introduced), the pre-
diction error triggers surprise and a change in perception—the basis for why one cannot
tickle oneself effectively. This mechanism, present in healthy brains, is disrupted in in
functional movement disorder (FMD), where it is postulated that aberrant top–down
predictions—shaped by factors such as heightened self-focused attention, symptom expec-
tations, and personal beliefs—can dominate and override actual sensory feedback [42]. In
schizophrenia [43], hallucinations and delusions may arise from distinct predictive coding
disruptions: hallucinations result from overly strong top–down predictions, causing the
brain to ignore sensory input and perceive what it expects [44]; in contrast, delusions stem
from weak priors and the excessive weighting of sensory evidence, leading to exagger-
ated prediction errors and false belief formation [45]. The review paper [ 43] argues that
mismatch negativity can serve as a translational biomarker for detecting and differenti-
ating predictive coding abnormalities, potentially guiding personalized interventions for
such heterogeneity.
3. SCAN Mechanisms of Sense of Agency
SCAN regions stand out from surrounding motor areas due to their broad and inte-
grative connectivity [36]. Unlike classic primary motor cortex (M1) effector zones (e.g.,
hand or foot areas), which are mostly limited to contralateral M1 and local S1, SCAN
nodes connect extensively across both hemispheres and to multiple brain networks in-
volved in action, cognition, and autonomic regulation. They are especially linked to
the cingulo-opercular network (involved in attention and arousal), the SMA (efferent
signaling [46]), insula, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and even
autonomic centers like the adrenal medulla. The SCAN appears to integrate motor com-
mands with the internal state, sensory feedback, and goal-directed behavior. Functionally,
they co-activate during complex, multi-limb, or posture-related tasks, and neurosurgical
evidence shows that the stimulation of SCAN nodes elicits diffuse, multi-effector responses.
These regions act as flexible coordination hubs, linking isolated limb control with whole-
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 8 of 41
body movement, intention, and context that is postulated to subserve the SoA that arises
when our brain attributes an action and its contextual outcome to our own intent. The
SCAN’s strong links to cognitive and proprioceptive networks suggest it plays a key role
in generating movement intentions and comparing them with sensory feedback [47]. The
stimulation of SCAN regions can evoke the illusion or urge to move, highlighting its in-
volvement in the conscious experience of agency. The SCAN may integrate intent (from
prefrontal/ACC), execution (M1), and feedback (S1, cerebellum), forming the basis of the
feeling “I did that”. Disruptions in this integration could underlie disorders like alien
limb syndrome, positioning the SCAN as a potential neural correlate of the conscious
motor self.
Classic theories in cognitive neuroscience have long postulated that the SoA critically
depends on predictive mechanisms. The influential comparator model (see Figure 1) sug-
gests that when we plan (inverse model) a voluntary action, an efference copy of the motor
command is used by a forward model to predict the expected sensory consequences [6].
This predicted outcome (e.g., the sight, sound, or feel of the action’s effect) is then compared
to the actual sensory feedback. If the actual outcome matches the prediction, the brain
registers that “I caused this”, reinforcing the SoA. If there is a mismatch—for instance,
the outcome is delayed, deviated, or differs in an unexpected way—a discrepancy signal
arises, and the SoA is reduced or even abolished. Empirical evidence for this comparator
mechanism comes from studies showing that altering feedback can modulate agency. For
example, introducing temporal or spatial offsets between a person’s movement and its
visual/auditory effect reduces the person’s feeling of control over that effect. Similarly,
as noted, people cannot tickle themselves because the somatosensory consequences of a
self-generated movement are predicted and hence attenuated; if that prediction is disrupted
(e.g., by introducing an unexpected delay or using a robot arm to self-stimulate with altered
feedback, i.e., with exafference [48]), the self-produced touch can feel more ticklish and
less self-caused. These observations align with predictive coding: the SoA is strongest
when the prediction error is minimal (expected and actual align), and it diminishes as
the prediction error increases. Consistent with this, the predictability of outcomes has
been shown to directly shape the agency. One view holds that agency is mostly inferred
retrospectively—after action—based on how well the outcome matches the motor system’s
intent and predictions. That is, the brain “decides” one was the agent if the sensory evi-
dence fits the forecast of one’s own action effects, i.e., from the comparator mechanisms.
However, more recent research indicates prospective cues also play a role: the fluency or
ease of selecting and initiating an action can influence the SoA even before outcomes are
known. In other words, when an action feels effortful or unusually constrained, people
report lower agency, independent of the eventual outcome. Neuroimaging studies support
this by linking feelings of agency to activity in premotor and parietal regions during action
selection, not just outcome comparison, emphasizing the role of the prospective cues [49,50]
that can be delivered with exafference for rehabilitation [46,51]. Here, predictive coding
provides a computational design framework in which the brain’s top–down expectations
as initial conditions and bottom–up sensory evidence interact to guide perception and
action [52].

before outcomes are known. In other words, when an action feels effortful or unusually 
constrained, people report lower agency, independent of the eventual outcome. Neuroim-
aging studies support this by linking feelings of agency to activity in premotor and  pari-
etal regions during action selection, not just outcome comparison, emphasizing the role 
of the prospective cues [49,50] that can be delivered with exafference for rehabilitation 
[46,51]. Here, predictive coding provides a computational design framework in which the 
brain’s top–down expectations as initial conditions and bottom –up sensory evidence in-
teract to guide perception and action [52].

in the form of visual and auditory feedback. The bottom panel illustrates the flow of information
in a comparator model for motor control and agency. A motor command (efference copy) is sent
from the motor system to the effector and simultaneously to a forward model, which predicts the
expected sensory consequences of the action. The actual sensory feedback from the movement is
then compared with the predicted outcome. One comparator (SCAN) matches the intended goal of
an action with the actual outcome, producing a judgment of agency. Another (cerebellum—parietal
cortex) compares the actual sensory feedback with predicted outcomes based on the efference copy,
leading to the feeling of agency. Together, these processes combine sensorimotor and predictive
information to form the sense of agency (SoA).

4. Predictive Coding Framework: Preparatory Activity Bayesian Prior
Predictive coding is closely tied to broader Bayesian brain theories, which posit that the
brain encodes probabilistic beliefs and optimally combines prior expectations with sensory
evidence [53]. Perception optimizes internal states to explain the world, whereas action
optimizes external states (the world/body) to match internal predictions. The concept of
perception–action coupling via predictive coding has deep connections to earlier ideas in
motor control. For example, the “forward model” in motor control theory [ 54]—which
predicts sensory consequences of one’s own actions—can be seen as a special case of the
brain’s generative model, and the “inverse model” (computing motor commands to achieve
desired outcomes) aligns with action-based prediction-error minimization. Active inference
unifies these by positing that inverse models may not need to be computed explicitly;
instead, if the brain holds a forward model (predicting sensory input given motor com-
mands), then simply setting a desired outcome (sensory goal) and suppressing updates
to that prediction (beta-band oscillations signal the “status quo” [55]) effectively recruits
reflex arcs to make the prediction come true [40]. Indeed, Adams, Shipp, and Friston [40]
demonstrated that classical motor reflexes (like maintaining posture) can be derived from
active inference principles by “clamping” certain predictions and letting the motor plant
reduce the error. Therefore, in active inference theory, perception and action are two sides
of the same coin: perception optimizes internal predictions to fit sensory input, while action
changes the external input to better fit the internal predictions [ 40]. In other words, if a
mismatch exists between what the brain predicts and what it senses, it can either update its
belief or act to make reality more like the prediction—this dual strategy means the brain’s
control of the body is fundamentally model-driven. As noted by Friston et al., higher-level
cortical areas send descending proprioceptive predictions (desired limb positions) instead
of explicit motor commands, and the motor plant reacts reflexively to reduce the resulting
error [40]. This aligns with the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis (EPH), introduced by Anatol
Feldman [56], which posits that the central nervous system controls movements by setting
desired equilibrium positions (desired limb positions) for muscles, allowing the inherent
properties of muscles and reflexes to drive the limb toward these positions without speci-
fying exact trajectories. This suggests that movement disorders (e.g., FMD, Parkinson’s)
may arise from the disrupted predictive tuning of equilibrium points, leading to abnormal
motor execution [57–59]. Here, active inference extends the EPH by adding a predictive di-
mension, allowing the nervous system to update equilibrium points dynamically. Through
this lens, classical notions of reward or utility maximization are reformulated as inference:
actions are chosen based on prior beliefs about achieving preferred outcomes [60], rather
than directly maximizing reward [24]. For example, if the weather appears windy and rainy,
prior beliefs about staying dry lead one to carry and hold an umbrella tightly, setting initial
conditions (likely at the SCAN nodes of M1) for action based on expectations. Similarly, in
the brain, decision-making can be viewed as a dynamical system, where initial neural states
(shaped by prior experience) combine with incoming sensory inputs to drive evolving
neural activity [52]. These findings suggest that decisions and adjustments emerge from the
interaction between the initial conditions and sensory evidence, supporting a dynamical
systems view of neural decision-making. The effectiveness of this adjustment depends on
the brain’s preparatory and continuous estimation of sensory precision, akin to the Kalman
gain in control theory, which determines the weight assigned to new sensory information
versus prior beliefs [ 61]. However, this precision estimation is not always optimal [ 41].
While the predictive coding framework posits that prediction errors should diminish with
repeated exposure (Kalman gain decreases—the system learns, and habituation occurs),
persistent sensory responses in conditions such as Fragile X Syndrome challenge this
view [56]. A possible reconciliation involves the impaired estimation of precision (pos-

sibly due to impaired neuromodulatory control), where sensory inputs are persistently
overweighted—Kalman gain stays abnormally high, meaning the system keeps treating
sensory input as surprising, even when it should be expected. Then, in conditions like FND,
the brain, instead of updating beliefs in response to sensory feedback, may attempt to force
“reality” to conform to the predictions [41]. This maladaptive strategy reinforces learned
helplessness in FND. In summary, active inference provides a unifying framework: it not
only accounts for perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference (akin to predictive coding)
but also embeds the selection of actions into the same inferential process in health and
disease [24]. This has practical implications for HMI design and robotics [46,48]. By har-
nessing the brain’s natural mechanisms of predicting sensory consequences and correcting
errors, these HMI systems can facilitate human interactions while also serving as a reha-
bilitation tool by modifying rewards and sensory feedback to drive operant conditioning
and adaptive learning [62]. Here, motor control involves two key components of agency:
body awareness—the “Brain as Observer”, likely supported by SCAN regions—and ac-
tion regulation—the “Brain as Controller”, likely handled by non-SCAN effector areas
of the M1.
Figure 1 shows how the interaction between the basal ganglia and premotor cortex
supports motor planning by preparing the primary motor cortex in an optimal initial
state. This includes setting body posture, arousal, and limb impedance for environmental
interaction. Figure 2a shows an example of how initial conditions critically shape out-
comes in a dynamical system. The differential equation for state, x:
.
x = µx − x3 + I, is
integrated over time with the input, I. When I = 0, the system is symmetric and un-
stable at zero, settling into either +√µ or −√µ depending on the starting point. When
I ̸= 0 (e.g., I = 0.5), the system is biased toward one outcome. Simulating trajectories
from different initial values ( −1.5 to 1.5) showed that small differences in the starting
state led to different long-term behaviors, analogous to how state can evolve into distinct
decisions. In uncertain environments, effective behavior relies on balancing prior expecta-
tions with sensory feedback—essentially performing Bayesian inference [63,64]. Ample
behavioral evidence supports this: humans combine cues (visual, proprioceptive, etc.)
in a statistically optimal (Bayes-like) manner in tasks ranging from depth perception to
motor adaptation. Under linear and Gaussian assumptions, classic results show that neural
integration can approach the Bayes-optimal weighting of information (as in the Kalman
filter model of sensorimotor integration [63,65]). Bayesian predictive coding merges these
ideas by suggesting that the brain’s generative model encodes a probability distribution
and prediction errors correspond to the updating of posterior beliefs. In fact, predictive
coding has been described as a particular implementation of Bayesian inference—one
way the brain might achieve approximate Bayes optimality through hierarchical error
minimization [13]—and combining them through continual prediction-error minimization
creates a simpler and more efficient approach following Occam’s Razor [ 66,67]. Active
inference extends these concepts further by incorporating action into the prediction-error
minimization loop.

with prior beliefs and internal simulations to optimize perception and learning [65]. These
mechanisms are crucial not only for skill acquisition but also for clinical interventions,
making Kalman filters valuable tools for understanding learning in complex, uncertain
environments [63]. Despite their usefulness in modeling brain processes related to per-
ception and action [13], Kalman filters have notable limitations, particularly their reliance
on assumptions such as linearity (system’s dynamics and observation models are linear),
Gaussian noise (both process noise and observation noise), and stationarity (state transition
matrix, observation matrix, noise covariances) [68]. While predictive coding alone maps
onto Kalman filtering—estimating hidden states through the minimization of prediction
error in a Gaussian, linear system—active inference adds action selection by incorporat-
ing expected outcomes and control costs, thereby resembling Linear–Quadratic–Gaussian
(LQG) control [69]. In this expanded view, Kalman filtering handles perceptual inference,
while LQG-like optimization governs goal-directed behavior. Crucially, active inference
does not treat perception and control as separate processes; instead, both are viewed as
coupled components of free-energy minimization, where actions are chosen to fulfill pre-
dictions generated by internal models. This explicit integration—absent in traditional
predictive coding—means that active inference embodies the combined logic of the Kalman
filter and LQG control under a single Bayesian variational principle [69].
Consider the scenario in Figure 1 where “Hoop Hustle” is an XR therapeutic game
designed for upper arm rehabilitation [51] using the HRX-1 haptic robot. The HRX-1 is
a compact robotic interface developed by HumanRobotiX London for upper-limb neuro-
motor research. It provides the controlled actuation of wrist or elbow movements in both
horizontal and vertical planes, with a ±140-degree range of motion and peak torque of
4 Nm. Weighing 4 kg, it features angle and torque sensing capabilities and offers flexible
configurations, including wrist, elbow, and bimanual setups. The HRX-1 supports current,
velocity, and position control modes and is programmable via MATLAB (R2023b), Simulink,
and C/C++. Additionally, it integrates with EMG and EEG devices for comprehensive
neuromechanical analysis. Participants used their affected arm, using the palm handle
(see Figure 1) to shoot virtual balls through hoops positioned at varying locations. They
received real-time visual feedback via a Meta Quest 3 headset with immediate visual and
auditory rewards for successful scores. The XR game adapts the difficulty (e.g., virtual
haptic spring–damper) based on individual ability. Players must move the open-palm
handle (see Figure 1) to move the ball ( y) to a target ( r) within a set time ( N) to shoot
and earn rewards (visual/auditory feedback). Figure 2b builds on Figure 1 by illustrating
the dual roles of feedforward action simulation and delayed reafferent feedback in motor
control and agency. Motor planning begins in the prefrontal cortex with intention setting,
followed by basal ganglia evaluation of cost and reward to select the optimal motor plan
via internal inverse models. This plan is issued through the supplementary motor area
(SMA) to the SCAN node of M1 for preparatory activity and simultaneously sent as an
efference copy to forward models in the cerebellum. When the body is ready for action
with preparatory activity, a signal to go is delivered to the non-SCAN effector nodes of M1.
Predicted sensory outcomes are compared with actual feedback in the parietal cortex, with
any mismatch used to update beliefs and decipher the judgment of agency. The “Virtual
World” haptic spring–damper system (see Figure 2b) is controlled via a Kalman filter and
LQG controller in humans.
The task objective can be formally described as minimizing a quadratic cost function
that captures both reward-based positional accuracy and body energy expenditure:
J = (y(N) − r)TQ(y(N) − r) + ∑
N−1
t=0 u(t)T Lu(t)
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 14 of 41
Here, y(N) is the ball position at final time N; r is the target location; Q is a matrix defining
the positional error cost at the final time (t = N); u(t) denotes motor commands at time t;
and L represents the cost associated with motor commands. The relative magnitude of Q
and L indicates the trade-off between error cost and effort—this may subserve comorbid
fatigue in FND [70]. Here, the effort can be modulated using a haptic spring–damper, as
shown in Figure 1, to modulate human trade-off between error cost and effort.
To successfully complete the task, participants require an internal model, i.e., a predic-
tive relationship between motor commands and their sensory outcomes (e.g., propriocep-
tive and visual states). This “Hoop Hustle” is a novel task for the participants, so this must
be learned [71]. We represent the state-space model dynamics linearly as follows:
State prediction: ˆx(t + 1|t) = ˆA ˆx(t|t) + ˆBu(t);
Sensory feedback prediction: ˆy(t) = ˆH ˆx(t|t).
Here, ˆx(t|t) is the predicted state (e.g., body and ball) at time t given actual sensory
feedback up to that time; ˆA, ˆB, and ˆH are learned (adapted over time through experience)
matrices defining how states evolve without input (e.g., physics of arm dynamics) ( ˆA is
the state transition matrix), how motor commands (e.g., muscle activations) affect the
states ( ˆB is the control matrix), and how internal states map to sensory feedback (e.g.,
vision, proprioception) translating into their prediction, ˆy(t) ( ˆH is the observation matrix),
where ˆx(t + 1|t) is the predicted state at time t + 1 given the predicted state, ˆx(t|t), and
motor command, u(t), at time t. The controllability matrix is C =

, where n is the number of state variables.
The state estimate update (correction) at time t + 1 given new sensory feedback at t + 1,
y(t + 1), will be ˆx(t + 1|t + 1) = ˆx(t + 1|t) + K(t + 1)

. The mixing
gain matrix, K(t), determines how much the state estimate should be corrected based
on prediction errors (balances between prediction and measurement), which may not
be optimal (Kalman gain) in FND [ 41]. Figure 2 expands on Figure 1, highlighting the
parallel roles of feedforward simulation (SCAN nodes of M1) and delayed reafferent
feedback in motor control (non-SCAN effector nodes of M1). Figure 1 shows how the
prefrontal cortex initiates intentions and supports the metacognitive evaluation of agency,
using the prospective sense of agency to guide preparatory motor activity before action at
M1 [72]. The basal ganglia evaluates a combination of body cost and reward by minimizing
an objective function of the form, ( (y(N) − r)TQ(y(N) − r) + ∑N−1
t=0 u(t)T Lu(t)), using
internal inverse models (decision-related dynamics at premotor cortex [ 52]), selecting
the optimal motor plan that minimizes this cost till the final time ( t = N). Once the best
motor plan is selected and the body is ready for action following preparatory activity, the
basal ganglia delivers a “Go” signal to initiate the corresponding motor plan sequence till
the final time ( t = N). The SMA complex receives the selected motor plan by upstream
evaluative systems (e.g., basal ganglia–dorsal premotor cortex interactions) that is issued to
the non-SCAN effector nodes of M1 for execution and is simultaneously broadcast by SMA
with a SCAN node of M1 as an efference copy to internal forward models (cerebellum) [46].
This efference copy serves as an input to a predictive model—often formalized as part of a
Kalman filter state estimator—which generates an internal prediction of the movement’s
sensory consequences. These predictions are then compared against actual sensory feedback
to compute a prediction error, which is used for state update, i.e., update (parietal cortex)
about the system’s state (e.g., body and environment). Here, I postulate that SCAN serves
as a key computational hub in the judgment of agency—see Figure 2b. The prediction error
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 15 of 41
reflects the mismatch between the predicted and actual sensory feedback SCAN (dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex plays a key role) and is integrated with additional contextual
variables such as the final cost and reward (from basal ganglia) associated with the action
and the prior belief about agency held before the action—together, these signals shape a
posterior SoA.
Interaction with the body and environment—including exafference via a haptic spring–
damper system (HRX-1 robot [ 51])—enables perturbations using exafference to probe
goal-directed movement and provide operant conditioning (by modulating effort, L) in
dysfunctions like those seen in FND [ 51]. Given these estimates, the control problem
(subserved by the basal ganglia ↔ premotor cortex loop) reduces to finding the motor com-
mands (u(t)) that minimize the expected future costs (“cost-to-go” (Riccati) equation) [71],
u(t) = −G(t) ˆx(t), where G(t) is the feedback gain at time t, computed recursively back-
ward via a dynamic programming algorithm that solves the underlying LQG control
problem [73] (optimality assumed in healthy individuals [74]), i.e.,
G(t) =

L + BTW(t + 1)B
−1
BTW(t + 1)A
W(t) = ATW(t + 1)[A − BG(t)], W(t = N) = HTQH
The feedback gain (G(t)) encodes how beliefs about states map into motor commands,
effectively defining the optimal control policy based on backward recursion (Riccati equa-
tion). Here, movement elements are consolidated (e.g., motor chunking [ 75]) with state
estimation computed forward in time and optimal control computed backward to guide
action. In FND, the control policy may not be optimal [41], inhibiting the action.
In practice, motor commands u(t) introduce noise, εu(t), which can be modeled as
zero-mean Gaussian noise whose variance is proportional to the magnitude of the control
signal itself, ∑i Ciu(t)φi(t), where φi(t) ∼ N(0, 1) is an independent standard Gaussian
random variable. Thus, the full stochastic dynamics of the internal model are as follows:

ments y(t) are continuously integrated with model predictions ˆy(t) to update beliefs about
the state.

In control theory, two key properties—controllability and observability—determine
whether a system can be effectively regulated and monitored. A system is controllable if it
can be driven from any initial state to a desired one through control inputs (evaluated via
the controllability matrix). It is observable if its internal states can be reconstructed from
external outputs (determined through the observability matrix). These dual properties are
foundational in designing adaptive and stable systems, such as in robotics [68]. Extending
this framework, I propose that the judgment of agency depends on the perceived controlla-
bility and observability of one’s body and environment, learned through a metacognitive
Ladder of Causation. When observability is reduced (e.g., due to societal opacity), or
controllability is undermined (e.g., by coercion), one’s sense of agency can deteriorate.
Mental simulation can serve as a representational tool for understanding both the self
and others [76] through a metacognitive Ladder of Causation. As illustrated in Figure 2b,
mental imagery can engage action simulation via the forward model, which can be shaped
by external suggestions (exafference) [77]. Hypnotic suggestion (considered exafference),
often defined as a process that enhances the realism of imagined scenarios, can shape
perceptions of body ownership, agency, and size [78]. Hypnotic suggestions are typically
preceded by hypnotic induction techniques, such as focused breathing and heightened bod-
ily awareness [78] as preparatory activities. In this state of “focused attention and reduced
peripheral awareness, characterized by an enhanced response to suggestion” [79], reaffer-
ence is minimized and suggestions are trusted as the sole sensory input (exafference), Sext ,



. Then,
mental imagery, as a form of enactment imagination [80], relies on sensory visualization
and shares neural mechanisms with perception. Mental imagery functions as an internal
simulation system, using forward models to predict the outcomes of potential actions and
guide belief updating [41]. This process supports adaptive learning and problem-solving by
enabling the brain to simulate future scenarios without physical movement. In the context
of Insight Meditation, there is no external sensory feedback; instead, the mind primarily
engages with internal noise ( y(t + 1) ∼ N(0, V)) [41]. Through consistent meditation
practice, the variance in this internal noise ( V) is reduced, enhancing the state expecta-

[41]. Figure 3 shows
a MATLAB (Mathworks Inc. Natick, Massachusetts, USA) simulation of a three-phase
cognitive control process using the LQG control framework to model how full attention on
all sensory inputs, internal simulation without sensory input (in Insight Meditation [41]),
and hypnotic suggestions without sensory input affect state estimation and motor behavior
(code, figure3.m at https://github.com/Siagnos/ICRA2025 accessed on 10 April 2025). It
simulates a 10 Hz oscillatory system (physiological oscillations ~10 Hz) under feedback
control, with state estimates updated via a Kalman filter. In Phase 1 (t = 1–20), the system
has access to all sensory inputs (reafference) and uses a Kalman filter for the internal
state estimate—representing a condition with full attention to sensory inputs. In Phase 2
(t = 21–40), the sensory input is no longer available, but the system continues to simulate
internal dynamics with minimizing external noise, representing internal simulation in
Insight Meditation [41] where belief updating is mostly driven by prior expectations. In
Phase 3 (t = 41–60), the system incorporates external suggestions (bias term for exafference
as sensory input), simulating how hypnotic suggestions can shape future expectations in
the absence of real-world sensory input. Throughout, the code tracks the prediction error
and applies LQR control using the estimated state. These results are visualized through
two complementary figures: a prediction error plot (Figure 3a) and a comparison of the
true versus estimated position over time (Figure 3b). Together, these plots illustrate how
hypnotic suggestions dynamically modulate belief updating and motor control. Specifically,
the persistence of steady-state prediction error under suggestions reflects a biased setpoint,
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 17 of 41
which—according to the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis—can drive limb movement even in
the absence of conscious motor intent. In line with these simulation results, I propose the
integration of virtual reality (VR)-based hypnotic suggestion within a platform technology for
eXtended Reality biofeedback training under operant conditioning (using suggestions) for
FMD rehabilitation [81]. In this framework, brain imaging—particularly beta synchronization
observed in the SMA during post-movement stages in individuals with FND—can provide a
biomarker of sensorimotor integration (efferent copy ,u(t)–Figure 2b) [46]. Prior research has
demonstrated that the hypnotic state modulates sensorimotor beta rhythms during both real
movement and motor imagery [82]. Hypnotic suggestion has been shown to alter motor cortex
excitability [83] and modulate corticospinal output during motor imagery [84], highlighting its
potential as a tool for reshaping dysfunctional motor representations [85] likely subserved by
the SCAN nodes of M1. These findings open new avenues for applying cognitive neuroscience
principles [77] to XR therapeutic interventions in FND.

optimal, simulating FND-like dysfunction where the brain underweights sensory input

poor state estimation. At t = 40, hypnotic suggestions are introduced by restoring sensory
precision (focused attention with hypnotic induction), which increases Kalman gain and
improves belief updating [41]. The observed reduction in prediction error (Figure 4a) and
the convergence between estimated and true states (Figure 4b) demonstrate how hypnotic
suggestions can recalibrate the balance between sensory evidence and internal models,
effectively correcting the disrupted inference seen in FND. A reduction in the prediction
error facilitates a posterior sense of agency with hypnotically suggested movements that
feel involuntary and therefore effortless.

The Kalman filter and LQG control align with active inference, a framework in which
the brain predicts the sensory outcomes of movements and minimizes discrepancies be-
tween expected and actual sensations by adjusting motor commands (inverse model)
and/or updating predictions (forward model). Here, I propose that the brain can simulate
alternative actions and outcomes to incorporate the Ladder of Causation [88], a framework
introduced by Judea Pearl, which consists of three levels:
Association—recognizing correlations between variables without inferring causal-
ity, i.e., associative learning using a comparator model (prediction error = ∥expected
outcome−observed outcome∥) [89].
Intervention—understanding the effort and impact of deliberate actions on outcomes,
moving beyond passive observation, i.e., active inference (active minimization of variational
free energy) [26] and causal inference [5].
Counterfactuals—engaging in retrospective revaluation [ 41], leading to assessing
agency under ambiguity, i.e., counterfactual regret minimization [90].
Integrating retrospective revaluation enhances motor learning through action sim-
ulation via predictive coding and counterfactuals [ 4]. Activation in the right prefrontal
cortex and ventral striatum was observed during retrospective revaluation [91], providing
support. In the context of the free-energy principle [26], an agent evaluates possible actions
by minimizing the expected free energy, which balances the predicted rewards (what it
wants) and information gain (what it needs to learn) [26]. This approach unifies perception
and decision-making, treating both as processes of reducing uncertainty and achieving
goals. Within a retrospective revaluation framework, the brain retrospectively revaluates
interventions—from action execution to action simulation—to discern for agency under am-
biguity [91]. Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a computational method used to
approximate Nash equilibria in extensive-form games [90]. CFR is guaranteed to converge
to a Nash equilibrium in two-player, zero-sum games with perfect recall, where players
remember past decisions. When noise is introduced—reflecting real-world uncertainty—
players may not settle into a fixed strategy but instead exhibit patterns consistent with
a stochastic equilibrium, where strategies are stable on average. This approach offers a
more realistic understanding of human decision-making under ambiguity [92] that is also
relevant in skill learning.
6. “Brain as Controller” vis-à-vis “Brain as Observer” in Skill Learning
Skill learning with a medical simulator based on directed brain connectivity showed
an interaction between expertise (experience level) and simulator quality (contextual real-
ism) [93]. Figure 5 shows how directed brain connectivity is influenced by the interaction
between expertise and simulator type during skill learning. In the context of laparoscopic
surgical skill acquisition [ 93], the virtual simulator is novel for both groups, while the
physical simulator is only novel to novices. The analysis reveals significant differences
in the directed brain connectivity between groups, specifically from the supplementary
motor area (SMA) to the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and from the left sensorimotor cor-
tex (LPMC) to the right prefrontal cortex (RPFC)—regions implicated in motor planning
and the retrospective revaluation of actions [ 91] likely subserved by the SCAN nodes
of M1.

microstates, each representing distinct brain activation patterns associated with unique 
and shared cortical regions. The classic four-state scheme (labeled A, B, C, and D) is pre-
sented, along with additional variants C′, E, and F. Microstates A and B represent diagonal 
opposites in spatial distribution (e.g., left anterior to right posterior for A and the reverse 
for B) – I postulate in “Brain as Observer” state. Microstates C and D exhibit strong ante-
rior–posterior contrasts with inverted polarities —pattern C shows red frontal and blue 
occipital regions, while pattern D shows the opposite – I postulate in “Brain as Controller” 
state. Variant C′ features a central polarity surrounded by an oppositely charged ring, 
whereas E and F introduce lateral (left –right) and fronto-central asymmetries in datasets 
that exceed the four -class model. These spatial patterns help characterize which lobes 
(frontal vs. occipital) and hemispheres (left vs. right) exhibit primary positivity or nega-
tivity. Notably, the data —collected from 164 participants using a 256 -channel EEG sys-
tem—demonstrate that not all individuals express every microstate, par ticularly for pat-
terns C and D, suggesting inter -individual variability (“Brain as Controller” in internal 
processing). This is further highlighted by the division of Microstate C into subtypes, re-
inforcing the non-uniformity of brain activation patterns.

The review paper [96] also distinguishes MS pattern C′ as a separate subtype, further
segmenting the classic C pattern beyond the six-state models used in Walia et al. [95] and
Brechet et al. [94]—this suggests a finer classification granularity. When comparing EEG
microstates across studies, several methodological factors must be considered. EEG map
signs are inherently arbitrary—for instance, a red-top/blue-bottom pattern is functionally
identical to a blue-top/red-bottom one. This makes direct visual comparisons across
studies potentially misleading. Additionally, differences in referencing schemes, such as
using a common average versus average mastoids, can further alter the appearance of
topographies by shifting or tilting the overall map. These factors highlight the importance
of caution when interpreting or comparing EEG topographies purely based on visual
features. Nevertheless, traditional EEG microstate analysis ignores topographical polarity,
treating reversed patterns as the same state, which can miss important neural dynamics [97].
By accounting for polarity, Kashihara et al. [97] uncovered more detailed and continuous
microstate transitions. They found that transitions typically occur within the same polarity,
while between-polarity shifts are rare and structured. Notably, aging altered these patterns—
older adults showed fewer transitions along key routes like D-C-E, more within-polarity
shifts among A, D, and B, and an increase in uncommon transitions. Including polarity
offers a clearer, more accurate view of brain activity over time. Moreover, the number of
microstates modeled (e.g., 6 vs. 7) can impact classification outcomes, where additions
like C′ reflect finer subtyping within established categories. To objectively evaluate the
similarity between the review’s microstates (A–F) and our own (1–6), we compute Pearson
correlation coefficients and mean squared errors (MSEs) between their spatial distributions,
using normalized pixel values. This quantitative comparison provides an empirical basis
for mapping and aligning microstates across studies. Transition probabilities between EEG
microstate classes (see Figure 8) revealed distinct patterns differentiating experts from
novices in their brain responses to task errors, as reported in Walia et al. [95]. These neural
responses were mapped onto steps of the proposed Kalman filter model, wherein predicted
internal states are adjusted based on sensory prediction errors—a process central to motor
control and error correction.
A key mechanism underlying expert performance is implicit mental imagery, which
refers to the unconscious activation of sensorimotor brain regions during motor tasks. Un-
like explicit mental imagery, where individuals intentionally visualize movement, implicit
imagery occurs automatically—often during motor planning or real-time error correction—
and is especially prominent in expert performers [98,99]. In the study by Walia et al. [95],
the expert group consisted of nine attending surgeons and residents with over one year
of experience in laparoscopic surgery, while the novice group included thirteen medical
students with no prior exposure to laparoscopic procedures. This contrast allowed for
the examination of expertise-related neural signatures during task performance and error
monitoring. Further extending this investigation, a separate study [99] involved a cohort
of surgical trainees and professionals performing an explicit mental imagery task. In this
task, participants—comprising junior residents (PGY 1–3, n = 10), senior residents (PGY
4–5, n = 10), and attending surgeons (n = 10)—were asked to dictate a simulated operative
note, simulating the cognitive demands of intraoperative decision-making. During the
surgical epoch of this dictation task, brain activity was recorded using fNIRS, focusing
on the prefrontal, sensorimotor, and occipital regions. These data were used to analyze
underlying brain states, offering insight into how different levels of surgical expertise
manifest in distinct neural activation patterns during surgical tasks.

Despite the well-established role of EEG microstates during resting state, their impli-
cation in the generation of motor behavior is debated [100]. Evidence of such a functional 
role of spontaneous brain activity would provide support for the design of novel and sen-
sitive biomarkers not only for skill learning but also in neurological disorders [100]. Pi-
rondini et al. [100] showed that the subject -specific microstates’ dynamical organization 
correlated with the activation of muscle synergies and can be used to decode individual 
grasping movements with high accuracy. These findings highlight the relevance of task -
related microstate analysis over resting -state analysis [101] for revealing how spontane-
ous brain activity encodes motor control, offering potential for personalized biomarkers 
in skill learning and neurorehabilitation. The functional relevance of these microstates has 
been extensively characterized by Tarailis et al. [102], who linked each to distinct neural 
networks and cognitive functions. Microstate A is commonly associated with the auditory 
network, showing negative BOLD correlations in the bilateral superior and middle tem-
poral gyri and sometimes in the medial prefront al cortex (MPFC) and occipital cortex 
(OC)—suggesting a role in sensory integration. Microstate B corresponds to the visual 
network, marked by BOLD signals in the occipital cortex and strong activati on in lateral 
and medial parietal areas, including the precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, which are 
involved in visual scene construction and episodic memory. Microstate C has been asso-

contexts. It shows positive BOLD activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), 
bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and right insula —regions tied to salience detection and 
interoceptive awareness. Subtypes such as Microstate C′ hav e been identified in studies

6.1. Microstate Transitions During the Error Epoch 
In the error epoch, novices primarily transition from Microstate 4 (corresponding to 
Microstate E) to Microstate 1 (a combination of Microstates A and C). This transition likely 
reflects a shift from automatic/intuitive processing (Microstate E) to an observation model 
involving sensory integration (Microstate A) and SN + DMN (Microstate C). Such patterns 
suggest a novice-level response to task errors, wherein conscious observation and sensory 
recalibration dominate. In contrast, experts show a more refined transition pa ttern. They 
begin in Microstate 6, which integrates features of Microstates E and F —reflecting both 
intuitive decision-making (right medial prefrontal cortex, MPFC; Microstate E) and delib-
erate cognitive control (left MPFC; Microstate F). This bilateral MPFC activity suggests the 
experts’ ability to balance automatic and controlled processes, effectively regulating error-
related arousal before transitioning to Microstate 1, the observation model. 
Another notable transition in experts occurs from Microstate 5 (aligned with Micros-
tate E) to Microstate 3 (a combination of Microstates A and D). Here, Microstate D primar-
ily represents the FPN, critical for the Correction Step [104] in the Kalman filter and LQG 
control framework. Within Microstate 3, sensory integration (Microstate A) and motor 
planning areas such as the DMFC—including the SMA—are thought to interact with the

Another notable transition in experts occurs from Microstate 5 (aligned with Microstate
E) to Microstate 3 (a combination of Microstates A and D). Here, Microstate D primarily
represents the FPN, critical for the Correction Step [ 104] in the Kalman filter and LQG
control framework. Within Microstate 3, sensory integration (Microstate A) and motor
planning areas such as the DMFC—including the SMA—are thought to interact with the
dACC from Microstate D. This interaction enables the transformation of error signals
into corrective motor plans. Importantly, the dACC serves as a communication hub across
multiple networks, the CON and the SN [105], both of which are implicated in goal-directed
behavior and prediction-error signaling [106]. This makes Microstate D—involving the
dACC, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal regions—suited also for Bayesian belief updating
in response to surprising or unexpected events [107].
In the context of FLSs learning, it is proposed that the CON uses inputs from the SN to
detect salient events and then recruits the FPN to guide adaptive motor responses [108] by
the effector nodes of M1. In the error epoch, Microstates 5 and 6 (experts) and Microstate 4
(novices) are likely involved in Hidden State Transitions (implicit mental imagery) in the
Kalman filter model.
6.2. Microstate Dynamics During Task Initiation
During the initiation phase of the FLSs task, novices exhibit frequent transitions
between Microstates 1 and 3, reflecting an interplay between the “Brain as Observer”
and the “Brain as Controller”. Here, the SCAN involves the dACC, SMA, insula, and
inter-effector M1 nodes—areas linked to Microstate C. Functionally, one may view the
SCAN as coordinating global motor programs and mapping them onto the local executors
(the limb-specific neurons). During an actual movement, SCAN nodes in M1 might help
adjust posture, activate stabilizing muscles, modulate autonomic responses (e.g., raising
heart rate via adrenal connection for a strenuous action), and ensure the movement aligns
with the intended goal (via connections to cognitive control centers). This pattern aligns
with the cognitive stage of skill learning [93,109], characterized by a high cognitive load
and conscious performance monitoring. Experts, however, predominantly transition to
Microstate 3, with strong transitions from Microstates 2 and 5. Here, Microstate 2 (a hybrid
of Microstates A and B) involves sensory integration (A) and episodic memory recall via the
precuneus/retrosplenial cortex (B). This suggests a more autonomous, experience-driven
form of Hidden State Transition (implicit mental imagery), where implicit mental imagery
supports the experts’ control mechanisms—characteristic of an autonomous stage.
6.3. Internal Simulation Model and Task Observation
In our Internal Simulation Model for enactment imagination, we propose that mental
imagery facilitates the Correction Step by enabling individuals to simulate corrective
actions internally for reevaluation (subserved by SMA, LPFC, LPMC, RPFC—see Figure 5).
Here, the observation model reflects brain activity during first-person observation and
varies with experience [109]. Enactment imagination is the mental rehearsal of movement
without actual execution [110]. It engages the brain’s motor planning circuits, particularly
regions that also activate during real movement—though at lower intensity. Studies show
that imagined actions activate areas like the M1, premotor cortex, and SMA and suppress
sensorimotor rhythms in EEG, similar to actual movement. The SCAN appears to play a
central role in internal simulation by integrating intention, planning, and sensory prediction,
without driving overt motion. SCAN regions in M1, with their high activation thresholds
and links to cognitive control areas, likely allow us to “feel” the movement internally while
keeping the body still. This is supported by findings that motor cortex excitability increases
during imagery but stays sub-threshold—enabling rehearsal without action [111].
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 27 of 41
Functional imaging studies show that mental imagery recruits higher-order networks,
such as CON and FPN circuits, more than execution does. SCAN nodes help maintain
the imagined action through connections with the prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar
regions, supporting both the sense of agency and the internal simulation [ 41]. In this
way, the SCAN provides the neural foundation for the vivid experience of movement
in the mind’s eye, bridging cognition and motor control—see Table 2. Mental imagery
engages distinct regions of the SCAN, each contributing to different aspects of simulated
movement. The middle SCAN region (SCAN-M), located between the hand and mouth
areas in M1, is strongly activated during bimanual, tool-related, and goal-directed imagery.
It supports internal movement modeling and sequencing through its connections with the
premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).
The ventral SCAN region (SCAN-V), situated below the mouth area, is involved in the
imagery of facial gestures, vocalizations, and emotionally charged actions, likely aiding
interoceptive simulation and affective embodiment via links to the insula, orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The dorsal SCAN region (SCAN-D),
between the foot and hand zones, is less explored but may contribute to imagery involving
posture, gait, or full-body coordination. Together, these regions facilitate the planning,
prediction, and embodied experience of imagined actions. Therefore, SCAN brain regions
participate in both real and imagined movements, but they take on an especially crucial
integrative role during imagery when overt motor output is absent. Both conditions share
the activation of these “somato-cognitive” nodes—reflecting overlapping neural substrates—
yet the balance shifts: execution leans more on M1 effector-specific activation and sensory
feedback, whereas imagery leans more on M1 SCAN-mediated internal modeling and
cognitive network support. Our study [ 109] investigated how brain activation during
a cognitive surgical task—simulated operative dictation (an internal simulation task)—
varies with surgical experience. Using fNIRS, we measured brain activity across the
prefrontal, sensorimotor, and occipital regions in junior residents, senior residents, and
attending surgeons. The results showed that senior residents exhibited significantly greater
activation in the left prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortices compared to both juniors
and attendings. These findings suggest that cognitive-task-related brain activation patterns
differ by experience level and highlight the potential of functional neuroimaging as an
objective tool for assessing cognitive surgical expertise.

the role of SCAN (inter-effector) regions and related circuitry.
Network Engagement Motor Execution Mental Simulation
Primary M1 effector zones
Strongly activated for the specific
moving body part; large corticospinal
output drives muscles.
Moderately activated (sub-threshold
activity); increased excitability but output
gated (no overt movement).
SCAN inter-effector zones
Active to integrate multi-limb
coordination, posture, and link
movement with goals. Assist in
planning and adjusting movement
(feedback integration).
Active to simulate the action plan and sense
of movement. Likely more relative
involvement since they generate the internal
action representation without triggering
muscles. Contribute to the feeling of
“agency” and urge during imagination.

Table 2. Cont.
Network Engagement Motor Execution Mental Simulation
Sensory feedback (S1)
High actual feedback from
proprioception, touch, etc., fed into
primary sensory cortex S1; SCAN
bridges to S1 (via “plis de passage”)
to incorporate this feedback.
Little to no actual feedback (no movement),
but predicted feedback may be internally
generated. SCAN’s connection to BA3a
(proprioceptive area) might simulate
expected sensations.
Subcortical involvement
Strong involvement of basal ganglia
and cerebellum for executing
movement (initiating and refining
motions); SCAN connects to these
(putamen, cerebellum) to help
orchestrate execution.
Basal ganglia engaged in suppressing actual
movement (inhibition via striatal circuits)
while still allowing the thalamocortical loop
of the plan. Cerebellum active in simulating
the dynamics of the imagined movement.
SCAN connectivity to these regions
supports running the “motor
program” offline.
Cognitive network coupling
Moderate: cognitive control
(dACC/insula) signals ensure the
movement meets the goal, especially
if adjustments or attention is needed.
Some cognitive resources focus on
external execution monitoring.
Strong: sustained engagement of prefrontal,
attention, and imagery networks (visual or
kinesthetic imagery recruits frontoparietal
and occipital areas). SCAN nodes heavily
coupled with cingulo-opercular network to
maintain the intention in mind
without output.
7. Discussion
In this review paper, I applied the Kalman filter and LQG control framework to under-
stand how brain activation during a cognitive–motor task varies with surgical experience,
focusing on transitions between EEG microstates. During FLSs task initiation, novices
showed high transition variability—especially between Microstates 1 (“Brain as Observer”)
and 3 (“Brain as Controller”)—reflecting exploratory strategies typical of early learning.
In contrast, experts demonstrated more efficient and focused transitions, primarily into
Microstate 3 from Microstates 2 and 5, enabling controlled action through prediction-error-
based processing [94,95,112]. During the error correction phase, experts used quick robust
transitions (e.g., Microstate 5 to 3; Microstate 6 to 1) [ 113], while novices relied on more
variable transitions. The observation model was supported by SCAN-linked microstates
(A, C), involved in self-monitoring and memory retrieval [1,114], while the Correction Step
engaged the FPN, SN, and CON via Microstates D and 3, facilitating adaptive control and
behavior modification [108,115,116]. Enactment imagination further distinguished skill
levels [99], with experts showing localized SMA activation—critical for motor intention-
ality and integration across the DMN, FPN, and sensorimotor systems [113,114,116,117].
Disruptions in these dynamics are observed in FMD, where abnormal beta synchronization,
heightened self-focus, and impaired SN–FPN switching impair motor control [118–120],
and motor imagery mechanisms may underlie their symptoms [121]. Neurological evidence
suggests that the SCAN network plays a key role in linking intention with movement,
contributing to the sense of agency—the feeling of “I am initiating this action”. Disruption
to the SCAN may impair this link, as seen in patients with this motor pathway damage
who struggle with motor imagery. In contrast, motor imagery training may strengthen
SCAN connectivity when this pathway is intact. A recent study [122] also found that the
SCAN connects many key neuromodulatory targets for Parkinson’s disease, including
areas treated with deep brain stimulation. This highlights the SCAN as a central hub
in motor control under the Kalman filter framework, see Table 3, potentially involved
in disorders like Parkinson’s, where self-initiated movement is impaired and motor im-
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 29 of 41
agery remains relatively preserved. Individuals with aphantasia, who lack visual mental
imagery, also have impaired motor simulations. A study by Dupont et al. [ 123] found
that, unlike those with typical imagery, people with aphantasia did not show increased
corticospinal excitability during motor imagery or action observation, indicating reduced
motor system activation. However, it is still unclear whether SCAN regions are specifically
affected in aphantasia, and further research will be key to deciphering SCAN involvement
in cognitive–motor tasks.

Recent findings [124–126] support the view that sensorimotor performance, such as
tracking tasks, depends on dynamic, embodied engagement with environmental feed-
back. Older adults exhibited reduced tracking accuracy when required to integrate visual
feedback and internal prediction, suggesting a decline in their ability to flexibly update
beliefs in response to external cues [127]. This aligns with a dynamical systems perspec-
tive in which decision-making emerges from the interplay between preparatory neural
states (prior beliefs) [ 128] and real-time sensory evidence, modulated by precision esti-
mation mechanisms akin to Kalman gain. Here, Mu and beta–gamma rhythms—linked
to the “Brain as Observer” and “Brain as Controller”, respectively—dynamically mod-
ulate corticospinal excitability during movement [55,129–131]. Their disruption in FND
may be addressed through mental imagery and external suggestions (for operant con-
ditioning) [48,132]. The cerebellum, through its connections with the MPFC and thala-
mocortical circuits, supports Hidden State Transitions and Correction Steps [ 133]. Sen-
sory deafferentiation in the context of FND refers to the disruption or abnormal pro-
cessing of afferent sensory signals—particularly reafferent feedback (i.e., sensory input
generated by one’s own movements) [ 41]. In FND, sensory deafferentiation arises not
from peripheral nerve damage but from altered central processing. Maladaptive learn-
ing may lead the brain to ignore sensory feedback, modeled as a Kalman filter, where
measurement noise is perceived as extremely high ( R → ∞), confidence in internal pre-
dictions is excessive ( P(t | t − 1) → 0), and the observation model fails to link sensory
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 30 of 41
input to the internal state ( ˆH → 0). As a result, the Kalman gain K(t) approaches zero
( K(t) =P(t | t − 1) ˆHT[ ˆHP(t | t − 1) ˆHT + R]−1 → 0), preventing updates from sensory
feedback and disrupting sensorimotor integration for motor control [41]. From a functional
dystonia and tremor case observed during our usability study [51], we can simulate key
sensorimotor disruptions computationally for goal-directed movement, r = 1. The Matlab
(Mathworks Inc. USA) code (https://github.com/Siagnos/ICRA2025 accessed on 10 April
2025) captured the core mechanisms of functional dystonia (FD)—disrupted prediction,
sensory feedback, and motor control [134].
Figure 11 shows the simulation of the Kalman filter and LQG control model to rep-
resent motor behavior in a healthy human versus FD model. It integrates a traditional
LQG controller for goal-directed movement with an external adaptive haptic controller
(modeled as a predictive LQR since “Virtual World” spring-damper model is known—see
Figure 1), simulating XR-based assistance. To capture the dysfunctions seen in FD, the
mixing gain is artificially reduced to simulate deafferentation or overconfident prediction,
while motor imagery suggestion is modeled by amplifying this mixing gain. The system
incorporates elements of effort–reward miscalibration, motor suppression, and involuntary
movement using randomized effort thresholds, control suppression, and low-frequency
motor command biases, respectively. The result is a hybrid system that blends control,
assistance, and pathological interference, making it suitable for studying motor dysfunction
in sensorimotor disorders like FD. Figure 12 illustrates that adaptive haptic exafference
restores motor control in FD by using predictive LQR assistance (“Virtual World” spring-
damper model is known—see Figure 1), while top-down suggestions enhance human
state estimation through increased mixing gain. Indeed, suggestions have been shown to
influence these processes by modulating agency and prediction through the cerebellar and
SMA pathways [135–139], offering potential for therapeutic intervention in disorders of
agency and motor control.
Altered states of consciousness, such as those induced by meditation and hypnosis,
modulate brain dynamics, e.g., Brechet et al. [ 140] demonstrated that intense medita-
tion training significantly reshapes EEG microstates. Two novel microstate topographies
emerged post meditation, accounting for nearly 50% of the variance in EEG data. These pat-
terns are localized to brain areas involved in self-related multisensory experience, including
the insula, supramarginal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. Notably, meditation disrupted
the dominance of Microstate C—during internal processing (without suppression, just
with increased awareness) likely subserved by the SCAN—suggesting a departure from
the typically stable microstate architecture found in prior studies [ 141]. These findings
support the hypothesis that meditation enhances internal processing without suppression,
aligning with the increased self-awareness reported during hypnotic states [96]. Katayama
et al. [141] investigated EEG microstate changes across stages of hypnosis—resting, light,
deep hypnosis, and recovery. They found that during deep hypnosis, Microstates A and C
increased in duration and time coverage, while Microstates B and D decreased. This transi-
tion is postulated to reflect a shift in cognitive dominance from executive control toward
self-reflective internal processing without suppression. Recovery stages showed intermedi-
ate characteristics, highlighting a dynamic trajectory through altered states. Importantly,
Katayama’s results suggest that deep hypnosis may enhance insight by amplifying “Brain
as Observer” activity while dampening “Brain as Controller” functions. Comparisons
across states showed that deep hypnosis shared traits with schizophrenia (e.g., halluci-
nations), while light hypnosis overlapped with meditation in promoting relaxation and
awareness. This observation aligns with findings by Xu et al. [ 142], who explored self-
projection and future thinking. Participants reported higher vividness and self-projection
when imagining their Future Self compared to their Present Self. A functional dissociation
Brain Sci.2025, 15, 396 31 of 41
emerged within the DMN: the anterior DMN (aDMN) was more active during Present
Self-reflection (“Brain as Observer”), while the posterior DMN (pDMN) was more active
during Future Self imagery or Projection (“Brain as Controller”). These subsystems may
be selectively modulated through internal simulation and suggestion-based techniques,
particularly in therapeutic contexts like self-hypnosis [41]. Within this broader context, the
Kalman filter and LQG control framework offers a powerful model to explain how the
brain learns, corrects errors, and adapts motor skills—see Table 3. In my proposed model,
microstate analysis and enactment imagination [ 99] can be used alongside multimodal
brain imaging to distinguish between novice and expert skill acquisition.

Novices display variable, exploratory neural pathways, while experts show efficient
transitions across the FPN, DMN, and SN during skill learning [109]. Here, the SMA plays
a central integrative role, transforming internal motor intentions into precise executions,
informed by external feedback including suggestions. For example, a steady decline in
the strength of directed functional connectivity from the lateral prefrontal cortex to the
SMA over the course of a 15-day training period was found [ 109]. During the initial
“Cognitive stage” (Days 1–5), connectivity was high, reflecting strong top–down control
from the LPFC as participants engaged in conscious, effortful learning. As training pro-
gressed into the “Associative stage” (Days 6–15), this connectivity gradually decreased,
indicating reduced reliance on executive control and increased motor automation. By the
retention phase, the LPFC →SMA influence remained low, suggesting that the skill has
become internalized and more efficiently executed. This shift reflects the brain’s transition

from effortful to automatic processing, a hallmark of sensorimotor learning. However,
in FMD, this process breaks down—disrupted agency and impaired SMA signaling in-
terfere with adaptive motor control [46]. This literature review of the Kalman filter and
LQG control framework revealed how internal simulations and external suggestions dur-
ing enactment imagination can be harnessed to recalibrate these pathways and restore
voluntary control.

The SCAN offers a unifying framework for understanding mind–body aspects of
how the brain integrates intention, planning, and movement [ 38]. It plays a central role
in coordinating complex, full-body motor plans by drawing on body schema and task
goals, allowing for anticipatory adjustments in posture, arousal, and attention. The SCAN
also contributes to the SoA, helping bind intention with action and feedback, and may be
disrupted in conditions like alien limb syndrome, FMD, or motor delusions. Functionally,
SCAN connects motor control with cognitive and emotional processes, supporting tasks
that demand the real-time integration of movement and mental focus—such as performing
under stress. Its role in motor imagery and rehabilitation is especially notable, as engaging
the SCAN during mental practice may enhance motor recovery by strengthening global
mind-body action frameworks and enabling inter-limb learning. In HMI applications,
leveraging the SCAN through kinesthetic imagery whole-body action preconditioning
may yield more robust brain-based control signals. Overall, the SCAN bridges cognitive
processes with motor execution, enriching our understanding of volitional movement,
embodied cognition, and neurorehabilitation. Across neuroimaging studies, SCAN-related
regions like the SMA, parietal cortex (IPL/TPJ), cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex emerge
as central hubs for generating, monitoring, and attributing agency. Here, the Contingent
Negative Variation (CNV) is postulated to reflect the scalp-level electrophysiological activity
of the SCAN, with its amplitude and distribution corresponding to the engagement of
SCAN-related regions—such as the SMA, midcingulate cortex, thalamus, and insula—
during anticipatory, time-based, and goal-directed motor–cognitive preparation [143–145].
Specifically, CNV may index slow cortical potentials associated with increased cortical
excitability [144], consistent with the SCAN’s role in integrating cognitive control, motor
readiness, and internal timing mechanisms [145]. Then, using anodal transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) over the M1, we found increased theta-band EEG activity
and a reduced slope in slow cortical potentials during self-initiated movement in healthy
participants [146]. Our findings suggest that anodal tDCS modulates brain activity patterns
linked to movement preparation, possibly by influencing decision-related neural processes
involving the SCAN at the M1. Here, structural connectivity between the SMA/pre-
SMA and parietal cortex via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), particularly its
branches (SLF I and SLF II), further supports such integrated brain functions [147], motor
intentionality [148], and the sense of agency [ 149,150]. Also, the transcranial electrical
stimulation of angular gyrus–middle frontal gyrus connections, linked via the dorsal SLF
II, may enhance the sense of agency. Similarly, targeting the supramarginal gyrus–inferior
frontal gyrus via SLF III may support perception in complex tasks. In experts, the preSMA–
LPFC coupling, supported by the extended frontal aslant tract, may underlie sequence
learning and executive control in familiar tasks. Overall, optimally targeted transcranial
electrical stimulation may boost predictive coding and efference copy signaling, aiding
motor skill learning and neurorehabilitation [93,146,151,152], e.g., the transcranial electrical
stimulation of the SCAN nodes of M1.
