Although the increase in the use of dynamical modeling in the lit erature on
cultural evolution makes current models more mathematically so phisticated,
these models have yet to be tested or validated. This paper pro vides a testable
deep active inference formulation of social behavior and accompanyi ng
simulations of cumulative culture in two steps: First, we cast cultu ral
transmission as a bi-directional process of communication that induces a
generalized synchrony (operationalized as a particular converg ence) between
the belief states of interlocutors. Second, we cast social or cultural e xchange
as a process of active inference by equipping agents with the choice o f who to
engage in communication with. This induces trade-oﬀs between conﬁr mation
of current beliefs and exploration of the social environment. W e ﬁnd that
cumulative culture emerges from belief updating (i.e., active i nference and
learning) in the form of a joint minimization of uncertainty. T he emergent
cultural equilibria are characterized by a segregation into gr oups, whose belief
systems are actively sustained by selective, uncertainty minim izing, dyadic
exchanges. The nature of these equilibria depends sensitive ly on the precision
aﬀorded by various probabilistic mappings in each individual ’s generative
model of their encultured niche.

/one.tnum. Introduction
The study of cultural evolution examines how processes of transmission and selec tion
at the individual level bring about population level patterns of cultural change. As a
general overarching trend, models of cultural evolution have seen a steady inc rease
in complexity, resulting from specialized theories from social psychology on t he

Kastel et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnbot./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/six.tnum
interconnected dynamics of culture. For instance, a recent model
of cultural systems (
Jansson et al., 2021 ) applied a framework
that implements the structural dependencies between cultural
traits and the emergent ways that these dependencies inﬂuence
the acquisition of cultural transmission.
Another step in the direction of increasing the complexity
and systems view of culture has been the investigation of the
relationship between population structure and the capacity for
a culture to accumulate beneﬁcial cultural traits over time
(i.e., cultural accumulation), which has been a particular topic
of interest in the past decade. Although some empirical tests
provide support for the hypothesis that eﬀective population size
constraints cumulative cultural evolution (
Derex and Mesoudi,
2020), there is contradictory evidence regarding the relationship
between population size and cultural accumulation ( Kempe and
Mesoudi, 2014). Another study theorizing about the foundations
for the uniquely human capacity for cultural accumulation
suggests that this capacity is rooted in a unique foraging
niche which can still be observed in few hunter-gatherer
populations. This niche, encompassing social interactions
such as cooperation with unrelated individuals and social
division of labor, underlies a task specialization which spreads
cultural knowledge across individuals. This task division, a
multilevel social structure which evolved as an adaptation to the
environment, may explain human collective intelligence and its
unique capacity for sophisticated cumulative culture (
Migliano
and Vinicius, 2022 ).
While the increase in the use of dynamical modeling
in the literature on cultural evolution makes current models
more mathematically sophisticated, these models have yet to
be tested or validated (
Kashima et al., 2017 ). Review of the
literature reveals that one line of research that has been
especially fruitful in that it can be validated experimentally
are Bayesian models that create detailed models of cognition
and have had remarkable success in producing predictions
qualitatively in accord with experimental results (
Kempe and
Mesoudi, 2014 ). Currently these models have only been
applied to relatively low level cognitive processes, but the
creation of high level cognitive maps at the individual level
as well as modeling the emergence of cultural change on
the population-wide dynamics represents a promising line of
future work.
The dynamics underlying the evolution of culture consist
of three processes that are typically studied separately: the
introduction of novel beliefs and practices to a culture (i.e.,
innovation), the transmission of established beliefs and practices
within a population (i.e., innovation diﬀusion), and changes
in their prevalence (
Kashima et al., 2019 ). The term “cultural
transmission” typically denotes the transference and spread
of any particular fashion, ideology, preference, language, or
behavior within a culture (
Creanza et al., 2017 ). A prominent
stream of quantitative models for cultural transmission are
inspired by epidemiology, and convert models used for
predicting the spread of a virus to formalize the spread of an
idea (
Bettencourt et al., 2006 ).
While the comparison of an idea to a (non-mutating)
virus has its beneﬁts from a formal perspective, it implies the
controversial notion that an idea is simply copied during its
transmission through cultural exchange between individuals.
This notion is not only intuitively insuﬃcient for a realistic
characterization of communication dynamics, but also conﬂicts
with established theoretical models of transmission on these
same grounds.
Current literature in cultural psychology indicates that
rather than being simply duplicated during transmission,
cultural beliefs and practices are modiﬁed through the active
interpretation of each individual (
Kashima et al., 2019 ).
Furthermore, psychological research indicates that eﬀective
human communication can be characterized by (usually only
partially) common realities in which conversation partners share
an intersubjective reference frame (
Clark and Brennan, 1991 ;
Echterhoﬀ et al., 2009 ). Accordingly, conversation partners have
to be understood as active participants that co-create these
partially shared reference frames in a self-organizing fashion
over the course of each interaction. Intersubjective theories of
communication aim to account for those underlying dynamics
that—slightly paradoxically—both enable and (to some extent)
require the co-creation of (partially) shared reference frames
amongst interlocutors. In contrast, traditional formulations have
tended to oversimplify communication in terms of back-and-
forth exchanges based on (largely) ﬁxed symbolic meaning
systems, implicitly presupposing those shared reference frames
in an ad-hoc manner.
The theory of cumulative culture (
Stout and Hecht, 2017 ;
Dunstone and Caldwell, 2018 ) expands on the notion that
progressive alterations of cultural beliefs and practices are
intrinsic to all cultural exchanges because they are embodied,
expressed, and interpreted diﬀerently by each individual
participant of the ensemble (
Dean et al., 2014 ). While eﬃcient
cultural exchanges do tend to be grounded in similar physical
substrates across and within individuals (e.g., facial expressions,
body language, etc.), the high abstraction levels and malleability
of these substrates render cultural dynamics in a diﬀerent class
than phenomena that are wholly dependent on consistency
across genetic substrates, such as sexual reproduction and
disease spread. Of course, genetics does play a crucial role in the
range of phenomena associated with gene-culture co-evolution,
but that will be explored in future work.
Although there appears to be some degree of consensus on
the intrinsic complexity of culture, it remains an outstanding
challenge to provide convincing quantitative accounts of its
full glory (
Buskell et al., 2019 ). This article aims to act as a
stepping stone toward tackling this challenge of characterizing
cumulative culture by developing a multi-agent model based
on deep active inference account. This work was developed
by reformulating and greatly expanding upon a much shorter

/two.tnum. Methods
An emerging conclusion from the literature is that the term
“transmission” for describing the spread of cultural information
seems impoverished, as it leaves out the retention of cultural
information. As implied by active inference—and theoretical
models of communication—the acquisition of cultural beliefs
is as fundamental to the understanding of cultural information
spread as their transmission. For this reason, we will henceforth
be referring to what is known in the literature on cultural
transmission as communication, or more technically: the local
dynamics of cumulative culture. Although we will use the
term “communication” and “transmission” interchangeably in
this paper, It is important to note that communication does
not always imply cultural transmission. Cultural transmission,
also known as cultural learning, refers to the learning of
social behaviors that occurs in every new generation in a
particular society (
Nicol, 1995 ). Since cultural transmission
only occurs when social behaviors or beliefs are learned,
communication only truly implies transmission when what
is being communicated has been picked up and solidiﬁed
in the receiver’s cognitive model. We assume this kind of
communication in our simulations, which is why under our
account communication does imply transmission.
Conversely, cultural transmission can occur without
communicating information through language. It has been
suggested that humans learn the social behaviors of their
culture through immersive participation in cultural practices
that selectively shape attention and behavior. This is a form of
implicit learning, where agents infer other agents’ expectations
about the world and how to behave in a social context. It
is even argued that implicit learning of information about
other people’s expectations constitutes the primary domain
of statistical regularities that humans leverage to predict
and organize behavior (
Veissière et al., 2020 ). Although
cultural transmission does not necessarily require verbal
communication, we assume this kind of communication in
our simulations.
/two.tnum./one.tnum. Simulating the local dynamics of
communication
In our model, cultural transmission is cast as the
mutual attunement of actively inferring agents to each other’s
internal belief states. This builds on a recent formalization of
communication as active inference (
Friston and Frith, 2015 )
which resolves the problem of hermeneutics, (i.e., provides a
model for the way in which people are able to understand
each other precisely, despite lacking direct access to each other’s
internal representations of meaning) by appealing to the notion
of generalized synchrony as signaling the emergence of a shared
narrative to which both interlocutors refer. From the perspective
of active inference, agents of a socio-cultural system infer the
belief states of those in their environment and update their
own representations accordingly. An emergent property of this
bi-directional inference—and implicit belief updating—is the
synchronization of belief states among the cultural ensemble
(
Palacios et al., 2019 ).
In nature, generalized synchrony emerges from a speciﬁc
coupling between the internal states of dissipative chaotic
systems (
Pikovsky et al., 2003 ). As a fundamental concept in
complex systems theory closely related to stochastic resonance
(
Nicolis and Nicolis, 2012 ), it is typical of complex nonlinear
dynamics that aﬀord the coexistence of chaotic and ordered
subsystems (also called chimera patterns; see, e.g.,
Zakharova,
2020; Haugland, 2021 ). In active inference, the coupling of
agents’ internal states is made possible through communication,
as it allows interlocutors to mutually inﬂuence each other
and enter into a bidirectional action-perception cycle that
can be described as coupled dynamical systems (
Friston and
Frith, 2015 ; Constant et al., 2018 ). When active inference
agents engage in the coupled dynamics of communication,
generalized synchrony between their internal states emerges
from their mutual eﬀorts to minimize uncertainty—as scored
mathematically with (variational) free energy. Put simply,
generalized synchrony ensures the greatest mutual predictability
error resolves the greatest amount of collective uncertainty.
Our model of communication builds on the notion of
generalized synchrony to suggest that the emergence of
synchrony from the coupled communication of active inference
agents may be operationalized as a particular convergence
between their respective generative models. That is, when
we simulate the belief-updating dynamics of communicating
agents, the cultural reproduction of a particular idea takes
the form of a learnable convergence between their respective
belief states (expressed as generative models) and distinct
representations combine into one synchronized, shared model
of the world.
Formally, our model deﬁnes perceptual inference in terms of
a coupling parameter linking the internal states of interlocutors
through dialogue (
Figure 1). Also understood as sensitivity to
model evidence (A1), perceptual inference is a direct and explicit
form of coupling that occurs over the span of a single dialogue
such that it is hypothesized to modulate agents’ convergence of
internal belief states during communication.
While throughout the narrative of this paper we have
characterized the alternative “idea” as having actual content, we
Frontiers in Neurorobotics /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
Kastel et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnbot./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/six.tnum
have intentionally left it unspeciﬁed such that it could also be
taken to simply refer to a blanket disagreement with the ideas
or practices representing the “status quo.” In that sense, it is
consistent with simulation work on social dynamics suggesting
that cultural extremism can arise without the formulation of
alternatives (e.g., see
Kashima et al., 2021 ).
/two.tnum./two.tnum. Simulating the global dynamics of
cumulative culture
Cultural beliefs and practices spread within a society
through communication, a process which we have referred to
as the local dynamics of cumulative culture. This description is
appropriate because the accumulated outcomes of each (local)
dyadic interaction collectively determine the degree to which an
idea is prevalent in a culture. Moving from local communication
dynamics to the prevalence of a communicable idea—in a
cumulative culture—is what we will refer to as the global
dynamics of cumulative culture.
In our simulations of a cumulative culture, 50 active
inference agents simultaneously engage in local dyadic
communication as illustrated. Forty-nine of our 50 agents were
initialized as adhering to a similar idea, which could be regarded
as the status quo (indicated with the color red later on), while
the initial strength of their adherence to this consensus varied
across individuals because we generated the parameters of
their generative models from various probability distributions
to characterize variability in the population (described in the
Appendix). The same holds for other modulators of cognitive,
aﬀective, and behavioral variability, such as (1) expectations
about each other’s expressions, (2) habit formation, and (3)
emotional valence states (all described below). Jointly, the
emergent eﬀects of these individual diﬀerences gave rise to
factions that vary in their adherence to the current consensus,
in a way reminiscent of political diversity in real-life cultural
environments: strict conservatives, centrists, and skeptics (see
also
Figure 6 below). In order to illustrate this spectrum, we
introduced one agent (labeled “rogue agent” in Figure 6) whose
idea strongly contradicted the consensus and who was fully
resistant to the consensus idea. When we introduced this agent
adhering to a divergent idea to the population, it propagated
via pseudo-random engagements of agents in dialogue. In this
simulated world of actively inferring agents, their individual
mental (generative) models were slightly modiﬁed with every
interlocutor they encounter, as their distinct representations
converged to a shared narrative (
Friston and Frith, 2015 ;
Constant et al., 2019 ). The attunement of interlocutors to
each other’s generative models on the (local) microscale thus
translated over time and with multiple encounters into collective
free energy minimization on the (global) macroscale.
/three.tnum. A generative model of
communication
For a formal (variational free energy) proof of principle,
we oﬀer an active inference account of cultural dynamics.
A foundational step in this endeavor is the formulation of
generative models underlying the decision making of agents that
can be deployed in simulations.
Active inference assumes that the brain-body system mimics
a Bayesian inference machine by embodying a model of itself
acting in the world and using local observations to secure
evidence for that model. This model is “generative” in that it
generates predictions of what observational data should look
like, given that the model is correct. Predictions are compared
with actual observations and any discrepancies (known as
“prediction errors”) are used to update the generative model
(
Smith et al., 2019 ). This (Bayesian belief) updating can be at
a fast timescale corresponding to inference about the hidden
causes of observations—or at a slow timescale corresponding
to learning the parameters of the generative model, which
best explain the inferred causes. For an elaboration on the
mathematical foundations of active inference, the reader is
referred to
Friston K. et al. (2017).
In our simulations, agents attempt to convince each other
of a cultural belief under generative models that operate with
local information only. We formulate these generative models
as a partially observed Markov decision process (MDP), where
beliefs take the form of discrete probability distributions (for
technical details on MDPs in active inference, see
Hesp et al.,
2019). To simulate active inference under these models, one
speciﬁes variables—such as hidden states ( x, s), observable
outcomes ( o) and one-step action policies ( u)—alongside
parameters specifying the probabilistic relationships between the
variables in question.
Agents’ recollection of a visit is thus an expression of
humans’ innate ability to infer each other’s expectations, which
makes human cognition, sociality, and culture possible at all
(
Veissière et al., 2020 ). This rests on the idea that humans, having
evolved to rely on elaborate and highly coordinated action, have
expectations regarding other agents’ sharing aspects of their
own generative model, and thereby believing that other agents
have those expectations as well. These carefully and implicitly
coordinated and co-constructed expectations allow agents from
a particular culture to learn what to expect from each other
and leverage those expectations to act accordingly in their
environment. In our model these expectations are manifested
as agents’ information and preference-seeking, which are biased
toward the selection of similar interlocutors to engage with,
in conversation.
MDPs allow for the construction of a deep hierarchical
model comprising nested levels of complexity. Below we will

Communication Coupling Parameters. Our model deﬁnes two groups of parameters that couple the internal states of agents: Learnin g and
inference. Perceptual learning (A/two.tnum) is the learning of associations between emotional valence and belief states that guide t he long term actions
of our agents who hold and express beliefs. This learning happens at slow time scales, accumulating across multiple interaction s and used to
modify models over extended periods of exchange. Perceptual Infer ence (A/one.tnum)—namely, sensitivity to model evidence—operates on fast time
scales and is direct and explicit to agents during dialogue. Imp ortantly, we hypothesized that without precise evidence accum ulation, agents
would be insensitive to evidence regarding the belief state of the other, and their internal states would not converge.
describe those levels and detail the cognitive processes that take
place within each one (
Figure 2).
For our simulations, six kinds of matrices were
parameterized ( A, B, C, E, C, and G) using two kinds of
concentration parameters ( α,ε) for Dirichlet distributions, and
temperature and rate parameters for precision terms (indicated
with γ ; see
Figure 3 and Appendix A9).
/three.tnum./one.tnum. Perceptual inference
The ﬁrst level of this generative model captures how
agents process belief claims they are introduced to through
conversation with other agents. The perception of another’s
beliefs requires prior beliefs (represented as likelihood mapping
A1) about how hidden states ( s1) generate sensory outcomes ( o).
Speciﬁcally, our agents form expectations about the likelihood
of encountering expressions of particular ideas, given their
beliefs about the degree of consensus in the agent’s social
circles and their past experiences with individual agents.
Parameterizing this (likelihood) mapping in terms of precision
can be understood as parameterizing each agents’ sensitivity
to the claims of others. High precision here corresponds with
high sensitivity to claims. The likelihood precisions for each
agent were generated from a continuous gamma distribution,
which was skewed in favor of high sensitivity to evidence at the
population level (see
Figure 2: Perception).
/three.tnum./one.tnum./one.tnum. Perceptual inference as a coupling
parameter
The sensitivity to another agent’s claims ( A1), represents
the explicit coupling between interlocutors, in terms of how
much belief updating one agent can induce in another agent.
It is a key element in our simulations (
Figure 1). We call
this parameter explicit because it modulates the direct (i.e.,
explicitly articulated) and immediate (i.e., occurs over the
course of a single interaction with an agent) inﬂuence of
agents’ claims on the beliefs of others (
Friston and Frith,
2015). In other words, sensitivity to claims—encoded by the
likelihood precision—couples the belief states of interlocutors
via their claims or utterances to each other (
Figure 8). Crucially,
belief updating depends not only on their adherence to
each other’s claims but also a certain (varying) degree of
commitment to their own beliefs. The balance is determined
by each agents’ sensitivity to sensory evidence; i.e., the claims
of interlocutors.
Technically, we can describe belief updating in terms of the
generative model in
Figure 3 as follows:

/three.tnum./two.tnum. Anticipation
At the ﬁrst level, our generative model speciﬁes the agents’
beliefs about how hidden states (detailed in
Appendix A2) evolve
over time. The precision of state transition probabilities in
B1 (
Figure 3C) speciﬁes the volatility of an agent’s meeting
location ( s2) and beliefs in particular claims ( s1) [ B1]. For
each agent, this precision parameter is sampled from a gamma
distribution, determining the a priori probability of changing
state, relative to maintaining a current state. Note that belief
states themselves are deﬁned on the continuous range (0, 1)
(i.e., as a probability distribution on a binary state), such that
repeated state transitions tends to result in a continuous decay
of conﬁdence over time, in the absence of new evidence (where
the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the precision of B1)
(see
Figure 2: Anticipation).
/three.tnum./three.tnum. Action
After inferring and anticipating hidden states, our agents
conduct deliberate actions to minimize expected free energy (the
generative model for action is detailed in
Appendixes A4, A5 ).
At each time point, a policy ( u) is chosen out of a set of
possible action sequences. In our simulations, two types of
actions are allowed: selecting an agent to meet at each given
time point ( u2) and selecting a speciﬁc claim to express in
conversation ( u1). The ﬁrst allowable action covers 50 possible
outcomes (one for each agent in the simulation) while the

involved in applying a softmax operator. Finally, it would also occ lude the fact that certain entries (e.g., the expected free ener gy) will vary over
time during a simulation.
second corresponds to denying or supporting the claim. In
order to simulate variability in an agents’ conﬁdence in a belief
claim, the claim is generated for each conversation from a beta
distribution that is parameterized by the speaker’s (phenotype-
congruent) action model. Each policy under the G matrix
(
Figure 3F) speciﬁes a particular combination of actions, and
the policy that minimizes expected free energy is chosen (see
Figure 2: Action).
/three.tnum./three.tnum./one.tnum. Habitual belief expression and meeting
selection
At the low level of cognitive control, each agent starts with
a baseline prior expectation concerning the probability of a
particular policy being selected (action prior probabilities [ E1
and E2],
Figures 3D,E). This parameter can be understood as
modeling a habitual cognitive process, where an agent’s current
one-step policy ( u) is biased toward previously selected actions

(u1, u2). In our simulations, agents observe and track previous
actions via the accumulation of a concentration parameter ( ε),
thus enabling continued updates to action priors, which can
either strengthen or weaken previous habits (details for habit
learning of belief expression and meeting selection are provided
in
Appendix A8).
/three.tnum./three.tnum./two.tnum. Voluntary belief expression
At the high level of cognitive control, agents incorporate
a series of processes underlying the selection of a particular
claim for expression ( u2). In addition to habitual factor (E),
this selection involves several considerations. First, an agent
considers their core belief state ( x), and the way this state a priori
maps on to one of two discrete emotional valence states ( s2)
via a likelihood mapping [ A2] (
Figure 3B). Emotional Valence
(EV) is deﬁned as the extent to which an emotion is positive
or negative ( Russell and Barrett, 1999 ), such that agents’ core
beliefs are a priori associated with either positive emotional
valence or negative emotional valence (with some probability).
As a minimal form of vicarious learning, the initial mapping is
further updated based on associations agents observe between
their interlocutors’ expressed claims and EV-value (details of the
generative process underlying belief expression and emotional
valence are provided in
Appendix A6). The initial mapping
therefore involves minimal precision for the expected EV for the
alternative belief since agents are ﬁrst introduced to this belief
(and associated EV) during the simulations. For this reason, the
initial likelihood mapping between states is updated throughout
our simulation via a crucial concentration parameter ( α) which
will be elaborated on under level 4.
The inferred EV state is then used to generate an action
precision (γ ) such that positive EV generates high conﬁdence in
action selection ( u1) and negative EV generates low conﬁdence.
Higher conﬁdence values produce higher precision on the
expected free energy ( G) for one’s belief claim expressed in the
current conversation.
EV states are generated from core belief states, using a
(learnable) likelihood mapping:
P
(
x(1)
sat|x(2)

)
= Cat

A(2)

(6)
Conﬁdence of belief expression is generated using a Gamma
distribution, where the rate parameter βexpr is the Bayesian
model average of β(+ ,− ) values associated with high and
low satisfaction:
P
(
γexpr
)
≈ Ŵ
(
1, β expr
)
(7)
β expr = β(+ ,− ) · x(1)
sat (8)
where β(+ ,− ) = [0.25; 2.0]
The expression of beliefs is guided by current core beliefs
(scaled with satisfaction-dependent γexpr) and by habitual belief
expression Eexpr (scaled with a ﬁxed parameter γE,expr):

The intrinsically stochastic and itinerant nature of the
generative process of communication is modeled by using a
two-dimensional Dirichlet distribution to generate observed
expressions on the range (0,1), where each agent’s belief
expression prior P

)
is used to specify their
concentration parameters (multiplied by 12 to reduce variance):

/three.tnum./three.tnum./three.tnum. Voluntary meeting selection
While the choice of interlocutor is predetermined in a
dyad, our multi-agent simulations required a speciﬁcation of
the process behind agents’ selection of a conversational partner
(s3) at each of the (hundred) time points. Building on previous
work on active inference navigation and planning (
Kaplan and
Friston, 2018 ), meeting selection in our model is represented
as a preferred location on a grid, where each cell on the grid
represents an agent to meet (
Figure 4).
Importantly, agents diﬀer in their action model of which
agent to visit at each time point. Their individual choices
are guided by expected free energy G (
Figure 3F) which
entails maximizing the expected utility of an action (known as
pragmatic value) as well as maximizing the expected information
gain (known as epistemic value). These two values constrain
each other such that maximizing both simultaneously is partially
(but not entirely) paradoxical (as illustrated in
Figure 4).
These constraints may also be understood as formalizing
the exploration-exploitation trade-oﬀ, where epistemic value
(exploration) refers to the beneﬁt of searching to get a better
estimation of promising areas that oﬀer pragmatic value
(exploitation) (
Friston and Frith, 2015 ).
Mathematically, action selection was formalized as follows:
P
(
uvisit|γG,visit
)
= σ
(
− γG,visitGvisit + γE,visitEvisit
)
(11)
Here, Gvisit represents the expected free energy:
Gvisit = oexpr,visit ·(ln oexpr,visit − Cidea) + H · xidea,visit (12)
An agent traveling to visit:
x(1)
idea,visit = B(1)

FIGURE /four.tnum
A simpliﬁed example of exploitation- and exploration-driven st rategies for meeting selection. This Figure illustrates the beh avioral diﬀerences
between the extreme cases of being fully driven by exploitation (Left) or exploration (Right). Each cell on the grid corresponds to a potential
interlocutor for these agents, who make decisions in three consecu tive time steps ( t = /one.tnum, /two.tnum, /three.tnum) and have previously engaged with three other
interlocutors (marked with blue rectangles), where we use the s horthand klC to indicate the pragmatic component of the expected free energy
Gpragmatic,visit = oexpr,visit ·(ln oexpr,visit − Cidea), which corresponds to the KL divergence between expectations a bout the interlocutor at that
location (as informed by previous visits) and the preferred idea s of our agents, such that lower values correspond to a better match . Cells that
are visited during t = /one.tnum, /two.tnum, /three.tnum are ﬁlled with granite. The exploitation-driven agent(Left) simply revisits three times a known interlocutor with the
lowest KLC. In contrast, the exploration-driven agent (Right) prefers novel visits and switches to an unknown agent every time s tep. In the
simulations presented later, agents will dynamically balanc e these two strategies as their preferences themselves evolve over time.
Individual preferences about the support for the idea:
Cidea = ln
(
A(2)
C x(2)
core
)
(15)
Finally, expectations about a potential reduction in
ambiguity about the support for an idea by a particular agent
reﬂects one’s recollection about their most recent visit to this
other agent. Hj = 0 if an agent can remember a recent visit (i.e.,
there is no ambiguity left to reduce), and 0.1 otherwise.
Crucially, both types of (information and goal seeking)
preferences are absorbed into expected free energy. Pragmatic
value translates into a bias toward meeting agents with
similar beliefs at a given time point. This bias reﬂects the
widely observed phenomenon in psychology research that
people’s choices tend to be biased toward conﬁrming their
current beliefs (
Nickerson, 1998 ). Conﬁrmation bias, or a
state-dependent preference ( C) for meeting “belief compatible”
agents, biases action selection through the risk component of
expected free energy ( G) (
Figure 3F). Under active inference, a
preference for meeting agents with similar beliefs increases the
propensity for generalized synchronization, which underwrites
the emergence of (expected free energy reducing) shared
expectations (
Hesp et al., 2019 ).
In contrast, emphasizing epistemic value translates into a
bias toward meeting agents whose beliefs are unknown at a
given time point. This bias reﬂects the extent to which agents
are driven by the minimization of the ambiguity component
of expected free energy ( G;
Figure 3F) about the beliefs of
other agents. Novelty seeking, or a proclivity for encountering
novel agents with unknown beliefs is a strategy for maximizing
information gain. Also understood as intrinsically motivated
curiosity behavior (
Friston K. J. et al., 2017 ), maximization
of epistemic value helps individuals to better predict the
consequences of their actions (e.g., when they decide which
agent to meet) as they reduce uncertainty about hidden states
of their environment, whether real or imagined (e.g., in this case
it refers to the ideas supported by other agents).
Because of our method of procedural generation of various
(hyper)parameters from various probability distributions
(described in more detail in the
Appendix), a continuous
spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, and aﬀective tendencies
emerged in our simulations due to the large variety of
possible combinations. In principle one could obtain any
range of behaviors from this method of procedural generation
based on a set of probability distributions for all these
hyperparameters, which could hence be ﬁtted to population
data. A full-blown analysis of all the emergent variability
in the simulated populations is beyond the scope of the
current paper.
For the sake of our demonstration, a clear distinction
between agents with high and low conﬁrmation bias was
introduced in our simulations by drawing individualized

(illustrated in

each agent’s likelihood mapping from higher-level core beliefs
to lower-level preferences concerning observed expressions. The
resulting distinct populations could have emerged from, e.g.,
cultural segregation where diﬀerent cultural subgroups have
developed diﬀerent priorities in guiding social interactions—
in this case guided more or less strongly by conﬁrmation of
core beliefs.
Novelty-seeking tendencies were not explicitly coded and
simply emerged from the parameters that regulate the relative
impact of epistemic vs. pragmatic value in the expected free
energy, although it should be clear that high conﬁrmation bias
tends to suppress novelty-seeking. In

purely for communicative purposes and should not be taken as
a deﬁnite discretization.
/three.tnum./four.tnum. Perceptual learning
On this level of belief updating, agents learn contingencies;
for example, how core belief states (speciﬁed in
Appendix A1)
change over time ( B2) ( Figure 3C). This is the highest level
of cognitive processing, where agents learn (as detailed in
Appendix A3). By talking with other synthetic agents and
inferring their emotional and belief states, our agents learn
associations between EV and beliefs via a high level likelihood
mapping ( A2), (updated via concentration parameter α). The
updating of the likelihood mapping between beliefs and claims,
is detailed in
Appendix A7. This kind of learning is important
because it provides our agents with certainty, regarding the
emotional value they can expect from holding the alternative
belief to the status quo, which has low precision at the beginning
of the simulation (before the population is introduced to an
agent proclaiming this belief).
/three.tnum./four.tnum./one.tnum. Perceptual learning as a coupling
parameter
The learning of associations between belief and emotional
valence states may be understood as a form of implicit coupling
between agents (
Figure 1), in that it represents an indirect and
secondary inﬂuence of one agent’s internal state on another.
That is, sensitivity to each others’ mental states is made possible
only through inferences about the others’ emotional state (in
the absence of any overt or observable evidence for that
emotional state).
In contrast to perceptual inference, learning occurs at slow
time scales as mutual minimization of prediction error brings
about a convergence in the parameters of hierarchical models
Frontiers in Neurorobotics /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org
Kastel et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnbot./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/six.tnum
that generate mutually sympathetic (or possibly empathetic)
predictions. Parameter learning accumulates across multiple
interactions, modifying generative models over a long period
of time as opposed to being immediately expressed in agents’
behavior. This is why perceptual learning does not bring about
an immediate convergence or synchrony between interlocutors’
internal states, but is only expressed in agents’ adapted behavior
over time.
Individuals vary in the degree to which they are sensitive
to the information gained by learning associations between
belief states and their potential emotional outcomes. This
variation is represented in each agent’s categorical probability
distribution A2 that is updated throughout the simulation via
a concentration parameter ( α) as they accumulate information
with every agent they meet. Updates to the A2-concentration
parameters model the way in which agents’ associations between
belief and emotional states are based on implicit observations of
others’ emotional states.

communication by casting cultural transmission as a bi-
directional communicative process that entails a particular
convergence between distinct conveyors and conveners of
cultural information. We provide a proof of concept for this
formalization of communication dynamics by simulating a
dialogue between active inference agents holding distinct beliefs
and trying to convince each other of their own beliefs.

/four.tnum./one.tnum. Local dynamics of coupled
communication
/four.tnum./one.tnum./one.tnum. The emergence of generalized synchrony
from coupled communication
In nature, generalized synchrony emerges from sparse
coupling between the internal states of dissipative chaotic
systems (
Pikovsky et al., 2003 ). In our model, generalized
synchrony within a social system is operationalized as
a convergence between belief states held by interlocutors
(
Figure 1). In other words, generalized synchrony between
mutually inferring agents is understood as signaling a form
of cultural reproduction of beliefs, namely, a mechanism by
which previously distinct internal states merge and combine into
one. This convergence is made possible through a particular
coupling between the internal states of cultural entities, under
which generalized synchrony is an emergent phenomenon.
We hypothesized that without active perception and mutual
model updating, belief convergence would be precluded, since
interlocutors’ inner states would be inaccessible to each other.
That is, agents’ ability to actively infer hidden states in the
world and update their own model according to the sensory
evidence they receive is the foundation for achieving generalized
synchrony in a social system.
Our results indicate that agents’ ability to listen and attune
to the claims of their partner is indeed limited to the extent
that they are sensitive to sensory evidence from their encultured
environment (
Figure 8).
To understand the implications of these ﬁndings, it is
important to shed light on the way they tie in to previous
work on active inference communication. In
Friston and
Frith (2015) provided evidence for the notion that generalized
synchrony becomes altogether unattainable when agents do
not possess suﬃciently similar generative models. Our results
go beyond this and provide evidence for the idea that
only when generalized synchrony is attainable (i.e., when
interlocutors possess suﬃciently similar generative models),
communication underlies a convergence between agents’ belief
states. Our simulations should therefore be understood as taking

the premise that the level to which agents’ beliefs converge (i.e.,
the level of synchrony between their internal states) is modulated
by their sensitivity to model evidence ( A1).
/four.tnum./two.tnum. Global dynamics of cumulative
culture
Our simulations of a cumulative culture should be
understood as modeling the dynamics of a culture that is the
sum (or accumulation) of modiﬁcations to cultural beliefs and
practices over time (
Figure 9). While the local dyadic dynamics
simulated in the previous section illustrate convergence to
shared belief states held by individual agents, our global
simulations leverage this synchronization to evince emergent
dynamics within the population. We now review the key
(predicted and) emergent phenomena we observed under this
model of cumulative culture:
/four.tnum./two.tnum./one.tnum. The introduction and spread of a novel
belief induces segregation within a population
When a divergent (non status quo) belief state propagates
within our synthetic population, it brings about segregation
into sub-groups. Qualitatively, this is represented as a visible
separation between two groups of agents: those that hold a belief
that approximates the status quo (presented in red), and those
that approximate the alternative, divergent belief (presented
in blue).
In active inference, this communicative isolation (where
agents gradually form groups of individuals they would prefer
to converse with) can be explained by the attunement of
interlocutor’s generative models on the microscale, which
translates over time—and with multiple encounters—into
collective free energy minimization on the macroscale. On the
microscale, local eﬀorts to minimize free energy are expressed
as agents’ disinclination for meeting interlocutors that hold
intractably divergent beliefs. On the macroscale, these local
eﬀorts translate into a global collective behavior of self organized
separation between incongruent groups of agents, such that
communicative isolation best ensures both local and collective
free energy minimization. In other words, when an intractable
divergent belief propagates within a homogenous population,
communicative isolation between incongruent groups emerges
as a strategy to minimize expected free energy, while the same
strategy homogenizes the belief states of agents within congruent
groups. It is interesting to reﬂect on the observation that the
size of the two groups was roughly equivalent; a phenomena that
characterizes many instances of cultural convergence (
Myerson
and Weber, 1993 ); e.g., the voting in the UK for Brexit.

regards to the idea that represents the initial status quo (top indicates /one.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum% support, bottom indicates /zero.tnum% support) over time (horizontal axes)

individual agents by means of their vertical location as well, w ith a color scale for additional clarity (red indicating maximal support for the status
quo, blue maximal support for the novel idea). (A) Simulation of a Cumulative Culture: In this reference simula tion, half of all agents are
parameterized with high conﬁrmation bias. When a divergent beli ef state (blue) is introduced to the status quo population (red) at the ﬁrst time
step, it spreads through it via agents in dialogue that cumulatively change the belief structur e within the population. Notably, the introduction of
a divergent belief seems to split the population into two subgroup s: those supporting the new idea, and those adhering to the previ ous status
quo. This eﬀect is modulated by agents’ individual strategies for choosing which interlocutors to engage with (s/three.tnum).(B) High levels of novelty
seeking in the population: When only /one.tnum/five.tnum% of agents are parameterized with high conﬁrmation bias, the population exhibits high levels of novelty
seeking and ends up being divided in favor of the divergent belief state, with more agents eventually holding this belief than the status quo. (C)

Figure 5) and novelty
seeking (emerging from G) aﬀect the segregation within the
population into groups of agents holding either congruent
beliefs or the alternative belief. When conﬁrmation bias is
relatively low (
Figure 9B), the population evolves such that the
majority of agents end up subscribing to the alternative belief.
However, when conﬁrmation bias is relatively high (
Figure 9C),
the majority of agents remains convinced of the previous
status quo.
These results indicate that conﬁrmation bias suppresses
tendencies of the population as a whole toward the adoption
of an idea that diverges from the status quo. When the
conﬁrmation-driven fraction of the population is relatively low
(15%), we naturally observe more novelty-seeking behaviors,
indicating agents are more “open-minded” and willing to
meet with agents of unknown beliefs. They are intrinsically
encouraged by their own curiosity to expose themselves to
novel expressions. Once such agents become convinced by such
interactions, they can start to popularize it for the rest of
the population. If the population is, however, made up of a
majority of agents driven by conﬁrmation bias, they do not
engage as much with the alternative belief and popularization
is precluded.
These results are reminiscent of the widely used “adopter
categories” theory, a theoretical framework outlined by Everett
Rogers in his book “Diﬀusion of Innovations” which deﬁnes
ﬁve groups in terms of their relative precession in adopting an
innovation (
Rogers et al., 2014 ). According to this framework,
the ﬁrst two groups to adopt an innovation are innovators and
early adopters, which make up 2.5 and 13.5% of the population,
respectively (
Sahin, 2006 ). Our results appear to be consonant
with the ﬁnding that relatively small numbers of early adopters
and innovators play a signiﬁcant role in the propagation of
an innovation to other segments of the population (
Dedehayir
et al., 2017 ). One explanation for this phenomenon is that
innovators and early adopters communicate innovations and
their relative advantages to other segments of the population,
thereby popularizing them.

/five.tnum. Discussion
In this paper, we provide an active inference framework
for the emergence of a cumulative culture from joint
communication dynamics. The principal achievement of this
framework is that it oﬀers an overarching, quantitative and
multiscale account against which multiple hypotheses from
diﬀerent domains of the social sciences may be universally
tested. This accomplishment has the potentiality to bring
the replication crisis faced by the psychological and social
sciences in the past decade, a step closer to a resolution. A
formal, standardized model of cultural evolution can evoke such
an outcome as personal intuitions and culturally biased folk
theories that currently make results diﬃcult or impossible to
reproduce, will become anchored to an objective and universally
agreed upon veriﬁable account.
Notably, our framework oﬀers a multiscale approach to the
understanding of cultural evolution processes, as expressed in at
least three ways. Firstly, it refers to the intrinsically hierarchical
nature of the generative models themselves characterizing
aﬀective, cognitive, and behavioral dynamics (described at
length in the text and summarized in
Figure 2). Secondly,
we combined this with the hierarchical nature of the dyadic
interaction process (described at length in the text and
summarized in
Figure 7). Thirdly, these dyadic interactions
were contextualized by a multi-agent setting for which
parametrizations themselves were generated procedurally from
population-level distributions of hyperparameters (described
at length in the text and
Appendix, illustrated in Figure 6)
and including two subgroups (described in Figure 5). Our
simulations depict cultural dynamics that arise from one another
to form nested levels of hierarchical organization, quintessential
to complex dynamical systems. This novel way of modeling
cultural dynamics across layers of organization accord nicely
with new approaches to artiﬁcial intelligence that originate
from the notion that intelligence emerges as much from
cells and societies as it does from individuals. The emerging
ﬁeld of biologically inspired artiﬁcial intelligence involves
computational approaches that model biological systems on
various layers of organization. Such artiﬁcial intelligence systems
include: cellular systems; neural systems; immune systems; bio-
mimetic, epi-genetic and evolutionary robots as well as collective
systems. In this section we will discuss the speciﬁc implications
of our multilevel cultural simulations on the ﬁeld of biologically
inspired artiﬁcial intelligence.
/five.tnum./one.tnum. Communication models for
biologically inspired artiﬁcial intelligence
Traditionally, AI has been concerned with representing
the behaviors and architectures of human cognition. The
preoccupation with human intelligence stems from the widely
accepted notion that despite being neither the strongest nor the
fastest species on earth, humans occupy a distinctly dominant
position. Intellectual in nature, this dominance has previously
been attributed to our culture, morality and language. However,
in most of these social-cultural capacities, great apes share
striking similarities with humans, yet still do not show human
level intelligence, which leaves social scientists wondering about
the underlying roots and causes of human intelligence. Recent
studies show that despite their striking similarity to humans
in most social-cultural domains, great apes are not cognitively
equipped for the kinds of social coordination with others
that is evident in humans (
Krupenye et al., 2016 ; Tomasello,
2018). These ﬁndings suggest that humans might owe their
remarkable intelligence to their unique ability to coordinate their
behavior through joint communication and other (non verbal)
cultural exchanges.
The idea that humans’ cognitive skills are the result of shared
intentionality, coordination, communication and social learning
is known as the ontogenetic adaptation hypothesis (
Tomasello,
2020). This theory stipulates that animals use social learning
to gather information from their conspeciﬁcs about challenges
in their environment while avoiding some of the energetic and
time costs associated with a-social, trial and error learning
(
Clark and Dumas, 2016 ). According to this, social interactions-
and speciﬁcally, communication and coordination- are a crucial
component of human intelligence.
This makes a strong case for the use of communication
models as inspiration for the development of socially intelligent
artiﬁcial agents. Indeed, equipping artiﬁcial agents with the
ability to accurately coordinate and communicate with other
agents in their environment may well be a crucial missing piece
in the modeling of advanced- human level- cognitive abilities.
By modeling the underlying dynamics of social communication
and coordination as we have in this paper, we bring to
light an otherwise unexplored topic, which may be one of
the most promising directions for achieving human level
machine intelligence.
/five.tnum./two.tnum. Cumulative culture models for
biologically inspired artiﬁcial intelligence
The social sciences are on the verge of a revolution,
where researchers begin to have a more complex understanding
of the ways in which cultural practices and social choices
interplay with, and shape human experiences. Speciﬁcally, it
is becoming clear that individual intelligence is not what
makes us- above other species- uniquely intelligent. Rather,
the last decade has brought with it the notion that the
cumulative nature of human culture is responsible for our
exceptional cognitive capabilities and intelligence as a species.
Frontiers in Neurorobotics /one.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org
Kastel et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnbot./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/six.tnum
This capacity to acquire- across generations- highly evolved
and complex social systems such as language, cities and
technologies, are said to have sharpened humans’ cognitive
capacities and survival strategies in a way that no other
species has ever had the privilege to experience (
Henrich,
2015).
Other related theories suggest that individuals are not “the
brains” behind a creative idea, but that innovation is in fact
a product of a collective cultural brain (
Muthukrishna and
Henrich, 2016 ). According to this, The ideas of individuals
do not stand in competition or comparison with other agents
in the population, but are better understood as a nexus for
previously isolated ideas within it. This collective approach to
cultural innovation is supported by empirical ﬁndings showing
that innovation rates are higher in cultures with high sociality
(i.e., large and highly interconnected populations that oﬀer
exposure to more ideas), transmission ﬁdelity (i.e., better
learning between agents) and transmission variance (i.e., a
willingness to somewhat deviate from the accepted learned
norms) (
Muthukrishna and Henrich, 2016 ).
Although the capacity for cumulative culture (i.e., the
capacity to acquire complex social systems through learning that
accumulates across generations) in animals remains contentious
(
Dean et al., 2014 ), their expression of collective intelligent
systems in swarms ( Chakraborty and Kar, 2017 ), ant-colonies
(Blum, 2005 ), ﬂocks of birds ( Boucherie et al., 2019 ), schools of
ﬁsh ( Boucherie et al., 2019 ) and other social systems, is evident
in nature and has become an integral part in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial
intelligence as more and more high complexity problems require
bio-inspired solutions that are achievable within a reasonable
period of time.
To the extent that the cumulative and collective nature of
culture provides an accurate account of intelligence, as theories
suggest, investigating the underlying mechanisms of intelligence
may be informed by the investigation of complex social-cultural
systems. In this case, providing a quantitative and measurable
account of the way a “collective brain” emerges from simple,
local rules of operation (namely, joint communication), as we
have illustrated in this paper, becomes invaluable in the pursuit
of machine intelligence.
/five.tnum./three.tnum. Embodied active inference for
biologically inspired artiﬁcial intelligence
Embodied cognition is the theory that many elements of
cognition are shaped by elements of the entire body of the
organism. While emphasizing the circular causality between the
environment and the individual, social embodiment suggests
that embodiment in social beings plays a signiﬁcant role and
improves upon social interactions. Justiﬁcations for social
embodiment are that diﬀerent body states (such as postures
and facial expressions) enhance the communicative skills
of embodied agents and consequently, play a central role
in social information processing such that interactions
between embodied agents and humans are facilitated
(
Bolotta and Dumas, 2021 ).
A natural speculation may be that robots have better skills of
communication and inter-robot social inference and expression
than digital avatars, since they can use their bodies for behavioral
expression and coordination with other robots. However, we
argue that despite lacking a physical body, active inference
avatars are embodied in that the computational formalism that is
applied to them (namely, active inference) implies embodiment.
Technically, what this means is that active inference agents in
our simulations adhere to three formal conditions for having
embodied cognition:
1. They have a perceptual system which allows them to gather
culturally relevant information from their surroundings.
This is evident in the ﬁrst layer (“perception”) of the
hierarchical structure of the generative model of the agents
(
Figure 2).
2. They have a motor system that allows them to communicate
their internal states to their social environment. This is
evident in the third layer (“action”) of the hierarchical
structure of the generative model of the agents
(
Figure 2).
3. They are situated in their environment such that they are
able to manipulate their dynamic surroundings through
their actions. This is evident in agents’ ability to listen
and attune to each others’ belief expression in a way
that allows for a coupling of their internal states and
the emergence of generalized synchrony between them
(
Figure 8).
The fact that agents under the active inference formulation
conform to these three conditions is non trivial, and it points
to the fact that these agents could not be simply replaced by
any hypothetical- non embodied- simulated intelligent being.
In other words, our simulations would not make sense unless
applied to a population that adheres to the certain criteria
aforementioned. We could only apply our simulations to
agents that adhere to all these conditions (i.e., have embodied
cognition), or our simulations simply would not work. In this
sense, our agents may not be physically embodied robots, but
we argue that- by deﬁnition- as active inference agents capable
of perceptions and actions in a situated environment, they are
software embodied agents. Had we put this software into social
robots that had the hardware equivalent of “ears” and “mouths, ”
we would be able to produce embodied robots in a way that
would improve their social interactions. Crucially, we argue here
that embodiment must be present in both the software and the
hardware for social interactions of agents to be enhanced by it,
and that the active inference formalism implies embodiment for
the former.

/five.tnum./four.tnum. Limitations and future research
Although this paper provides important insights into the
underlying dynamics of social-cultural systems, it entails certain
limitations that will now be outlined and may be addressed in
future research.
First, our communication simulations assume that social
exchange is limited to a dyad, when in fact generalized
synchrony in nature may occur between multiple coupled
systems. Our formulations of the exchange of social information
as communication therefore represent only a speciﬁc case
of generalized synchrony that might highlight a much more
encompassing phenomenon. As an example, through social
media, cultural information can reach large populations at a
given time point. The idea that generalized synchrony between
inferring agents may go beyond the emergent behavior of
two communicators and exist between ensembles of coupled
self organizing systems has also been considered in the active
inference literature (
Palacios et al., 2019 ).
Second, while we provide a formulation of the way
modiﬁcations to cultural information occur during
communication (i.e., the transmission of social information)
and we have simulated the emergence of cumulative culture
from these dynamics (i.e., the prevalence of social information),
we have not provided an account of the way novel social
information is introduced into a population to begin with. We
have assumed that belief states are gradually modiﬁed with every
cultural exchange, such that the outcome of this exchange may
be considered novel by virtue of it being a unique recombination
of existing beliefs and practices. Future research may focus on
asking important questions like: Why are we inclined to say
that innovation is a unique event that does not occur with every
cultural transmission? More importantly, how can we deﬁne
and even model the diﬀerence between a slight modiﬁcation to
a cultural trait and innovation?
The importance of identifying exactly what constitutes
innovation and how to model its emergence is critical for
an accurate understanding of socio-cultural dynamics because
it would bring the circular dynamics of a complex culture
to a required close (
Figure 10). Under such an account,
not only would cumulative culture naturally emerge from a
complex network of agents engaged in joint communication
(as shown in this proposal), but innovation would emerge
from cumulative culture and underlie communication in a
repeating, recursive loop that is the hallmark of complex
dynamical systems.
In the simulation environment presented here, eﬃcient
communication could be considered, to some extent, as
reﬂecting local communicative needs and these needs are
grounded in properties of this socio-cultural environment.
However, the environment itself does not impose any of
the practical constraints known to drive real-life human
behaviors (e.g., need for food, warmth, hygiene). Previously,
FIGURE /one.tnum/zero.tnum
The circular dynamics of cultural evolution.researchers have argued that practical beneﬁts in adapting to the
environment tend to accelerate the repetition and widespread
adoption of cultural practices (
Kashima et al., 2019 ). In future
work, the authors aim to expand on these notions by enriching
the simulated environment with actual practical constraints.
In the current work, emotional valence was tied to action
conﬁdence in a top-down manner (it aﬀected action-model
precision for both meeting selection and expression) but not
in a bottom-up manner (e.g., based on action outcomes).
For the sake of simplicity, inﬂuences on emotional valence
were purely associative (i.e., based on emotional expressions
of conversation partners). Therefore, one natural and valuable
extension of these simulations in future work would be to
fully incorporate the recursive and principled formulation of
emotional valence that has been derived from deep active
inference (
Hesp et al., 2021 ), which naturally tracks changes
in subjective ﬁtness. This recurrent formulation, in particular
when combined with imagination-induced aﬀect (see
Hesp
et al., 2020 ), will speciﬁcally beneﬁt from the grounding of
these simulated cultural exchanges in a more elaborate virtual
environment combined with agents that have actual bodily and
social needs such that subjective ﬁtness estimates (based on
action-model precision) come to confer some practical relevance
(as described in the preceding paragraph).
Finally, another limitation of our simulations is that the
agents’ freedom for choosing the interlocutors they want to
engage with, might bias cultural transmission in a way that
does not apply to some forms of social interaction. Speciﬁcally,
meeting selection, or the freedom to voluntarily select the
transmitting interlocutor, does not extend to social interactions
in which agents do not have a choice in determining the source
of their cultural learning. For example, during development,
children are constantly exposed to individuals, social situations,
cultural practices, and conversations that they do not voluntarily
select. In this case, it is the Parents’ culturally dominant
behaviors that play a central role in the development of children’s
internalization of cultural beliefs, rather than the voluntary
actions of their children (
Fernald and Morikawa, 1993 ; Senzaki
et al., 2016 ).

/six.tnum. Conclusion
In this paper, we employed a Bayesian framework—known
as active inference—to formally account for the dynamics
underlying (local) communication and (global) cumulative
culture dynamics, thus contributing to the ever-growing body
of research on multi-agent Bayesian models (e.g.,
Gunji et al.,
2018) and collective active inference (e.g., Friedman et al.,
2021; Heins et al., 2022 ) Under our account, the social
“transmission” of cultural information has been cast as a
fundamentally bidirectional process of communication, which
has been shown in the previous active inference literature
to induce a generalized synchrony between the internal
(belief) states of agents holding suﬃciently similar generative
models. Building on this work, we operationalized generalized
synchrony as a particular convergence between the internal
states of interlocutors, and show that it depends sensitively
on the precision of observation or likelihood mappings in
a generative model of communicative exchange. When we
simulate a population of agents that simultaneously engage in
communication over time, cumulative culture emerges as the
collective behavior brought about by local belief updating (active
inference and learning in a dyadic setting). Our simulations
show that when a divergent belief is introduced to the status quo,
it spreads within the population and brings about a collective
behavior characterized by a certain degree of segregation
between diﬀerent belief groups. The level to which the status
quo population defects to the divergent belief is mediated by
local psychological biases for conﬁrmation bias (as directly
manipulated) and novelty seeking (as emergent from procedural
generation of parameters). These cultural (c.f., voting) equilibria
are minimizers of collective or joint free energy that emerge
from the imperative to minimize uncertainty and surprise in
dyadic exchanges.
