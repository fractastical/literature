Abstract
Why do individuals tend to discount bad news when making judgements about the likelihood of 
future events? In this short review, we explore recent research findings regarding this frequently 
observed and replicated phenomenon – optimism bias – with particular attention on how this 
bias affects the way individuals update or revise their beliefs. We begin by highlighting five 
interrelated frameworks for understanding optimism bias (utility maximization, active inference, 
dual systems, cognitive immunity, predictive processing). We then examine findings from affective 
and clinical domains that indicate that people with depression and other psychiatric disorders, as 
well as acutely sad or anxious individuals, have dampened optimistic bias when updating beliefs in 
response to good news. Finally, we consider the neural underpinnings of these phenomena through 
the free energy principle and discuss implications for clinical interventions and future research.
Many believe they are more likely to have positive experiences and less likely to have 
negative ones relative to the average person. This widely reported and frequently replicated 
observation has drawn significant attention, particularly in psychology and economics. After 
all, if people are systematically miscalculating their likelihood of experiencing risks and 
benefits, then it follows that cognitive processes underlying their decisions fundamentally 
diverge from economically optimal choices. Crucially, disruptions to these processes have 
been implicated in several psychiatric conditions and are associated with symptoms of 
depression and anxiety – potentially affecting millions of Americans each year.
Termed optimism bias (OB), this phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in the 
psychological and behavioral economic literature. Recent investigations have linked OB 
with evaluation of transport costs [1], construction management [2], education processes

[3,4], psychotherapy quality [5], risk management [6], consumer communication [7], digital 
safety [8], and COVID-19 infection [9,10]. Findings in these areas are largely consistent: 
individuals demonstrate OB in the face of disconfirming evidence.
The purpose of this brief review is to examine unrealistic optimistic belief updating through 
the integration and analysis of recent major findings. Using an interdisciplinary approach, 
integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, and other fields, 
we explore developments through five distinct, but interrelated, conceptual frameworks. 
Further, we examine neuroaffective alterations to belief updating and OB and some of 
the neurological substrates of these processes using the free energy principle. Lastly, we 
highlight potential implications for the development of novel interventions and identify 
directions for future research.
Models of belief formation and optimistically biased updating
Functionally, optimistically biased belief updating results is the increased tendency towards 
integration of good news (i.e., reduced likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes, 
increased likelihood of experiencing positive outcomes), compared to bad news (i.e., the 
reverse) into beliefs (see Figure 1) [11]. To explain this, Sharot et al. (2021) [12] employ 
a utility maximization framework: every belief carries a certain utility, reflecting the 
perceived benefits or costs associated with holding it (see Figure 2). When potentially 
changing a belief, individuals must unconsciously weigh their expected utility of adopting a 
new belief against the old one by evaluating the expected external (e.g., tangible rewards or 
consequences) and internal (e.g., psychological well-being or self-esteem) outcomes. These 
outcomes can be further defined as accuracy-dependent or accuracy-independent, reflecting 
the extent to which the outcomes rely on the correctness of the belief. For example, beliefs 
that lead to positive external outcomes, such as financial gains or social approval, may carry 
higher utility than beliefs that result in negative external outcomes, such as financial losses 
or social rejection. Similarly, beliefs that contribute to positive internal outcomes, such as 
feelings of security or self-confidence, may be valued more highly than beliefs that lead to 
negative internal outcomes, such as anxiety or self-doubt.
Oeberst and Imhoff (2023) [13] consolidate these findings, arguing that cognitive biases 
result from the same underlying phenomenology: (1) that individuals tend to consider their 
own reference point as a reasonable basis for belief formation and (2) that they then engage 
in both motivated (e.g., the belief is deeply held or undermining it would undermine many 
other beliefs) and unmotivated (e.g., attending more fully to information that aligns with 
reference beliefs) belief-consistent information processing. Specifically, these operations 
may be primarily driven by a hedonic bias – that although individuals are motivated toward 
increased accuracy, they tend to sample positively biased information more readily [14]. 
Using an active inference framework, Paulus et al. (2019) [15] suggest that organisms that 
generate expectancies about future events gain an adaptive advantage by encoding useful 
information and encouraging behaviors that have led to positive outcomes, even in the face 
of disconfirming evidence.

Based on the Oeberst and Imhoff classification system, OB can be classified alongside 
other self-serving biases (e.g., better-than-average effect [16], availability heuristic [17]) that 
are associated with behavioral economic theory. Specifically, the dual systems framework 
suggests that biases are driven by two primary cognitive systems: a “fast intuitive” one 
associated with optimistic belief updating and a “slow reflective” one associated with 
realistic belief formation. Supporting this model, Sjåstad and Baumeister (2023) [18] 
demonstrate that, upon taking time to deliberate, individuals tend toward realistic belief 
updating in the face of valenced, disconfirming evidence. Likewise, especially large 
discrepancies between initial beliefs and positive information are discounted in belief 
updates, suggesting a “tipping point” wherein suspiciously discrepant information activates 
this slow, deliberative process and fails to be assimilated regardless of direction [19,20].
Alternatively, Würtz et al. (2024) [20] invoke the better-than-average effect in describing the 
cognitive immunization framework (see Figure 3). They argue that because most people 
believe themselves to be above-average, when presented with conflicting information (e.g., 
that performance is average), they use motivated reasoning to explain the discrepancy. 
In other words, individuals “immunize” themselves against information that may be 
psychologically harmful.
Many of these observations can be integrated through a predictive processing model [21]. 
This model proposes that the brain generates expectancies based on prior experiences, 
utilizing “prediction units” (PUs) and “prediction error units” (PEs) to minimize error 
and shape cognitive-affective experiences [22]. This perspective emphasizes the temporally 
dynamic nature of neural processing, suggesting that affective experiences should be 
conceptualized as trajectories from pre-stimulus to post-stimulus brain states. Unlike the 
static view of discrete emotional states in the traditional hierarchical neural system, the 
predictive processing model advocates for a heterarchical organization, characterized by 
flexible and bidirectional functional relationships between brain regions [22].
Moreover, the predictive processing model challenges the notion of stable neural baselines, 
suggesting that the brain is in a constant state of activity, continuously responding to 
feedback from predictions rather than lying dormant until specific stimulation occurs [22]. 
This perspective highlights the importance of accounting for initial neural conditions when 
evaluating neural responses to stimuli and emphasizes perturbation of dynamical systems 
over responses to stimuli as a fundamental aspect of neural processing. This perspective may 
also help elucidate other cognitive biases like the endowment effect and status quo bias [23]: 
the brain’s propensity to incorporate priors may lead to assigning higher value to existing 
beliefs/status quo, increasing resistance to potential alternatives.
Optimistic belief updating and emotional dysfunction
Crucially, predictive processing integrates baseline cognitive-affective states with a 
mechanistic updating process that initiates belief revision. Recently, significant interest 
has focused on evaluating OB in populations experiencing emotional dysfunction (i.e., 
with altered initial cognitive-affective conditions). For example, optimistically biased belief 
updating is not observed in populations with major depressive [20,24] and anxiety disorders

[25]. Instead, people with depression have blunted emotional reactions to positive PEs, but 
not to negative ones [26]. People with depression also appear to demonstrate increased 
learning from negatively valenced information, while anxiety disorders are associated with 
decreased learning from any disconfirming evidence, positive or negative [25]. Individuals 
with high-functioning autism [27] and those that experience delusions and psychosis [25,28] 
also demonstrate decreased OB. Lastly, patients with psychosis also demonstrate decreased 
overall learning responsivity [25].
However, these effects do not appear to be limited to clinical populations. Garrett et al. 
2018 [29] demonstrate that optimistically biased belief updating disappears when individuals 
experience acute perceived threat. Similarly, using negative mood induction, Kube et al. 
[30] found that state negative affect significantly hinders integration of unexpectedly positive 
performance feedback into self-evaluations, speaking to impaired inferential learning under 
dysphoric conditions. Lastly, we have demonstrated that when presented with bad news 
about experiencing future negative events optimistic belief updating vanishes for individuals 
who are acutely sad [31].
These observations challenge the conception of OB as a stable construct resistant to changes 
based on experiences and affective states. For example, an age effect of decreasing OB 
and decreased OB following military deployment suggest that individual-level events and 
life experiences lead to changes in OB [32,33]. Identifying and assessing changes to OB, 
particularly following adverse individual level (e.g., trauma) and macro-level (e.g., economic 
recession) has been identified as a crucial area requiring further investigation [34].
In addressing these findings, Paulus et al. (2019) [15], suggest that hyperprecise priors 
(i.e., strongly held initial expectancies) and contextual rigidity (i.e., failure to update beliefs 
in the face of disconfirming evidence) are dysfunctional cognitive processes in people 
with depression and other psychiatric conditions that increase attentiveness to negatively 
valenced information. In their conception, depressive cognitions result in more strongly 
held (hyperprecise) priors that are rigid to valenced but uncertain information, leading 
to reinforcement of these evaluation networks. This results in an adaptive advantage for 
individuals experiencing frequent and overwhelming negative outcomes in response to 
resource-gathering behaviors.
Neuroaffective basis of optimism bias
A significant body of research investigating the neural processes that underly optimism 
bias has emerged. Here we attempt to summarize these findings and unite them with 
the theoretical models outlined above, though for a more detailed account with potential 
alternative interpretations, we recommend Erthal et al. (2021) [51] for a detailed review. For 
example, loss aversion in animal models is associated with increased anterior insular cortical 
(AIC) activity and connectivity [35,36]. In humans, the default mode network (DMN), 
which is associated with self-referential and ruminative cognitive processes, characteristic 
of people with depression, is modulated by the AIC [37], which, in turn, is attenuated in 
response to negative stimuli. Collectively, this highlights the centrality of DMN activity in 
the depression of OB when confronted with negatively valenced disconfirming evidence

[38]. Accordingly, the relationship between depressive symptoms and thwarted updating of 
positive news is fully mediated by self-evaluative (i.e., DMN) processes [20].
In people with depression, the DMN is activated during conscious processing of emotional 
stimuli [39]. Thus, patients may more readily update beliefs in response to negative 
information because the brain areas recruited for analyzing the content, particularly 
information processing from the DMN [40], are more heavily traversed (hyperactivated) 
due to depressive rumination [41]. When individuals are presented with novel stimuli or 
information that challenges existing beliefs, the brain initiates the belief updating process, 
engaging regions that are typically involved in self-referential cognitive processing and 
decision-making [42]. The activation of portions of the DMN during belief updating 
tasks suggests that individuals simulate thinking patterns associated with evaluating new 
information when considering potential belief change [43]. However, people with depression 
appear to discount or ignore evidence that contradicts existing beliefs, particularly when 
those beliefs contribute to positive internal outcomes (e.g., feelings of security, self-worth) 
via attenuated left insular (i.e., social emotional processing [44]) and dorsomedial prefrontal 
cortical (i.e., top-down control of affective framing of episodic memory, spontaneous 
optimistic self-evaluation [45]) activity.
The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC: emotion processing, decision making) is 
associated with OB to positive information, while the ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC; 
value computation, decision-making [46]) and posterior cingulate (PCC; central DMN 
structure associated with future planning, autobiographic memory retrieval [47]) cortices 
are activated during general assessment of unexpected positive information [48]. Depression 
symptoms are also associated with increased vmPFC and PCC activity to positively 
disconfirming stimuli [48]. These regions are usually attenuated during self-evaluative 
feedback for traits with increased dependencies, reducing updates of self-views to maintain 
self-concept coherence [42]. Taken together, these findings indicate that depressivity is 
associated with attenuated self-protective cognitive processes (i.e., cognitive immunity) and 
increased consolidation of negative self-views due to hyperactivity in these networks [20], 
consistent with the finding that reduced OB is associated with lower self-esteem [49].
Lastly, the ACC generally modulates communication between frontal cortical and limbic 
structures. Increased rACC/amygdala connectivity is associated with onset of depressive 
symptoms and rACC/AIC connectivity is associated with emotional regulation [50]. 
Activation of the ACC and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) are significantly associated 
with increased OB, particularly in the discounting of unexpected negative information 
[11,51]. Interestingly, the rIFG activity, associated with response inhibition and attentional 
control, differentiates depressed patients from controls in belief updating tasks [52]. This 
decreased negative correlation of rIFG activity with negative PEs suggests that inhibition of 
attention and responsiveness to negatively disconfirming stimuli plays an important role in 
the presence of blunted OB.

A general neuroaffective framework for understanding optimism bias
In consolidating these findings, we emphasize a framework for understanding OB based on 
the predictive processing model and the free-energy principle. According to this conception, 
the brain acts a “prediction machine” constantly generating expectancies about conscious 
experience and reacting to deviations from these. From an evolutionary perspective, this 
predictive processing model maximizes metabolic efficiency by seeking savings through the 
minimization of differences between expected and actual sensory experiences [22,53]. In 
other words, neural systems continuously adjust to find the lowest energy state, helping 
to explain why initial affective conditions and persistently altered mental states (e.g., 
depression) lead to fundamental alterations in these processes.
Discrete emotional states have previously been considered the result of “lower” sub-cortical 
and limbic/paralimbic neural systems, but the predictive processing model describes 
affective experiences as diffuse and reliant upon feedforward and feedback error minimizing 
procedures across multiple “higher” and “lower” level systems [22]. When the brain is 
confronted with a “surprising” stimulus, the ongoing cognitive operations are altered – 
in acutely sad or anxious people this results in reduced inhibition (via rIFG activity) of 
negatively disconfirming stimuli.
Alternatively, in depressive disorders, brain areas that are reliably activated during periods 
of rest between cognitive tasks (i.e., DMN) are also more frequently activated during 
social cognitive tasks and consume metabolic energy while traversing multiple functionally 
connective states [22]. Because these pathways are more densely connected due to 
depressive rumination, energy minimizing systems increase recruitment of these regions. 
As a result, depressive (and anxious or psychotic) disorders experience increased integration 
of negatively valenced stimuli.
Clinical implications and directions for future research
Several possibilities for utilizing these insights in treatment of psychiatric disorders 
have been advanced. For example, interventions could integrate optimism training and 
inhibition of cognitive immunization into psychotherapy [54]. Alternatively, attention bias 
modification training has been demonstrated to be an effective bottom-up intervention that 
enhances optimism [55]. In clinical training and improvement, psychotherapists experience 
OB in assessing their own therapeutic strengths and may benefit from strategic messaging 
to maximize integration of feedback [5,56]. Recent calls for longitudinal research have 
suggested that alterations toward optimistic expectancies may be one of the crucial areas 
of change in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy [57]. For example, a single ketamine 
infusion not only improves depressive symptoms overall, but also results in increased 
optimistically biased belief updating [58,59]. Collectively, these promising results suggest 
that cognitive-behavioral and attention bias modification procedures could be implemented 
alongside improved feedback and psychopharmacological interventions for treating complex 
depressive conditions.

Moving forward, research on OB should address recent findings from affective neuroscience 
outlined here. Specifically, understanding how OB functions under differing affective 
conditions over time and in differing contexts can help elucidate the cognitive 
mechanisms that underly the entrenchment of negative attributional style in persistently 
dysphoric disorders. Incorporating intensive longitudinal data collection alongside repeated 
neuroimaging and psychophysiological assessments are underutilized methodologies in this 
area that hold significant promise for future breakthroughs, as these methods can capture 
relevant processes in vivo. Alternatively, evaluation of behavioral markers of aberrant 
decision-making processes can be integrated with multiple data streams to improve detection 
of risk and inform outreach strategies. Lastly, treatment models that integrate promising 
findings outlined above need further development and validation.

Figure 1: 
Overview of findings of belief updating studies
PE: prediction error; BU: belief update.
In persons without depression and under neutral affective conditions (left side panels), 
individuals demonstrate optimism bias. When considering the likelihood of experiencing a 
positive outcome in the future, individuals presented with bad news (i.e., that a positive 
outcome is less likely than previously believed) tend to update their beliefs less (i.e., reduced 
BUs relative to PEs) than when presented with good news (i.e., that a positive event is more 
likely to happen than previously believed; increased BUs relative to PEs). Similarly, when 
considering potential negative outcomes, individuals tend to update their beliefs more to 
good news (i.e., that a negative outcome is less likely; reduced BUs relative to PEs) than to 
bad news (i.e., that a negative outcome is more likely; increased BUs relative to PEs).
Conversely, in persons with depression and individuals who are acutely sad or experiencing 
increased stress (right side panels), optimism bias is not observed. When presented with bad 
news about potentially positive or negative future events, these individuals tend to accurately 
update their beliefs (i.e., BUs are relatively equal to PEs). In response to good news, they 
tend to either accurately or fail to update their beliefs for both positive and negative events 
(i.e., BUs either equal PEs or are around 0).

Figure 2: 
Utility maximization framework for belief updating
According to the utility maximization framework, individuals weigh the relative utility 
of their old belief against a new one when presented with disconfirming evidence. Here, 
each symbol on the scales represents a single “unit of utility” for expected positive and 
negative outcomes leading to benefits and costs. Red symbols represent accuracy-dependent 
outcomes, blue symbols represent accuracy-independent outcomes, circles represent internal 
outcomes, and triangles represent external outcomes. Accuracy-dependent internal (e.g., 
having a consistent worldview/expectancies), accuracy-independent internal (e.g., holding 
positive views of oneself), accuracy-dependent external (e.g., monetary or social rewards for 
holding a religious belief), and accuracy-independent external (e.g., preferences, avoiding 
harmful exposures) outcomes of accepting a new belief are weighed against those of 
the original belief. Additionally, one’s initial confidence in the belief will influence the 
acceptance of the belief as well as the engagement in motivated and unmotivated reasoning 
and information-seeking processes the individual will use to justify and aid in the selection 
of what information to integrate.

Figure 3: 
Cognitive immunization extended metaphor
The cognitive immunization framework for understanding valence-dependent belief 
updating posits that, similar to the adaptive immune system, human beings “immunize” 
themselves against disconfirming evidence. In non-depressed populations (left side of 
dotted center line), individuals (represented by the “cell”) selectively filter negatively 
disconfirming information (represented by the “DNA” in the cells and pathogens). Here, 
in psychologically “healthy” populations, (A) prior beliefs are (B) selectively updated 
when presented with positively disconfirming evidence, (i.e., negative expectancies are 
less likely, positive expectancies are more likely than previously believed), represented 
here by blue pathogens. On the other hand, (C) negatively disconfirming evidence 
(i.e., negative expectancies are more likely, positive expectancies are less likely than 
previously believed), represented here by red pathogens, are selectively blocked from being 
integrated. Additionally, this process forms a feedback mechanism, wherein selectively 
blocking negatively disconfirming information strengthens immunization through increased 
utilization of motivated information-seeking and reasoning processes, represented here 
by gray half-circular binding proteins. In depressed populations, these processes are 
largely reversed through (E) increased integration of negatively disconfirming evidence 
and (F) selective blocking of positively disconfirming evidence (i.e., mostly that positive 
expectancies ae more likely to happen) using motivated information-seeking and reasoning, 
leading to a (G) parallel mutual reinforcement process.

Figure 4: 
Predictive processing framework
The predictive processing framework outlined here (A) argues the brain makes constant 
predictions about what to expect when generating conscious experiences. When (B) the 
brain encounters “surprising” stimuli, diffuse neural activity increases in response to the 
new information. To reach the lowest energy state, neural circuits that are more frequently 
traversed during other activities are the paths that are activated most frequently in response 
to the increased overall action potential in the brain. This leads to differences in the way that

information is processed for people with and without depression. Additionally, the initial 
neural conditions (i.e., under experiences of threat or acute sadness) also lead to differences 
in cognitive processing of such information. During eyes closed and reflective processing, 
the default mode network, comprising the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), 
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus (PCu), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) are 
activated (highlighted in purple). In people with depression, these regions, associated with 
self-reflective assessment and depressive rumination, demonstrate increased connectivity 
and activity relative to those without depression. When making judgements about the 
likelihood of future negative events (C) the anterior insular cortex (AIC) is activated in 
individuals without depression, which is followed by attenuated DMN activity, but (D) in 
depressed patients, AIC activity is attenuated and DMN activity is increased. Alternatively, 
in response to good news about future positive events, (E) activity in the rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (rACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and PCC are activated in 
individuals without depression, but (F) are attenuated in individuals with depression. Lastly, 
the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is the brain area responsible for inhibitory control and (G) 
increased activity is associated with reduced optimism bias following unexpected negative 
information in individuals without depression and (H) increased negative prediction errors in 
individuals with depression.
