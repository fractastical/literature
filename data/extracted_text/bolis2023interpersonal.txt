In this article, we analyse social interactions, drawing on diverse points of
views, ranging from dialectics, second-person neuroscience and enactivism
to dynamical systems, active inference and machine learning. To this end, we
define interpersonal attunement as a set of multi-scale processes of building
up and materializing social expectations— put simply , anticipating and inter-
acting with others and ourselves. While cultivating and negotiating common
ground, via communication and culture-building activities, are indispensable
for the survival of the individual, the relevant multi-scale mechanisms have
been largely considered in isolation. Here, collective psychophysiology,w e
argue, can lend itself to the fine-tuned analysis of social interactions, without
neglecting the individual. On the other hand, an interpersonal mismatch of
expectations can lead to a breakdown of communication and social isolation
known to negatively affect mental health. In this regard, we review psycho-
pathology in terms of interpersonal misattunement, conceptualizing
psychiatric disorders as disorders of social interaction, to describe how individ-
ual mental health is inextricably linked to social interaction. By doing so, we
foresee avenues for aninter-personalized psychiatry , which moves from a static
spectrum of disorders to a dynamic relational space, focusing on how the
multi-faceted processes of social interaction can help to promote mental health.
This article is part of the theme issue‘Concepts in interaction: social
engagement and inner experiences’.
The true direction of the development of thinking is not from the individual to the
social, but from the social to the individual.

1. Interpersonal attunement in and through social interaction
People tend to ‘fall in synchrony’ in social interactions, e.g. through spon-
taneously aligning rhythmic behaviours, such as gait and clapping or adopting
others’mannerisms, from shaking a foot or scratching the head to adopting

each other’s speech styles, emotions and moods [1–6]. Intrigu-
ingly , humans oftentimes attune to each other beyond personal
cost-benefit evaluation (e.g. informal social norm following;
[7]) and even against their actual intention [8]. Furthermore,
interpersonal attunement in social interactions has not only
been demonstrated at the behavioural, but also at the neural
level, including phenomena ranging from motor synchrony
[9] and shared psychological perspectives [10], to collective
musical experience [11] and real-life social relationships [12,13].
All of these instances of interpersonal attunement can be
thought of as facilitating human communication, collaboration
and eventually trust-based social relationships, by virtue of
locally decreasing interpersonal complexity [7,14], while pro-
viding new tools of self-regulation at the individual level.
Indeed, from developmental psychology to social neuroscience
and psychiatry , an increasing number of findings have demon-
strated the critical role of interpersonal coordination in
the development and maintenance of our social— and even
individual— abilities. It is through co-ownership of social inter-
actions that babies learn the distinction between self and other
[15], the temporality of social exchanges [16], and the notion of
a shared world [17]. Later on, it is through engagement in social
interaction that cognitive abilities such as language and‘theory
of mind’emerge, leading to the ability to effectively communi-
cate and make sense of one’s own and other persons’intentions
and beliefs, but also to the generation of certain social biases
associated with expectations towards social norms [18,19]. In
a nutshell, interpersonal attunement in early social interactions
lay the ground for human becoming, via the co-construction of
progressively symbolic communication and its internalization
as inner speech [20,21].
In this regard, our view is inspired by and consistent with
descriptions provided by Vygotsky, who already at the begin-
ning of the previous century suggested that all‘higher’mental
processes within an individual result from an internalization of
prior social interactionsbetweenpeople [21]. Furthermore, he pro-
posed that every mental function of this kind appears twice in a
child’s development, first at a social level (i.e.‘intermind’)a n d
then at an individual level (i.e.‘intramind’): in brief, he suggested
that‘through others we become ourselves’. Taken together, inter-
personal attunement, here, is defined as the set of the multi-scale
processes of establishing joint and eventually collective inter-
action patterns and expectations about states of the world and
social behaviour [19,20]. Such interpersonal attunement, in
turn, enables and facilitates intrapersonal attunement and vice
versa, here, taken as the set of self-regulation processes (e.g.
inner speech and interoception [21,–23]). Critically, interpersonal
attunement does not only include harmonic developments, but
also at times dramatic tensions and conflicts that appear instru-
mental in driving change across the entire lifespan [20]. In this
light and leaning on diverse perspectives, ranging from
second-person neuroscience, dialectics and enactivism to dyna-
mical systems, active inference and machine learning, in this
article, we argue that a multi-scale, fine-grained analysis of
social interaction might help us to elucidate the underlying be-
havioural and neural mechanisms both at the level of the
individual, but also at the level of interacting bodies and minds.
More concretely , in the current section, we discuss the role
of interpersonal attunement in social interactions and how it
shapes the formation of the self. In the second section, we
describe how psychopathology can be construed asinterperper-
sonal misattunement. In the third section, we describe the
paradigm of collective psychophysiology as a methodology to
empirically study interpersonal (mis)attunement. In the
fourth section, we suggest an integrative clinical, empirical
and computational research line, which aims at formally
defining a multi-dimensional relational
space of conditions ,
embracing different levels of analysis and how developments
could contribute to what could be described as an inter-
personalized psychiatry. We end this article by describing some
of the societal implications of our approach.
(a) The dialectics of internalization and externalization
In this first section, we place our focus on the individual,
reviewing human development and becoming as the dynamic
interplay between (social) internalization and (collective) exter-
nalization in and through social interaction [20–25]. On the
one hand, internalization, here, can be thought of as the co-
construction of bodily structures actively reflecting the social
world and the organism. On the other hand, externalization
is taken as the collective construction of the world, including
other (inter-)bodily structures. Along those lines, the collective
and the level of the individual appear inextricably linked, as an
interrelation between the formation of multi-scale hierarchical
bodily structures (e.g. psychophysiological states) and inter-
personal statistical regularities beyond the individual (e.g.
social norms). Below we further unpack the key notions of
internalization and externalization, while connecting them to
recent computational theories of brain and bodily function.
Our notion of internalization is based on the Vygotskian
take, thought of as the internal reconstruction of an external
operation [21], further operationalized within the predictive
processing framework ([26]; see also [27]). Predictive proces-
sing has been defined as a hierarchical bidirectional process
through which an organism adjusts itself in order to (Bayes)
‘optimally’ predict environmental and bodily regularities.
With regard to brain function, predictions are continuously
generated and propagated from higher levels of the neural hier-
archy to lower ones in an attempt to explain away so-called
prediction errors, i.e. the discrepancy between incoming
information and generated predictions. On the other hand, pre-
diction errors are propagated from lower levels of the hierarchy
to higher ones in order to‘optimally’reconfigure the organism.
Of note, in the framework of predictive processing, higher
(deeper) levels of the neural hierarchy are thought of corre-
sponding to higher levels of abstraction. In brief, organisms
are continuously trying to optimize their expectations, via
minimizing overall prediction error, across various scales,
through functions such as perception and learning. In doing
so, organisms maximize their odds of survival via prediction
error minimization. An organism is assumed to achieve this
by virtue of keeping — at least temporarily and locally —
entropy low, or, in other words, the states the organism can
visit as a system bounded (e.g. body temperature around
37°C). Notably , expectations in this framework cover a wide
spectrum of controlled processes, from conscious actions and
thoughts to‘automatically’adjusted interoceptive states.
Yet, humans are not mere passive spectators who just
assimilate reality. On the contrary , they actively interact
with their world, including other persons, modifying it to
meet their expectations through processes of externalization
(cf. active inference; [22,28]). For instance, when the perceived
partial pressure of carbon dioxide surpasses certain bounds,
the respiratory system is in charge of keeping it within
expected levels, preserving bodily order and thereby
royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstbPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B378: 20210365
2
survival. To give another example, when a person sits in the
cold for an extended period of time, their body temperature
tends to fall below predicted values. Trembling, lighting a
fire, or entering a warm facility often reverses this trend
and aids in keeping the body temperature within boundaries
that are conducive to survival and well-being. Such predic-
tion error minimization processes of actively controlling the
body and the environment, with the goal of actively trans-
forming the world and the body such that they conform
with prior expectations, has been referred as active inference
([26,28]; see also [27]).
Importantly, in real life, the above-mentioned processes of
internalization and externalization should be considered as
inextricably linked. To this end, in the next section, we will
situate these accounts in the sociocultural realm through a
dialectical prism, emphasizing what we describe as‘becom-
ing-with’ (on a collective level) and its interrelation with
‘being’(on an individual level).
(b) The dialectics of the individual and the collective
The above-mentioned hierarchical structures of predictive
processing, in our view, should be considered as collectively
shaped. First, we dynamically ‘embody’each other in and
through social interaction [20], enabling interpersonal attune-
ment (e.g. interpersonal belief resonance; [29]). In other
words, by engaging in sensory-motor couplings with others
in social interactions, we have our bodily structures mutually
transformed beyond the here and now [20,30]. Second, such
structures, arguably , unfold within nested time and space
scales, from biology and cognition all the way up to society
[14,31,32]. That is, these multi-scale dynamics encompass
bottom-up and top-down processes, even outside the skull
of individuals, and thus solving such dialectic requires
accepting the complementary nature of reduction and emer-
gence [33]. Various theoretical frameworks have been
proposed, from autopoïesis and enaction [34] to coordination
dynamics [35] and active inference [26].
While autopoïesis is one of the first examples of such multi-
scale frameworks, its attempt to connect biology up to the social
level has been limited. Indeed, first-order structural coupling
allows for the emergence of cells, and second-order structural
coupling allows for the emergence of multi-cellular organisms;
social interaction between those complex organisms, in turn,
can be thought of as a third-order structural coupling [36].
However, the (bio)logical grounding of autopoïesis assumed a
strong solipsism regarding knowledge, and thus the largest
autopoïetic unit has always remained a single agent [37,38].
In fact, this constitutes a key point of disagreement between
Maturana and Varela, as well as the later developed paradigm
of ‘enaction’, which on the one hand, keeps the inspiration from
autopoïesis and on the other hand, aims to explore the link
between our individual experience and the interaction— and
even co-existence— with others [39].
The coordination dynamics framework had relatively
less problems for bridging the micro–macro divide, since it
comes from the language of complex systems and nonlinear
dynamics. Originally applying the tools of synergetics to
the understanding of finger movement [40], the derived prin-
ciples were revealed to apply across multiple scales: between
brain regions within a given brain, between limbs within a
given individual and even between individuals within
social groups [33].
The frameworks of predictive processing and active infer-
ence have lent themselves to the formal generation and
comparison of hypotheses through their associated generative
models [41–44], yet also have been criticized for an overly pas-
sive and detached approach to make sense of human cognition
in certain articulations [45]. Additionally , more broadly the
field of computational psychiatry [46] can be questioned for
largely emphasizing certain aspects of (artificial) cognition
(e.g. reinforcement learning, decision-making, as well as rep-
resentations of reward, punishment and risk as optimization
functions), at the expense of other ones (e.g. social dimension,
subjective experience and creativity). Therefore, while active
inference appears as a potentially unifying framework, a
lot of work remains to be done toward a balanced state space
which would account for a realistic perspective of the human
mind. Having said that, despite their original limitations,
within the relevant scientific landscape, the active inference fra-
meworks can be viewed as a powerful toolbox, which shares
some neurobiological grounding with autopoïesis and enac-
tion, while at the same time deploys a physics formalism akin
to coordination dynamics [26,47].
Considering the commonalities (the emphasis on complex
systems, multi-scale dynamics, uncertainty, embodiment and
self-organization to name but a few; [20,25,45,47–55]), but
also the tensions between the various flavours [48,52,56,57],
we foresee a dynamic convergence between the above-men-
tioned frameworks, which, in our view, have been already
capturing complementary — overlapping at times — projec-
tions of the multi-scale dynamics of social interaction and
the mind. As a result of their interaction, on the one hand,
enaction has been drawing inspiration from the commitment
to formalism [58], while, on the other hand, active inference
has been increasingly situated within multi-scale (social)
interactions [20,59–62].
In doing so, active inference has been aspiring to become
a generalized framework in various fields, ranging from
philosophy , psychology and psychiatry to neuroscience,
robotics and artificial intelligence (e.g. [23,52,63–67]; ‘a theory
of every “thing” that can be distinguished from other
“things” in a statistical sense’
as Friston provocatively puts it
[68]; but also note critiques on the scope of current versions
of the framework; [69–71]).
In light of the above-described considerations, active infer-
ence, we argue, should not be thought of as exclusively lying
within or being restricted to the individual. For example,
social norms, architecture and technology may all be under-
stood as a collective effort to optimize predictability via
transforming ourselves and the environment in accordance
with bodily and interpersonal expectations [20,72,73]. Here,
bodily expectations could be an adaptive range of certain attri-
butes of a living human body , such as temperature and
pressure, but also psychological states, such as the desire for
socializing and reproducing, while interpersonal expectations
may include whatever another person or a group of persons
could expect from us (cf. social norms). We typically try to
satisfy both bodily and interpersonal expectations, even if
they , at times, appear contradictory (cf. the various conflicts
between desires and cultural conventions). Importantly , both
types of expectations should be considered as dynamic states
of the world and thus‘historical’products of interaction. In
other words, expectations are multi-scale processes, fluctuating
at various scales, from phylogeny and ontogeny to culture and
individual psychophysiology.

Here, let us examine an illustrative hypothetical scenario on
the ontogenic scale, inspired by Vygotsky [21]. A baby , trying
to regulate her hunger and thus interoception balance, tries
to reach for food. However, she is unable to do so, despite
stretching her whole body , even extending the index finger.
A caregiver, observing the situation and predicting the
baby’s goal, brings the piece of food closer to the kid. After
multiple repetitions, this statistical regularity of interpersonal
coordination can be internalized by the baby , who at some
point understands that an extended index finger towards an
object denotes the intention of directing the attention of
another person to an object in the environment. This is an
important realization, as it is in this very process of transform-
ing the interpersonal into an individual mental process, that
the baby masters a completely new (mental) tool, through
which she can then affect the environment, including others,
and critically her own self (cf. self-regulation), in a much
more efficient way. Such skills at the interface of the collective
and the individual may give rise to core aspects of the human
self, such as‘social agency’, which has been thought of as the
‘sense of self that is gained through the perceived control one
exerts over the social world’[74] . As Vygotsky put it‘the
relation between higher psychological functions was at one
time a physical relation between people’[75] ).
Now stretching this example at an intergenerational scale,
one could trace back the interpersonal history of various cul-
tural conventions and social norms, which now appear as
psychological laws, such as the need to wear clothes even
when the weather conditions do not require to do so [20].
Finally , considering possible interactions of these processes
at the scale of phylogeny might even allow us to examine
the potential social origins and interrelation of certain aspects
of human anatomy and human-specific skills. A typical
example can be found at the potential multi-scale interplays
between the human eye morphology (e.g. ratio of exposed
sclera in the eye outline, which allow the other to recognize
easier the gaze’s direction), the enhanced cognitive abilities
for gaze-based interaction and later abstract cognitive skills
[20,76]. These sorts of multi-scale and inextricably linked pro-
cesses of human becoming while attuning to one another and
the environment, is what has been described as dialectical
attunement [20,22].
Taken together, humans actively co-construct and
co-regulate— in interaction with other organisms— their ecoso-
cial niches, so that they increase survival chances of not just the
individual, but also the social group and the species as a whole.
2. Interpersonal misattunement in and through
social interaction
So far, we have considered the importance of interpersonal
attunement in social interactions and the formation of the
human self. Subsequently , placing our focus on psychopathol-
ogy , we extend our discussion from attunement to potential
misattunement, discussing thedialectical misattunement hypoth-
esis [63]. According to this hypothesis, psychopathology can be
viewed not as mere (mis-)function within single brains, but
also as a dynamic interpersonal mismatch (for a comprehen-
sive review of the phenomenon as well as the relevant
psychophysiological processes see [63]). As we will examine
below, the primary aim of such an approach is to move
beyond the individual in the study of psychopathology , yet
without neglecting the tightly connected psychophysiological
processes at play.
More concretely, here, misattunement across persons is
thought of as a series of disturbances of the dynamic and reci-
procal unfolding of an interaction [59]. Such misattunement
results in potentially increasingly divergent prediction and
interaction styles and vice versa. Prediction and interaction
styles are defined as a set of prior expectations and reaction
patterns a person dynamically develops in interaction with
the world and others, as discussed above (cf. predictive
processing and active inference). The above-mentioned misat-
tunement is not only mediated, but at times reinforced by a
selectively designed cultural and technological environment,
which is typically meant to conform with and satisfy
dominant social standards.
A dynamic interpersonal misattunement is— similarly to
attunement— expected to unfold across various scales, from
seconds to multiple years. First, consider the case of a conversa-
tion between two persons. Someone may voice an unexpected
opinion or act in an unforeseen manner. In turn, the second
person might react defensively. This slight initial misattune-
ment can potentially spiral out of control, while additional
factors, such as emotional engagement and internalized social
norms might further reinforce such a vicious cycle. An example
of such an interacting dyad may consist of an autistic child who,
when stressed, might tend to react with repetitive movements
and a neurotypical one who has— via exclusively interacting
with neurotypical peers— formed a rather strictly tuned set
of expectations (cf.‘narrow priors’in Bayesian formulation) of
what a typical conversational reaction might be.
Furthermore, imagine a human relationship. Short-scale
interpersonal disturbances might lead to a cumulative misattu-
nement, which can oftentimes go beyond the conscious will of
the interacting parts. In other words, day-to-day misunder-
standings— if not timely resolved— can potentially lead to a
cascade of interpersonal obstacles and increasing personal dis-
satisfaction, up to an eventual dissolution of a relationship [77].
Now consider a child who along her whole development
repeatedly experiences such interpersonal misattunement.
In such a case, a persistent social exclusion might actually
exert a higher impact on the development of this person, than
an initial atypicality in the generation of expectations and reac-
tions. This is likely to prevent her from naturally developing the
knowledge and skills a typical person develops in and through
the daily social interactions within a given culture.
Of note, an interpersonal misattunement, as defined above,
lies in theinteractionbetween the two parties and as such it con-
stitutes a collective phenomenon non-reducible to either of
them. Here, it should become clear that our view goes beyond
an apparently persistent misconception that the responsibility
of such a misattunementa priori lies in the individual who
might be considered as the atypical one.
With regard to larger groups of persons, this kind of
misattunement could even take on a cultural and as such inter-
generational form. For example, culturally cultivated beliefs
in a given society about a specific group of people might
highly impact the effectiveness of interaction between in- and
out-group persons, eventually provoking intergroup conflict
and vice versa. From a Bayesian perspective, one can
imagine social stigma and stereotypes as a strict set of prior
beliefs operating on a relatively long timescale. Although cer-
tain rigid prior beliefs can be adaptive, potentially serving
as useful heuristics for quick and effective decisions, they

4
can turn out to be detrimental to human communication and
well-being in the long run by segregating social groups
and perpetuating inequalities.
Here, it is important to underline that, in our view, this
kind of interpersonal misattunement should be treated as
a phenomenon at the intersection of the individual and
the collective. Over-focusing on either of the sides can be
counterproductive when it comes to grasping complex
phenomena. For instance, an initial (medical) condition can
lead to a cascade of other ‘comorbid’ conditions, such as
depression and anxiety, not through an actual biologically
causal link, but through the interplay of an actual condition
and social expectations in a given sociocultural context.
Let us consider an illustrative example: a person, who, diag-
nosed as HIV positive, develops depression the years
following their diagnosis. In this case, the psychiatric con-
dition of depression might potentially have to be examined
more in relation to an interpersonally aversive environment
due to social stigma, than the actual medical condition.
In other words, taking social interactions seriously helps
to re-emphasize the importance of a genuinely biopsychoso-
cial model of health and disease [78] and argues for a
systems approach to medicine with a particular emphasis
on dyadic social interactions, which form a crucial interface
in connecting different factors and levels of descriptions.
So far, we have examined scenarios of misattunement
between persons. However, such interpersonal segregations
and social interaction disturbances might even take the form
of an environmental misattunement for certain groups of
people. Let us, here, contemplate a hypothetical scenario: in a
world where human height typically exceeds 3 metres, a
person of an average height in our world would face severe dif-
ficulties in everyday life; even an activity as simple as sitting on
a chair in a restaurant would turn into a challenging endeavour.
Now contrast this scenario with the everyday life of an autistic
person in a neurotypically designed cultural and technological
world. Arguably , at least part of their anxiety could be alle-
viated by reconsidering the design of our living spaces, both
real and virtual ones [79–81]. This kind of inextricably linked
and multi-scale processes of dynamically disturbed interaction
between persons— mediated by the (cultural) environment— is
what we call dialectical misattunement [22].
Importantly , the dialectical misattunement hypothesis
makes concrete suggestions with regard to social interactions
and interpersonal relationships in real life, amenable to
empirical validation: in certain scales‘interactions within homo-
geneous dyads are expected to appear smoother compared to
heterogeneous dyads. Additionally , tuned interactions of
either homogeneous or heterogeneous dyads should appear
as most effective’[ 5 9 ] .T op u s hb e y o n dt h e’healthy’versus
’patient’dichotomy , as a first step, it considers interactions not
only within neurotypical, but also mixed dyads or groups and
crucially between individuals from a certain social group (e.g.
individuals from a social or a so-called neural minority). That
is, the dialectical misattunement hypothesis proposes moving
beyond merely contrasting— ap r i o r iand largely arbitrarily
defined— groups of individuals toward systematically studying
the multi-scale dynamics of social interaction.
A focus on interactions between persons sharing a con-
dition, such as autism, will have a dual benefit. First,
tapping into interpersonal mismatch processes might result
in a more precise analysis of communication efficacy and
potential breakdown mechanisms, beyond an exclusively
neurobiological aetiology. Second, by taking atypical social
interaction seriously, in terms of both research and practice,
voice is given to the most relevant part of the population,
namely those with a condition themselves. As Milton [82]
put it, ‘autistic people will need to be utilising their voices
in, claiming ownership of the means of autistic production,
and potentially celebrate the diversity of dispositions within
and without the culture’.
Nevertheless, the dialectical misattunement hypothesis
eventually questions a priori dichotomies altogether, aiming
at eventually breaking free from acknowledged weaknesses
of prominent nosological
1 disease models. As van Praag ques-
tioned (2000), ‘are the diagnostic constructs we are used to
working with valid and clinically relevant or, rather, pseudo-
entities; artefacts of a rigidly applied nosological doctrine’.
Dialectical misattunement attempts to bypass such pitfalls by
examining psychopathology as a continuum of interpersonal
mismatch. In the case of autism, a straightforward way to oper-
ationalize this is via studying the interpersonal difference of
autistic traits, rather than merely individual traits. For example,
following this approach it has been recently shown that the
more similar two persons are in autistic traits, the higher is
the reported friendship quality [22]. Ultimately , as we will dis-
cuss later in this article, such a research line points toward
studying psychiatric conditions transdiagnostically , as
interpersonal distance in a multi-dimensional feature space.
Having said that, we still maintain that considering exclu-
sively the social dimension of psychopathology leads to
an incomplete understanding and that psychophysiological
mechanisms should be addressed in parallel. Indeed, the
boundary of neural, behavioural and social are in the eye of
the beholder, and the understanding of the physiological mech-
anisms supporting social dynamics is as important as the
understanding of the impact of social dynamics on individuals’
psychophysiological autonomy and balance. Here, dialectical
misattunement resonates with the neurodiversity paradigm
which, acknowledging the need to address certain aspects on
an individual basis, still views psychopathology as a human
variation rather than ana prioridisorder.
In this point, having considered situations of typical and aty-
pical attunement between persons, and also between them and
the environment, we now turn to situations where interpersonal
attunement fails after having been more or less typical up to
a certain point in life. An extended involuntary solitary confine-
ment may constitute such a case. Typically , isolated individuals
report multiple perceptual hallucinations— frequently of a
social nature [83]. Adopting a dialectical misattunement per-
spective, we argue that this kind of hallucination might be a
way to reduce prediction error due to a discrepancy between
strong bodily expectations to (socially) interact and unexpect-
edly unfolding reality. Indeed,‘Heidegger [84] provides an
analysis of human existence in which being-with (Mitsein) or
being-with others is part of the very structure of human exist-
ence, shaping the way that we are in the world.… In effect,
one doesn’t come to have a social constitution by way of interact-
ing with others; one is“hard-wired” to be other-oriented, and
this is an existential characteristic that makes human existence
what it is’[85]. Even worse, such situations may turn out to be
self-enhancing, as a person who experiences extended isolation
can potentially gradually develop a form of‘social atrophy’,
which in turn can contribute to further isolation and so on.
‘Social atrophy’is a metaphor used to describe a situation in
which social skills deteriorate because they are not used as

5
much as expected— like muscle atrophy is used to describe the
weakening of our muscles when they remain persistently inac-
tive. Here, we could consider various relevant examples, such
as homeless persons, institutionalized or otherwise socially
excluded. Such phenomena can at times even apply to whole
populations, as it has been the case with the recent repeated
COVID-19 lockdowns, aiming at restricting the spreading of
the pandemic. Taken together, the theoretical investigation of
interpersonal misattunement and how it could be potentially
ameliorated and even prevented could be relevant, not only to
psychiatry , but various other fields of research and societal
practice and could potentially concern each and everyone of us.
The dialectical misattunement hypothesis shares certain
commonalities with approaches of different fields, such as
computational psychiatry and sociology , from which it
departs due to its inherently multi-scale nature. For example,
leaning on predictive processing and active inference shares
common ground with accounts of computational psychiatry ,
such as the HIPPEA ([86]; for High Inflexible Precision of Pre-
diction Errors) and the aberrant precision one [87], which
attempt to redefine autism as a deficit of domain-general
information processing, explaining difficulties such as rel-
evant to theory of mind, executive dysfunction and central
coherence under a common umbrella. Notably, while these
accounts constitute an important development, touching
also upon certain social aspects, they still view the condition
from a methodologically individualistic perspective: the def-
icit or difference lies exclusively in the autistic individual. A
relevant account to the dialectical misattunement hypothesis
within the sociological field is the‘double empathy problem’
(DEP), which insightfully questions the ontological status of
autism as articulated in prominent cognitivist accounts in
favour of an interactional and relational one [88]. Although
the DEP has been an important idea, helping shift the
perspective to autism away from methodologically indivi-
dualistic approaches, it still remains relatively agnostic
about the key psychophysiological processes.
In a nutshell, due to various conceptual and methodo-
logical, but also societal constraints, sociological and
psychophysiological processes have been largely studied in
isolation [89,90]. In fact, it has been suggested that the study
of the single brain can be in-principle sufficient to understand
(social) cognition [91]. The dialectical misattunement hypo-
thesis aims at dialectically synthesizing the levels of the
individual and the collective through a principled approach.
Adopting a Vygotskian perspective, it considers the historical
and social construction of the atypical self, while adhering to
a scientific understanding of not only interpersonal but also
interrelated neurobiological mechanisms. Taken together, the
dialectical misattunement hypothesis hopes to serve as a tool
for the theoretical, methodological and empirical study of the
multi-scale dynamics of psychopathology pushing beyond
both reductionistic and descriptive accounts.
3. Collective psychophysiology: measuring and
analysing interpersonal (mis)attunement from
a second-person perspective
In the previous sections, we reviewed interpersonal attunement
and misattunement in social interactions from various angles.
Yet, however informative conceptual work might be, an effort
to truly go beyond the individual will remain incomplete
until put to the test empirically , not only in the laboratory ,
which allows for great experimental controllability , but also
where it really matters, in real life. To this end, here we describe
the paradigm of collective psychophysiology , which enables the
measurement and analysis of the multi-scale processes of social
interaction [20,22,76,92–100]. More concretely , it, first, embraces
the dialectic between the individual and the collective via
embedding empirical studies within the context of social inter-
actions, while, second, it synthesizes well-established empirical
practices, ranging from multi-person observational and phe-
nomenological approaches to multi-modal neurobehavioral
recordings in order to study social phenomena across scales
and contexts.
Indeed, crucial aspects of interpersonal attunement and
misattunement might not be always graspable by so-called
spectatorial paradigms, which primarily trigger and monitor
either (third-person) inferential or (first-person) phenomeno-
logical processes. By contrast— but also complementarily— to
such accounts, second-person accounts emphasize the role of
the real time and reciprocal dynamics of social interactions in
making sense of others:‘These accounts— sometimes contras-
tively described as the ‘second-person’ approach to other
minds— ask whether social cognition from an observer ’s
point of view is really the most pervasive way of knowing
other minds and suggest that social cognition may be funda-
mentally different when we are actively engaged with others
in ongoing social interaction, i.e. when we engage in social
cognition from an interactor’s point of view’([101]; see also
[76,102,103]). In fact, it has been suggested that social inter-
action in and of itself might even constitute— rather than
merely contextualize or enable— social cognition (cf. partici-
patory sense making; [24,104]). In our opinion, what is
crucial in this debate is to preclude the empirical paradigm
from a priori prioritizing selected aspects of human
experience and psychopathology.
In a nutshell, collective psychophysiology comprises a
recent empirical paradigm that synthesizes and extends exper-
imental and observational approaches, ranging from strictly
structured and free viewing tasks to real-time social interaction
and real-life aspects. This allows for the controlled recording
of high-resolution datasets from multiple modalities, while
retaining adequate degrees of ecological validity. In figure 1
one can find an example of a two-person psychophysiology
set-up, designed for studying the multi-scale dynamics
of dyadic real-time social interactions in high resolution in
the laboratory.
Recording robust and meaningful datasets is the first
crucial step towards capturing the essence of complex
phenomena. However, the development of suitable analytical
methods is of paramount importance. Typical summary
measures, averaged over time, offer convenient descriptions;
yet, when it comes to non-stationary processes and chaotic-
like systems, such as the case of real-time social interactions,
such methods fail to capture the critical aspects of the
multi-scale temporal dynamics [105].
Therefore, here we anticipate experimental and compu-
tational approaches grounded in a synthesis of dynamical
systems theories for formally grasping the real-time interper-
sonal dynamics on one hand and computational accounts of
cognition for formally grasping the intrapersonal bodily
processes on the other hand (for a preliminary sketch
see [59,74]). Such an approach could formally show how

collective dynamics in social interactions (e.g. quantified
by dynamical systems trajectories) are potentially tracked
and enacted by the individual (e.g. quantified by active infer-
ence states) and vice versa. Put simply , we view both‘low-
level attunement ’, which plays out in relatively short
spatio-temporal scales (e.g. interpersonal coupling in real-
time social interaction) and ‘high-level attunement’, which
is achieved through the interpersonal alignment and deepen-
ing of (inter-)bodily structures toward increasing abstraction
beyond the ‘here and now’(e.g. formation of social norms).
Having said that, low- and high-level attunement should
not be viewed as parts of a dichotomy , but rather within
their dynamic interrelation [20,106].
Indeed, recent empirical work has demonstrated that
distributed neural dynamics integrates information from
‘low-level’sensorimotor mechanisms and ‘high-level’social
cognition to support the realistic social behaviours that play
out in real time during interactive scenarios [107]. The
study of such interplay between real-time ongoing social
dynamics at the sensorimotor level, and slower paced rep-
resentational aspects of social negotiation require new
experimental paradigms. This goes from human –machine
interaction [108] to human–human interaction [109], and for
the latter a specific neuroimaging technique has contributed
to the burgeoning field of interactive social neuroscience:
hyperscanning— the recording of multiple brains simul-
taneously [99]. In two decades, this new approach has not
only demonstrated that social perception and social inter-
action were leading to different neural correlates [110–112]
but also uncovered new interpersonal signatures: inter-brain
synchronization [9,113]. Few neurocomputational models
have tried to explain social interaction dynamics, most of
them focusing on sensorimotor interaction [110,111,114]. Inte-
grating the cognitive part of social cognition thus presents a
great challenge for future studies [59].
In a nutshell, our conceptual analyses focused on the
importance of studying interpersonal (mis)attunement in
social interactions, describing second-person neuroscience and
collective psychophysiology as a most promising methodology
to this end. In the next section, we introduce the paradigm
of inter-personalized psychiatry, which will aim at the clinical
and scientific assessment, monitoring and treatment of not
only personal, but also interpersonal parameters and states,
potentially resulting in a complementary redefinition of
current psychiatric conditions.
4. Towards an inter-personalized psychiatry: the
example of the autism space
The here-described approach to interpersonal attunement
points toward a psychiatry that embraces the individual in
all its dimensions, in particular focusing on the interpersonal
aspects of mental health, which could be seen as pointing
toward the development of aninter-personalized psychiatry.
The above-mentioned dialectical misattunement hypothesis
has considered psychopathology as a process that unfolds
between the level of the individual and the collective and
construes psychopathology at least in part as a social inter-
action mismatch rather than a brain disorderper se. Here,
we extend this discussion in order to motivate further
conceptual, empirical and computational directions which
might allow for a principled redefinition of psychiatricspec-
trum conditions as space conditions, thereby doing justice to
their relational, multi-dimensional and multi-scale nature.
To this end, we take autism spectrum as a paradigm example
and apply an extended version of what has been described as
generative embedding [115].
Generative embedding is a data analysis approach that con-
sists of two steps, namely the generative modelling step, which
aims at modelling mechanisms of phenomena, and the discri-
minative step, which aims at capturing discriminative
information in the modelled data. The generative modelling
step serves as a meaningful dimensionality reduction from
the measurement to a latent space (cf. predictive processing
and active inference). The discriminative step deploys machine
learning for group classification (e.g. autistic and non-autistic)
and feature selection (i.e. selection of crucial parameters for dis-
tinguishing between groups). Additionally , this step makes it
also possible to adopt an unsupervised scheme, i.e. learning
directly based on unlabelled information, allowing for a data-
driven identification of statistically meaningful sub-groups
without relying ona prioricategorical assumptions.

Based on generative embedding, we now delineate a
research line consisting of four core steps (figure 2). In the
first step, the units of analysis are explicitly defined, and sub-
sequently collective psychophysiology data is acquired in
different (social) interaction contexts, aiming at probing
different mechanisms (cf. phenomenological [first-person],
interactional [second-person] and inferential [third-person]
phenomena). In a second step, by repeatedly applying gen-
erative modelling, the raw data is projected onto several
low-dimensional parameter spaces, one for each experiment.
In a third step, the separate parameter spaces are concate-
nated to form a single hyperspace, by virtue of bringing
together all calculated parameters and states. In the fourth
step, discriminative approaches are performed for identifying
the crucial independent dimensions of the hyperspace, yield-
ing a formalized definition of the feature space. By repeating
this cycle of experiments and data analyses, an (increasingly
informed) multi-dimensional feature space (cf. autism space
within a broader inter-condition space) is constructed,
being motivated by , and resulting in, increasingly sophisti-
cated units of analyses and experimental designs. This
pipeline is thought to perform repeated cycles: from the
definition of the units of analysis and experimental mea-
surements to computational modelling, machine learning,
data interpretation and back to the redefinition of the units
of analysis. In other words, this research line is meant to
perform a periodic movement, without returning to the
same point.
In short, the proposed procedure is expected to delineate
a dynamic multi-scale space of conditions that will be popu-
lated by not only individual parameters and states, but also
interactive and relational ones [59,98], potentially encapsulat-
ing fuzzy clusters of (sub-)conditions [116]. Our assumption,
here, is that fine-grained, objective measurements of social
interactions could help to identify , in a data-driven manner,
how belonging to a certain diagnostic category possibly
reflects certain social interaction patterns. In doing so, it
may also turn out that transdiagnostic markers of social
impairments are identified, a fact which might be even more
important for treatment than establishing whether someone
belongs to a certain diagnostic group. In fact, such an approach
may not necessarily be grounded in current diagnostic criteria
(allowing for classification in line with existing categorical
knowledge), but on the contrary , by following an unsupervised
data-driven approach, inherent biases of diagnostic manuals
could potentially be ameliorated (by virtue of potentially
unveiling novel transdiagnostic avenues). Here, we draw inspi-
ration from, but also extend toward an interpersonal
dimension, the vision of Stephan and Mathys [44]:‘The hope
for the future is that the delineation of patient sub-groups
characterized by different disease processes, as indexed by
mechanistically interpretable models, will allow for principled
predictions about individual treatment and, eventually , pave
the way towards a new nosology’.
Such a multi-scale account of focusing on real-time social
interactions and real-life relationships will be critical, as it has
been suggested that social interactions may entail processes
fundamentally different than situations of passive social
observation [76], while psychiatric disorders, thought of as
disorders of social interaction, might be more prominent or
may fully manifest in real-time social interactions and
real-life relationships [20,59,101,117].
Here, it is important to emphasize the dynamicity of
such a definition of a multi-dimensional feature space
of conditions. Taking into account that people, their inter-
relationships within society , as well as the concepts of
psychiatric conditions themselves are all dynamic processes,
such a procedure does not aim at concluding with a fixed
definition, but on the contrary at allowing for continuously
capturing the essential dynamics of the co-development of
biological processes, individual persons, their interactions
and relationships, as well as related emerging concepts,
such as social norms in their historical movement and
inherent contradiction. It is interesting to note here that our
here-described empirical and computational scheme could
theoretically accommodate all the above-mentioned pro-
cesses, as all of them, from neurobiology to social norms,
can be thought of as a dynamical process, potentially mod-
elled as Bayesian states. Consequently , this kind of analysis
will include not only a given patient, but also her social inter-
actions with others, ranging from significant others to the
therapists themselves. In a nutshell, a combined approach
of dynamical systems analyses, computational modelling
and machine learning will help to provide a mechanistic
account of interpersonal misattunement, that is, when, how
and why social interactions go wrong, across scales and
levels of description, by virtue of bridging the gap between
social interaction, behaviour and biology.
Our formal approach eventually aims at embracing
the individual not only personally but also interpersonally,
pointing toward the development of an inter-personalized
psychiatry. In fact, we deliberately introduce the new term
of inter-personalized psychiatry — in contradistinction to
personalized psychiatry— to make a case for taking social inter-
actions seriously across all domains of research and practice,
from conceptual, empirical and computational analyses, to
clinical and societal practice. The promising notion of person-
alized medicine has been built around the premise that‘an
individual’s unique physiologic characteristics play a signifi-
cant role in both disease vulnerability and in response to

specific therapies’[118]. While the idea can be traced back to,
at least, Hippocrates, according to whom‘it is more impor-
tant to know what sort of person has a disease than to
know what sort of disease a person has’(quoted in [119],
the term has gained a revitalized attention recently due
to developments of sophisticated methodologies of acqui-
sition and analysis of big (biological) data, e.g. genomics,
proteomics and metabolomics.
Here, our approach of inter-personalized medicine goes
directly beyond the individual, by formally embracing the
unique interactional and relational characteristics of dyads
and groups of persons, while pushing toward the formal
development of ‘sociomics’. Here, we view sociomics as the
discipline which will address the blind spot of the systematic
acquisition and analysis of real-time social interaction and
real-world social relationship data. This, we foresee, will lead
to a revolutionization of established methodologies targeting
the individual (cf. biomarkers, biofeedback, biometrics, self-
report questionnaires and brain stimulation) via widening
the spotlight to include the dyad and the social group (cf.
sociomarkers, cross-brain neurofeedback or sociofeedback,
sociometrics, dyad-report questionnaires and multi-brain
stimulation [22,59,113,120–123]), akin to the development of
hyperscanning as an extension to single-brain imaging [99].
Taken together, developing the paradigm of inter-person-
alized psychiatry will help bring the measurement of social
interaction to the foreground, allowing for the quantitative
assessment of psychiatric conditions both within and across
interacting individuals. This would offer an additional level
of description that has a long-standing history in psychiatry
(assessment of so-called psychomotor symptoms), but
which can benefit from novel technologies and the inte-
gration of interactional and relational data [59,98,117,124].
In other words, this approach could potentially offer a suite
of socio- and biomarkers for psychiatric conditions and
could help to stratify patients and interaction profiles.
Here, we should note that, critically , in addition to certain
diagnostic criteria being met that indicate the presence of a dis-
ease entity , in psychiatric practice, the subjective suffering
reported by individuals (or those in close contact with them)
is also assessed. Importantly , it is also assessed whether
social participation is reduced as a consequence of the occur-
rence of a psychiatric condition. Consequently , here we are
not suggesting eliminating these established ways of diagnos-
ing and treating in psychiatry. What we are suggesting is that
finding ways to quantitatively assess social interactions, with-
out neglecting qualitative dimensions, could help to elucidate
the interrelating social, behavioural, psychological and neuro-
biological mechanisms. Such a development, we argue, will
be an important contribution by virtue of generating inter-per-
sonalized prediction models for not only advancing our
scientific understanding, but also assisting clinical practice
and supporting real-life processes, when needed.
Of note, while our inter-personalized approach to psy-
chiatry is in agreement with the current dominant view that
mental disorders entail neurobiological, psychological, as
well as social dimensions, it is in sharp contrast with its
bottom-up hierarchical assumption about the interrelation
of those dimensions. As Priebe and colleagues insightfully
state [125] :‘[the prevailing paradigm] regards neurobiologi-
cal aspects as the basis of disorders, which are then expressed
in psychological symptoms influenced and managed within a
social context. Neurobiological findings tend to be taken as
explanations for disorders. Neurobiological processes have
been proposed as explanations for how and why interven-
tions work, including psychotherapy.’ Here, our aim is to
turn orthodox medicine on its head, by suggesting that
what we need to do is to systematically look at the interper-
sonal fit of persons and how they establish fulfilling social
connections, without neglecting the relevant neurobiological
processes, or in other words to naturalize the development
of the human mind and psychopathology, without neglecting
their cardinal social origins. In a nutshell, by bringing
together and formally integrating the studies of the individ-
ual and the social, inter-personalized psychiatry aspires to
go beyond both of them.
5. Interpersonal (mis-)attunement in society
Taken together, our approach to interpersonal attunement
in and through social interaction aims at providing the con-
ceptual and methodological tools in order to delineate the
multi-scale dynamics of the dialectic between social inter-
action and the mind. For instance, developmental studies of
interpersonal attunement, quantified by collective psycho-
physiology, interpersonal predictive processing and active
inference, as well as dynamical systems as discussed above,
might provide novel insights about how interpersonal dialo-
gue is progressively transformed into internal speech. This
sort of development could eventually lead to a mechanistic
account of abstract concept formation across development,
potentially unveiling the social and embodied origins of
the human self, while also facilitating the development of
artificial intelligence (cf. symbol emergence; [126]).
Perhaps, most importantly , the implications of an ecologi-
cally valid, real-world approach to social interaction reach
further than any particular field of research. As Vygotsky
stated, ‘we cannot master the truth about personality and per-
sonality itself as long as mankind has not mastered the truth
about society and society itself’[127, p. 342]. Taking the collec-
tive dimension of human becoming in its interrelation with
the individual seriously , as a dialectic between inter- and intra-
personal attunement (without neglecting the constructive
tensions, conflicts and struggles of misattunement; [20]),
points toward concrete directions for societal practice.
For instance, with regard to pedagogy , our approach
speaks to an interactive, collaborative and participant-
oriented learning framework as opposed to a commonly
deployed hierarchical and competitive one [20]. It is also in
line with a legal system which takes into account not only
individual but also collective responsibility , while rejecting
certain rehabilitation practices, such as solitary confinement,
as literally dehumanizing. With regard to clinical practice,
we suggest an inter-personalized psychiatry , which will be
systematically monitoring, evaluating and modulating not
only intrapersonal (e.g. psychophysiological and phenomen-
ological), but also interpersonal processes across various
contexts. This could include social interactions and interper-
sonal relationships with the therapist, significant others,
within the family, school or work, but also the broad link
to society, as this can help align expectations and as such
may improve understanding of others.
Here, we wish to emphasize the relation between psy-
chotherapist and patient, whose interpersonal (mis)match
may require closer evaluation, as not every psychotherapist
royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstbPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B378: 20210365
9
might be effective for every patient [20]. Along these lines,
psychotherapy in a dyadic setting could be investigated by
means of interaction-based phenotyping and psychophysiol-
ogy [59,98,124], which could help to identify communication
problems between patient and therapist in order to analyse
them in terms of underlying mechanisms, so that the patient
(but also the therapist) can learn from them. Furthermore, in
psychotherapy in a group setting, a formal communication
model could be used in order to explain how persons (of
different conditions) perceive the world and others. This
could help to explain when and how communication
breaks down and what can be done to prevent this. Addition-
ally , our approach points from current individualistically
oriented treatment options, such as biofeedback, toward
interpersonal ones, such as sociofeedback— from learning to
regulate intrapersonal functioning to learning to regulate
interpersonal functioning [59] and the use of social niches
to stabilize mental health [128].
Before concluding, we would like to underline the inter-
relation between psychological and socioeconomic processes
in social interactions, such as the generation and perpetuation
of social stigma and inequality. Social stigma may not func-
tion only as a cause of inequality, but also as a result
thereof. Therefore, a pragmatic approach to mental health
should aim at balancing structural asymmetries within
actual society. This could include, but is not limited to,
reducing social exclusion, as well as facilitating housing,
employment and relational seeking. Taken together, a
mutually informed understanding of dysfunction in social
interactions— across scales and contexts— and its biological
correlates may be exactly the key to finding new, pragmati-
cally efficient research and treatment strategy [59,101], but
also reminds us of the necessity to collectively work for
the societal change needed to promote well-being and
mental health for all.
