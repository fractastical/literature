Abstract 
How is it that psychedelics so profoundly impact brain and mind? According to the model of “Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics” 
(REBUS), 5-HT2a agonism is thought to help relax prior expectations, thus making room for new perspectives and patterns. Here, we 
introduce an alternative (but largely compatible) perspective, proposing that REBUS effects may primarily correspond to a particular 
(but potentially pivotal) regime of very high levels of 5-HT2a receptor agonism. Depending on both a variety of contextual factors and 
the specific neural systems being considered, we suggest opposite effects may also occur in which synchronous neural activity becomes 
more powerful, with accompanying “Strengthened Beliefs Under Psychedelics” (SEBUS) effects. Such SEBUS effects are consistent 
with the enhanced meaning-making observed in psychedelic therapy (e.g. psychological insight and the noetic quality of mystical 
experiences), with the imposition of prior expectations on perception (e.g. hallucinations and pareidolia), and with the delusional 
thinking that sometimes occurs during psychedelic experiences (e.g. apophenia, paranoia, engendering of inaccurate interpretations 
of events, and potentially false memories). With “Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics” (ALBUS), we propose that the manifestation of 
SEBUS vs. REBUS effects may vary across the dose–response curve of 5-HT2a signaling. While we explore a diverse range of sometimes 
complex models, our basic idea is fundamentally simple: psychedelic experiences can be understood as kinds of waking dream 
states of varying degrees of lucidity, with similar underlying mechanisms. We further demonstrate the utility of ALBUS by providing 
neurophenomenological models of psychedelics focusing on mechanisms of conscious perceptual synthesis, dreaming, and episodic 
memory and mental simulation.

representations in the brain at large (Carhart-Harris et  al. 2019). 
In contrast, earlier models described psychedelics as “non-specific 
amplifiers” of experience or as “consciousness expanding” (Grof 
1980). Inspired by both REBUS and the ways in which psychedelics 
can 
engender more intense—and potentially more compelling 
and/or meaningful (Dupuis and Veissière 2022, Geurts et  al. 
2022)—conscious states, we here introduce a complementary 
model 
involving Strengthened Beliefs Under Psychedelics (SEBUS). 
The enhanced meaning-making in psychedelic therapy may be 
the most striking realization of SEBUS effects, but other examples 
may be found in the perceptual illusions and cognitive delu-
sions that occur under these altered states of consciousness. The 
more intense realization of one’s life priorities, potentially more 
insightful perspectives on personal challenges—be it existential 
orientation toward a cancer diagnosis, self-persecutory thoughts 
in depression, or the battle of competing motivations underlying 
addictions—seem to suggest some kind of belief strengthening 
is involved. A solely REBUS-focused account pharmacologically 
might better describe a dissociative or anesthetic effect, rather 
than the clinically significant induction of meaningful experiences 
and insights observed with psychedelic therapy. Our alternative 
model would suggest an opposite underlying mechanism whereby 
beliefs (e.g. access and responsiveness to personal meanings) may 
be transiently strengthened by psychedelic activity. Along these 
lines, pareidolia (Mavrogiorgou et  al. 2021), the propensity to 
discern meaningful visual patterns in random noise, is a phe-
nomenon consistently observed with psychedelic use—with over-
lapping neural correlates and associations with creativity (Pepin 
et al. 2022)—and could be explained by transient belief strength-
ening (Leptourgos et al. 2020). Psychedelic-related apophenia 
(Blain et al. 2020 ), or the potentially misleading perception of 
meaningfulness (Sack et al. 2005, McGovern et al. 2023), could 
also be elegantly accounted for with models involving strength-
ened beliefs. Perhaps most compellingly, we believe strengthened 
beliefs provide the most parsimonious account of core aspects 
of psychedelic phenomenology in being able to account for both 
hallucinations and delusions in terms of experience being more 
heavily impacted by prior expectations, rather than present obser-
vations (Maher 2006, Corlett et al. 2019).
One of our main goals for this manuscript is attempting to 
bring together different aspects of major theories to create a “min-
imum unifying model” (Wiese 2020) of the effects of psychedelics 
on brain and mind, wherein insights from diverse perspectives 
may be integrated, and the differences between them adjudi-
cated. We refer to this unifying framework as Altered Beliefs 
Under Psychedelics (ALBUS), with the operative term “altered” 
being meant to capture the capacity for psychedelics to either 
strengthen or relax beliefs at different levels of representational 
hierarchies. Key to the activity of psychedelic drugs is their action 
in the brain as 5-HT2a agonists (Willins et al. 1997 , Johnson 
et al. 2019). It is through consideration of the potential effects of 
this agonism across different doses and neural systems that we 
believe both strengthened and relaxed beliefs may (and must) be 
accounted for in a single framework. In addition to describing the 
core features of ALBUS and its implications, we will also explore 
how such understandings may illuminate fundamental mecha-
nisms of mind, human nature, and potentially even selfhood and 
consciousness in all their various manifestations.
In proposing ALBUS, we suggest a fruitful consensus and gen-
erative conversation can be realized by focusing on ways in 
which particular beliefs—whether in terms of perceptual synthe-
sis (Evans et al. 2020, Juliani et al. 2022b) or personal meanings 
(Kaufman 2021, Amada and Shane 2022)—are either strengthened 
or weakened in different combinations based on multiple factors, 
including various (i) substances, (ii) doses, and (iii) “[personal] 
sets and [environmental] settings” (Leary 1969). That is, it is not 
only the case that we ought to expect both directly and indirectly 
strengthened and relaxed beliefs at different hierarchical levels 
(so allowing for both REBUS and SEBUS effects to occur), but we 
ought to expect further complexities in the ways these admix-
tures of belief strengthening and relaxation vary as a function 
of numerous factors that may vary not just across individuals, 
but even within individuals across contexts, including across the 
time-course of individual psychedelic sessions (with lower phar-
macological levels being present at the ascending and descending 
limbs of high-dose sessions). As such, regardless of whether or not 
an ALBUS framework is accepted as a unifying model, we hope 
to show why it is necessary for us to take caution in ever making 
blanket statements about psychedelics. That is, rather than saying 
“psychedelics do X,” we would do better to say, “this psychedelic 
at this range of doses tends to do X, Y , and Z in A, B, and C con-
texts.” This is not just a matter of pedantry, but reflects the kind 
of precision we need if we are to proceed with the care required 
for discussing and studying these powerful (and so both promising 
and perilous) transformative agents.
We begin by providing a brief overview of how 5-HT2a recep-
tor agonism may lead to either strengthened or relaxed beliefs 
(Fig. 1). Next, we discuss how connecting models of predic-
tive processing to psychedelic phenomenology requires a more 
thorough account of the nature of conscious perception (Fig. 2). 
We further consider how various kinds of sense-driven and 
imaginative experiences are suggested by different models of 
psychedelic action (Fig. 3). We then go on to extend these neu-
rophenomenological models to “thought,” operationally defined 
as sequences of mental actions, experienced as a “stream of con-
sciousness” (Fig. 4). Finally, we discuss some of the complexities 
and future directions of our proposal for both basic and clinical
research.

and 
Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework (Friston et  al. 2006 , 
2017, F riston 2010). In brief, REBUS suggests that psychedelics 
alter hierarchical predictive processing (HPP) mechanisms in ways 
that flatten free energy landscapes, or the differential attract-
ing forces associated with various (Bayesian) beliefs (Sengupta 
et al. 2016, Hesp et  al. 2020, Safron 2021b), so promoting flex-
ibility in inference and learning. Algorithmically speaking, this 
would correspond to reduced “precision-weighting” over top-down 
prior expectations—functionally understood as reduced filter-
ing of perception and cognition via attentional selection (Parr 
and Friston 2017 )—so allowing bottom-up prediction errors to 
have a greater influence on inference and learning. Or perhaps 
with fewer assumptions, one may consider REBUS effects to 
arise whenever minds are altered in ways that disrupt typical 
belief dynamics, with a potentially useful analogy being found 
in visualizing a physical mechanism having different function-
ing when deployed under atypical conditions. Such relaxations 
of beliefs and enhanced capacity for updating may help explain 
why psychedelics appear to have transdiagnostic relevance across 
a broad range of conditions, which may be expected because 
flexibility is almost synonymous with an essential capacity for

Figure 1 SEBUS and REBUS effects in Hierarchical Predictive Processing (HPP). The left image depicts mechanisms of inference and updating in cortical 
hierarchies (Safron 2020a, 2022), considered before the administration of 5-HT2a agonists. Dark purple rectangles indicate higher levels of cortical 
hierarchies (e.g. transmodal cortices and associated networks), encoding more abstract high-level beliefs regarding sources of prior expectations over 
the causal structure of the world (including oneself and others). Light purple circles indicate deep pyramidal neurons (layer 5), thought to encode 
predictions (or priors) via their ability to form large-scale synchronous complexes, partially due to the ability of these units to form re-entrant loops 
with the thalamus. Red shading indicates rhythmic complexes of synchronized neuronal activity forming at beta frequencies (∼13–30 Hz), where these 
probabilistic beliefs are propagated down cortical hierarchies toward primary sensory modalities, indicated by red arrows, where degree of thickness 
corresponds to relative strengths for these prior expectations. White circles indicate superficial pyramidal neurons (L2/3), corresponding to expectancy 
violations, providing a bottom-up flow of prediction errors (generated at faster gamma frequencies; gray shading) as the only information passed up 
cortical hierarchies in predictive coding. The confidence associated with these prediction errors is known as “precision weighting,” indicated by 
thickness of black arrows. Ascending prediction errors are depicted as thinner grey arrows when they are attenuated by descending predictions. A 
REBUS effect (bottom right) would involve a weakening of priors (indicated by smaller beta complexes with thinner red arrows), so allowing more 
sensory observations to reach deeper portions of the brain as prediction errors fail to be suppressed (indicated by more numerous gray-shaded regions 
and somewhat thicker grey arrows). A SEBUS effect (top right), in contrast, would involve a strengthening of priors (indicated by larger beta complexes 
with thicker red arrows), which are depicted as being more effective at suppressing ascending prediction errors (indicated by thinner grey arrows). An 
additional SEBUS effect is depicted in terms of thinner arrows for all prediction errors, which could be functionally understood as a kind of default 
reduction in precision weighting and shielding (or reduced updating) from sense data. This attenuation of the gain on sensory observations may be 
functionally understood as providing prior expectations with greater (or stronger) influence on inferences and updating. In this way, psychedelics may 
not only involve strengthened prior expectations, but such beliefs may be given further strength/precision by being less likely to be contradicted by 
inconsistent sense data.
all complex adaptive systems: open-ended evolution ( Stanley 
and Lehman 2015, Hinton and Kirmayer 2017 , Atasoy et al. 
2019, Hayes 2019 , Brouwer and Carhart-Harris 2020, Safron
et al. 2021b).       
The foundational premise of REBUS is that 5-HT2a agonism 
promotes excessive excitability in “deep” pyramidal cells—i.e. 
layer 5 cortical neurons, as opposed to “superficial” layers (L2/3) 
associated with bottom-up prediction errors (Fig. 1)—which are 
thought to encode top-down “beliefs” based on our prior expec-
tations ( Bastos et al. 2012), with this effect being especially 
pronounced with respect to higher levels of cortical hierarchies. 
According to REBUS, 5-HT2a agonism of deep pyramidal neurons 
causes overly excited ensembles to fail to synchronize, so resulting 
in the implicit relaxation of high-level priors, making it more likely 
that nervous systems will be updated by unsuppressed ascending 
prediction errors from the external world. This removal of top-
down priors then affords a greater latitude for bottom-up sensory 
evidence to drive belief updating throughout the hierarchy.
Here, we propose an alternative account of the effects of 
psychedelics that is in many ways compatible with REBUS, albeit

Figure 2 Integration of sense data into a coherent field of experience. Cortical predictive processing hierarchies from Fig. 1 are depicted as trapezoidal 
shapes with purple-shaded rectangles at their apex. The top, bottom left, and bottom right trapezoids indicate respective hierarchies over somatic, 
auditory, and visual modalities. Dark red shading indicates smaller and faster forming beliefs from synchronized neural activity communicated at 
higher beta frequencies (∼20–30 Hz), and light red shading indicates larger and slower forming beliefs communicated at lower frequencies 
(∼13–20 Hz). Smaller and faster beta oscillatory complexes are depicted as sometimes nested within larger and more slowly synchronizing beta 
rhythms, so enabling hierarchical modeling of more complex events evolving across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Blue shading indicates even 
larger and more slowly unfolding alpha rhythms (∼8–12 Hz), providing yet another level of hierarchical depth for deep temporal world modeling 
(including with respect to self-processes). The left-most panel depicts modeling via fast and small beta complexes, with entailed representations 
constituting lower-level features such as vibratory patterns for hearing, somatosensation, and fine-grained visual information. The middle panel 
depicts this information being brought together into more complex compositions, including object information as modeled by each modality. However, 
these entailed objects are not intended to indicate conscious experiences, which are reserved for the rightmost panel in which modalities can be 
coherently integrated via egocentric reference frames (i.e. seeing one’s hand reaching out to grab an apple from the branch of a tree). See Safron 
(2020a, 2021b, 2022) for more details on the neural and computational bases of phenomenal (and access) consciousness
with some important differences. In what follows, we introduce a 
unified model of ALBUS in which 5-HT2a agonism also involves 
SEBUS effects (Figs 1–3), particularly at intermediate levels of 
abstraction associated with conscious experience ( O’Reilly et al. 
2017, Prinz 2017, Aru et al. 2019, 2020, Safron 2020a, 2021b, 2022). 
By intermediate-level beliefs, we mean to indicate that SEBUS 
effects may primarily be observed at levels that are both hierar-
chically higher to and also more abstract than those that would be 
found closer to primary modalities where sense data is first pro-
cessed. However, these beliefs are “intermediate” in that they may 
be thought of as lower in the predictive processing hierarchy, rela-
tive to more abstract “representations” (Safron et al. 2023) as might 
be associated with/by the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) 
(Çatal et al. 2021). In other words, perhaps intuitively for some, we 
suggest 5-HT2a agonism will tend to increase the overall intensity 
of phenomenal consciousness (e.g. with respect to the vividness 
and/or detail of experience). This increase in the overall intensity 
of perception (and imagination) may potentially occur along most 
of the full dose–response curve for psychedelics under both typi-
cal and altered conditions. We propose that this intensification of 
experience may be crucial for understanding (i) what “manifests” 
in which ways under psychedelics and (ii) what is likely to be acted 
upon and learned while under potentially intensely altered states.
SEBUS effects may provide the most straightforward account 
of folk psychological descriptions of psychedelics as “mind man-
ifesting” and “consciousness elevating.” That is, we propose that 
5-HT2a agonism may allow information to become more con-
sciously accessible by strengthening the activity of particular 
neuronal ensembles. Perhaps more compellingly, strengthened 
beliefs—and as we will suggest later, potentially a shielding of 
these novel imaginings from conflicting sense data—evoke widely 
held impressions that psychedelic experiences can be similar to 
“waking dreams” and “transient psychosis” ( Sacks 2013 , Safron 
and Sheikhbahaee 2021a, Stoliker et al. 2022, 2023, Smith and Ter-
hune 2023). The complexity of cortical information flows clearly 
cannot be reduced to either 5-HT2a-mediated SEBUS or REBUS 
effects. Indeed, psychedelic alterations of working memory capac-
ity may be accounted for by mechanisms that are independent 
of 5-HT2a receptors (Ekins et al. 2023). Nonetheless, ALBUS (criti-
cally) supports a REBUS-like approach in suggesting that attempt-
ing to model the impacts of 5-HT2a signaling on predictive pro-
cessing may be useful for attempting to model the complex effects 
of psychedelics on brain and mind.
We propose that SEBUS effects are strongly suggested by 
the nonveridical nature of hallucinations, as well as pareido-
lia ( Mavrogiorgou et al. 2021, Pepin et al. 2022 ), both of which 
may be straightforwardly understood as strong prior expecta-
tions overwhelming sensory evidence. A strictly REBUS-involving 
account, in contrast, would suggest more veridical perception 
from increased driving of dynamics by raw sensory input from 
the world, with less influence from prior expectations. Further 
support for SEBUS effects may be found in similarities between 
psychedelic phenomenology and the varieties of images created 
with “Deep Dream”-style techniques ( Szegedy et al. 2014, Suzuki 
et al. 2017). With these technologies, specific units in neural net-
works are made to exert particularly strong top-down influences 
in the process of generating likely patterns of inputs, resulting in 
generated stimuli becoming predominated by representations of 
corresponding features (e.g. superimposing fractal or insect-like 
forms onto visual fields in unusual combinations). This would be

Figure 3 REBUS, SEBUS, and ALBUS effects on brain and mind. These images depict how neurological and phenomenological processes might be 
altered with different levels of 5-HT2a agonism under different theoretical assumptions. Panels on the top indicate perception-grounded sensation, 
which is always necessarily experienced from a first-person point of view due to locations of sensors on the body. Panels on the bottom indicate 
imaginative perception (or dreaming) generated from memory decoupled from sensation, organized according to a third-person perspective. The 
extent of shaded complexes of rhythmic neural activity is meant to indicate degrees of coherent integration associated with various frequency bands. 
Sensation is characterized by alpha and beta complexes that extend further down toward primary modalities to indicate information flows being 
constrained by sense data to a greater degree. For imagination, alpha and beta complexes are hypothesized to be centered in deeper portions of the 
brain, so realizing imaginative processing as the unfolding of consciousness with reduced tethering by information from the external world
an instance of strengthening, rather than weakening the beliefs 
entailed by particular units in artificial neural networks; we sug-
gest not dissimilar principles may be at play in biological neural 
networks when high levels of 5-HT2a agonism drive increased 
activity from L5 pyramidal neurons.
The increased subjective vividness and detail of experience 
with psychedelics would seem to suggest increased precision for 
sensory observations (i.e. more influence from prediction errors). 
However, models of consciousness centered on HPP suggest that 
perception and imagination are entailed by predictions, rather 
than sensory prediction errors ( Safron 2020a, 2022). Individu-
als may feel like they are seeing more details of the world as it 
is—which could be the case, depending on many factors—when 
in reality they may actually be experiencing their expectations 
more vividly, but less accurately. Observations of similar effects 
in the domain of cognition—cf. the “noetic” quality of mystical 
6 Safron et al.
experiences (Barrett et al. 2015)—suggest that SEBUS effects may 
parsimoniously apply to belief dynamics at multiple levels of 
abstraction.
We believe that SEBUS effects are further suggested by findings 
in which gamma power—thought to encode prediction errors—
from the primary visual cortex is inhibited with 5-HT2a ago-
nism (Michaiel et al. 2019 ), as well as by associations between 
hallucinations and sensory deprivation (cf. Charles Bonnet syn-
drome or anomalous perceptual experiences sometimes reported 
with isolation tanks) ( Sacks 2013). To the extent that stimulat-
ing L2/3 interneurons contributes to imaginings that are more 
vivid and potentially less constrained, more detailed charac-
terization of the mechanisms and phenomenology of sensory 
attenuation experiences may be a valuable line of inquiry (cf. 
“dark meditation retreats,” the opening of critical plasticity win-
dows with sensory deprivation (Ismail et al. 2017), etc.). Con-
nections between psychedelics and mental imagery have been 
compellingly explored in recent work by Stoliker et  al. (2023) ,

Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics (ALBUS)  7
Figure 4 Cognition might be theoretically altered under different levels of 5-HT2a agonism. Please see the main text for a more detailed description. 
(a) The top set of rows (Unaltered) shows cognition unfolding with low levels of 5-HT2a agonism. (b) The second set of rows (Microdose) shows a 
slightly more extended sequence with somewhat increased perceptual clarity and continuity across percepts. (c) The third set of rows (Threshold dose) 
shows even more extended sequences with even greater vividness, detail, and absorption, with the beginnings of more creative associations (e.g. 
imagining (and possibly remembering) an apple pie). (d) The fourth set of rows (Medium dose) shows the beginnings of psychedelic phenomenology as 
normally understood, with the number of theta cycles (and cognitive operations) in each sequence beginning to lessen due to reduced coherence. 
Imaginings become increasingly creative and closer to perception in vividness, which here shows an additional mnemonic association (i.e. one’s 
mother in relation to apple pie) that might not otherwise be accessible under less altered conditions. (e) The fifth set of rows (Heroic dose) shows 
further truncated sequences with even more intense psychedelic phenomenology, near-complete blurring of imagination and reality, and altered 
selfhood. (f) The sixth set of rows (Extreme dose) shows radically altered cognition involving the visualization of archetypal images (i.e. core priors) 
and a near-complete breakdown of the processes by which coherent metacognition and objectified selfhood are made possible
which are highly compatible with the current proposal in empha-
sizing the nature of such experiences as ranging from dream-like 
to hyper-real, oftentimes in seemingly paradoxical combinations 
(Hoel 2021, Safron and Sheikhbahaee 2021a, Stoliker et al. 2022, 
2023, Smith and Terhune 2023).
ALBUS should not be taken to suggest a simple account of 
either strengthened or relaxed beliefs associated with different 
levels of 5-HT2a agonism. Rather, we should expect different com-
binations of SEBUS and REBUS effects based on a variety of factors 
including the consideration of particular neural systems, sub-
stances, doses, sets, and settings. There may also be broad trends 
with respect to things like the availability of high-level schemas, 
the intensity with which goals are imagined (or consciously repre-
sented) (Safron 2021a, 2021b), and perhaps also with respect to the 
degree to which these intermediate and higher-order attracting 
states are updated by sense data. In terms of canonical micro-
circuits for HPP (Bastos et al. 2012, 2020
), we suggest the following 
hypotheses for the effects of altered 5-HT2a signaling:
(i) Low-to-moderate levels of stimulation of L5 excitatory 
pyramidal neurons may be more likely to strengthen 
(SEBUS)—rather than weaken (REBUS)—complexes of syn-
chronous activity to which these neuronal populations con-
tribute via oscillations from thalamocortical loops (Aru et al. 
2019). Such amplification would have the effect of strength-
ening entailed beliefs, functionally understood as implicit 
and sometimes explicit Bayesian prior expectations, or “pre-
dictions” with respect to HPP.
(ii) Moderate-to-high levels of stimulation of L5 neurons may 
produce direct belief strengthening at intermediate levels of 
cortical hierarchies corresponding to conscious perceptual 
synthesis, or indirectly via higher-level belief-relaxation (e.g. 
from reduced suppression or unusual patterns of attention 
secondary to REBUS effects), or by inducing novel biophys-
ical regimes that diverge from past shaping by experiential 
histories (e.g. thinking/attending differently because things 
feel different).
(iii) Low-to-moderate levels of stimulation of L2/3 inhibitory 
interneurons (Willins et al. 1997)—which are presently not 
included in REBUS models—may also suppress ascending 
sensory prediction errors, so decreasing their influence on 
updating prior expectations. This could have the effect of 
further shielding (possibly strengthened) beliefs from dis-
ruption by inconsistent evidence (cf. hallucinations from 
sensory deprivation).
In sum, we propose that low-to-moderate doses of psychedelics 
may often have impacts that are the opposite of what REBUS 
8 Safron et al.
models might suggest and may predominantly result in direct 
SEBUS effects, with perhaps indirect forms of belief-relaxation 
being generated as a function of expectations. We further sug-
gest that moderate-to-high doses of psychedelics may produce 
complex admixtures of both direct and indirectly realized SEBUS 
and REBUS effects. The observation of the dosage-related effects 
described earlier (and further) would be invaluable for helping 
to determine the soundness of the ALBUS framework. Unfortu-
nately, as will be discussed in greater detail later, most animal 
studies capable of addressing these questions tend to use a “head 
twitch” paradigm ( de la Fuente Revenga et  al. 2019, Halberstadt 
et al. 2020), in which animals are provided with increasing doses 
until they exhibit behavior patterns considered to be indicative of 
psychedelic-like states. While the absence of such evidence is a 
limitation of the present discussion, we also believe that one of 
the primary sources of added value from ALBUS is motivating the 
collection of new datasets, and in this case experiments capable 
of reliably characterizing the functional characteristics of the full 
dose–response curve of 5-HT2a receptors.
Overall, we propose that explaining the effects of compounds 
such as 5-HT2a agonists and other psychedelics may require 
a combination of SEBUS and REBUS models for understanding 
ALBUS. SEBUS-involving models may be necessary to sufficiently 
account for both the therapeutic and “psychotomimetic” effects 
of psychedelics. We suggest that strengthened-belief models may 
provide the most parsimonious explanation for how delusions 
and hallucinations are generated—and why these phenomena 
tend to show strong correlations—under both the temporarily 
altered states of psychedelics as well as in more enduring psy-
chotic states (Wengler et al. 2020). As we hope to demonstrate 
with the detailed neurophenomenological models presented here 
(Figs 2–4), we believe a more sophisticated analysis of cognition is 
required to adequately characterize ways in which beliefs may be 
altered under psychedelics ( Friston et al. 2020, Hesp et al. 2020, 
Safron and Sheikhbahaee 2021a).
We believe ALBUS can provide a “minimum unifying model” 
for understanding psychedelics (Wiese 2020), with various combi-
nations of SEBUS and REBUS effects at varying hierarchical levels 
providing a potentially sufficient conceptual lexicon for describ-
ing how belief dynamics may be altered under different circum-
stances. That is, we do not intend on supplanting theories that 
exist or will be developed in the future, but instead are proposing 
candidate mechanisms and principles by which other models can 
more readily be compared and synergistically integrated with one 
another. While the ALBUS model may be questioned, one of our 
main goals is to demonstrate how we may meaningfully specify 
computational descriptions for nervous systems using the lan-
guage of probability theory and machine learning, with minds 
understood as evolving ecosystems of beliefs/predictions (that 
may be either strengthened or relaxed in myriad ways) for value-
driven agents. In this manuscript, we specifically focus ALBUS on 
classic psychedelics, whose effects are substantially (but not com-
pletely) mediated by 5-HT2a receptors. However, in what follows, 
we hope to show that the study of psychedelics within the ALBUS 
framework has broader implications for understanding varieties 
of conscious (and unconscious) experiences, including phenom-
ena such as psychopathological conditions, various meditative 
states, and even the nature of dreaming.
Any adequate attempt at unification requires considering 
the precise conditions under which people tend to utilize 
psychedelics, including with respect to repeated uses. This is 
especially important in light of the fact that complex behav-
iors usually require learning as part of their contextualization, 
especially with respect to interventions whose primary purpose 
often involves attempting to induce altered states in the service 
of forming altered traits (Goleman and Davidson 2017 , Pollan 
2018). Other frameworks have been provided along these lines, 
such as recently proposed models of psychopathology based on 
the “canalization” of belief landscapes (Carhart-Harris et al. 2023, 
Juliani et al. 2023). However, we would also suggest that such 
models will neither be complete nor accurate if they fail to ade-
quately account for ways in which both (direct and indirect) 
belief strengthening and relaxation play out in (and through)
our minds.
Toward a model of altered states of 
perception
Explaining alterations of perception under psychedelics may 
require models that go beyond the simplicity and elegance of 
HPP as usually understood in terms of a singular algorithm for 
Bayesian inference. Toward this end, we are required to consider 
models of the processes that generate different kinds of subjective 
experiences and their qualities: i.e. phenomenal consciousness. 
Without this kind of detailed understanding, we will likely fail to 
achieve sufficiently constrained hypothesis spaces for reliability 
for both scientific theorizing and clinical interventions.
Safron ( 2020a, 2022) proposes that a multiscale nested hier-
archy over posterior cortices affords phenomenal consciousness, 
partially by virtue of the scope of alpha-band rhythms. More 
specifically, these 8–12 Hz oscillations are suggested to afford 
neuronal synchronization at the spatiotemporal scales required 
to integrate multiple sensory modalities, and further organize 
this information according to egocentric reference frames for the 
sake of both informing and being informed by action–perception 
cycles on the timescales over which they evolve. Please note: 
we are not suggesting that we are in possession of a complete 
account of the neural bases of phenomenal consciousness. For 
example, it remains unclear whether these distributed rhyth-
mic attractors themselves constitute the physical and computa-
tional substrates that generate experience (itself), or something 
more like an essential—but potentially without consciousness 
on its own—passive sampling from the environment (cf. carrier 
waves and multiresolution wavelet analysis). Fortunately, these 
unsolved technical questions do not impact the core claims made 
in the present manuscript, and we instead hope that psychedelics 
may provide valuable data for disambiguating between models of 
consciousness (cf. neural correlates of 5-MeoDMT experiences and 
“cessation” events with advanced Jhana meditators ( Ermakova 
et al. 2021, Laukkonen et al. 2023)).
In Fig. 2, a visuospatial sketchpad—and “mind’s eye,” or “Carte-
sian theater” (Safron 2021b)—is depicted as centered on posterior 
medial cortices, which have been demonstrated to constitute 
major sources of alpha synchronization, implicated in generating 
both visual imagery and awareness (Freton et al. 2014, Sreekumar 
et al. 2018, Xie et al. 2020), and as potentially essential for coher-
ently translating between egocentric and allocentric perspectival 
reference frames (Alexander et al. 2023). While not depicted, an 
additional source of conscious experience may be found in lateral 
parietal cortices in terms of somatospatial processing, which may 
couple with visuospatial modalities in complex ways that would 
influence things like awareness of embodied selfhood, coherent 
tracking of causal sequences, and senses of ownership for actions 
(Darby et al. 2018 ). If such couplings are disrupted, this could 
potentially contribute to the generation of a variety of anoma-
lous inferences ranging from hallucinated external voices to the 
Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics (ALBUS)  9
perception of nonexistent entities ( Safron 2021a ). Such percep-
tions of other agents are sometimes reported with psychedelic 
experiences (Davis et al. 2020), and we believe an ALBUS per-
spective may be able to provide a mechanistic (and naturalistic) 
account of some of the processes that might contribute to their
generation.
Our emphasis on the importance of the preconditions for 
establishing coherent perspectival reference frames may be cru-
cially important for understanding psychedelics, especially con-
sidering the centrality of constructs such as “ego dissolution” 
or the ways in which mystic/awe experiences may both further 
and be furthered by various forms of self-decentering and dis-
inhibiting self/cognitive-control processes (Doss et al. 2021, Say-
alı and Barrett 2023). While further work is needed to support 
our suggested progression from predictive processing to coher-
ent perceptual synthesis, we believe there are good reasons to 
understand nervous systems in terms of workspace-like archi-
tectures for multimodal inference (Safron 2020b, 2022, Juliani 
et al. 2022b ). However, our primary goal here is to provide ser-
viceable (and hopefully useful and accurate) “placeholder” models 
that provide the basis for the models of sophisticated cognition
described later.
Figure 2 describes a progression of information being inte-
grated into increasingly large and encompassing (but more slowly 
evolving) complexes of synchronous neural activity. An apple, for 
example, is consciously experienced if multiple sensory hierar-
chies combine their complementary sources of information to 
synergistically facilitate inference via cross-modal priors. These 
inferential capacities may be further enhanced if organized by 
egocentric perspectival reference frames, which may be required 
for sufficiently coherent experiences such that we can be made 
aware of and report on them, or perhaps may be necessary for 
any consciousness to be generated whatsoever ( Safron 2020a , 
2022
). Across scales, neuronal synchronization is assumed to 
enable “communication through coherence” (Fries 2015, Deco and 
Kringelbach 2016), computationally understood as the establish-
ment of joint beliefs from whatever information is capable of 
being exchanged on the timescales of formation for these meta-
stable attracting states (Safron 2020a , 2022
). An inverse relation-
ship between the size and speed of rhythms is depicted, which 
may be a necessary consequence of the differential challenges of 
creating coherent oscillatory modes for networks of varying sizes 
(Buzsáki and Watson 2012).
Differential effects of 5-HT2a agonism on 
sensation and imagination
Among the many aspects of phenomenology to be accounted 
for by an adequate account of psychedelics, we believe two key 
components of ways in which experience may be altered include 
the qualities of imagination and perception, as well as ways in 
which self-consciousness is shaped by tendencies and capaci-
ties for adopting egocentric and/or allocentric perspectives on 
oneself. With potential relevance to both spirituality and clini-
cal practice, nondual awareness and dissociative (and potentially 
pathological) states associated with psychedelics and meditative 
experiences may involve a breakdown of such processes of self-
objectification (Deane et al. 2020 , Safron 2021b, Ciaunica and
Safron 2022).
The contributions of posterior medial cortices to alpha power 
are notable in that this region has been shown to contribute 
to the establishment of coherent egocentric perspectival refer-
ence frames (Safron 2020a). Reducing coherence in signaling from 
these regions could have the effect of destabilizing egocentric-
ity for selfhood on multiple levels, potentially contributing to the 
attenuation of more extended self-processes while preserving suf-
ficiently coherent models of bodily states for maintaining some 
degree of conscious perception (Safron 2021b). Speculatively, such 
a partially dissociated state could allow for elevated absorption 
with respect to both imagination and perception (Tellegen 1982, 
Csíkszentmihályi 1991 , Ott et  al. 2005 ), potentially achieved by 
forcing individuals to focus their perceptions and imaginings on 
“the now” (Tolle 2010, Young 2016).
The strength of rhythmic complexes of neural activity is sug-
gested to reflect the strength of beliefs, some subset of which 
correspond to conscious subjective experiences. We further pro-
pose a model focusing on rhythmic complexes over posterior lobes 
as potential realizers of phenomenal consciousness, understood 
as the iterative estimation of likely sensory states, conditioned on 
a causal world model.
Figure 3 describes REBUS and SEBUS effects in the contexts of 
imagination (or dreaming) and perception. While imagination can 
involve either first- or third-person reference frames, only third-
person perspectives are depicted to indicate their necessity for 
constructing objectified selfhood and reflexive meta-aware self-
consciousness (i.e. moving from an experiencing “I” to a Jamesian 
“me”) (James 1890, Metzinger 2010).
The second column in Fig. 3 depicts what might be observed 
under smaller psychedelic doses with strictly REBUS effects (i.e. 
relaxed beliefs) with all beliefs being relaxed, depicted as less 
extensive alpha and beta complexes. The expected subjective 
effects from such modifications are depicted as including greater 
sensory details from perception, but with less perceptual vivid-
ness. Discrepancies between these predictions with actual sub-
jective reports indicate that the REBUS model on its own may not 
be adequate for accounting for psychedelic experience. If all pri-
ors were relaxed for cortical generative models, then we would 
expect this to also apply to intermediate hierarchical levels at 
which perceptual synthesis and sensorimotor-grounded cognition 
may be realized ( Varela et al. 1992 , Barsalou 2010, Prinz 2017, 
Safron 2021c).
The third column in Fig. 3 indicates what might be observed 
under smaller doses with strictly SEBUS effects (i.e. strength-
ened beliefs)—which could be the case for low-to-moderate levels 
of 5-HT2a agonism. This is subjectively depicted as including 
greater perceptual vividness, and details being more likely to 
match the expectations of potentially richer and more unusual 
imaginings, with the beginnings of psychedelic phenomenology 
in the form of fractal patterns and quasi-synesthetic percepts. 
Synesthetic phenomenology, however, does not appear to be well 
suited to disambiguate between models of psychedelic action, 
since such perceptual alterations could be explained either by 
SEBUS effects as strengthened cross-modal priors or in terms of 
REBUS effects where (nonstrengthened) priors are afforded greater 
cross-modal communicative capacity (when normal high-level 
beliefs are relaxed).
The fourth column of Fig. 3 indicates an admixture of 
REBUS and SEBUS effects (i.e. ALBUS), involving both strength-
ened beta and relaxed alpha synchrony, subjectively depicted 
as entailing both greater perceptual vividness and more intense 
psychedelic phenomenology, including the beginning of altered
self-models.
The fifth column indicates REBUS/SEBUS effects under extreme 
levels of 5-HT2a agonism, including the breakdown of organiza-
tion of experience according to coherent self-models. Such highly 
altered states could be understood as a kind of “ego death” as 
10 Safron et al.
sometimes described by “psychonauts” ( Martial et al. 2021), and 
which is normally only reported by meditative adepts, with nat-
urally occurring mystical experiences ( James 1902, Safron 2016), 
or in individuals suffering from severe forms of psychosis (cf. 
disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia). Our core claim is 
that mechanisms of predictive processing suggest that primar-
ily SEBUS effects should be expected with lower levels of 5-HT2a 
agonism, and also that REBUS effects are unlikely to be observed 
in isolation without the concomitant strengthening of perceptual 
beliefs.
We have considered situations in which one might observe 
both directly and indirectly strengthened and relaxed beliefs in 
different combinations as a potential explanation for different 
varieties of psychedelic alterations. We have further suggested 
that psychedelic states could be understood as being similar to 
waking dreams with varying degrees of lucidity. Table 1 provides 
an overview of how the potential alterations of neural dynam-
ics depicted in Fig. 3 could explain different modes of waking 
and dreaming cognition, potentially (but not necessarily) involving 
endogenous psychedelic mechanisms. That is, we are suggesting 
that SEBUS- and REBUS-like effects could be useful for describing 
different states of consciousness, even without the administration 
of psychedelic compounds. 
The H/E-S and orchestration of streams of 
consciousness and cognition
ALBUS highlights potential (both direct and indirect) alterations of 
hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) functioning as one of the 
primary explanatory mechanisms for understanding the effects 
of psychedelics. This emphasis is not arbitrary but is rather moti-
vated by a growing consensus that H/E-S functions may be the 
key to understanding sophisticated cognitive processes such as 
episodic memory and imagination/planning, and even capacities 
for “mental time-travel” and autobiographical selfhood ( Safron 
et al. 2021). It has been suggested that most (and perhaps all) high-
level cognition may be productively understood in terms of the 
problem of an autonomous system/agent/robot simultaneously 
attempting to locate itself and construct maps of environments 
within which it attempts to achieve (or forage for) valued goals. 
If this is indeed a profitable direction of travel for cognitive sci-
ence and brain-inspired artificial intelligence (Juliani et al. 2022a), 
then it should no less apply to understanding psychedelic expe-
riences. However, the complexity of the H/E-S is also daunting, 
with many details remaining unclear. To what extent do differ-
ent psychedelic states involve alterations in the granularity with 
which space is organized according to hexagonal grids/tilings? 
To what extent do psychedelics alter the extent to which obsta-
cles and goals distort these spaces, with what functional sig-
nificances (e.g. Lilliputian phenomena from atypical modes of 
body mapping?)? While such unanswered questions suggest it 
may be premature to try to add further unknowns in investi-
gating such complex phenomena, we propose that the oppo-
site may be the case: by altering minds so profoundly, to what 
extent can psychedelics provide a “telescope for the mind” in 
providing edge cases and “exceptions that prove the rule” with 
respect to the normative functioning of core cognitive/affective
systems?
While this interpretation of hippocampal remapping is admit-
tedly speculative, we believe it is also well supported by numerous 
computational models ( Çatal et al. 2021, Safron 2021b; Safron 
et al. 2021). With respect to psychedelics, we believe there may be 
an important interpretation of sharp-wave ripple events as indi-
cating an attempt at (re)positioning organisms within the spatial 
reference frames used to situate themselves in environments 
within which they pursue valued goals ( De Freitas et al. 2023, 
Paul et al. 2023 ). Some support for the centrality of the H/E-S 
for psychedelic cognition may be found in recent work in which 
reduced sharp-wave ripples correlated with reduced performance 
with respect to the ability of schizophrenic patients to coherently 
navigate through “semantic spaces” (Nour et al. 2023).
The models depicted in this section, if found to be accurate, 
would provide a powerful basis for understanding the effects of 
psychedelics on cognition. Some theoretical support for these 
models may be found by considering the H/E-S as a kind of energy-
based contrastive learner ( Mazzaglia et al. 2022), with potential 
functional mappings onto machine learning architectures such 
as spectral graph nets (Greff et  al. 2020 ). Theoretically, we may 
even find ourselves understanding these operations in terms of 
well-defined cognitive cycles with clear interpretations of different 
phenomena (e.g. interactions between hippocampal theta preces-
sion and more globally distributed synchronous dynamics across 
the brain). The details of the models presented here are neces-
sarily preliminary, given our current state of understanding, but 
we believe they point to the potential and importance of trying to 
depict the unfolding of streams of experience with respect to their 
various aspects/qualities, as well as the ways these phenomena 
might vary both between and within individuals.
Figure 4 describes six different hypothetical regimes of 
cognition—organized with respect to levels of 5-HT2a-receptor 
stimulation—expected with various psychedelic interventions 
or similar endogenously generated states: “Unaltered,” “Micro-
dose,” “Threshold dose,” “Medium dose,” “Heroic dose,” and 
“Extreme dose.” For each regime of cognition (with potential cor-
respondences with different levels of 5-HT2a agonism and other 
psychedelic mechanisms), two episodes of ∼1–3 s in duration are 
shown as sequences of imaginative and perceptual states, with 
the second episode meant to indicate a stream of experience 
generated subsequent to termination of the first one. Depictions 
of the brain and associated experiences involve the model of 
phenomenal consciousness (and its alterations) from Fig. 3 but 
are expanded to include orchestration by theta rhythms (yellow 
shading) from the H/E-S.
Figure 4 depicts an inverted-U-shaped function (Yerkes and 
Dodson 1908) with respect to the extent of the impact of increas-
ing doses on the stability of cognition across time. This prediction 
is tentative in that there is at present little available evidence sup-
porting nonlinear dose–response curves with respect to behavior 
or cognition. However, the potential for qualitatively different 
regimes may be suggested by enhanced attention with low (but 
not high) doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) ( Hutten et al. 
2020) and impaired attention being observed with high-dose psilo-
cybin (Carter et al. 2005, Vollenweider et al. 2007). Some indirect 
speculative support for nonlinear dose–response effects could 
potentially also be found with respect to subjective time dilation—
a hallmark of flow states characterized by absorbed attention 
(Csíkszentmihályi 1991)—being most strongly observed for 10 μg 
(relative to 5 and 20 μg) doses of LSD ( Yanakieva et al. 2019). 
Further (admittedly both indirect and speculative) convergent 
support for qualitatively different effects may also be found in cre-
ativity enhancements being more reliably associated with lower 
doses of LSD (Wießner et al. 2022).
“Cognitive maps” in the hippocampus are depicted underneath 
each brain in Figure 4 as embedded in hexagonal tiling of space 
(Moser et al. 2008, 2017), through which potential future trajec-
tories through possible locations are indicated as green-shaded 
hexagons, with present-estimated trajectories indicated by red

hexagons. T wo maps are shown to indicate potential functional 
divisions between anterior and posterior portions of the hip-
pocampus, which, respectively, more strongly couple to frontal 
and posterior cortices (Faul et al. 2020 ). Anterior hippocampal 
maps show multiple routes through space, which are selected 
at each moment (darkest green) based on the expected value 
of choosing that route ( Stachenfeld et al. 2017, Kay et al. 2020, 
McNamee et  al. 2021 ). Posterior maps, in contrast, show a sin-
gle route through space, corresponding to the perceived path 
taken and encoded in memory, with the most intense red shading 
indicating estimates for the present moment of experience, and 
with this activity gradually fading across subsequent time steps. 
Notably, while these trajectories are most commonly understood 
with respect to navigation through physical space, it is increas-
ingly suspected that this core system for localization and mapping 
was repurposed for the sake of high-level cognition as naviga-
tion through generalized space, including for conceptual spaces 
(Gothoskar et al. 2019 , Hawkins 2021, Kaplan and Friston 2018; 
Safron et al. 2021, Whittington et al. 2019).
Below these maps, within each theta cycle, two frames of 
experience are depicted as unfolding at alpha frequencies. While 
the generation of particular experiential frames may be influ-
enced by counterfactual imagination and memory as orches-
trated by the hippocampus (Hassabis et al. 2014 , Faul et al. 
2020
), particular moments of experience could be a function of 
either imagination or perception depending on numerous fac-
tors (e.g. degree of driving inputs from the senses). The num-
ber of theta cycles in each row indicates tilings of (generalized) 
space along which trajectories may be planned and recorded in 
memory, which are shown as variable length sequences due to 
different levels of 5-HT2a agonism. These chunked sequences 
could be understood as Edelman’s “remembered present” or 
James’ “specious present,” wherein “the now” has inherent tem-
poral thickness as past moments both contextualize and are 
recontextualized by future moments of experience ( Varela 1999,
Edelman 2001).
T wo sequences (Episodes 1 and 2) are depicted for each level of 
dosing, where different cognitive regimes involve varying degrees 
of coherence (and potentially conscious access/remembering) 
maintained across time when separated by hippocampal reset-
ting/remapping events (Colgin et  al. 2008). The precise extent of 
these trajectories through mental spaces may be influenced by 
“circuit-level” functional properties such as degrees of neuromod-
ulation ( Ul Haq et al. 2016, O’Callaghan et al. 2021 ), with both 
5-HT1a and 5-HT2a receptor agonism being capable of inhibit-
ing the sharp-wave ripple events indicative of hippocampally 
mediated memory consolidation and activation of distributed cor-
tical ensembles. Tentatively, inspired by models from machine 
learning ( De Freitas et al. 2023, Paul et  al. 2023), we suggest 
these suppressed ripples might also be accompanied by sup-
pressed remapping of physical and conceptual spaces, which 
when refreshed, may afford different modes of sense-making with 
alternative sets of potential actions. Additionally, hippocampal 
remapping could potentially occur via surpassing thresholds for 
cumulative prediction error, such as might be expected as uncer-
tainty builds with respect to the ability of a given set of behavioral 
policies to be effectively realized through enaction (and where this 
uncertainty would be likely to increase under highly altered condi-
tions). 5-HT2a agonism may impact the extent of these predictive 
and remembered “task” sets both by inhibiting hippocampal reset-
ting mechanisms directly, as well as by altering the coherence of 
streams of experience, so influencing degrees of overall accompa-
nying prediction error, so influencing the likelihood of error-driven 
remapping.
If the models described in Fig. 4 were found to be usefully accu-
rate depictions of the unfolding of the stream of consciousness 
and associated cognitive processes, then ALBUS may represent 
the first unified paradigm for understanding psychedelic phe-
nomena and varieties of conscious experiences more generally. 
That is, while this may seem like an excessively bold claim, we 
believe the progression of regimes described in Fig. 4 could poten-
tially not only apply to different levels of 5-HT2a agonism, but 
could also be used to model various clinical conditions (cf. the 
“psychotomimetic paradigm”), the progression from sleeping to 
waking and back again, degrees of lucidity within dreams, or other 
progressions such as cognitive development and decline (e.g. Lewy 
body dementia and “terminal lucidity”).
Discussion
The ALBUS framework is intended to provide a common basis for 
integrating models and associated findings from other paradigms, 
whether emphasizing relaxed beliefs (Carhart-Harris et al. 2019), 
opening attentional and perceptual thalamic filters (Preller et  al. 
2019), or altering cortical processing by disrupted coupling with 
integrative structures such as the claustrum (Doss et al. 2021). 
Apart from REBUS, other accounts of psychedelic action have 
tended to remain uncommitted in describing effects on the lev-
els of computational functions and their potential algorithmic 
realizations. ALBUS suggests that Bayesian cognitive science and 
machine learning could provide a kind of “lingua franca” for 
shared (and potentially synergistic) sense-making across differ-
ent theories. Our goal is not a definitive exhaustive account of 
psychedelic and related experiences, but to facilitate produc-
tive conversations across perspectives that have nonoverlapping 
strengths and weaknesses (and thereby potential for inferential 
synergy). Below we will consider some additional complexities and 
hypotheses before concluding with open questions and directions 
for future work.
ALBUS and complex causation: SEBUS via 
REBUS; REBUS via SEBUS
REBUS emphasizes L5 pyramidal neurons (Carhart-Harris et al. 
2019), suggesting that increased excitability from 5-HT2a agonism 
results in asynchronous activation modes, and thereby relaxed 
beliefs through attenuated coherence. This suggestion provides a 
potentially sufficient account for reduced alpha power and ego 
dissolution associated with psychedelic states (Smigielski et al. 
2019). In a similar spirit to this paradoxical reduction in coher-
ent signaling via excessive excitation, the inhibitory-interneuron 
mechanism described earlier as a source of SEBUS effects may 
be challenged. That is, increasing the excitability of superficial 
interneurons may not necessarily inhibit ascending prediction 
errors in those layers, but could potentially have the opposite 
result via indirect disinhibitory dynamics (Friston 2019; A. Safron, 
personal communication). Detailed neurophysiological investiga-
tions with lower levels of 5-HT2a agonism will be helpful for 
gaining clarity on these issues.
Perceptual illusions could be illustrative in terms of distin-
guishing between REBUS and SEBUS effects. Susceptibility to these 
misleading percepts is well explained by HPP in terms of per-
ception understood as probabilistic inference. If our perception 
corresponds to our best guess for causes of sensory observa-
tions, given past experience, then these guesses can sometimes 
be mistaken. That is, minds are capable of being tricked in such 
ways because perception is structured according to prior expecta-
tions from (interpretations of) past sensory experiences. According 
Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics (ALBUS)  13
to a purely REBUS-involving model, relaxation of these priors 
should raise illusion-susceptibility thresholds, so making us more 
resistant to going down these perceptual garden paths.
According to a SEBUS model, however, the thresholds for illu-
sory perception may be lowered, so making us even more likely to 
misperceive. Based on the mechanistic considerations described 
earlier, we suggest SEBUS effects are likely to predominate with 
low-to-moderate levels of 5-HT2a agonism (Figs 2 and 3), and with 
some combination of SEBUS and REBUS effects at higher levels 
of stimulation for those pathways. Thus, we might expect either 
increased or decreased illusion susceptibility with, respectively, 
lower or higher doses of psychedelics.
REBUS emphasizes the high concentrations of 5-HT2a recep-
tors for deeper portions of generative models, suggesting that 
intermediate hierarchical levels associated with conscious per-
ception could become strengthened as they are released from pre-
dictive suppression from hierarchically higher areas. This would 
be an example in which SEBUS phenomena are generated as an 
indirect consequence of REBUS effects. The inclusion of such loop-
ing causal cascades may make it difficult to establish whether 
SEBUS effects can occur independently of being driven by 5-HT2a 
stimulation that results in REBUS effects. Observing increased 
susceptibility for illusions involving low-level perceptual features 
with lower psychedelic doses could potentially provide evidence 
for the independent functional significances of SEBUS mecha-
nisms. Such beliefs may be less likely to be influenced by high-
level expectations, and it is also unclear that we should expect 
excitation-induced desynchronization described by REBUS with 
low-to-moderate levels of 5-HT2a agonism.
Yet another example of a complex relationship between 
strengthened and weakened beliefs was proposed by Pink-
Hashkes et al. (2017) , where predictions form so readily that 
they are less likely to adequately explain incoming sense data, 
thereby generating increased prediction errors, and so result in 
more uncertain—or entropic (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014, Carhart-
Harris 2018)—belief landscapes. Under such a state of elevated 
uncertainty, hallucinations and other psychedelic phenomena are 
suggested to result as anomalous predictions attempt to explain 
incoming sense data, potentially involving a compensatory up-
regulation of high-level priors. In this view, SEBUS effects produce 
a greater diversity of less well-fitted beliefs—as opposed to larger 
joint beliefs—which indirectly produce REBUS effects via con-
flicting predictions at hierarchically higher levels. SEBUS effects 
(e.g. hallucinations) may also arise indirectly if relaxed beliefs at 
upper levels of cortical hierarchies reduce suppression of predic-
tion errors at lower and intermediate levels of organization, so 
resulting in net disinhibition (Figs 2 and 3). In this view, SEBUS 
effects would be the indirect result of REBUS effects.
Causal complexity could become even greater if we consider 
various forms of conscious and self-referential processing. For 
example, low-to-moderate doses of 5-HT2a agonism could gen-
erate strictly SEBUS effects at the level of cortical microcircuitry 
(Fig. 1), yet produce multiple kinds of REBUS effects in overall 
belief dynamics such as the following:
(i) Qualitative differences in processing resulting in individu-
als approaching experience atypically, so “relaxing” typical 
assumptions.
(ii) Expectations of particular modes of cognition that devi-
ate from typical priors causing such experiences to become 
more likely (cf. placebo and nocebo effects).
(iii) Explicit expectation of REBUS-like effects producing patterns 
of cognition characterized by enhanced open-mindedness 
and creativity.
In these ways, while we believe the account of predictive process-
ing described by REBUS may require additional details to account 
for the full range of psychedelic phenomena, we want to empha-
size that we are not suggesting this theory should be abandoned 
in favor of SEBUS models. Rather, we suggest the way forward will 
involve combining both SEBUS and REBUS phenomena (including 
their potential inter-relations), as well as additional neural pro-
cess theories (Preller et al. 2019, Doss et al. 2021), into a broader 
framework that considers the diversity of ALBUS.
Psychedelics, psychopathology, and cognitive 
spectrums
SEBUS effects may help account for observations of “psy-
chotomimetic” properties for psychedelic phenomenology, for 
which overly strong priors represent a face-valid model of mul-
tiple aspects of schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) 
(Frith 2005, Maher 2006, Corlett et al. 2019 ). Yet, REBUS effects 
may provide a more useful account of psychosis involving disrup-
tion of deep beliefs (Adams et al. 2013), including with respect to 
the integrative properties of self-related processing (Friston et al. 
2016, Noel et al. 2017). Carhart-Harris et al. (2019) note the similar-
ities between their suggested mechanisms for psychedelic states 
and the excessive prediction errors that may represent a partial 
diathesis for autism ( Lawson et al. 2014 ). However, they go on 
to argue against this connection based on differences between 
dynamics unfolding on state and trait levels. While considera-
tions of time scales over which relevant psychological phenom-
ena evolve are surely important, it is nonetheless notable that 
there are clear dissimilarities between psychedelic and autistic 
phenomenology, as well as similarities between psychedelic and 
psychotic states.
SEBUS-like processes may be required to reconcile differences 
between the altered states suggested by strictly REBUS-based 
models and particular traits of autism. It has been suggested 
that autism spectrum disorders may reflect one pole of a cog-
nitive spectrum with schizophrenia on the opposing end ( Byars 
et al. 2014, Crespi and Dinsdale 2019). In this domain and others 
(Table 2), SEBUS/REBUS mechanisms may be important in suggest-
ing which interventions might be most helpful in which circum-
stances. For example, by attenuating sensory prediction errors and 
increasing the ability to form high-level inferences—potentially 
including the kinds underlying different aspects of social cogni-
tion (Call and Tomasello 2008, Penn et al. 2008, Rabinowitz et al. 
2018)—low-to-moderate doses of 5-HT2a agonists could poten-
tially provide a valuable treatment for autism ( Markram and 
Markram 2010, De Jaegher 2013). 
Furthermore, a purely REBUS-based model might (perhaps 
questionably) suggest 5-HT2a agonists as beneficial in some cases 
of psychosis by attenuating overly strong beliefs (Schmidt et  al. 
1995, Stoliker et al. 2023). Yet a SEBUS-involving model, in con-
trast, would suggest that classic psychedelics may be strongly 
contraindicated for anyone at risk for psychosis—with poten-
tial exceptions from specific targeted interventions—and would 
further point to potential benefits from 5-HT2a antagonism for 
treating psychotic states (Schmidt et al. 1995). Please note: our 
hypotheses concerning the clinical implications of ALBUS are not 
meant to constitute a definitive statement of recommendations, 
with research being needed to inform interventions.
As described earlier, the study of visual illusions with varying 
susceptibility thresholds could potentially provide valuable data 
on these matters. While resistance to visual illusions has been 
discussed with both psychedelics (Pollan 2018 ) and schizophre-
nia (Gupta et al. 2016 ), this association might be more reliable

18 Safron et al.
with respect to autism (Turi et al. 2018). Hypothetically, we might 
expect schizophrenia to be particularly strongly associated with 
resistance to illusions at early- or mid-stages if it is of a vari-
ety that has overlapping diatheses with autism (Barneveld et al. 
2011), or at late stages where breakdown of global integration 
may be observed (e.g. via NMDA-receptor auto-immunity) (Braun 
et al. 2016 ). However, we might also potentially expect prodro-
mal individuals and relatives of schizophrenic patients to show 
the opposite pattern of heightened illusion susceptibility, poten-
tially consistent with findings regarding predisposing factors for 
pareidolia and apophenia (Blain et al. 2020, Mavrogiorgou et al. 
2021). To the extent that such inter- and intra-individual dif-
ferences in predictive processing and cognitive spectrums apply, 
the kinds of models described in Figs 3 and 4 could provide 
valuable means of characterizing these sources of human vari-
ation. Thus, we might be able to adjudicate between mech-
anistic models based on SEBUS or REBUS effects, as well as 
their combinations (ALBUS) by assessing the extent to which 
visual illusion thresholds are raised or lowered with 5-HT2a ago-
nists, with potentially notable differences across various kinds
of minds.
Breaking free of (and via) default modes; 
creativity and consciousness
Altered beliefs under classic psychedelics could result in over-
coming barriers to breaking typical frames and engaging in non-
traditional divergent thinking ( Carson 2010, Kenett et al. 2018a, 
Girn et al. 2020), so allowing novel streams of imagination to be 
considered ( DeYoung et al. 2008). This kind of “out of the box” 
(or frame) creative thinking can be thought of as driving minds 
into otherwise uncharted territories of hypothesis spaces. In look-
ing for systems potentially required for enabling robust patterns 
of counterfactual processing, the default mode network (DMN) 
may provide this kind of dynamo for creativity and imagination 
(Beaty et al. 2014, 2015
, 2018, Hassabis et al. 2014). By constitut-
ing a source of strong internally coherent predictions, the DMN 
may be capable of temporarily absorbing and then releasing free 
energy via the shaping of perception and driving of action, perhaps 
especially when coupled to salience networks (Carhart-Harris and 
Friston 2010, Rueter et al. 2018, Zhou et al. 2018, Safron 2021b). 
However, while the DMN is likely essential for constructing things 
(or processes) like autobiographical selfhood, its effective connec-
tivity with the salience network and neuromodulatory nuclei of 
the brainstem is likely essential for understanding how dynam-
ics may be orchestrated according to estimates of value based 
on past experiences (Dohmatob et al. 2020, Hamilos et al. 2021). 
The connectomic properties of the DMN suggest this core net-
work is ideally suited to serve these functions (in collaboration 
with other intrinsic functional networks) by virtue of having high 
centrality, and so high potential for integrating information and 
exerting control (Kenett et al. 2018a). The DMN is further located 
distally from primary modalities and is thereby capable of sup-
porting dynamics more decoupled from immediate sensorimotor 
engagements (Buckner and Krienen 2013, Sormaz et al. 2018). Fur-
thermore, the DMN is likely to support some of the most stable 
inferences available to embodied embedded persons, with major 
nodes contributing to egocentric perspective, integrated memory, 
and even the foundations of selfhood and intersubjective model-
ing (Hazlett et al. 2005, Hassabis and Maguire 2009, Brewer et al. 
2013, Leech and Sharp 2014).
While the precise roles of the DMN may be debated, this 
kind of trading-off of prediction error across neural systems may 
be involved in not only the unusual imaginings associated with 
creativity, but also agentic control, which necessarily involves 
prediction error generation due to the counterfactual status of 
yet-to-be-achieved goals. In this way, every intentional action is 
inherently creative in bringing desired states into being through 
holding onto prior expectations as a kind of sustained imagina-
tion. This is a clear case in which SEBUS effects are relevant and 
would recast the functional significance of (low-to-moderate) lev-
els of 5-HT2a signaling as crucially involving strengthened beliefs 
for imaginative planning and goal-oriented cognition more gen-
erally (Hesp et al. 2020, Safron 2021a, Safron and Sheikhbahaee 
2021b). Perhaps this relates to the reported efficacy of the older 
model of “psycholytic therapy” in which talk therapy during expe-
riences prompted by moderate psychedelic doses (in contrast to 
higher doses in “psychedelic therapy” in which there is minimal 
therapeutic interaction during the experience itself) is leveraged 
toward therapeutic change (Passie et al. 2022).
The strengthening of DMN-mediated counterfactual imagin-
ings with psychedelics is consistent with recent work involving 
LSD, in which dynamic causal modeling established increased 
effective connectivity from posterior portions of the DMN to 
associated thalamic nuclei ( Preller et  al. 2019). While recent 
work has identified additional complexities using similar meth-
ods ( Stoliker et  al. 2023 , 2023a, 2023b), these sorts of find-
ings provide intriguing support for a SEBUS-involving account of 
enhanced creative capacity (and potentially agency) via more vivid
imaginings.
In these ways, both SEBUS and REBUS effects may be observed 
in various ways at different levels of organization, including inter-
mediate levels of hierarchical abstraction for which conscious 
experience may be realized as a stream of sensorimotor pre-
dictions (Prinz 2017, Safron 2020a, 2021b, 2022). However, even 
if SEBUS effects may be required for explaining some aspects 
of psychedelic phenomenology, REBUS-informed models may be 
essential for capturing other aspects of personal experience and 
clinically relevant outcomes ( Tables 2, 3), such as the increased 
open-mindedness associated with psychedelic-use (MacLean et al. 
2011, Erritzoe et al. 2019). In this way, an adequate account of the 
ways in which psychedelics alter brain and mind likely needs to be 
expanded into an ALBUS framework capable of integrating across 
both SEBUS and REBUS phenomena.
Conclusions and future directions
While SEBUS and REBUS effects may converge with moderate-
to-high levels of 5-HT2a agonism, we might expect qualitatively 
different effects with low-to-moderate doses. Under regimes char-
acteristic of microdosing or threshold experiences ( Figs 3 and 4), 
consciousness may be elevated without substantially altering typ-
ical belief dynamics. In these ways, microdosing may provide a 
promising and overlooked therapeutic intervention for depression 
(e.g. anhedonia), autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and disorders of 
consciousness. In contrast to a purely REBUS-focused model, a 
SEBUS-involving ALBUS perspective makes different predictions 
for the potential utility of various psychedelic interventions for 
these debilitating conditions, for which advances in treatment 
could have impacts on public health that may be difficult to over-
state. We suggest the following lines of inquiry are likely to be 
informative for testing ALBUS:
Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics (ALBUS)  19
(i) Do lower and higher levels of 5-HT2a agonism have dif-
ferent effects on the extent to which particular priors—
and at which levels of organization under which circum-
stances?—are either strengthened or relaxed in HPP?
(ii) To what extent (and under which circumstances) could ago-
nizing L2/3 inhibitory interneurons result in reduced gain 
on observations (cf. sensory deprivation), so contributing to 
more intense and/or less constrained imaginings?
(iii) Can high-field strength fMRI (or multiple imaging modali-
ties with complementary resolution in spatial and tempo-
ral domains) of psychedelic experiences allow for testing 
hypotheses regarding the relative strength of predictions and 
prediction errors from respective superficial or deep cortical 
layers (Fracasso et al. 2017, Bastos et al. 2020)?
(iv) With respect to such models, could sufficiently reli-
able estimates of individual-level data be obtained for 
alignment with subjective reports, so helping to real-
ize some of the hopes of “neurophenomenology” (Rudrauf 
et al. 2003 , Carhart-Harris 2018, Sandved Smith et al.
2020)?
(v) Perhaps the most straightforward approach to investigating 
when we might expect SEBUS/REBUS phenomena would be 
the systematic study of perceptual illusions whose suscep-
tibility thresholds have been titrated such that the relative 
strength of priors can be ascertained. This work could be 
conducted with a wide range of illusory percepts at multiple 
hierarchical levels in different modalities, in multiple combi-
nations. Such work can include not only perception but also 
cognitive tasks such as thresholds of categorization. While 
this would be a nontrivial research program, it may also 
be one of the most effective ways of characterizing under-
lying mechanisms and would also have the advantage of 
helping us to be more precise in specifying which particular 
beliefs are suggested to be either strengthened or weakened 
in which contexts.
Finally, in Tables 2 and 3 we provide a list of potential ways in 
which an emphasis on SEBUS and/or REBUS effects may sug-
gest different use cases for psychedelics and explanations for 
commonly reported psychedelic phenomena. While these specu-
lations are tentatively suggested, we believe they help to illustrate 
what might be at stake in obtaining more detailed models of 
psychedelic action, and also point to additional testable hypothe-
ses. Given the immense potential of these powerful compounds 
for both clinical and basic science, we believe substantial further 
work and funding is warranted to explore the conditions under 
which we might expect relaxed, strengthened, and more generally 
altered beliefs under psychedelics and other varieties of conscious 
experiences.
