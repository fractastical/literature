Supplementary information S1 (box): The entropy of sensory states and their causes 
This box shows that the entropy of hidden states in the environment is bounded by the 
entropy of sensory states. This means that if the entropy of sensory signals is minimised, so 
is the entropy of the environmental states that caused them. For any agent or model 
m  the 
entropy of generalised sensory states 
( ) [ , , , ]Ts t s s s′ ′′=% K  is simply their average surprise

Under ergodic assumptions, this is just the long-term time or path-integral of surprise. We will 
assume sensory states are an analytic function of hidden environmental states plus some 
generalised random fluctuations

        S1.2 
 
Here, hidden states change according to the stochastic differential equations of motion (with 
parameters 
θ ) in S1.2. Because 
x%  and 
z%  are statistically independent, we have (see Eq. 
6.4.6 in Jones 1979, p149)

    S1.3 
 
Here, 
( , ) 0I s z ≥% %  is the mutual information between the sensory states and noise. By Gibb’s 
inequality this cross-entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence is non-negative (Theorem 6.5; 
Jones 1979, p151). This means the entropy of the sensory states is greater than the entropy 
of the sensory mapping. Here. 
x g∂ %  is the sensitivity or gradient of the sensory mapping with 
respect to the hidden states. The integral in S1.3 reflects the fact that entropy is not invariant

to a change of variables and assumes that the sensory mapping 
:g x s→% %   is diffeomorphic 
(i.e., bijective and smooth). This requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the 
same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalised states at an appropriately 
high order. For example, if we had 
n  hidden states in 
m  generalised coordinates of motion, 
we would consider 
m  sensory states in 
n  generalised coordinates; so that

     S1.4 
 
In conclusion, the entropy of hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of sensations, 
assuming their sensitivity to hidden states is constant, over the range of states encountered. 
 
Clearly, the ergodic assumption in S1.1 only holds over certain temporal scales for real 
organisms that are on a trajectory from birth to death. This scale can be somatic (e.g., over 
days or months, where development is locally stationary) or evolutionary (e.g., over 
generations, where evolution is locally stationary).
