1. Introduction 
hronic pain is a significant public health issue, 
affecting approximately 19% of adults in the US, with 
particularly high prevalence among Veterans. Its complex 
nature involves biological, psychological, and socio -
professional factors, making it challenging to treat 
comprehensively. Pharmacological treatments often provide 
limited relief, come with side effects, and fail to address the 
multidimensional aspects of chronic pain, such as 
sensations, emotions, behaviors, and cognitions. This has led 
to a growin g emphasis on non -pharmacological 
interventions, including hypnosis and mindfulness 
meditation, which have shown promise in managing chronic 
pain (1, 2).

Chronic pain is a multifaceted condition that significantly impacts quality of life and 
poses challenges for effective management. Non -pharmacological interventions, 
such as hypnosis and mindfulness meditation, have emerged as promising 
approaches for alle viating pain. This review examines the mechanisms and 
comparative effectiveness of these therapies through the lens of the free energy 
principle, a unifying framework in neuroscience that conceptualizes pain as a 
mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs, resulting in increased free 
energy. Hypnosis operates by leveraging top-down modulation to recalibrate the 
brain's predictive models, thereby reducing the sensory and affective dimensions of 
pain through the targeted engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, mindfulness fosters bottom -up 
sensory processing and acceptance, minimizing prediction errors by engaging the 
anterior insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex to promote emotional regulation and 
sensory integration. Comparative studies, including randomized trials in Veterans, 
demonstrate that both hypnosis and mindfulness provide sustained reductions in pain 
intensity, interference, and associated psychological symptoms, outperf orming 
education-based controls. Hypnosis shows particular efficacy in altering sensory 
pain perception, while mindfulness excels in reducing emotional reactivity to pain. 
By integrating the free energy principle into the neuropsychological model of pain, 
this review highlights how these therapies recalibrate predictive coding processes to 
reduce pain perception. Future research should focus on optimizing these 
interventions and exploring their synergistic potential in clinical settings.

The free energy principle, a unifying theory in 
neuroscience, provides a novel framework for understanding 
how these interventions modulate pain. According to this 
principle, the brain minimizes "free energy" - a measure of 
uncertainty or prediction error- by continuously updating its 
internal models to better predict and adapt to sensory inputs. 
Pain, as a multidimensional experience, can be 
conceptualized as a mismatch between predicted and actual 
sensory inputs, resulting in a heightened perception of fre e 
energy. Hypnosis and mindfulness can be understood as 
interventions that reduce this free energy by recalibrating the 
brain's predictive coding processes, thereby alleviating the 
perception of pain (3). 
2. Hypnosis for Pain Management 
Hypnosis is a cognitive -behavioral technique that 
involves focused attention and suggestion to alter perception 
and experience. It has been shown to reduce pain intensity, 
pain interference, depression, and anxiety, while improving 
quality of life in patie nts with chronic pain (1, 2). Hypnosis 
is effective for both acute procedural pain and chronic pain 
conditions, with benefits observed in both short - and long-
term outcomes. Given its favorable side -effect profile, self-
hypnosis training is considered a viable first -line approach 
for chronic pain management (4). 
3. Mechanisms of Hypnosis: A Free Energy 
Perspective 
From the perspective of the free energy principle, 
hypnosis operates by leveraging top -down modulation to 
recalibrate the brain's predictive models of pain. Through 
focused attention and suggestion, hypnosis creates a state in 
which the brain's expectation s about pain are altered, 
effectively reducing the mismatch between sensory input 
and internal predictions. This process minimizes free energy 
and reduces the perception of pain. 
• Sensory Modulation: Hypnotic suggestions can 
specifically target the sensory dimension of pain, 
leading to changes in activity within the primary 
somatosensory cortex (S1). This modulation 
reduces the intensity of pain perception by altering 
the brain's representation of nociceptive input (5). 
• Affective Modulation: Hypnosis also reduces the 
unpleasantness of pain by modulating the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC), which encodes the 
affective dimension of pain. This dissociation 
between sensory and affective components 
highlights the flexibility of hypnosis in targeting 
different aspects of the pain experience (6). 
• Attention and Control: Hypnosis engages the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region 
involved in attention and executive control. By 
focusing attention away from pain and toward 
hypnotic suggestions, the brain reallocates 
resources to reduce the sa lience of pain signals, 
thereby further minimizing the free energy 
associated with pain  (Faymonville, 2000). 
4. Mindfulness for Pain Management 
Mindfulness meditation focuses on cultivating present -
moment awareness and acceptance of pain without 
emotional reactivity. It has been shown to reduce pain 
intensity and improve mood, sleep, and overall functioning 
in chronic pain conditions (7) (Zeidan, 2016). Unlike 
hypnosis, mindfulness engages brain regions such as the 
orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insular cortex, which are 
associated with cognitive modulation and emotional 
acceptance of pain  (8). 
5. Mechanisms of Mindfulness: A Free Energy 
Perspective 
Mindfulness reduces free energy by fostering bottom -up 
sensory processing and recalibrating the brain's response to 
pain through acceptance and non -reactivity. This approach 
minimizes prediction errors by aligning the brain's 
expectations with the actual s ensory experience of pain, 
thereby reducing the mismatch between the two. 
• Acceptance and Reappraisal: Mindfulness engages 
the anterior insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, 
regions involved in emotional regulation and 
cognitive reappraisal. By promoting acceptance of 
pain, mindfulness reduces the emotional salience of 
pain si gnals, thereby minimizing free energy 
associated with affective distress (8, 9). 
• Attention Regulation: Mindfulness enhances 
activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), 
which is involved in attention regulation and self -
referential processing. This allows individuals to 
observe pain without becoming emotionally 
reactive, reducing t he brain's need to generate 
maladaptive predictions about pain (Zeidan, 2016). 
• Sensory Integration: Mindfulness strengthens 
connectivity between the somatosensory cortex and 
higher-order brain regions, improving the brain's

ability to integrate sensory inputs with internal 
models. This reduces the uncertainty associated 
with pain and aligns sensory processing with 
reality, thereby lowering free energy (10). 
6. Comparative Effectiveness: Insights from 
Research 
A growing body of research has compared the 
effectiveness of hypnosis and mindfulness for chronic pain 
management, highlighting their unique strengths and long -
term benefits: 
1. Veterans Study: A randomized clinical trial 
compared hypnosis (HYP), mindfulness meditation 
(MM), and an active education control (ED) for 
Veterans with chronic pain. Both HYP and MM 
demonstrated sustained benefits in reducing pain 
intensity, pain interfer ence, and depressive 
symptoms at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, while the 
benefits of ED dissipated over time. 
2. Meta-Analyses: Hypnosis has been shown to 
produce moderate to significant analgesic effects in 
both experimental and clinical pain settings, with 
long-term benefits observed in chronic pain 
populations (4, 11). Similarly, mindfulness -based 
interventions have demonstrated improvements in 
pain intensity, depression, and quality of life, 
although their effects are often more minor when 
compared to active control groups (7). 
3. Long-Term Outcomes: Studies have shown that 
self-hypnosis skills are retained by patients up to 12 
months post-treatment, with significant reductions 
in pain intensity and anxiety (12, 13). Mindfulness, 
on the other hand, fosters long -term changes in 
brain connectivity and pain acceptance, which 
contribute to sustained improvements in pain 
outcomes (9). 
4. Combined Interventions: A study comparing self -
hypnosis combined with cognitive -behavioral 
therapy (CBT) to other interventions found that 
hypnosis/CBT led to significant improvements in 
pain intensity, quality of life, and perceived control 
over pain, wit h benefits persisting at 12 -month 
follow-ups (14). 
7. Conclusion 
Hypnosis and mindfulness are effective, non -
pharmacological interventions for mechanical 
musculoskeletal pain, each with unique mechanisms and 
applications. Hypnosis primarily reduces free energy by 
altering sensory and affective pain predictions through 
suggestion-driven modulation, while mindfulness minimizes 
free energy by fostering accepta nce and recalibrating 
sensory processing. The findings from comparative studies 
underscore the sustained benefits of hypnosis and 
mindfulness over time, compared to ed ucation-based 
interventions. Future research should focus on direct 
comparisons in clinical settings and the integration of 
hypnotic and meditative interventions to reduce pain and 
related complications, leveraging the potential for increased 
free energy i n various biopsychosocial systems, in a more 
integrative and practical approach.
