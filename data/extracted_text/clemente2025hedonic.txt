Assigning hedonic value shapes behaviour across organisms, yet how these values translate 
into motivated behaviour remains unclear. We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by 
which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework 
integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes 
wanting—the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes—while variational free energy co 
responds to liking—the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the 
mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition 
and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances.

Hedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform 
hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain 
unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do 
common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival 
mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated 
behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference—a framework in which 
perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue 
that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected 
free energy encodes wanting—the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This 
synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms 
navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits 
that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with 
hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. 
We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic 
processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and 
cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between 
hedonic evaluation and active inference—two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, 
hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in 
adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework 
for investigating cognition and behaviour.

1. Introduction 
Motivated behaviour is usually examined through highly specialised lenses, focusing on 
idiosyncratic biological adaptations, neural processes and cognitive mechanisms. This leads to 
a proliferation of theories specific to particular fields or taxa, with limited prospects for 
unification. Yet, one of the main endeavours of cognitive psychology and neuroscience is to 
unveil general mechanisms of behaviour (Berridge, 2004; Friston, 2010), raising the 
fundamental question: Is there a common mechanism driving behaviour across the spectrum of 
complexity and species? For instance, could the same principles explain a C. elegans orienting 
in a nutrient gradient, an endotherm foraging to maintain metabolic balance and a human 
formulating complex plans to achieve distant goals? 
 
When searching for unifying theories in biology and the behavioural sciences, evolution always 
emerges as a key principle (Gintis, 2007; Mesoudi et al., 2006). To be biologically meaningful, 
behaviour must be adaptive, enhancing the organism s chances of survival and reproduction by 
improving its interaction with the environment. Behavioural mechanisms are shaped by the need 
to ensure ontogenetic and phylogenetic success (Duckworth, 2009; Snell-Rood, 2013). 
 
Adaptive behaviour relies on evaluating the environment—its elements, relationships and 
affordances (Chiel & Beer, 1997; Schwarz, 2007). The fundamental neurobiological process of 
assessing stimuli as beneficial or harmful, rewarding or punishing, is referred to as hedonic 
evaluation. This process underpins the capacity to compare alternatives, make decisions and 
prioritise actions (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2015; Rosenthal, 2017). Whether selecting food, 
choosing a mate or engaging in leisure activities, organisms with a reward system are driven by 
the pursuit of rewards and avoidance of threats (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2008; Friston, 2013; 
Kringelbach, 2005; Rangel et al., 2008). This reward-seeking behaviour has been fundamental 
to brain evolution (Schultz, 2015). Since the emergence of chordates (Cisek, 2022), neurons in 
the reward system compute value signals by integrating sensory input with interoceptive and 
executive information, reflecting the organism's past experiences, states, goals and 
expectations (Rangel et al., 2008), thereby motivating and evaluating behaviour (Berridge & 
Kringelbach, 2013, 2015). 
 
Motivated behaviour unfolds in three interrelated phases, each involving specific mechanisms 
and value signals (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2013; Pessiglione & Lebreton, 2015). In the 
appetitive phase, wanting mechanisms anticipate the reward of behavioural outcomes, guiding 
approach or avoidance, biasing perception towards salient features and modulating neural 
activity in perceptual and cognitive systems. During the consummatory phase, these 
motivational aspects integrate with executive and motor systems to implement behavioural 
choices. Finally, in the satiety phase, liking (and disliking) mechanisms evaluate the behavioural 
outcomes, signalling reward and informing future behaviour through learning (Dayan, 2022).1 
Hedonic values are thus affective states that reward or punish behavioural decisions and inform 
future behaviour (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2015). 
 
Yet, the mechanisms by which the information conveyed by hedonic values is transformed into 
behaviour are not fully understood. For example, how does the pleasurable taste of a fruit urge 
 
1 The processes and mechanisms discussed and proposed in this paper are not necessarily explicit or 
conscious, although they may be accompanied by explicit or conscious experience. Accordingly, we 
primarily refer to (implicit) core wanting (incentive salience) and liking (hedonic impact), as opposed to 
(explicit) conscious wanting (cognitive incentive) and liking (conscious pleasure) (Berridge & Dayan, 
2021).

someone to buy it and someone else to cultivate an orchard? Whereas the former seeks 
immediate, simple reward, the latter engages in a long-term, risky and costly endeavour aiming 
for a future, complex reward. The picture gets even more complicated when multiple hedonic 
values conflict, as when animals explore new environments to seek novel and better resources 
despite facing a greater risk of predation. Hedonic evaluation explains the neuropsychological 
mechanisms of reward, but it does not explain how hedonic values are computed and translated 
into concrete actions. As a result, it fails to make specific predictions about future behaviour. 
This limitation arises because hedonic evaluation lacks a computational mechanism for 
selecting and implementing behavioural choices and, therefore, fails to establish causal 
relationships between hedonic value and actual behaviour. 
 
The most primary behaviours are rooted in the biological imperative to maintain homeostasis, 
driven by evaluative processes that compare the organism’s state with reference values 
(Cannon, 1929). This imperative provides a natural link to action, as deviations from 
homeostatic set points generate hedonic signals that motivate corrective behaviours to restore 
balance (Ramsay & Woods, 2014). For instance, organisms require precise glycaemia ranges, 
experiencing pleasure when approaching them (e.g., eating) and distress when deviating from 
them (e.g., feeling hungry or experiencing indigestion). Importantly, the behaviour to approach 
such preferences depends on the organism and the context of evaluation, as eating may be 
pleasurable when hungry but unpleasant when satiated (Berridge, 1991; Skov, 2023). 
Therefore, quantitative measures capturing the role of hedonic value in motivating behaviour, 
and thus a computational framework for motivated behaviour, must be grounded in comparisons 
with preferences and tailored to embodied, situated behaviour (Roth & Jornet, 2013; Shapiro, 
2011). 
 
The imperative of maintaining homeostasis has long been recognised as central for living 
organisms, with the view that deviations trigger corrective mechanisms through reflexive actions 
(Cannon, 1929). However, recent approaches focus on the anticipatory nature of physiological 
regulation, a process called allostasis (Kleckner et al., 2017; Sterling, 2012). Allostasis implies a 
crucial shift from a reactive to a predictive perspective on the brain, because a predictive brain 
anticipates future events, objects and demands (Clark, 2013). This has two key implications: 
First, the brain projects its preferred future outcomes, generating internal representations of the 
consequences of possible actions (Conant & Ross Ashby, 1970; Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016). 
Second, the brain commands anticipatory actions, namely those that, according to its internal 
model, lead to its preferred outcomes (Wiener, 1948).  
 
These two implications call for an enactive approach whereby the brain does not merely store 
internal models of the world to infer the causes of incoming information but, more 
fundamentally, develops models that enable a dynamic interaction between the organism and 
its environment. Such an interaction entails estimating conditions and affordances upon which it 
may act to fulfil its needs and goals. This perspective brings together two pivotal heritages in 
conceptualising and understanding perception, and the very raison d’être of perception itself 
(Friston, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2024). First, in Helmholtz’s view (von Helmholtz, 1866), 
perception is a process of inference of the causes of the incoming sensory input. The brain 
constantly combines top-down information from an internal generative model and bottom-up 
sensory evidence in order to estimate what is going on in the environment. This view has been 
framed using a proper probabilistic setting in the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Doya et al., 2007; 
Gregory, 1980; Pouget et al., 2013; Rao & Ballard, 1999). Second, in Gibson’s (Gibson, 1986) 
ecological theory of perception, the brain’s primary function is to perceive affordances, i.e., 
chances for action in the environment. In this action-oriented perspective, the brain is directly

tuned to what the environment can offer to the organism without requiring complex internal 
processing. 
 
To meaningfully explain and predict motivated behaviour, a mechanistic framework must 
therefore integrate predictive and enactive perspectives on the brain, proposing a probabilistic 
brain inference account of affordances in Bayes-optimal behaviour (Friston et al., 2006; Kording 
& Wolpert, 2006). Moreover, it must adopt an evolutionary perspective grounded in the simple 
axiom that an organism’s behaviour serves the imperative to survive in its environment (Friston, 
2010). This axiom implies that organisms maintain life by adopting adaptive behaviours that 
bring them to preferred states, reflecting optimal living conditions within their ecological niche 
(Friston et al., 2012; Pezzulo et al., 2015). 
 
Active inference provides a mathematical framework to operationalise such a process (Friston, 
2010). Specifically, in active inference, behaviour reflects the imperative to minimise free 
energy, a proxy for the divergence between actual and preferred states (Friston, 2010; Pezzulo 
et al., 2024). In this article, we demonstrate how a broad range of behaviours can be accounted 
for by integrating hedonic evaluation with the core constructs of active inference, thus providing 
a biologically plausible computational framework for investigating behaviour. We demonstrate 
the potential of the proposed unified framework by modelling behaviour along a continuum, from 
basic allostatic processes shared by all organisms to more complex activities typically deemed 
uniquely human, such as art appreciation. This proposal allows us to bridge the gap and clarify 
the causal relationship between fundamental physiological processes involved in hedonic 
evaluation and action selection, offering a cohesive explanation for the motivational 
underpinnings of behaviour across different levels of complexity. By framing hedonic evaluation 
within active inference, we can better understand how organisms, from simple life forms to 
humans, navigate their environments, make decisions and pursue goals in a way that balances 
immediate rewards with long-term survival and well-being. 
 
We start by deriving a correspondence between the main components of hedonic evaluation, 
namely hedonic impact (core liking or disliking) and incentive salience (core wanting) (Berridge 
& Robinson, 1998), and the three components that guide policy choice in active inference, 
namely free energy, expected free energy and habit (K. Friston et al., 2017). From this 
correspondence, we propose a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation drives behaviour: 
hedonic foraging. Following this exposition, we showcase hedonic foraging with a series of 
example scenarios to illustrate its suitability to account for a continuum of behaviours. We argue 
that hedonic foraging ascribes complex cognitive functions such as appreciating art to the set of 
behaviours already accounted for by active inference, therefore welding core biological 
mechanisms and sophisticated cultural pursuits. We next discuss hedonic foraging in relation to 
existing proposals and the implications and contributions of the framework. To conclude, we 
emphasise the consequences and potential of a unifying, enactive and embodied computational 
mechanistic framework for understanding cognition and behaviour.

2. Hedonic foraging: Hedonic evaluation as 
active inference 
As previously outlined, the processes by which hedonic evaluation, a core motivational process, 
translates into a framework for understanding and predicting behaviour remain undefined. In 
particular, there is no clear mechanism for computing distinct hedonic values, integrating them 
and guiding behaviour over time. To fill this fundamental gap and understand motivated 
behaviour, we propose mapping hedonic evaluation onto the constructs of active inference, a 
principled theory that explains and predicts embodied cognition and behaviour (Friston, 2010; 
Pezzulo et al., 2024). The central move is to express the role of hedonic evaluation in 
monitoring and motivating free energy minimisation. 
 
Free energy minimisation is at the core of active inference. The theory stems from the truism 
that organisms must maintain their bodily parameters within some limits to stay alive. This 
pursuit is framed using the concept of surprise2 (Friston, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2024). Surprising 
observations (e.g., exteroceptive, interoceptive, proprioceptive) are those that deviate from 
reference observations, which are called preferences and reflect the range of values that are 
characteristic and beneficial for an organism’s functioning (Friston, 2010). In active inference, 
preferences are modelled as expectations about observations reflecting states of the world 
aligned with the organism’s needs and goals. Surprise thus corresponds to prediction errors 
when such expectations are not met. Active inference posits that a single, unified principle 
drives behaviour: the imperative of minimising surprise, or, more precisely, minimising a 
tractable proxy of surprise called free energy (Friston, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2024) (Box 1).  
 
An organism minimises free energy through a process of inference based on a generative 
model, namely a probabilistic mapping between hidden states of the world 𝑠 and their 
associated observations 𝑜. The (true) states of the world are called hidden because the 
organism may not have direct access to the true unfolding process—the generative process—
occurring in the world (Box 1). Instead, the organism relies on observations to infer the 
underlying states. Following the tradition of perception as inference—originating with Helmholtz 
and further developed in the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Doya et al., 2007; Gregory, 1980; Rao 
& Ballard, 1999; von Helmholtz, 1866)—, the inference process is conceived as an inversion of 
the generative model, estimating the most likely states of the environment given observations.  
 
Active inference extends Bayesian theories by incorporating action into the inference process. 
In this framework, the brain does not merely infer causes passively; it also generates actions to 
minimise discrepancies between predicted and actual observations. To minimise surprise and 
maintain their preferred states, organisms continuously invert their generative model, comparing 
predicted observations with actual observations, to actively reduce the gap between expected 
and observed outcomes. This surprise-minimisation process drives both perception—updating 
beliefs as in the tradition of perception as inference (von Helmholtz, 1866)—and action—
modifying the environment to achieve preferred outcomes (Friston, 2010; Gallagher, 2017). 
Consequently, active inference is inherently enactive, incorporating action into the inference 
process to enable adaptive behaviour in a dynamic world (Friston, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2024; 
Ramstead et al., 2020). For example, organisms cannot survive outside a specific range of 
glycaemic levels, and deviation with respect to their preferred (physiologically ideal) range

align with the concept of psychological surprise.

constitutes a surprising state. They do not have direct access to their actual glucose index as 
reported by a physical glucometer but sense its effects (e.g., hunger) through interoceptive 
mechanisms involving the hypothalamus (Marty et al., 2007). Feeding is the action directed at 
restoring preferred glycaemic levels. 
 
While active inference proposes a computational mechanism by which behaviour emerges from 
the drive to reach preferred states, hedonic evaluation provides organisms with information 
about the expected (wanting) and resulting (liking) values of behaviours to guide future actions 
(Dayan, 2022). Both the will and action of approaching preferences are positively signalled (e.g., 
the desire and pleasure of eating) whereas departing from preferences is negatively signalled 
(e.g., the displeasure of being hungry). In this proposal, we integrate hedonic evaluation and 
active inference to derive a general theory of how hedonic value motivates behaviour, and 
illustrate how the proposed framework, hedonic foraging, enables predicting behaviour. In the 
remainder of this section, we establish correspondences between the main components of 
hedonic evaluation and active inference, which form the foundation of our proposal, ultimately 
leading to hedonic foraging as a unified framework for understanding behaviour. 
2.1. Hedonic impact (core liking) as variational free energy 
From an active inference perspective, organisms seek states that best match their preferences 
(Friston, 2010). When an organism is closer to its preferred (expected) states, it experiences 
less surprise and hence reduced variational free energy (VFE). From the perspective of hedonic 
evaluation, these states are rewarding (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2013; Pessiglione & Lebreton, 
2015).  
 
We propose that VFE can thus be considered as a quantitative measure of hedonic impact or 
core liking (Box 1). This step constitutes our proposal’s first and central component to build a 
framework that casts hedonic evaluation onto active inference. 
 
As an illustration, consider a predator that expects to be in the adaptive state of satiation. When 
the predator is hungry, this discrepancy leads to prediction errors in its brain. This mismatch 
between the actual (hunger) and desired observation (satiety) is associated with high free 
energy. As the animal eats, this mismatch decreases, reducing VFE and eliciting a rewarding 
sensation. Similarly, when a person listens to Western classical music, they may experience 
pleasure when a perfect cadence resolves to the tonic. This fulfilment of expectations after the 
uncertainty introduced by the dominant chord corresponds to a state of lower VFE and a 
pleasurable listening experience (Cheung et al., 2019; Gold et al., 2019; Koelsch, Vuust, et al., 
2019). In both examples, VFE provides a measure for the hedonic impact (liking) of the chosen 
behaviour. Such a quantitative reference is crucial to compare and motivate behaviour.

Box 1. Formalisation of the active inference components of hedonic foraging 
 
Variational free energy 
Active inference builds on the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain has an internal generative model of the 
world. This generative model encodes how outcomes arise from hidden causes in the environment, providing a stochastic 
mapping between a representation of the states of the world 𝑠 and observations 𝑜. Importantly, the causal structure of the 
world—the generative process that describes how 𝑜 is caused by the true state of the world 𝑠 ∗—which may be hidden, i.e., not 
directly accessible to the organism (Illustration 1a). According to the Bayesian brain hypothesis, the organism infers the likely 
causes of observations by inverting its generative model using Bayes’ rule 𝑃(𝑠|𝑜) = 𝑃(𝑠)𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)/𝑃(𝑜). 
 
 
Illustration 1. a. Formalism in active inference (adapted from (Parr et al., 2022). b. Illustration of the correspondence between preference and 
surprise, with preference here driven by the homeostatic reference temperature in endotherms. 
Active inference extends the Bayesian brain hypothesis with three crucial additions: First, the brain does not passively infer the 
causes of sensory input; it goes beyond perception to include action by actively inferring the best actions to take based on its 
internal model and sensory data. Second, and centrally, this inference process encompassing perception and action is governed 
by the imperative to minimise the deviation between actual sensory observations and preferred (i.e., expected) observations. 
This deviation is called surprise and quantified using information theoretic surprise: 𝒮(𝑜) = −𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑜), where 𝑃 is the prior 
preference distribution. It is also called prediction error as it reflects the organism s drive to predict and sense what it prefers 
(Illustration 1b). Minimising surprise directly is often intractable, however, as the process requires inverting the brain’s 
generative model and hence computing the posterior distribution of all possible hidden states given sensory observations. Third, 
to address this, the brain employs a proxy for surprise, free energy, enabling a computationally tractable alternative for 
minimising surprise. This is done by substituting 𝑃(𝑠|𝑜) by an approximate posterior 𝑄(𝑠), and surprise by variational free 
energy (VFE) 𝐹, which can be expressed as the functional  
 
𝐹[𝑄, 𝑜] = 𝐷𝐾𝐿 (𝑄(𝑠) ∥ 𝑃(𝑠|𝑜)) − 𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑜),                    (Eq 1)                            
 
where the first term, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, measures the dissimilarity between the approximate distribution 𝑄(𝑠) 
and the true posterior 𝑃(𝑠|𝑜). The inference process amounts to minimising VFE. As the KL divergence is always non-negative, 
Equation 1 shows that VFE is an upper bound to surprise and that there are two ways of minimising VFE: Minimising the first 
term, namely getting 𝑄 closer to the true posterior over states, corresponds to perceptual inference. Alternatively, the second 
term can be minimised by acting to change the sensory observation 𝑜. Together, active inference is the minimisation of VFE 
through perception and action with the aim for the organism to stay within or reach preferred states, as defined by its generative 
model. 
 
Expected free energy 
Planning a sequence of actions involves representing the expected future observations they will produce. In active inference, 
this process is guided by expected free energy (EFE), a forward-looking extension of VFE that predicts the future free energy an 
agent anticipates experiencing under a given sequence of actions (called a policy). EFE decomposes into terms capturing 
epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (goal-directed outcomes) as

where 𝐺𝜋 is the expected free energy 𝐺 of policy 𝜋 (see Schwartenbeck et al., 2019, for details). In a discrete setting, behaviour 
is guided by selecting policies with the greatest potential of minimising variational free energy in the future among a finite set of 
options. This ensures the organism to integrate effectively exploration and exploitation to reduce VFE given current knowledge. 
 
Habit 
In active inference, habit represents the influence of past experience when selecting a policy. It is simply represented as a 
distribution of probability 𝐸 = (𝐸𝜋) over all possible policies.

2.2. Incentive salience (core wanting) as expected free energy 
While a reference measure for hedonic impact is necessary to understand motivated behaviour, 
it is not sufficient to predict it and thus explain how hedonic evaluation motivates behaviour. The 
reason is simple: VFE is retrospective; it evaluates incoming observations a posteriori and thus 
refers to past and present states. However, for planning and decision-making, an organism 
needs to infer the most effective future action or sequence of actions (hereafter referred to as 
policies) that generate observations yielding the most positive hedonic value, which are 
signalled by the lowest VFE. This cannot be done by simply considering past and current 
observations because actions must be chosen to bring about preferred observations in the 
future. To infer optimal policies, the organism must predict sequences of future states and 
observations and, for each possible policy, estimate its resulting VFE, that is, compute its 
expected free energy (EFE) (Box 1). The prospective nature of EFE enables organisms to 
evaluate and select policies based on their impact on future states. EFE extends VFE to 
account for planning, decision-making, exploration and curiosity, making it central to active 
inference as a theory of goal-directed behaviour (Friston et al., 2015; K. J. Friston et al., 2017; 
Schwartenbeck et al., 2019). 
 
We propose EFE as a quantitative measure of incentive salience or core wanting. This 
constitutes the second component of our proposal (Box 1). EFE consists of two key elements: 
pragmatic value and epistemic value (Box 1, Eq 2).  
 
Minimising the pragmatic term of EFE (Eq 2 in Box 2) maximises the pragmatic value, that is, 
the expected utility or reward associated with a future state consequence of the organism’s 
policy. This aspect of EFE evaluates future outcomes (i.e., observations in the future resulting 
from policies) according to the extent to which they would fulfil the organism’s goal—i.e., how 
close they would bring the organism to its preference. By maximising pragmatic value, 
organisms avoid adverse outcomes and maximise immediate reward, therefore driving 
exploitative behaviour (K. Friston et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2019). For example, the 
anticipation of eating a prey enhances the likelihood of hunting it for a predator. Similarly, the 
anticipation of enjoying live music motivates people to go to a concert. In other words, hedonic 
evaluation tells us that organisms want what they believe they will like, and active inference 
reveals the causal relationship underlying their choice of the policy expected to best achieve 
their desired outcome. 
 
Minimising the epistemic term of expected free energy (Eq 2 in Box 2) maximises epistemic 
value, which represents the expected information gain of each policy. This drives explorative 
behaviour by favouring policies that maximise knowledge about the world, resolving 
uncertainties about the environment and minimising prediction error. In our proposal, the 
epistemic component relates to incentive salience by driving the pursuit of information that 
reduces uncertainty about the environment, even in the absence of immediate reward 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2019). For example, a predator can explore new territories to improve 
access to higher-quality or more abundant prey, just as humans might seek out new artists or 
venues to enhance future musical experiences. 
 
In summary, minimising EFE embodies incentive motivation by increasing the likelihood of 
choosing policies that lead to outcomes with more positive hedonic value, both in the short and 
long term. This minimisation can be naturally cast onto core wanting (Berridge & Dayan, 2021; 
Berridge & Kringelbach, 2015), capturing the dual motivational pull of securing rewarding 
outcomes and fostering learning.

Box 2. Hedonic foraging in discrete time using POMDPs 
For simplicity, we formalise hedonic foraging in discrete time1 using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP, 
henceforth; (Malekzadeh & Plataniotis, 2024; Spaan, 2012) (Illustration 2), a formal structure widely used in active inference to model 
organisms (or, more generally, agents) operating under environmental uncertainty and partial observability (Smith et al., 2022). This 
framework captures the interaction between an organism’s generative model (its internal representation of the world) and the 
generative process (the actual dynamics of the environment) (Box 1). Under the free-energy principle, decision-making unfolds as the 
organism updates its beliefs about hidden states (𝑠𝑡), which evolve over discrete time steps, with the objective of minimising EFE. 
Actions are selected based on policies (series of actions) that maximise the probability of achieving preferred outcomes, or 
observations (𝑜𝑡). These observations can include exteroceptive, proprioceptive or interoceptive sensory input, as well as cognitive 
representations. 
 
 
 
Illustration 2. Basic formalism of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). 
 
By minimising EFE, the organism achieves preferred outcomes (pragmatic value) and continuously refines its generative model, 
improving predictions while selecting actions that reduce uncertainty (epistemic value). The dynamics of a POMDP—and each scenario 
in Section 3—are specified in terms of a set of matrices or tensors (𝑨, 𝑩, 𝑪) and vectors (𝐷, 𝐸) representing the alignment between 
the generative model and the generative process. When they align, the organism’s generative model exactly captures the generative 
process leading to its observations—although uncertainty about initial states and stochasticity between states and observations may 
still exist. When they do not align, the organism can learn the generative process through repeated observations in a process akin to 
Hebbian learning (e.g. see preference learning in Figure 3b). 
 
Hedonic foraging is thus described by the iteration of two steps: First, the organism selects a policy according to the prior distribution 
over policies 𝜎(𝑙𝑛𝐸 − 𝛾𝐺), which combines habit and EFE to represent the “value” of all the policies as a discrete probability 
distribution—here, 𝜎 is a softmax function 𝜎(𝑥)𝜋 = 𝑒−𝛼𝑥𝜋 /∑
𝑘
𝑒−𝛼𝑥𝑘  for 𝑥 = (𝑥𝜋), 𝛼 is a temperature parameter that controls action 
precision (as high values increase the differences between entries), and 𝛾 is the EFE precision parameter that encodes the organism’s 
confidence in the ability of EFE to predict VFE. The second step is given by the posterior probability distribution over policies 𝜎(𝑙𝑛𝐸 −
𝛾𝐺 − 𝐹), which combines habit, EFE and the VFE resulting from the new observations.  
 
When these two steps are completed, two key processes take place: First, the EFE precision parameter is updated based on the 
agreement between the prior and the posterior, with an increase in precision (𝛾) when they align (Sales et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2022). 
Second, all learning parameters in the model are updated. This learning process resembles Hebbian learning, as it relies on 
coincidence detection. For instance, if the habit component is subject to learning, its weight in the habit probability distribution 𝐸𝜋0  
increases every time a specific policy 𝜋0 leads to a positive outcome. Consequently, this policy becomes more likely to be selected in 
the future. 
 
Importantly, the influence of wanting in guiding behaviour is modulated by its capacity to lead to liking after the consequences of a 
selected policy have been experienced and evaluated. As implemented in active inference, the contribution of EFE in defining the prior 
is weighed by the confidence the organism places in its ability to predict rewarding behaviour, that is, in minimising VFE. To this end, 
the prior is computed using the distribution over policies 𝑙𝑛𝐸𝜋 − 𝛾𝐺𝜋, where 𝛾 is the precision parameter that encodes the organism’s 
confidence in EFE estimates (Box 1). Every time new observations are received, the precision parameter is updated. If the posterior 
carried by VFE aligns with EFE—i.e., the policy with lower EFE before any observation was available corresponds to the one that 
actually leads to a reduction in VFE—, 𝛾 increases. The organism is then more confident in the beliefs provided by 𝐺𝜋, and the impact 
of EFE (wanting) in guiding behaviour grows. The opposite happens when the VFE of the resulting observations is inconsistent with the 
estimate provided by EFE, in which case the confidence of the organism in its beliefs brought by 𝐺𝜋 decreases. Dopamine release 
signals such confidence in policy selection (Bogacz, 2020; FitzGerald et al., 2015; Friston et al., 2012) by ramping according to wanting 
in the appetitive phase (Box 1).

2022).

2.3. Learned hedonic values as habits 
 
In active inference, learning occurs at multiple time scales (Friston et al., 2016). A particularly 
interesting form of learning emerges from repeated behaviour, which may—although does not 
necessarily—result from consistently selecting policies that have proven beneficial in the past 
(Thorndike, 1911). Habits emerge from a history of repeated behaviours, reflecting the role of 
past actions and their associated hedonic values in motivating future behaviour (Seger & 
Spiering, 2011) (Box 1).  
 
As such, habit constitutes an essential drive, capturing long-term associations between 
expectations and outcomes to complete the map of interrelations between hedonic values and 
the constructs of active inference. While EFE drives goal-directed behaviour, characterised by 
adaptive flexibility to environmental contingencies (Dayan, 2009), habit accounts for recurrent 
behaviour defined by past reinforcements but possibly unrelated to current hedonic values; 
being thus automatic, computationally efficient and inflexible (Dolan & Dayan, 2013). 
 
Habit formation provides adaptive advantages, as habits may maximise efficiency in policy 
selection for recurrent scenarios when there is little evidence from data, as they minimise 
energetic costs and risks when the available options are invariable and no further exploration is 
required or desired (Dayan, 2009; Dolan & Dayan, 2013). For example, the habit of visiting a 
particular location at a particular time of day or year when prey is abundant can be greatly 
beneficial for a predator as it does not have to spend energy and take risks to find it. Similarly, 
the habit of attending concerts at a known venue may increase the odds to enjoy a pleasurable 
musical experience, as the listener has learned that previous experiences have been 
consistently pleasurable. 
2.4. Motivated behaviour as hedonic foraging 
 
The central idea of this proposal is that the mechanisms of motivated behaviour can be 
characterised as an interaction between habit, EFE minimisation (wanting) and VFE 
minimisation (liking). First, policy selection depends on the combination of habits ( , reflecting a 
history of previous policy selections and their resulting hedonic impacts: liking or disliking) and 
expected free energy ( , corresponding to wanting for available policies). Then, the selected 
policy leads to new observations, whose VFE ( , corresponding to liking or disliking the 
resulting outcomes) is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy. In this way, the hedonic 
components of habit and wanting define the prior expectations over policies, while their 
combination with liking determines the posterior for the selected policy, which in turn will inform 
subsequent priors. We refer to Box 2 for a detailed formalisation of hedonic foraging. 
 
Hedonic foraging can thus be understood as navigating a free energy landscape (Figure 1), 
using the probabilities of selecting actions provided by habits and EFE as a compass, with 
continual adjustments informed by the VFE resulting from each policy. At each step, the 
organism chooses a policy that optimises, with some stochastic variability, a balance between 
habit and wanting. After each policy, the organism evaluates the VFE based on the resulting 
observations, which is reflected in a degree of liking or disliking. This hedonic evaluation then 
updates the active inference process, modulating the organism’s habits and wanting and, more 
generally, refining the generative model that guides its actions. Behaviour thus unfolds 
iteratively, with each iteration consisting of these two interdependent stages (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Hedonic foraging schematic: Free energy and reward landscape in thermoregulation 
As endotherm organisms, humans must keep their body temperature within a specific range. Cold, in particular, 
poses a significant threat, as prolonged exposure is life-threatening. The unpleasant sensation of cold increases the 
motivation (wanting) to restore body temperature. Various policies differ in their effectiveness, effort and time required 
to achieve this goal. For example, a hiker suddenly confronted with an unpleasant cold sensation but not taking any 
action (𝜋1) would likely remain cold, further intensifying the unpleasant sensation (as VFE increases). However, she 
may take action to reach a more beneficial state. For instance, she could light a fire (𝜋2) to raise her body 
temperature quickly, providing an immediate but transient reward (as VFE decreases), since her body temperature 
drops again when the fire extinguishes, again eliciting the unpleasant sensation of cold (as VFE increases). 
Alternatively, she may consider the more elaborated, time-wise and energy-wise costly, deeper policy (𝜋3) of building 
a shelter (initially increasing VFE and hence discomfort) before lighting a fire, ultimately leading to a greater and more 
lasting reward (as VFE decreases). Overall, the first policy (𝜋1) would be disliked while the second (𝜋2) would be 
mildly liked and the third (𝜋3) would be strongly liked. By monitoring policies and their expected and experienced 
hedonic values at each time step, organisms can learn embodied associations between (series of) actions and 
outcomes, using this knowledge to guide future decisions and behaviours.

Hedonic foraging casts behaviour as a balance between habits and EFE with the aim to 
minimise VFE, leading to various scenarios. In simpler cases, one component may dominate 
when the others are indifferent to the outcome of a new policy: e.g., a habit may drive behaviour 
when all options are equally appealing and there is no incentive salience for learning—the 
distribution of expectations of EFE is flat. In more complex cases, a chosen policy may reflect a 
trade-off between competing components: e.g., when habitual behaviour conflicts with the drive 
for epistemic exploration. In the next section, we illustrate the scope of our proposal across a 
range of scenarios.

3. A continuum of behaviours through hedonic 
foraging 
 
In this section, we demonstrate that a continuum of behaviours can be captured within the 
single, unifying framework of hedonic foraging. To achieve this, we simulate behaviour across 
four illustrative scenarios. The model’s architecture and the computational mechanisms that 
govern behaviour are the same across scenarios. This consistency is the basis for describing 
the model as accounting for a continuum of behaviours. Only the parameters of the generative 
models and the generative processes are specific to each behavioural scenario.  
 
The following set of mappings defines the generative models characterising all scenarios: The 
first matrix (or tensor, 𝑨 in Box 2) maps hidden states to observable outcomes. This mapping is 
probabilistic, providing the likelihood of a particular observation given the true state of the world. 
For example (Figure 1, Illustration 1b in Box 1), a state of hypothermia leads to the sensation 
of cold most of the time but not always. The second mapping (𝑩 in Box 2) describes the 
probabilistic transitions between hidden states from the present to the next time step, depending 
on each action taken. In the example in Figure 1, not moving keeps the agent in the state of 
hypothermia, whereas looking for shelter entails transitioning to the state of normothermia with a 
probability of 0.8. Finally, the preference matrix (𝑪 in Box 2) is central as it encodes the agent’s 
desired outcomes as probability distributions, fundamentally shaping the VFE landscape and, 
consequently, the EFE. In this example, the organism has a strong (adaptive) preference for 
staying in the reference (homeostatic) state of normothermia, which translates into positive 
hedonic values (desire, reward) for such reference state and negative hedonic values 
(avoidance, punishment) for the states of hypo- and hyperthermia.  
 
In the POMDP-based scenarios presented below, the behaviour of the simulated organism 
emerges dynamically from the interaction between the three components of hedonic foraging. 
Hedonic foraging is characterised as the stochastic evolution of the organism’s states and 
observations, driven by the combined influence of all POMDP factors—including observation 
mappings, state transitions, habits and preferences—, each constraining the organism’s choices 
in response to its environment. The code implementation and detailed description of each 
scenario are publicly accessible at

Scenario 1: Allostasis 
 
In this scenario, we simulate how hedonic foraging accounts for the fundamental process of 
allostasis in a simple setting: glycoregulation (López-Gambero et al., 2019; Roh et al., 2016). An 
organism can be in one of three physiological states: hypoglycaemia, normoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia. It estimates these states through interoceptive observations: the sensations of 
hunger, satiety and indigestion, respectively. The mapping between hidden states and 
sensations can be noisy, meaning that a true state does not always align perfectly with its usual 
sensation (e.g., hypoglycaemia can be perceived as satiety). The organism iteratively chooses 
between two actions: eating increases the likelihood of transitioning to a higher glycaemic state 
(from hypoglycaemia to normoglycaemia and from normoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia) 
whereas resting increases the likelihood of transitioning to a lower glycaemic state (from 
hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia and from normoglycaemia to hypoglycaemia). Ultimately, 
the organism strongly prefers satiety (normoglycaemia). As a result of hedonic foraging, the 
organism’s feeding cycle emerges from the imperative to reach the preferred state and avoid 
surprise (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Allostasis (glycoregulation) 
In this instance of glycemia regulation, the organism starts in normoglycemia (𝑡1). When its glycemic level decays 
(𝑡2), it enters a hypoglycaemic state and hence feels hungry, so it starts eating (𝑡3) to reach a normoglycemic state 
and feel satiated. Eating in normoglycemia (𝑡4) leads to hyperglycaemia, with the accompanying sensation of 
indigestion. Resting (𝑡5) leads to progressive decay in glycemic level until reaching the preferred normoglycemic 
state, which progressively decays into a hypoglycaemic state, triggering eating again (𝑡6). The left panels show how a 
feeding cycle emerges from the goal of maintaining normoglycemia as long as possible. Here, dots represent the 
hidden state (a), the chosen action (b) and the resulting observation (c) at each time step. The process is not 
deterministic, so the organism can, for example, keep eating even when satiated. The policy choices are driven by 
hedonic foraging, with the greatest reward resulting from eating when feeling hungry. The right panels show the 
dynamics of wanting (𝐺, b), liking (𝐹, d) and hedonic foraging (f), with lower expected free energy corresponding to 
higher expected reward and variational free energy corresponding to actual reward: the choices converge into a 
stable policy (𝜋16) yielding maximum global hedonic value.

Scenario 2: Statistical learning and preference formation 
 
Statistical learning is the process by which an organism implicitly learns regularities in sensory 
input, shaping future expectations (Turk-Browne, 2012). When an input aligns well with learned 
patterns, this match triggers a positive affective response, as the sensory-cognitive systems are 
particularly suited to processing familiar features efficiently (Bornstein & Dagostino, 1992; Reber 
et al., 1998). Statistical learning thus subserves mere exposure effects, which refer to a 
tendency to develop liking for stimuli as a function of familiarity (Zajonc, 1968). These effects 
are shared with other animals and have been extensively demonstrated in humans to influence 
the hedonic evaluation of a broad range of stimuli, from food (Birch & Marlin, 1982; Pliner, 1982) 
to music (Pereira et al., 2011) and artworks (Leder, 2003; Reber et al., 2004).  
 
This scenario exposes a simple link between statistical learning and preference formation. Here, 
an organism freely chooses among three equally preferred locations. Two contain stimulus A 
while the other contains a different but equally rewarding stimulus B. That is, the organism has 
no initial preference for either stimulus or location over the other. Without any incentive to favour 
a specific location, stimulus A is twice as likely to be encountered. According to the mere 
exposure effect, a greater exposure reinforces preference for stimulus A over B. As the 
organism progressively learns the frequency of each stimulus and where to encounter them, the 
pursuit of reward creates a feedback loop in which frequent visits to locations with the preferred 
stimulus strengthen the preference for that stimulus, further increasing the likelihood of 
returning. This behaviour ultimately leads to establishing a habit of visiting the locations typically 
containing the preferred stimulus.

Figure 3. Statistical learning and formation of familiarity-driven preferences  
In this example, the organism initially has no preference between stimulus A and B, leading to random choices. Over 
time, it learns the frequency and locations of each stimulus: A appears in 2/3 of locations while B does in 1/3. Even if 
the agent first encounters B (𝑡0), it quickly infers that A is more frequent and shifts its preference accordingly, 
increasing visits to A-associated locations (𝑡>1). Hedonic foraging drives behaviour by selecting policies (dots in a) 
that maximise reward according to updated beliefs about reward probability (trajectories for each stimulus in b).

Scenario 3: Bias and curiosity 
 
Hedonic evaluation is context-dependent (Berridge, 1991; Lim, 2011; Skov, 2023). Through 
statistical learning, organisms identify regularities in spatial and temporal co-occurrences (Turk-
Browne, 2012) and develop preferences for familiar patterns, as shown in Scenario 2. 
Consequently, preferences for specific stimuli can be biased by their co-occurrence with other 
stimuli or contextual features with enhanced evaluative salience (Lopez-Persem et al., 2016). 
For instance, the white cube effect refers to a tendency to prefer artworks displayed in 
museums over those encountered in public spaces (Brieber et al., 2015; Gartus & Leder, 2014). 
However, curiosity (Gottlieb & Oudeyer, 2018; Kidd & Hayden, 2015) can counteract such 
biases. This mitigating effect of curiosity is accounted for in hedonic foraging, which 
incorporates curiosity via the epistemic term of expected free energy—fostering wanting to 
explore unknown aspects of the environment to reduce uncertainty (Schwartenbeck et al., 
2019). 
 
In this scenario, an organism (e.g., a museum visitor) can choose between two contexts leading 
to equally pleasurable stimuli (e.g., a particular artwork). The organism prefers one of the 
contexts (e.g., a museum over a metro station) because it has statistically, culturally or socially 
learned that the stimuli associated with this context are usually more rewarding than those 
typically present in the other context. The incentive motivation (𝐺 in Box 1) or habit (𝑬 in Box 1 
and Box 2) to visit the preferred context more often bias the hedonic impact (𝐹 in Box 1) of 
stimuli in that context, thus enhancing their preference (𝑪 in Box 2) or reinforcing the habit of 
visiting that context (𝑬 in Box 1 and Box 2). Figure 4 shows contrasting levels of curiosity and 
demonstrates that more curious organisms visit the less-preferred context more often (Figure 
4a as opposed to Figure 4b), resulting in bias reduction and even bias reversal, as these 
individuals have the opportunity to evaluate the stimuli in their own right.

19 of 41 
Figure 4. Interplay between bias and curiosity 
In this example, contexts 1 and 2 contain the same stimulus. The organism has an initial bias (preference) for context 
1, even if it starts visiting context 2 due to the stochasticity of policy choice (𝑡0). Hedonic foraging guides behaviour, 
with policy selection (top panels) maximising reward based on updated beliefs about reward probability (bottom 
panels). a. When the curiosity to explore other contexts is low, the agent visits context 1 more frequently (top panel) 
because it believes this context yields greater reward, which in turn reinforces this belief (bottom panel). b. By 
contrast, higher curiosity counteracts this bias, as exploration allows the agent to experience the same stimuli in both 
contexts and evaluate them in their own right. Increased exploration reveals that stimulus value is context-
independent, leading to more balanced use of both contexts and the vanishing of prior biases.

Scenario 4: Insight, Erlebnis and “Aha” experiences 
 
Ambiguous stimuli elicit unstable percepts (Klink et al., 2012). From the predictive coding 
perspective within active inference, uncertainty generates prediction error (Cheung et al., 2019; 
Gold & Shadlen, 2007; Koelsch, Bashevkin, et al., 2019; Ross & Hansen, 2016). Organisms 
seek to resolve such uncertainty and thus reduce prediction error, deriving reward from the 
process. When this understanding occurs suddenly, with a feeling of ease and certainty 
(Topolinski & Reber, 2010), usually requiring only a few observations and favoured by curious 
behaviour (K. J. Friston et al., 2017), it is called insight, Erlebnis or “Aha” experience. Gaining 
insight or understanding can occur exogenously, through external cues or explicit information, or 
endogenously, through internal reasoning or exploration—each with a distinct probability of 
success. Organisms vary in their preferences for seeking insight either exogenously or 
endogenously and in their ability to gain insight with or without external cues—see (Kounios & 
Beeman, 2014) for a review of the cognitive neuroscience of insight in humans and 
(Shettleworth, 2012) for a discussion of the phenomenon in other animals with a brain.  
 
This scenario shows how individual ability and relative preference for exogenous or endogenous 
insight guides an organism’s behaviour. It can be situated, for example, in a museum where 
visitors choose whether to consult the labels accompanying the artworks (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Preference for endogenous vs exogenous insight 
An organism is presented with an ambiguous stimulus about which it seeks to gain insight. This can be achieved 
through two strategies: exogenously, by consulting external information, which increases the probability of insight, or 
endogenously, relying on internal processing with a lower probability of insight. Organisms also exhibit individual 
variability in preference for endogenous over exogenous insight, as well as distinct ability (probability) to gain insight 
(circled dots) through each modality (0.6 for exogenous and 0.4 for endogenous across panels). Hedonic foraging 
captures how such traits determine individual behaviour (dots represent chosen actions in the upper panels, while the 
lower panels depict the evolution of beliefs about the relative probabilities of gaining insight). a. When the preference 
for endogenous insight is significantly stronger than the preference for exogenous insight, the expected reward 
outweighs the risk of not getting insight, leading the organism to disregard external information and trust its own 
capability more often. b. When the preference for endogenous insight is not strong enough to compensate for the risk 
of not getting insight, both strategies are more balanced. c. If there is no preference for endogenous insight, the 
organism prioritises gaining insight, relying more frequently on exogenous facilitation.

4. Contextualising hedonic foraging 
 
In this section, we review theoretical frameworks and computational models that explore the 
relationships between hedonic evaluation—along with the related concepts of emotional valence 
and affective value—and motivated behaviour. We categorise these approaches into those 
grounded in active inference and those based on alternative theoretical paradigms. For each 
approach, we highlight its core principles, summarise its key findings and evaluate how it relates 
to hedonic foraging. 
 
4.1. Emotion, affect and epistemic curiosity 
 
Theories and models built on active inference that aim to establish principled links between 
hedonic value and behaviour have primarily focused on the subjective emotional impact of 
experiences—specifically, on emotional valence, the positive or negative quality of emotion. 
Joffily and Coricelli (Joffily & Coricelli, 2013) proposed an association of emotional valence with 
the rate of change of VFE. As in hedonic foraging, their framework introduces a meta-
construction in that it applies to any active inference process independently of the underlying 
specific generative model. In their proposal, emotional valence emerges from the dynamics of 
VFE, tracked through its first and second derivatives. These dynamics are directly tied to the 
organism’s adaptation to its environment. In contrast to hedonic foraging, the association 
between emotional valence and free energy in Joffily and Coricelli’s proposal was not extended 
to action, limiting its ability to explain or predict motivated behaviour. The reason is that this 
framework predated the development of EFE in active inference, which provides a formal 
mechanism to link affective states with action selection (Friston et al., 2015). 
 
Emotional valence and adaptive behaviour have also been connected through active inference 
via the theory of constructed emotion, which posits that emotions emerge as holistic, context-
dependent brain-body phenomena (Barrett, 2017). This theory highlights the role of predictive 
processes in constructing emotional experiences, with the brain dynamically modelling internal 
and external states to regulate the body (allostasis) and interpret sensory inputs. As part of this 
process, emotional valence reflects the brain s predictions about bodily and environmental 
changes. Hesp and colleagues (Hesp et al., 2021) extended this framework by introducing 
affective charge, a computational perspective that incorporates meta-cognition, explicitly linking 
confidence in action selection to affective valence and subjective fitness through second-order 
beliefs—i.e., beliefs about beliefs. Affective charge can therefore be understood as a (signed) 
reward prediction error, where positive prediction errors increase the agent’s confidence in its 
action model and vice versa (Hesp et al., 2021). Hedonic foraging, by contrast, emphasises the 
direct role of habit, wanting and liking in shaping behaviour. In sum, affective charge highlights 
the intrinsic link between affect, implicit metacognition and action, where biological systems infer 
and regulate their own affective states, while hedonic foraging focuses on the primary forces 
driving behavioural choices. The idea of affective charge can be integrated into the hedonic 
foraging framework as second-order monitoring of reward maximisation, i.e., of free energy 
minimisation. 
 
The relationship between uncertainty reduction and positive hedonic value—or reward—has 
also been explored as a mechanism for understanding art appreciation. These studies are 
framed within the theory of predictive coding, which serves as a key foundational component of 
the broader framework of active inference. Predictive coding suggests that the brain seeks to 
make sense of sensory input by inferring the hidden states of the environment through Bayesian

inference. Under this framework, predictions from a generative model are compared to incoming 
sensory information, with the mismatch—prediction error—being reminiscent of VFE in active 
inference. Applying this to art appreciation, Van de Cruys (Van de Cruys, 2017) proposed that 
transitioning from a state of higher uncertainty to one of lower uncertainty—thus reducing 
prediction error—and positive rates of prediction error reduction elicit positive affective 
experiences. According to this view, the intense pleasure of “Aha” or Erlebnis moments arises 
from such a resolution of uncertainty. This perspective aligns with our proposal, where liking is 
proportional to the reduction in VFE. However, (Van de Cruys, 2017)’s framework did not 
address why organisms engage in behaviours that can initially increase prediction error, as 
seen in exploratory or epistemic actions. 
 
Overcoming this limitation, Van de Cruys and colleagues (Van de Cruys et al., 2024) have 
recently proposed that engaging in behaviours that initially increase prediction error is explained 
by the epistemic component of curiosity, which reflects expected information gain and the 
expectation of resolving uncertainty. They describe this process as an epistemic arc comprising 
three interconnected stages: curiosity, epistemic action and the resulting “Aha” experiences, 
which they interpret as the foundation of aesthetic experiences. While their model draws on the 
process theory of active inference and acknowledges potential applications beyond art-related 
experiences—such as everyday sense-making processes—it remains largely conceptual and 
lacks a quantitative framework. Our approach addresses this gap by providing a quantitative 
method for characterising epistemic arcs, situating them within a continuum of experiences not 
restricted to specific domains or species. Our formulation builds on active inference by offering a 
precise characterisation of the epistemic and pragmatic motivations that drive engagement with 
the world. By extending these principles, our approach underscores the importance of formal 
models in capturing the general mechanisms underlying curiosity-driven behaviours across 
diverse contexts, and how hedonic evaluation monitors and drives such behaviours. 
 
4.2. Other models of hedonic value 
 
Several approaches unrelated to active inference have proposed links between the processes 
involved in hedonic evaluation and motivated behaviour. Skov (Skov, 2023) offered a 
conceptual model explaining how nervous systems assign hedonic value to sensory objects, 
leading to action. As in the current proposal, hedonic values are inherently adaptive, shaped by 
the organism’s survival needs and ever-changing environment. Liking and disliking trigger 
response patterns that enable organisms to recognise and react to situations that could aid or 
harm their survival. Therefore, sensory valuation is not a simple reflection of an object’s intrinsic 
properties but depends on the organism’s idiosyncratic and current needs and evaluative 
context. For example, eating may elicit a positive hedonic value when the organism is in 
hypoglycaemia (as in Scenario 1 in Section 3) and a negative value when it is in 
hyperglycaemia (López-Gambero et al., 2019; Roh et al., 2016). While Skov s model remains 
conceptual and does not accommodate data or make predictions, its conceptual similarities with 
our proposal and its detailed description of the neurobiology of hedonic evaluation make it a 
valuable resource for refining and enhancing descriptions based on active inference. 
 
Our proposal shares several features with computational models of hedonic value based on 
reinforcement learning. Both reinforcement learning and active inference are theories of 
decision-making. In reinforcement learning, the objective is to determine the optimal policy—the 
one that maximises reward—through a value function following Bellman s equation (Sutton & 
Barto, 2018). This function includes components for immediate rewards and expected future 
rewards. In a proposal focused on hedonic value (referred to as aesthetic value), Brielmann and

Dayan (Brielmann & Dayan, 2022) mapped two processes known to contribute to art 
appreciation to these two components of reinforcement learning: processing fluency (Reber et 
al., 2004; Reber et al., 1998) informs immediate rewards while learning influences expected 
future rewards by facilitating future processing efficiency. Drawing on this parallel, the authors 
suggest that art experiences are processed in the brain similarly to how other rewarding 
experiences are handled in reinforcement learning, with hedonic value serving as a reward 
signal that guides future behaviour and preferences. While this proposal establishes a formal 
analogy with wanting and liking in hedonic evaluation, it does not account for the intrinsic 
motivation in learning or the pre-existing preferences that drive behaviour. This limitation is 
inherent to all reinforcement learning models due to their lack of an explicit formulation of 
epistemic (uncertainty-reducing) and pragmatic (goal-directed) imperatives, which are present in 
active inference (K. J. Friston et al., 2017; Pezzulo et al., 2024). In contrast with reinforcement 
learning, agents in active inference are endowed with a model of purposive behaviour: they act 
to fulfil their prior preferences. In addition, unlike value functions, which must be inferred, active 
inference naturally incorporates degrees of belief and uncertainty, which are central to 
understanding adaptive decision-making (Doya et al., 2007). In that sense, active inference 
offers a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning for analysing and generating motivated 
behaviour as it focuses on an agent’s beliefs, uncertainty and intrinsic motivations rather than 
externally defined rewards. In so doing, active inference provides deeper insights into 
exploration, decision-making under uncertainty, and adaptability in dynamic environments 
(Friston et al., 2016; Pezzulo et al., 2024; Schwartenbeck et al., 2019).

5. Why should we expect a continuum?  
 
Hedonic foraging integrates hedonic evaluation into a single, unified model of action and 
perception—active inference—to describe a comprehensive range of behaviours that 
transcends biological taxa. In this framework, the core constructs of active inference remain 
consistent, with only the modulating parameters being scenario-specific and tailored to each 
organism and behaviour. This is how continuum should be understood here: a single framework 
accounts for a range of observed phenomena, illustrating continuity across behavioural 
complexity and species endowed with an evaluation system. 
 
But why should we expect a continuum in the first place? This enquiry is central to many 
disciplines, as it carries fundamental scientific and philosophical implications for understanding 
cognition and human nature. In particular, it addresses whether there is a computational or 
neurophysiological mechanism of behaviour unique to Homo sapiens. If such a special 
mechanism exists, what does the break in the continuum look like, mean and entail for 
cognition? If a common mechanism drives a continuum of behaviours across scenarios and 
taxa, even sophisticated human pursuits and experiences traditionally deemed distinctly human 
(e.g., the so-called aesthetic experiences) would obey the same principles as allostatic 
processes in simpler organisms such as worms. We can refine the question to resolve this 
conundrum as follows: Should we expect wanting or liking nutritionally valuable food (a primary 
reward satisfying biological needs) and wanting or liking in the conscious appreciation of an 
artwork (a secondary reward without direct biological relevance) to share the same 
computational and neurophysiological mechanisms? 
 
Scholars in empirical aesthetics and related disciplines have traditionally insisted on a negative 
answer to this question, based on the widespread but controversial belief that art appreciation is 
disconnected from other psychological and neurological processes, as critically reviewed by 
Skov and Nadal (Nadal & Skov, 2024; Skov, 2019; Skov & Nadal, 2018, 2020). However, a 
central argument for a broadly shared basis of hedonic evaluation in motivated behaviour rests 
on substantial evidence that not only a wide array of pleasurable experiences—e.g., eating 
chocolate, having sex, listening to music—engages the same neural circuits in humans, but also 
that these circuits are evolutionarily conserved and widely shared with other animals (Berridge & 
Dayan, 2021; Berridge & Kringelbach, 2013, 2015). This supports the hypothesis of a common 
currency for hedonic evaluation (Levy & Glimcher, 2012; Montague & King-Casas, 2007), 
according to which first and secondary rewards are processed within a shared neural network 
across a range of species (Bartra et al., 2013; Sescousse et al., 2013).  
 
From an evolutionary perspective, the function of liking is not to generate positive introspective 
experiences but to enable organisms to identify and respond to adaptive opportunities and 
threats (Pessiglione & Lebreton, 2015; Rosenthal, 2017). Darwin (Darwin, 1872) anticipated this 
idea, proposing that emotional reactions are primarily selected for their adaptive value. This 
view has been substantiated by modern neuroscience, which provides extensive evidence that 
affective processing is underpinned by a core set of mechanisms shared across phylogeny 
(Anderson & Adolphs, 2014; LeDoux, 2012). Over time, cognitive and cultural pleasures have 
co-opted the hedonic circuitry initially evolved for basic sensory pleasures (Berridge & Dayan, 
2021; Nguyen et al., 2021). Core hedonic values (affective signals) appeared first, followed by 
subjective and conscious evaluations computed by more complex, hierarchical structures 
(Berridge & Kringelbach, 2015; Panksepp, 1998). It has been proposed that wanting evolved 
initially to pursue innate rewards, such as nutrients and mates, while liking likely emerged later

to evaluate behaviour and inform subsequent wanting (Berridge & Dayan, 2021; Winkielman & 
Berridge, 2003). This would explain both innate drives and exploration of novel environments, 
with learning resulting from the evaluation of such exploration. In these cases, reward 
maximisation (EFE minimisation) would have been first initiated by uninformed predictions 
(hypothetical VFE) and later informed by previous experiences (resulting VFE). 
 
Crucially, hedonic foraging describes a common computational mechanism implemented 
through specific neurobiological processes. While the framework suggests that the principle of 
reward maximisation spans behaviours and species, the scenarios and the brain structures 
underlying hedonic evaluation differ between taxa. More complex brains enable more refined 
cognitive abilities and sophisticated computations, such as deeper policy evaluation and 
planning: for example, C. elegans search for food using simple exploration strategies (Calhoun 
et al., 2014; Madirolas et al., 2023) whereas orcas plan and coordinate collective hunts (Lopez 
& Lopez, 1985; Pitman & Durban, 2012). Furthermore, distinct brain structures subserve similar 
functions in different species (see (Jarvis et al., 2005), for a review of brain evolution in 
vertebrates): for instance, executive functions involved in behavioural optimisation are 
associated with activity in the mammalian prefrontal cortex (Chudasama, 2011; Friedman & 
Robbins, 2022) and the avian nidopallium caudolaterale (Güntürkün, 2005; Güntürkün & 
Bugnyar, 2016).  
 
However, despite specific differences, the neural machinery underpinning hedonic evaluation is 
conserved across phylogeny, with biogenic amines (e.g., dopamine) playing a fundamental role 
in behavioural responses to rewards across various animal phyla (Barron et al., 2010). The 
emergence of the mesolimbic reward system predates the divergence of chordates (Yamamoto 
& Vernier, 2011) and there is substantial converging evidence for homology across major 
vertebrate lineages (O'Connell & Hofmann, 2011). Dopamine and other neurotransmitters 
mediate hedonic signals in sensory learning and motivate behaviour in invertebrates as well 
(Unoki et al., 2006). Moreover, neurogenetic studies suggest that the insect reward system has 
a modular structure that broadly parallels the mammalian system in terms of functional 
organisation, with distinct brain circuits for reward learning, wanting and liking (Perry & Barron, 
2013). 
 
Together, these functional, phylogenetic and neurophysiological similarities suggest a unified 
framework for understanding how hedonic evaluation guides behaviour across scenarios and 
taxa. As reviewed above, hedonic evaluation mechanisms evolved to motivate adaptive 
behaviour and are conserved across species (e.g., C. elegans, Homo sapiens), scenarios and 
stimuli (e.g., food, sex, artworks). Active inference explains this continuum from first principles, 
with behaviour driven by the imperative to maintain preferred states shaped by evolutionary 
adaptations to an ecological niche. By integrating hedonic evaluation within active inference, 
hedonic foraging provides the computational mechanism through which reward maximisation 
drives and monitors behaviour in organisms with a reward system, situating the commonalities 
discussed above within a continuum of behaviours and species.

6. Implications and potential of the hedonic foraging framework 
 
6.1. Contributions to the hedonic evaluation and active inference 
frameworks 
 
We have presented hedonic foraging as a computational mechanism through which reward 
maximisation drives behaviour in organisms with a reward system, with hedonic evaluation 
monitoring and motivating free energy minimisation relative to specific, embodied affordances 
and conditions. The theoretical and mathematical integration of hedonic evaluation and active 
inference entails a reciprocal enrichment of both frameworks, advancing our understanding of 
how motivated behaviour aligns with reward-driven behaviour. In the remainder of this section, 
we succinctly discuss the implications of merging hedonic evaluation and active inference in 
hedonic foraging, and how this integrated approach addresses the central questions raised in 
the introduction. 
 
Through hedonic foraging, active inference makes several key contributions to hedonic 
evaluation. Traditionally, hedonic evaluation has lacked a formal mechanism for quantifying and 
comparing hedonic values and translating these values into decisions and actions. In our 
proposal, active inference fills this gap by providing hedonic evaluation with a computational 
framework for understanding motivated behaviour. By formalising hedonic evaluation within the 
active inference framework, researchers can systematically examine how the interplay of factors 
such as internal states and environmental cues leads to behavioural outcomes. Crucially, 
hedonic foraging unifies wanting and liking, the core components of hedonic evaluation, as 
complementary facets of a single objective: maximising reward, that is, minimising VFE. 
Furthermore, this approach embraces the common currency hypothesis in that it acknowledges 
a single evaluative mechanism regardless of reward type, and transcends it by proposing a 
unified mechanism for behaviour across complexity and taxa grounded in free energy 
minimisation. In doing so, active inference provides hedonic evaluation with a first principle 
account of behaviour, linking neurobiological processes to computational goals. 
 
Conversely, through our framework, hedonic evaluation offers significant insights with the 
potential to enhance and refine active inference. The mechanisms underlying evaluation and 
reward are increasingly well defined in active inference. Reward maximisation is integrated 
through prior preferences that encode desired outcomes. These preferences guide policy 
selection by minimising EFE, which balances exploration and exploitation. Additionally, active 
inference formalises reward-related behaviour by treating prediction errors and learning rates as 
precision-weighted processes, akin to mechanisms in reinforcement learning but grounded in a 
unifying Bayesian framework. Crucially, dopamine has emerged as a key candidate for 
encoding precision-weighted prediction errors in active inference. Phasic dopamine signals are 
thought to represent transient changes in precision, guiding learning and action by signalling 
reward prediction errors (Bogacz, 2020; Friston et al., 2012), while tonic dopamine signals 
(Bogacz, 2020), or the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system (Sales et al., 2019), modulate the 
baseline confidence in policies, balancing exploratory and exploitative behaviour. 
 
Despite these neurobiological formulations of active inference, much remains unknown about its 
precise neurobiological correlates. In particular, the neurobiological implementation of VFE 
minimisation is not so well formalised in active inference, and that of the correspondence 
between habits EFE and VFE has not yet been clarified. Thanks to its grounding in hedonic 
evaluation, the hedonic foraging framework outlines possible directions to address these gaps. 
As a first and paramount step, testing whether the activation of hedonic hotspots underlying

liking corresponds to a reduction of VFE in active inference is crucial to understanding how 
behavioural choices are evaluated. Let us consider, for example, an empirical task in which the 
organism has to choose among several options, such as a multi-armed bandit (Schwartenbeck 
et al., 2019). The choices leading to greater rewards correspond to a greater reduction in VFE. 
According to hedonic foraging, these choices would relate to the dopamine release signalling 
EFE and would subsequently be associated with the activation of hedonic hotspots. Testing 
such hypotheses would provide insights into the neurobiological correlates of active inference. 
Casting the constructs of hedonic evaluation—supported by its extensive neurobiological 
foundation (Berridge & Kringelbach, 2013, 2015)—within the active inference framework 
enables hedonic foraging to generate novel hypotheses and investigate the potential 
neurobiological mechanisms underlying free energy minimisation. 
 
In summary, hedonic foraging fosters a mutual enrichment of hedonic evaluation—the 
fundamental adaptive neurobiological process of assessing stimuli as beneficial or harmful—
and active inference—a unified, principled theory of behaviour. In doing so, hedonic foraging 
has the potential to explain how information encoded in hedonic values is integrated and 
transformed into motivated behaviour, unifying computational and neurobiological mechanisms 
of behaviour into a single theoretical framework. 
 
 
6.2. Explaining and predicting empirical data 
 
The value of any theory or model resides in its heuristic utility and predictive power—its ability to 
explain existing phenomena and anticipate new data (Lipton, 2005). The central concept for 
understanding how hedonic foraging can address empirical questions is computational 
phenotyping. At the core of hedonic foraging, regardless of the scenario under scrutiny, lies a 
generative model, which establishes a mapping between model parameters and behaviour. 
Computational phenotyping is the process of retrieving model parameters from empirical data 
by inverting such mapping (Schwartenbeck & Friston, 2016). Computational phenotyping has 
emerged as a powerful tool for characterising individual variability in domains such as social 
behaviour (Xiang et al., 2012), personality, developmental and clinical neuroscience (Patzelt et 
al., 2018), cognition (Schurr et al., 2024) and genetics (Drouin et al., 2016). It has also been 
applied to active inference, particularly in computational psychiatry (Schwartenbeck & Friston, 
2016) and clinical neuroscience (Smith et al., 2021), offering a dual benefit: First, it harnesses 
the power of active inference—with its principled formulation and parameters interpretable in 
terms of cognitive processes—to provide a deeper understanding of cognitive phenomena. 
Second, it enables the simulation and prediction of behaviour based on empirically derived 
parameters.  
 
Hedonic foraging promotes the application of computational phenotyping to empirical 
experiments involving hedonic evaluation. To illustrate the potential benefits, let us consider an 
example from behavioural and cognitive ecology, where measuring preference and choice is 
central (Rosenthal, 2017). Predators preferentially choose cryptically coloured over conspicuous 
prey, as the latter are often associated with defences such as toxins that render them 
unpalatable (Mappes et al., 2005; Penacchio et al., 2024). This preference aligns with the 
imperative to minimise surprise in active inference, as sampling conspicuous prey can be 
associated with surprise (Penacchio et al., 2025). However, the preference for cryptic prey can 
be reduced or reversed when food is scarce, as the imperative to avoid hunger takes 
precedence (Barnett et al., 2007). Analysing behaviour in the context of predation—and other 
domains such as sexual selection—through the lens of hedonic foraging leverages deep

neurophysiological knowledge from hedonic evaluation within a principled computational 
framework, and provides insights into individual differences, including personality traits, sex and 
species-specific behaviours. 
 
Another relevant instance is the study of music appreciation, a model domain for a broad 
investigation of cognition and behaviour. Listening to music involves the interplay of factors such 
as individual brain structure (Loui et al., 2017) and function (Martínez-Molina et al., 2016), 
physiological state (Dreher et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2015), individual susceptibility in general 
(Aydogan et al., 2018) and specific to framing effects (Lopez-Persem et al., 2016), personality 
(Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), expertise (Alluri et al., 2015; Brattico et al., 2016), preferences 
(Palmer & Griscom, 2013; Smith & Melara, 1990), familiarity with the piece (Pereira et al., 2011; 
van den Bosch et al., 2013), dynamic and schematic (stylistic) expectations (Huron, 2006; 
Pearce, 2018) about the predictability and uncertainty of the musical structures (Cheung et al., 
2019; Gold et al., 2019), physical activity (North & Hargreaves, 2000), needs and goals (Sachs 
et al., 2015; Thoma et al., 2012) and social setting (Curzel et al., 2024; Nummenmaa et al., 
2021). The reward system integrates these inputs and generates value signals through 
dopamine release and activation of hedonic hotspots (Zatorre, 2015; Zatorre & Salimpoor, 
2013). This activity triggers action programs (Damasio & Carvalho, 2013) such as those 
associated with musical chills—elevating heart rate, skin conductance and respiration (de 
Fleurian & Pearce, 2021)—and policies directed to continuing or ceasing the listening 
experience. The hedonic impact of the experience contributes to the formation of preferences 
(Finnas, 1989; Kathios et al., 2024) and habits, thus informing subsequent behaviour—e.g., 
listening to the piece again, seeking related works, exploring new styles, learning to play an 
instrument, composing a piece and even devoting professionally to music. 
 
By applying computational phenotyping to these scenarios, researchers can disentangle how 
the complex interplay between habit, wanting and liking shapes behaviour. This approach 
allows experiments to move beyond descriptive measures, uncovering deeper mechanistic 
explanations that integrate the multiplicity of factors driving behaviour.  
 
Some of these factors correspond to general elements of the generative models, such as 
learning rates or the balance between exploration and exploitation, which apply to multiple 
scenarios. Curiosity (Schutte & Malouff, 2020), particularly its epistemic form (Hardy et al., 
2017), can be mapped onto lower precision (less determinacy) in policy selection (𝛽 in Box 2, 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2019). As shown in Scenario 3, curiosity may counteract and even 
reverse habits and biases. In Scenario 4, we demonstrated how the interplay between abilities 
and preferences drives behaviour and how these can be learned through reward maximisation.  
 
Other factors are more specific, enabling testing structured hypotheses. This is the case of 
individual traits that entail specific mappings in the generative models. Expertise (Ullén et al., 
2016) constitutes a prominent exemplary trait to test specific hypotheses through computational 
phenotyping, as it can be characterised through a more deterministic (less stochastic) mapping 
between states and observations (𝑨 in Box 2) and more deterministic transitions between states 
over time (e.g., what the resolution of a harmonic sequence can be) (𝑩 in Box 2), as a result of 
extensive statistical learning. For instance, individual sound events, their voice leading and tonal 
relationships in a Western classical musical piece are more precisely defined for classical 
musicians than aficionados (Schlaug, 2015; Zatorre et al., 2007). In active inference, this 
precision can be expressed as a higher probability of correspondence between the actual 
sounds and their perception in the generative model’s tensor 𝑨. Similarly, the probabilities for 
predicting the next event within a specific set in tensor 𝑩 are significantly higher for trained 
musicians, reflecting their enhanced ability to anticipate musical structure. This explains why

musicians experience greater surprise when tonal or voice-leading relationships are violated; 
that is, why they are less tolerant to mistakes (Hernández et al., 2019).  
 
In summary, computational phenotyping within the hedonic foraging framework offers a 
principled and versatile approach to studying motivated behaviour. The parameters inferred 
from observed behaviour can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of fundamental cognitive 
processes, drawing on core principles from hedonic evaluation as well as foundational 
constructs within active inference. Moreover, the theory facilitates the generation of testable 
predictions by simulating behaviour based on specific parameter values, which can then be 
compared to empirical observations in experimental settings.

7. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we propose a natural operationalisation of hedonic values in behaviour by 
mapping the phases of hedonic evaluation and their corresponding value signals onto the core 
components of active inference. In our interpretation, VFE corresponds to hedonic impact or 
core liking, quantifying sensory pleasure—or displeasure—of ongoing experiences, while EFE 
captures the motivational drive or core wanting to pursue rewarding outcomes. This synthesis 
forms the foundation of our theoretical framework, hedonic foraging, which describes how 
hedonic evaluation generates and evaluates motivated behaviour. 
Grounded in active inference, hedonic foraging provides a unifying framework for understanding 
preference-seeking behaviours through principles akin to those governing physical systems. 
Drawing on analogies from statistical physics, it conceptualises organisms as agents navigating 
probabilistic spaces to minimise VFE—similar to particles minimising a functional such as the 
Lagrangian (Friston, 2013; Friston et al., 2023). In this view, hedonic evaluation guides 
organisms along behavioural trajectories that minimise surprise, mirroring the principle of least 
action in physics. Crucially, this predictive framework relies on an embodied model of the 
world—shaped by an organism s ecological niche—that generates expectations about and 
evaluates the outcomes of actions in the form of hedonic values. 
A key strength of hedonic foraging is its ability to unify diverse preference-seeking behaviours 
under a shared mechanistic framework. This extends the common currency hypothesis beyond 
static neural correlates of hedonic value to highlight the dynamic mechanisms underpinning 
hedonic choice in action planning. In doing so, our proposal bridges fundamental biological 
processes with higher-order cultural endeavours typically considered uniquely human, 
suggesting shared roots in adaptive mechanisms. 
Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the idea that cognition is not primarily about abstract 
reasoning or knowledge accumulation but about engaging in adaptive interactions with the 
environment and its affordances. This perspective aligns with the growing recognition that 
purposive interaction is key to understanding cognition (Pezzulo et al., 2024) and represents a 
promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence. The move from traditional milestones in 
the field, such as the Turing test to the embodied Turing test (Zador et al., 2023), reflects this
