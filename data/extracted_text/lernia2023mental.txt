ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Mental health disorders pose a signiﬁcant challenge to society. The Bayesian perspective on the mind offers
unique insights and tools that may help address a variety of mental health conditions. Psychopathological
dysfunctions are often connected to altered predictive and active inference processes, in which cognitive
and physiological pathogenic beliefs shape the clinical condition and its symptoms. However, there is a
lack of general empirical models that integrate cognitive beliefs, physiological experience, and symptoms
in healthy and clinical populations. In this study, we examined the relationship between altered predictive
mechanisms, interoception, and pathological bodily distortions in healty individuals and in individuals suf-
fering from anorexia nervosa (AN). AN patients (N=15) completed a Virtual Reality Full-Body Illusion
along with interoceptive tasks twice: at hospital admission during an acute symptomatological phase (Time
1) and after a 12-week outpatient clinical weight-restoring rehabilitative program (Time 2). Results were
compared to a healthy control group. Ourﬁndings indicated that higher levels of interoceptive metacogni-
tive awareness were associated with a greater embodiment. However, unlike in healthy participants, AN
patients' interoceptive metacognition was linked to embodiment even in multisensory mismatching (asyn-
chronous) conditions. In addition, unlike in healthy participants, higher interoceptive metacognition in AN
patients was related to prior abnormal bodily distortions during the acute symptomatology phase. Predic-
tion errors in bodily estimates predicted posterior bodily estimate distortions after the illusion, but while
this relationship was only signiﬁcant in the synchronous condition in healthy participants, there was no
signiﬁcant difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions in AN patients. Despite the suc-
cess of the rehabilitation program in restoring som e dysfunctional patterns in the AN group, prediction
errors and posterior estimate distortions were present at hospital discharge. Ourﬁndings suggest that indi-
viduals with AN prioritize interoceptive metacognitive processes (i.e., con ﬁdence in their own perceived
sensations rather than their actual perceptions), di sregarding bottom-up bodily inputs in favour of their
prior altered top-down beliefs. Moreover, even if the rehabilitative program partially mitigated these altera-
tions, the pathological condition impaired the patients' ability to coherently update their prior erroneous
expectations with real-time multisensory bottom-up bodily information, possibly locking the patients in the
experience of a distorted prior top-down belief. Thes e results suggest new therapeutic perspectives and
introduce the framework of regenerative virtual therapy (RVT), which aims at utilizing technology-based
somatic modiﬁcation techniques to restructure the maladaptive priors underlying a pathological condition.

Introduction
Mental health issues are a widespread burden of our society, not-
withstanding there is a substantial disparity between those who require
mental health care and those who can access effective therapeutic solu-
tions (Pender, 2022). This gap in mental health care has led to intense
debate regarding diagnostic and prognostic relevance in health practi-
ces, resulting in a paradigmatic crisis (Rose, 2016) that forecasts two
opposite interpretations (Glannon, 2020).
On the one hand, biological psychiatry is supporting the idea that
mental illness can be described as nothing more than chemical imbalan-
ces within the brain, where psychoactive drug treatments that alter the
chemical makeup of the brain represent the preferred choice for inter-
vention (Pender, 2022). On the other side, psychotherapy suggests that
the individual's environment and life experiences are inextricably linked
to how the brain develops, copes, and interacts, as people's perceptions
of their reality can result in pathological symptoms and, in the same
manner, these perceptions can be altered to address the symptoms them-
selves (Mackay, 2003).
The concept of theBayesian brain offers a possible solution to this
conundrum, as it is presenting itself as an emerging new neuroscience
paradigm (Huang and Rao, 2011; Friston, 2018; Smith et al., 2021). The
fundamental assumption of this paradigm is that the brain functions as
an active inference machine that actively learns the statistical patterns
of the outside environment and develops predictions to improve the efﬁ-
ciency of information processing and sensorium comprehension. In this
view, mental health is the outcome of an "embodied self" that (Putica et
al., 2022): (1) anticipates the sensory input it will experience if one
course of action or another is chosen, (2) acts upon the environment and
changes it according to expectations and desires, (3) experiences the
result of action selection, (4) modiﬁes itself both at cognitive (subjective
expectations) and bodily (proprioceptive and interoceptive states) lev-
els, and (5) updates pre-existing models in response to unexpected
results. This vision has led to the emergence of a new researchﬁeld -
clinical computational neuroscience (Smith et al., 2021) - that suggests
how mental problems can be interpreted as the outcome of a dysfunction
in the representations (predictions) of the inner and outer worlds gener-
ated by the brain. In this view, mental health disorders can therefore be
the outcome of an impaired, overly precise, updating mechanism that
cannot integrate new sensory inputs because it relies more on the weight
of prior pathological beliefs.
Several clinical conditions might incorporate these prior pathological
beliefs, and among these clinical conditions, Anorexia Nervosa (AN)
seems to offer a functionalﬁeld of study to better understand how per-
ception, cognition, and a Bayesian account of the mind are related to
psychopathological dysfunctions.
AN is a severe disease that incurs, among other diagnostic criteria, in
“a disturbed view of one's own weight or body shape, undue inﬂuence of
weight and shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness associ-
ated with current low body weight” (DSM-5, 2013). Recent systematic
reviews and meta-analyses found higher consistency in the overestima-
tion of body percept in AN (Gardner & Brown, 2014; Glashouwer et al.,
2019). Patients suffering from AN often report distortions in their bodily
experiences and representations (Cash and Deagle, 1997; Dakanalis et
al., 2016). Similar ﬁ
ndings have been found also by Keizer and col-
leagues (Keizer et al., 2013), who concluded that body representation
disturbances in AN operate both at a conscious perceptual-cognitive
level (i.e., body image) and at an unconscious motor level (i.e., body
schema).
Notwithstanding, these frameworks missed perhaps the most crucial
aspect of our wellbeing, which is the experience of our body from within
– known as interoception. Interoception is deﬁned as “the process by
which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals origi-
nating from within the body, providing a moment-by-moment mapping
of the body's internal landscape across conscious and unconscious levels”
(Owens et al., 2018 ). In this regard, a recent systematic review
highlighted the presence of interoceptive deﬁcits in eating disorders,
suggesting that interoception might play a role as a transdiagnostic fea-
ture of this speciﬁc clinical dimension (Martin et al., 2019). In support
of this, several pieces of evidence found interoceptive alterations in
patients suffering from AN. Neuroimaging evidence identiﬁed white
matter abnormality and altered resting-state functionality (Gaudio et al.,
2015; Gaudio et al., 2017) in AN subject's interoceptive network, more-
over Kerr et al. (2016)found altered insula activity in weight restored
AN patients. Furthermore, different studies (Pollatos et al., 2008; Fischer
et al., 2016) reported interoceptive behavioural deﬁcits in AN where
patients were less accurate in detecting their interoceptive sensations
(heartbeat) compared to healthy controls. Similarly, evidence from a sin-
gle case study described a complete interoceptive axes dissociation in a
patient suffering from AN where the detection of interoceptive inputs
was completely absent but, at the same time, the patient's metacognitive
conﬁdence in these distorted perceptions was extremely high. This is as
if the patient was disregarding bottom-up information, favouring top-
down metacognitive beliefs leading to overconﬁdence in the erroneous
altered bodily perceptions (Di Lernia et al., 2019).
In the present study, we sought to collect evidence of altered predic-
tive mechanisms in a sample of patients suffering from AN, exploring
how these alterations are connected to inner bodily perceptions (intero-
ception) and to the pathological bodily distortions that characterize this
clinical condition. To pursue this objective, we used a well-validated Vir-
tual Reality (VR) Full-Body Illusion (Serino et al., 2016) along with
interoceptive perception tasks to explore how inner bodily perception
(interoception) is related to embodiment, bodily representations and
multisensory integration distortions in individuals suffering from AN.
Patients suffering from AN performed the evaluation two times; at hospi-
tal admission, during an acute symptomatological phase (Time 1) and
after a 12-week outpatient clinical weight-restoring rehabilitative pro-
gram (Time 2). Moreover, AN results were compared to a healthy con-
trol group.
As a general model, we deﬁned a Bayesian framework applied to
bodily perception and VR Full-Body Illusion that comprises a prior esti-
mate, namely an index of estimate distortion before the VR illusion, and
a posterior estimate, namely an index of estimate distortion after the VR
Full-Body Illusion. Under a Bayesian predictive account (Friston, 2010;
Friston et al., 2014; Ondobaka et al., 2015; Friston et al., 2016) we,
therefore, regarded (i) patients’ priors (expectations) as the degree of
distortion between their perceived body and their real body before a
multisensory VR Full-Body Illusion, (ii) posterior estimations, as the
degree of distortion between their perceived body illusion and their real
body after a VR Full-Body Illusion, (iii) the likelihood as the plausibility
of the virtual body (avatar) in relationship to the patient's real body, and
(iv) the prediction error has the distance between expectation (priors)
and reality (likelihood). With these terms, we were able to describe a
Bayesian model of bodily estimation adapted to VR Full-Body Illusions
that allows estimating priors, posteriors and the prediction error of
bodily perception, weighting both the actual bodily dimensions of the
participant taking part in the illusion and the dimension of the avatar
used in the VR Full-Body Illusion. As body illusions involve both a syn-
chronous and an asynchronous (control) stimulation of the participant's
visual and tactile systems, literature indicated a reduced perception of
embodiment in the asynchronous condition compared to the synchro-
nous condition (Keizer et al., 2014). However,Keizer et al. (2016)utiliz-
ing a VR Full-Body Illusion also showed that individuals suffering from
AN based their bodily estimations on the most recent available visual
inputs, rather than their afferent (proprioceptive) bodily signals, as
results were found both in the synchronous and the asynchronous condi-
tions. Authors, therefore, suggested that individuals suffering from AN
might disregard afferent proprioceptive inputs, favoring top-down per-
ceptions.
Following these premises and previous literature evidence on intero-
ceptive dissociation in patients suffering from AN (Di Lernia et al.,
2019), the study has the following hypotheses.

D.D. Lernia et al. International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology 23 (2023) 100383
Regarding the relationship between interoceptive processes and
embodiment in AN we would hypothesize that i) interoceptive metacog-
nitive beliefs rather than actual interoceptive perception (i.e., detection)
would predict the extent to which patients suffering from AN experi-
enced embodiment over a virtual body. Conversely, we do not expect
that interoceptive perception will play a role in healthy control partici-
pants, as recent literature indicated no role of heartbeat detection in
embodiment processes (Crucianelli et al., 2018; Horváth et al., 2020).
Regarding the relationship between interoceptive processes and
bodily distortion estimates in AN, we would hypothesize that ii) intero-
ceptive metacognitive beliefs would predict the extent of prior bodily
distortions in AN.
For both these hypotheses, we would hypothesize that the contribu-
tion of interoceptive variables will not depend on the synchronous or
asynchronous (control) condition, as individuals suffering from AN
might disregard bottom-up bodily inputs in favour of top-down percep-
tions, in line with previous results on the proprioceptive domain (Keizer
et al., 2016), as opposed to healthy participants.
Regarding the predictive Bayesian account of the relationship
between multisensory bodily illusions and bodily distortions in AN, we
would hypothesize that (iii) multisensory body prediction errors would
predict the extent of posterior bodily distortions, such as the larger the
bodily prediction error, the larger the perceived bodily distortions.
Lastly, as the severity of symptoms in individuals suffering from AN
is linked to alterations in bodily processing, we would hypothesize that
the pathologically altered bodily processes in individuals suffering from
AN, will be also moderately improved due to the rehabilitative clinical
intervention.
Methods
Participants
Fifteen patients affected by Anorexia Nervosa (AN) took part in the
study. The mean age at the beginning of the study was 18.93
(SD = 3.97) with a mean BMI of 15.13 (SD = 1.52), At the beginning of
the study mean Trait Anxiety was 62.07 (SD = 8.74), State Anxiety was
43.73 (SD = 9.16). Patients suffering from AN were recruited from the
Outpatients Rehabilitative Service of the Eating Disorders Centre, Divi-
sion of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, San Luca Hospital (Milan,
Italy). AN diagnosis was performed according to the clinical criteria of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fight Edition
(DSM-V) (APA, 2013) were carried out based on clinical interviews com-
pleted by clinical staff. All patients were recruited at hospital admission
during an acute symptomatological phase (Time 1), and the experimen-
tal procedure was repeated at hospital discharge (Time 2), after a 12-
week weight-restoring rehabilitative program. The rehabilitative pro-
gram provided a multidisciplinary approach, including several different
experts (i.e., endocrinologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and dieti-
tians) for delivering a personalized outpatient service, focused primarily
on weight and dietary rehabilitation and education. The program lasted
typically 12 weeks, and it was speciﬁcally customized according to the
clinical needs of every single patient in terms of frequency and clinical
activities - see Di Lernia et al. (2019). In addition, 15 healthy young
females, with no active or past diagnosis of AN and with healthy BMI,
were recruited and assessed as a control group. The mean age was 22
(SD = 0.59) with a mean BMI of 20.67 (SD = 2.18), The mean State
Anxiety was 38 (SD = 9.35) and Trait Anxiety was 44.07 (SD = 10.38).
Participants did not receive money nor any form of compensation for
their participation in the study.Table 1reports the descriptive and clini-
cal characteristics of the samples included. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants (or their parents, in the case of a
minor) to be included in the study. The study was conducted in compli-
ance with the Helsinki Declaration (of 1975, as revised in 2008), and
was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Istituto Auxologico Ital-
iano.
Procedure
After entering the experimental room, patients and healthy control
participants received instructions about the procedure and were famil-
iarized with the settings. After signing the informed consent, patients
were connected to a three-lead ECG sampling at 1000Hz (biosignalplux.
com) to perform a complete interoceptive assessment for interoceptive
accuracy (IAc) measured with an HCT (Schandry, 1981), and interocep-
tive metacognitive conﬁdence (IAw) measured with a VAS on the perfor-
mance at the HCT (Garﬁnkel et al., 2015). Patients also took time to
compile questionaries for self-reported state and trait anxiety measures
with the STAI (Spielberger et al., 1970). After that, they completed a
ﬁrst pre-illusion estimation of their body size with the Body Part Size
Estimation Task. Subsequently, they were invited to wear a head-
mounted display (Oculus Rift DK2, connected to a portable computer
HP TRUE VISION with CPU Intel® Core™i7) to experience the VR Full-
Body Illusion. In a randomized order, they experienced the synchronous
(i.e., experimental condition) and the asynchronous (i.e.,control condition)
visuotactile stimulation. After both stimulations, patients were asked to
complete the Embodiment Questionnaire (Serino et al., 2016) to mea-
sure the strength of the illusion and to complete the Body Size Estima-
tion Task. At the end of the entire procedure, their actual body measures
were collected. This procedure was performed at hospital admission
(Time 1) and after the 12 weeks rehabilitative program (Time 2).
Healthy control participants performed the same procedure, in a single
experimental session.
Materials
Virtual reality full-body illusion
The VR Full-Body Illusion (Fig. 1.) utilized the avatar of a young
female girl (approximately 20-25 years old) with a thin body (waist cir-
cumference: 73.94 cm, hips circumference: 96.72 cm) immersed in a
stimulus-free room. The virtual room was developed with the software
Unity3D (www.unity3d.com), while the avatar was modelled using the
software MakeHuman (http://www.makehuman.org/). To induce the
illusion of being the owner of the avatar, patients suffering from AN and
healthy controls were asked to visualize inﬁrst-person perspective the
avatar through the head-mounted display, while receiving a multisen-
sory stimulation involving the visual system (i.e., what they saw on the
virtual body) and the tactile proprioceptive system (i.e., tactile stimula-
tion to their own actual body). In the“synchronous visuotactile stimula-
tion” (i.e., experimental condition), participants felt a touch on their
abdomen for 90 s while synchronous stimulation was provided in VR to
the avatar's abdomen. This was achieved using a brush attached to a
motion-tracking device (i.e., Razer Hydra). In the“asynchronous visuo-
tactile stimulation” (i.e., the control condition) the same visuotactile
stimulation was provided on the participants' abdomen for 90 s, but
there was a temporal delay between the visual and tactile stimulation (i.
e., absence of a synchronous match between tactile and visual stimula-
tion). In the asynchronous condition, the experimenter recorded the tac-
tile stimulation by pressing a button on the Razer Hydra at the

beginning of the movement, which paused the image seen by partici-
pants. The tactile stimulation was later replayed in VR at the end of the
movement, thus inducing a mismatched multisensory stimulation
between what participants felt and what participants saw in the VR sce-
nario.
Body part size estimation task
Before the illusion was induced (i.e., baseline), after both the syn-
chronous (i.e., experimental condition) and the asynchronous visuotac-
tile stimulation (i.e., control condition), patients suffering from AN and
healthy control participants were asked to estimate the width and cir-
cumference of three body parts (shoulders, waist and hips) as in Serino
and colleagues (Serino et al., 2016). In the current study, we focused on
two different body estimates, namely the circumference of two different
body parts: the waist and hips. These speciﬁc body parts were selected
to allow comparison with the avatar's body part for which precise meas-
ures were deﬁned, i.e., the avatar's body was built with a waist circum-
ference of 73.94 cm and the hips circumference of 96.72 cm. In
particular, participants were provided with a piece of rope, and they
were asked to draw a circle/oval on theﬂoor representing the perceived
size of the same body parts. At the end of the entire experiment, the
experimenter measured the actual width and circumference of the tar-
geted body parts. For each body part, we calculated the delta of misesti-
mation between real and estimated measures.
Embodiment questionnaire
After both conditions, patients suffering from AN and healthy control
participants were required toﬁll out the Embodiment Questionnaire,
adapted from (Piryankova et al., 2014) and previously used in (Serino et
al., 2016). It consists of 20 items on a 7-point Likert scale. This self-
report questionnaire measures the strength of the illusion in terms of 1)
body ownership(i.e., the sense of being the owner of the virtual body); 2)
self-location (i.e., the sense of being in the same spatial location of the
virtual body); and 3)sense of agency(i.e., the sense of being in control of
virtual body’actions). The three subscales were calculated by averaging
the responses from the corresponding items.
Interoceptive measures
Following previous literature (Di Lernia et al., 2019), we performed a
detailed interoceptive assessment, collecting both interoceptive accuracy
(IAc) and interoceptive metacognitive awareness (IAw), at the beginning
(Time 1) and at the end of the rehabilitative program (Time 2).
Speciﬁcally, IAc measured with the HCT ( Schandry, 1981)i sa
behavioural index that reports the patients’ability to correctly perceive
inner bodily cardiac sensations. The task asks participants to silently
count their heartbeat focusing only on inner bodily sensations, without
taking the pulse and without making an inference based on time percep-
tion. Participants have to count their heartbeats in a speciﬁc time span
marked by two audio cues and report only the heartbeats they felt, with-
out guessing or estimating the number of beats (Desmedt et al., 2020).
The reported heartbeat count is compared to the real heartbeat number
measured through an ECG and a global performance index is calculated
according to the following formula: 1/3∑(1–(|recorded heartbeats –
counted heartbeats|) / recorded heartbeats). Index scores can vary
between 0 and 1, where lower values indicate poorer performances. In
our study, patients were connected to a portable ECG unit sampling at
1000 Hz with Ag/AgCl electrodes and they were instructed to count
their own heartbeats in speciﬁc intervals time intervals of 25, 35, and
45 s. Adjusted instructions were used following recent literature guide-
lines (Corneille et al., 2020).
Interoceptive conﬁdence refers to the construct of IAw originally
developed by Garﬁnkel et al. (2015)that assesses participants’ conﬁ-
dence in the answers to the accuracy task. InGarﬁnkel et al. (2015)par-
ticipants were invited to report their conﬁdence regarding the responses
Fig. 1. Virtual Reality Full-Body Illusion: (a) a calibration procedure identiﬁes four markers on the avatar's abdomen. The markers are matched with the corresponding
bodily locations of the participant's real body, creating a virtual plane on the participant's abdomen to allow the visuotactile stimulation to adhere to the participant's
bodily morphology, without colliding (e.g., trespassing) the avatar; (b.) the researcher can therefor move hand-tracked virtual brush, movementsare mapped in the
VR scenario in real-time; (c.) the researcher can perform a visuotactile stimulation of the participant's body moving the virtual brush from side to side, touching the par-
ticipant's real body at the same time. In the sync condition, tactile and visual stimulation are performed synchronously. In the async condition, theparticipant feels the
touch on the abdomen but sees the movement in the virtual scenario with a 30s delay.

to the HCT without any feedback on the actual performances. Responses
were given on a VAS that ranged from 0 (Not Conﬁdent at All) to 100
(Fully Conﬁdent). The metacognitive index was originally calculated as
the within-participant Pearson correlation between con ﬁdence and
accuracy (Garﬁnkel et al. 2015). Nonetheless,Garﬁnkel et al. (2015)uti-
lized a modiﬁed version of the heartbeat counting task, while this study
utilized the original Schandry task (Schandry, 1981) since the original
task has already been utilized in several studies (Di Lernia,Serino et al.,
2016; Di Lernia et al., 2020) thus allowing comparison of results across
the literature. Considering the structure of the original Schandry task,
the within-participant correlation would have not provided reliable sta-
tistical information, therefore raw VAS conﬁdence scores are reported as
a proxy of interoceptive conﬁdence. It has also been suggested, in pre-
dictive coding terms, that conﬁdence may index the‘precision’of intero-
ceptive sensations (Allen et al., 2019).
Bayesian embodiment and bodily prediction error in virtual avatars
In the present study, we describe a Bayesian model of bodily estima-
tion adapted to virtual reality bodily illusions that allow estimating the
prediction error of bodily perception, weighting both the actual bodily
dimensions of the participant taking part in the illusion and the dimen-
sion of the avatar used in the virtual illusion.
According to the Bayesian framework, four core elements describe
the probabilistic inference process: the likelihood as the distribution of
the observed data marginalized over the parameter(s) (i.e.,reality). The
prior is the distribution of the parameter(s) before any data is observed
(i.e., expectation or belief). The posterior is the distribution of the parame-
ter(s) after considering the observed data (i.e.,estimation). Lastly, the
prediction error, which in this case is described as the distance between
reality (likelihood) andexpectation (prior). SeeFig. 2.
In the context of a body virtual reality illusion, these parameters can
be adapted to extract fundamentalestimate distortion indexes, in the con-
text of an experimental design that requires the participant to estimate
their bodily size perceptions, before (prior) and after (posterior or esti-
mation) a given experimental procedure in virtual body avatar. In this
case, the posterior factor can be represented by the estimation of the
body (Body Size Estimation Task) in relation to the actual dimension of
the participant's real body, according to the formula:
Posterior  postPerception−RealDimension:
This factor represents a distortion estimation index that reports how
much patients suffering from AN can accurately estimate a given dimen-
sion of their body (e.g., hips circumference), after (post) each stimula-
tion. Similarly, the prior factor represents the participants’ perceptual
belief regarding the dimension of their own body, namely their expecta-
tion regarding a given dimension of their body prior to any stimulation.
The prior factor can therefore be represented by the formula:
Prior 
prePerception−RealDimension:
This factor represents a distortion estimation index that reports how
much patients suffering from AN can accurately perceive a given dimen-
sion of their body (e.g., hips circumference), before (pre) any
stimulation, therefore presenting their perceptual expectations about
their own body. Lastly, the likelihood factor can be described as the
plausibility of the virtual body (avatar) in relationship to the patient's
real body. The likelihood factor can therefore be represented by the for-
mula:
Likelihood  AvatarDimension−RealDimension:
This factor represents a distortion estimation index that reports how
much the avatar is similar to the participants’real body, therefore pro-
viding a likeness index of the avatar in comparison to the real body.
Given these terms, and accordingly, to the Bayesian framework, the pre-
diction error of a bodily illusion can be described as the distance
between reality and expectation, represented by the following formula:
Prediction Error= Likelihood - Prioror, in our terms:
PredictionError  AvatarDimension−RealDimension − prePerception−RealDimension :
In this case, the prediction error represents a distortion estimation
index that reports how much the plausibility of the avatar in relation to
the real body is different from the participants' perceptual beliefs
(expectations) in relation to their own real body. Ultimately, given these
terms, we can describe a Bayesian embodiment model that predicts pos-
terior bodily estimations for a given parameter:
Posterior estimate ∼PredictionError  Condition  Group
The model proposed can work as a generic predictive model for
Bayesian embodiment and bodily prediction error in virtual avatars. For
this study, we divided for each level of time (Time 1 and Time 2), stimu-
lation (Condition: synchronous and asynchronous), and Group (Control
and AN)
Statistical analyses
We used R version 3.6.3 for the analyses (R Core Team, 2014). In
particular, we used linear mixed-effects ANOVA (Luke, 2017) for the
pre-post effect model and robust linear regression for the Bayesian
model to evaluate the signiﬁcance of each predictor. The mixed-effects
ANOVA models were run withlme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) and
Bobyqa optimizer was applied (Brown, 2021). To account for intra-par-
ticipants variability, we put patients ID as random factor with random
intercept (R formula: outcome∼ ﬁxed effects + (1|ID). Models’assump-
tions of normality of residuals and homoscedasticity were veriﬁed by
visual inspection. As the control group was only assessed once (no reha-
bilitative intervention was administered to healthy controls), we used
this as baseline to assess any changes in the AN group with separate
models for Time (Time1 and Time2 models). One AN patient dropped-
out at Time2. Missing values were not imputed as mixed-effects model
handles missing values without removing the case but rather the missing
observation. Partial eta squared (η2
p) was interpreted (small = 0.01,
medium = 0.06, and large = 0.14) according to Richardson (Richard-

As a preliminary check, we evaluated changes in BMI before and
after the 12-week rehabilitative program (one-way within ANOVA)
between the admission – start of the rehabilitative program (Time 1)
and the hospital discharge - end of the rehabilitative program (Time2).
We found that the rehabilitation program signi ﬁcantly improved
patients’BMI (F1,44 = 45.23, p< 0.001, η2
p = 0.51 95% CI[0.29,0.65]).
At Time1 the mean BMI was 15.13 (SD = 1.54) whereas at Time2 was
16.64 (SD = 1.34), which however was still below normative values for
a healthy BMI suggesting that patients suffering from AN were still not
fully clinically recovered after the rehabilitative program.
In order to check if age signiﬁcantly affected our results we ran the
models with age as a covariate, this did not alter our results, so we

Embodiment of virtual reality full-body illusion in AN
To check if the VR Full-Body Illusion was effective, we analysed the
effect of the Illusion with separate models for Time1 and Time2 (2× 2
mixed ANOVAs, within factor: Condition: Synchronous Vs Asynchro-
nous visuotactile stimulation; and Group factor: AN Vs controls). Here

synchronous condition, the ow nership was higher (M = 3.91,
SD = 0.98) than in the asynchronous condition (M = 3.26,
SD = 0.93). No other main or interaction effects were found, suggest-
ing that patients suffering from AN experienced the full bodily illusion
similarly to healthy control participants, regarding the avatar's
embodiment.
In the ownership Time2 model, we found a main effect of Condition
(F1,26 = 9.39, p = 0.005,η2
p = 0.27). In the synchronous condition,
the ownership was higher (M = 3.85, SD = 1.02) than in the asynchro-
nous condition (M = 3.2, SD = 0.94). No other main or interaction
effects were found, conﬁrming ﬁndings at Time 1.
In the agency Time1 model, we found a main effect of Condition
(F1,27 = 13.05, p = 0.001,η2
p = 0.33). In the synchronous condition
the agency was higher (M = 4.14, SD = 1.51) than in the asynchronous
condition (M = 3.16, SD = 1.32). Moreover, we found a main effect of

agency was higher (M = 4.33, SD = 1.46) than in the AN group
(M = 2.91, SD = 1.17). No interaction effect was found.
In the agency Time2 model, we found a main effect of Condition
(F1,26 = 12.78, p = 0.001,η2
p = 0.33). In the synchronous condition,
the agency was higher (M = 4.31, SD = 1.42) than in the asynchronous
condition (M = 3.25, SD = 1.32). Any other main or interaction effects
were found.
Relationship between interoceptive processes and embodiment in AN
We evaluated IAc and IAw at Time1 and Time2 (one-way within
ANOVA) and we found no changes in IAc (F1,44 = 1.48, p = 0.229,
η2
p = 0.03 95% CI[0, 0.19]) and IAw (F1,44 = 0.265, p = 0.609,
η2
p = 0 95% CI[0, 0.12]) in relation to Time, suggesting no impact of
the rehabilitative program (which was focused primarily on weight and
dietary rehabilitation) on interoception.
To better understand the relationship between IAc and IAw in
patients suffering from AN, we conducted three separate Pearson's corre-
lations for IAc and IAw scores at Time1 (Fig. 3part a) and Time2 (Fig. 3
part b). We found a signiﬁcant negative correlation at Time1 (r = - 0.54
95% CI[-0.75, -0.26], p = 0.002) but this correlation was neither signiﬁ-
cant nor negative at Time2 (r = - 0.03 95% CI[-0.38, 0.33], p = 0.873).
Correlations are shown inFig. 3.
In the control group, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association
between IAw and IAc (r = 0.46 95% CI[-0.07, 0.79], p = 0.086). The
correlations between IAw/IAc and all the other synchronous/asynchro-
nous embodiment measures were not signiﬁcant (p-values > 0.05).
These results suggest that at hospital admission, during an acute patho-
logical phase, patients ’ perception of inner bodily sensation was

detached from the metacognitive process. After the rehabilitative pro-
gram, at hospital discharge, the relationship between interoceptive per-
ception and interoceptive metacognition was partially restored, as no
negative correlation was found similarly to the healthy control partici-
pants.
In order to study the impact of interoception in interaction with the
Group and Condition on embodiment processes, we performed separate
mixed ANCOVAs for IAc and IAw at Time1 and Time2. Post-hoc con-
trasts of interest were the comparison between the levels of Condition
within the groups and the contrast between Groups for each level of
Condition. SeeFig. 4for the results mentioned below. Agency and self-
location results are reported in the supplementary materials. Regarding
ownership at Time1 for the IAc model, we found that the IAc by Group
by Condition interaction was not signiﬁcant. Similarly, we found that
the IAc by Group by Condition interaction was not signiﬁcant at Time 2.
These results suggest that IAc does not contribute to the embodiment in
patients suffering from AN and in healthy control participants. Regard-
ing ownership at Time1 for the IAw model, we found that IAw by Group
by Condition interaction was signiﬁcant (F1,26 = 3.04, p = 0.035,
η2
p = 0.31). Post-hoc slope moderation analyses adjusted for Bonferroni
correction showed that only in the control group the slopes of the asyn-
chronous and synchronous conditions were statistically signiﬁcant (est.
diff. = -0.02, SE = 0, p = 0.026). In particular, the slope of IAw in the
synchronous condition was 0.02 (SE = 0.01), whereas in the asynchro-
nous condition was 0 (SE = 0.01). No other contrast was signiﬁcant. In
the ownership Time2 IAw model, we found that IAw by Group by Condi-
tion interaction was signiﬁcant (F1,26 = 3.8, p = 0.015,η2
p = 0.37).
However, post-hoc did not show signiﬁcant contrasts.
Relationship between interoceptive processes and bodily distortion estimates in
AN
In order to assess the effect of interoception and Group on prior esti-
mation, we performed separate between-subjects ANOVAs by IAw and
IAc at Time1 and Time2. As the mixed-effects ANOVAs failed to con-
verge we used the analysis of variance with linear regression.
In the prior waist Time1 IAc model, we did notﬁnd any signiﬁcant
results. In the prior waist Time2 IAc model, we did notﬁnd any signiﬁ-
cant results.
In the prior hips Time1 IAc model, we only found a main effect of
group (F1,56 = 10.86, p = 0.002,η2
p = 0.16). AN group had reduced
prior hips distortion (M = 20.35, SD = 13.83) compared to the control
group (M = 33.57, SD = 17.07). In the prior hips Time2 IAc model, we
only found a main effect of group (F1,54 = 20.2, p< 0.001, η2
p = 0.27).
AN group had reduced prior hips distortion (M = 14.53, SD = 14.9)
compared to the control group (M = 33.57, SD = 17.07). In the prior
waist Time1 IAw model, we did notﬁnd any signiﬁcant results. In the
prior waist Time2 IAw model, we did notﬁnd any signiﬁcant results.
In the prior hips Time1 IAw model, we found a Group by IAw interac-
tion (F1,56 = 4.18, p = 0.045,η2
p = 0.07). Post-hoc slope moderation
analyses adjusted for Bonferroni correction showed that the slopes of
the AN and control group were statistically signiﬁcant (est. diff. = 0.36,
SE = 0.18, p = 0.047). In particular, the slope of IAc in the control
group was -0.15 (SE = 0.15), whereas in the AN group was 0.21
(SE = 0.09). In the prior hips Time2 IAw model, we found a Group by
IAw interaction (F1,56 = 20.61, p< 0.001, η2
p = 0.28). However, post-
hoc slope moderation analyses were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.117).Fig. 5
shows these latter results.
Predictive Bayesian account of the relationship between multisensory bodily
illusions and bodily distortions in AN
In order to study the impact of Condition, Group, and Prediction
error on posterior hips estimation (as we did notﬁnd any signiﬁcant
results for prior waist estimation, we reported only hips estimation
here), we performed mixed ANCOVAs divided by Time1 and Time2.
Post-hoc contrasts of interest were the comparison between the levels of
Fig. 5. Signiﬁcant (left panel) post-hoc slope moderation analysis between IAw and Group at Time1 and non-signiﬁcant post-hoc slope moderation analysis at Time2.
IAw: interoceptive awareness; AN: anorexia nervosa. In healthy control participants, interoceptive metacognition was negatively related to bodily distortions. In this
case, the more conﬁdent healthy control participants were regarding their bodily perceptions, the less they overestimated their bodies. However, patients suffering
from AN exhibited an opposite pattern. At Time 1, during the acute symptomatological phase, higher interoceptive metacognition was positively related to prior bodily
distortion estimate, indicating that higher interoceptive metacognitive conﬁdence was connected to higher distortion at the body estimation task before the illusion.
This pattern was partially restored after a clinical rehabilitation program. At Time 2, no signiﬁcant differences were found between healthy controls and patients suffer-
ing from AN.

Condition within the groups and the contrast between Group for each
level of Condition.
For the Time1 model, we found an interaction effect between Condi-
tion and Prediction Error (F1,26 = 6.03, p = 0.021,η2
p = 0.19). Post-
hoc slope moderation analyses adjusted for Bonferroni correction
showed that the slopes of the asynchronous and synchronous condition
were statistically signiﬁcant (est. diff. = 0.29, SE = 0.12, p = 0.021).
In particular, the slope of the Prediction Error in the synchronous condi-
tion was -0.51 (SE = 0.15), whereas in the asynchronous condition was
-0.22 (SE = 0.15). We found also a negative association with the poste-
rior estimate of the Prediction Error covariate (est. = -0.31, p = 0.011).
For the Time2 model, we found an interaction effect among Group,
Condition, and Prediction Error (F1,24 = 9.56, p = 0.005,η2
p = 0.28).
Post-hoc slope moderation analyses adjusted for Bonferroni correction
showed that only in the control group the slopes of the asynchronous
and synchronous conditions were statistically signi ﬁcant (est.
diff. = 0.43, SE = 0.12, p = 0.008). In particular, the slope of the Pre-
diction Error in the synchronous condition was -0.51 (SE = 0.16),
whereas in the asynchronous condition was -0.14 (SE = 0.16). We
found also a negative association with the posterior estimate of the Pre-
diction Error covariate (est. = -0.88, p< 0.001). No other contrasts of
interest were found. Fig. 6 shows the signiﬁcant interaction effects
reported in this section.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between inter-
oception, embodiment, and body perception in a sample of patients suf-
fering from anorexia nervosa (AN) and compare the results to a control
group of healthy participants. We collected all relevant variables for the
AN group twice: at hospital admission during an acute symptomatologi-
cal phase (Time 1) and at hospital discharge after a 12-week outpatient
clinical weight-restoring rehabilitation program (Time 2). Our results
showed that the rehabilitation program, which aimed to improve weight
and dietary recovery, was effective in leading to a signiﬁcant increase in
patients' BMI. Although patients remained clinically underweight, the
assessment at hospital discharge allowed us to compare changes at two
different symptomatological time points (i.e., acute phase versus par-
tially recovered phase).
Several pieces of literature evidence reported deﬁcits in interocep-
tive perception in AN (Martin et al., 2019), however, these results were
often tied to interoceptive heartbeat perception tasks or questionaries
and no data were available regarding interoceptive metacognition. Inter-
estingly, but in line with some AN studies (Eshkevari et al., 2014;
Ambrosecchia et al., 2017; Lutz et al., 2019), we did notﬁnd a signiﬁca-
tive difference between patients suffering from AN and healthy control
participants in interoceptive accuracy or interoceptive metacognition.
Moreover, no signiﬁcant differences were found between before and
after the rehabilitative program for the AN group. This indicates that, at
least in our AN sample, interoceptive processes were not impaired. A
possible explanation for these results might be that in our sample as the
AN condition was still in the initial stage, due to the patients’young age.
Albeit clinically relevant, the pathological condition was far from being
chronic, and some authors suggested that deﬁcits in AN might be a prog-
nostic evolution in the chronicization of the pathology (Riva & Dakana-
lis, 2018).
Nonetheless, our ﬁndings revealed an intriguing negative relation-
ship between interoceptive accuracy and metacognition in individuals

2. Green segments represent signiﬁcant contrasts in the control group. *** = p< 0.001; ** = p< 0.01; * = p< 0.05. Results at Time 1 showed that larger prediction
error negative values (i.e., overestimation) were related to larger posterior bodily estimation distortions (i.e., overestimation of the real body) after the illusion. These
results were true for both patients suffering from AN and healthy control participants at Time 1, during the synchronous condition. This suggests that bodily estimate
prediction error was coherently merged with the multisensory integration processes underlying the illusion. Notwithstanding, this pattern was disrupted at Time 2
where signiﬁcant results for the synchronous condition were found only in healthy control participants.

suffering from AN, implying that the less they perceived their inner
body, the more conﬁdent they were of these erroneous perceptions.
From an interoceptive perspective, these results indicate a complete dis-
sociation between AN patients’inner bodily perception and their meta-
cognitive evaluation of these perceptions. This negative correlation was
found only at Time 1 and it replicates the interoceptive axes dissociation
found in a previous study (Di Lernia et al., 2019). After the rehabilitative
program, no negative correlation was found. This suggests that the rela-
tionship between interoceptive perception and interoceptive metacogni-
tion was partially restored. In the healthy participants, a statistical trend
suggested a strong positive relation between IAc and IAw, which proba-
bly did not reach signiﬁcative levels due to the small sample size. How-
ever, the trend for a positive relation between interoceptive accuracy
and metacognition in healthy participants was in line with previous lit-
erature on interoception (Garﬁnkel et al., 2015) further supporting the
concept of interoceptive axes dissociation in patients suffering from AN
(Di Lernia et al., 2019).
Regarding the relationship between interoceptive processes and
embodiment, literature on the healthy population provided contradic-
tory results on the role of interoceptive perceptions on embodiment pro-
cesses. Early evidence ( Tsakiris et al., 2011 ) suggested a positive
relationship between interoceptive accuracy and ownership, however
recent studies with the RHI found no role for interoceptive accuracy in
ownership processes (Crucianelli et al., 2018; Horváth et al., 2020).
However, no data in the literature provided insight regarding the role of
interoceptive perceptions, and especially interoceptive metacognitive
beliefs, in AN embodiment process during a Full-Body Illusion. In this
regard, our results suggest that higher levels of interoceptive metacogni-
tive beliefs (i.e., patients’ conﬁdence related to their interoceptive per-
ception, regardless of the accuracy of these perceptions) lead to higher
ownership. These results were not found for interoceptive accuracy indi-
cating that body ownership seems to be primarily related to interocep-
tive metacognitive (top-down) processes, rather than actual inner bodily
sensations, in line with recent literature (Crucianelli et al., 2018; Hor-
váth et al., 2020).
During the acute symptomatological phase interoceptive metacogni-
tive beliefs were positively related to the sense of ownership in individu-
als with AN regardless of the synchronous or asynchronous VR
conditions. This suggests that interoceptive metacognitive processes did
not coherently contribute to multisensory integration processes in the
sense of ownership in AN. It is therefore possible to speculate that
patients suffering from AN tend to prioritize top-down metacognitive
processes (namely the conﬁdence in their own perceived sensations
rather than their actual perception) even in the presence of multisensory
bodily afferent mismatching information, thus disregarding bottom-up
bodily inputs in favour of their prior altered top-down beliefs, as per pre-
vious evidence on the proprioceptive domain (Keizer et al., 2016). These
results were not found at hospital discharge, suggesting a rehabilitative
effect of the clinical program.
Our further analyses showed that only the healthy control partici-
pants demonstrated the integration of interoceptive metacognition in
the sense of ownership during the synchronous condition. Speciﬁcally,
we found that the higher the interoceptive metacognition, the greater
the ownership was experienced in the synchronous condition. These
ﬁndings suggest that healthy participants possess intact multisensory
integration processes and can coherently integrate interoceptive meta-
cognition and bottom-up inputs into their sense of ownership.
So far, our results have shown that interoceptive metacognition plays
a signiﬁcant role in embodiment processes. Speciﬁcally, we found that in
healthy participants, multisensory processes are coherently integrated
with interoceptive metacognition. However, in individuals suffering
from AN, the multisensory integration processes during the illusion
appear to be overridden in favour of top-down metacognitive beliefs
that are disconnected from actual bodily sensations, as the less the indi-
viduals suffering from AN perceived their inner body, the more conﬁ-
dent they were of their wrong perceptions.
Regarding the relationship between interoceptive processes and
bodily distortion estimates in AN, we analyzed the potential inﬂuence of
embodiment and interoceptive processing on altered body perception in
individuals suffering from AN. Ourﬁndings conﬁrm that interoceptive
metacognition has a distinct impact on distortions in prior bodily esti-
mates between the two groups. In healthy control participants, a nega-
tive relationship was observed between interoceptive metacognition
and bodily distortions. Speciﬁcally, higher levels of interoceptive meta-
cognition were associated with lower levels of prior bodily overestima-
tion. This suggests that the more conﬁdent healthy control participants
were in their bodily perceptions, the less they overestimated their bod-
ies. In contrast, individuals suffering from AN showed the opposite pat-
tern. During the acute symptomatological phase, we found a positive
relationship between interoceptive metacognition and prior bodily dis-
tortion estimate. This indicates that higher levels of interoceptive meta-
cognitive conﬁdence, which was detached from the detection of inner
bodily sensations, were associated with higher distortions at the body
estimation task before the illusion. This pattern was partially restored
following the clinical rehabilitation program. Interestingly, patients suf-
fering from AN were better at estimating their prior bodily dimensions
compared to healthy control, at least in absolute terms. We suspect that
this could be attributed to the regular medical evaluations that patients
undergo as part of their treatments, which involve frequent measure-
ments of their bodily dimensions. Nonetheless, this unexpectedﬁnding
did not impair our main results which were focused on the radically dif-
ferent contribution that interoceptive variables had on the body estima-
tion of healthy participants versus patients suffering from AN.
Lastly, regarding the predictive Bayesian account of the relationship
between multisensory bodily illusions and bodily distortions in AN, we
deﬁned a Bayesian model of bodily estimation adapted to VR Full-Body
Illusions that allows us to estimate the prediction error of a bodily per-
ception by weighting both the participant's actual body and the dimen-
sion of the avatar used in the virtual illusion. The prediction error in this
model representshow much the plausibility of the virtual avatar in relation
to the participant's real body is different from the participant's altered expecta-
tions (priors) of their body, i.e., how distorted the participant's prior
expectation is in comparison to the virtual body within the illusion.
Using this model to compare individuals suffering from AN and
healthy control participants, we found that larger negative values for pre-
diction error (i.e., distorted/overestimated prior bodily expectations com-
pared to the virtual body) were associated with larger posterior bodily
estimation distortions (i.e., overestimation of the real body) after the illu-
sion. This suggests that prior erroneous beliefs (i.e., prediction errors)
drove posterior bodily distortions after the illusion in both AN patients
and healthy control participants. On the other hand, smaller or positive
prediction error values (i.e., when participants had corrected prior bodily
expectations) resulted in lower posterior bodily distortions for both AN
patients and healthy control participants at Time 1, during the synchro-
nous condition. These results suggest that prediction errors in bodily esti-
mates were integrated coherently with the multisensory processes
underlying the illusion. However, this pattern was disrupted at Time 2,
where coherent integration of prediction error with the multisensory pro-
cesses of the illusion was only observed in healthy control participants,
while individuals suffering from AN did not show this coherent integra-
tion. This pattern is similar to the previously observed lack of coherent
integration between interoceptive metacognition and ownership across
multisensory processes during the illusion. Based on theseﬁndings, we
may speculate that prediction error requires time to be internalized and
may emerge in later stages of the pathology during chronicization pro-
cesses (Brewerton & Dennis, 2016), thus effectively“locking” the patients
in their prior overestimated (distorted) perception of their body without
the ability to reduce their overestimation by coherently integrating bot-
tom-up information (Riva &
Gaudio, 2012;R i v a ,Gaudio et al., 2015, Riva
& Dakanalis, 2018; Riva & Gaudio, 2018).
In conclusion, our results showed the crucial role of interoceptive
metacognition in embodiment and bodily perceptive distortions.

Interoceptive metacognition seems to function differently in individuals
suffering from Anorexia Nervosa compared to healthy control partici-
pants. While in healthy control participants, interoceptive metacogni-
tion is coherently merged into multisensory integration processes and
higher levels are linked to lower bodily perception distortions, this is
not the case for individuals suffering from AN. During the acute symp-
tomatological phase, AN patients’ interoceptive metacognitive belief
seems to override multisensory integration processes and was positively
related to bodily perception distortions. This suggests that AN patients
prioritize top-down metacognitive beliefs about the body, disregarding
bottom-up bodily perceptions and their multisensory integration. These
pathological patterns were partially recovered after a 12-week rehabili-
tative program suggesting that– at least in early pathological phases–
AN bodily perception deﬁcits still exhibit a degree of plasticity and can
be recovered. From a Bayesian perspective, prediction errors regarding
bodily estimation drove posterior bodily perceptive distortions both in
patients suffering from AN and healthy control participants. However,
while healthy participants coherently merged these prediction errors
with multisensory integration processes, patients suffering from AN
failed to do so, suggesting that the progression of the disease compro-
mised the ability of the patients to coherently integrate their prior
expectations with multisensory bottom-up information, possibly locking
their perception in a distorted prior top-down belief.
Limitations
Measuring interoception is an extremely challenging task, and the
scientiﬁc community is currently working on improving both procedures
and theoretical frameworks to address the ontological problem of mea-
suring inner bodily perceptions (Quigley et al., 2021).
From this point of view, theﬁrst limitation of the current study is the
use of the HCT as a measure of cardiac interoceptive perception. The
heartbeat counting task (HCT), originally developed by Schandry
(1981), has been thoroughly used in interoceptive literature so far and,
albeit several kinds of interoceptive accuracy do exist - e.g., respiratory,
gastric, etc. (Garﬁnkel et al., 2016; van Dyck et al., 2016; Ferentzi et al.,
2018), cardiac interoceptive accuracy remained the most diffused inter-
oceptive measure even in recent literature with clinical and healthy pop-
ulations (DeVille et al., 2021; Haruki & Ogawa, 2021; Manzoor et al.,
2021; Moccia et al., 2021; Terasawa et al., 2021; Vig et al., 2021; Fer-
entzi et al., 2022). Notwithstanding, HCT validity has been recently
questioned based on the argument that it is inﬂuenced by factors that
are not an inherent part of the interoceptive domain. Speciﬁcally, the
HCT has been criticised and it is currently at the centre of a dispute as
several methodological limitations have been highlighted in the original
task, such as the inﬂuence of top-down processes (Körmendi et al.,
2021), time estimation mechanisms, and prior beliefs regarding the
heartbeat rate (Desmedt et al., 2018; Desmedt et al., 2020). On the other
hand, the HCT has been repeatedly validated (Ainley et al., 2020) and
recent literature supported its convergent construct validity (Schulz et
al., 2021). Albeit the dispute is still ongoing, authors partially converged
on the notion that a strict set of instructionsDesmedt et al. (2020)might
improve HCT reliability. Following these recent suggestions (Ferentzi et
al., 2022), we adopted the set of strict instructions (i.e., by encouraging
to count felt heartbeats only and to report zero if no sensations were
detected) to improve the reliability of the HCT task used in this study.
Notwithstanding, the interpretation of the results should consider the
intrinsic bias of the task from the perspective of the current interocep-
tive debate (Desmedt et al., 2022). In this regard, future studies could
rely on more appropriate and solid measures of interoceptive percep-
tions (Ferentzi et al., 2022). As of today, several of these measures are
being developed, however, they still need extensive validation.
In the second instance, future studies that rely on visuotactile stimu-
lation could use wearable mechanical devices to standardize the syn-
chronous and asynchronous stimulation, limiting the bias due to the
procedure administered by the researcher.
Implications for treatment and future directions
The results just discussed suggest that prior metacognitive beliefs
and bodily prediction errors play a relevant role in the clinical symptom-
atological condition of patients suffering from AN, leading to the ques-
tion of how it is possible to modify the precision of prior beliefs and/or
sensory data of this clinical population. Several approaches offer insight
into an effective pathway to modify prior belief and sensory processing.
To brieﬂy summarize, biological psychiatry suggests that pharmacologi-
cal medications could play a relevant role in predictive and active infer-
ence processes. Different authors (Iglesias et al., 2013; Auksztulewicz &
Friston, 2016) suggested that conventional neuromodulators including
acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin and dopamine, and N-methyl-d-aspartate
(NMDA) are involved in synaptic gain control mechanisms and therefore
play a critical role in prediction error signaling. For example, a recent
experimental study (Haarsma et al., 2021) demonstrated that dopamine
plays a key role in the mechanisms underlying the precision weighting
of unsigned prediction errors (the prediction errors that signal surprise).
On the opposite side, psychotherapeutic frameworks imply a relevant
role of cognition and environment in prior beliefs generation and updat-
ing. Both the Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MAN-
TRA) and the Cognitive Behavior Therapy-Enhanced (CBT-E), two of
the most effective psychological treatments of AN (Jansingh et al.,
2020), share different techniques that may inﬂuence the precision of
both prior beliefs and sensory data. Theﬁrst technique called“correct-
ing thinking styles”, involves identifying thinking styles (perpetuating
cognitive models in AN), and alternative thinking styles. In the predic-
tive coding framework, this technique should reduce the precision of
beliefs about one's agency and capacity for control. A second technique
is the“body image module”, which involves identifying overvaluation/
overestimation processes and their consequences, enhancing the impor-
tance of other self-evaluation domains and reducing the importance of
shape and weight. Again, in the predictive coding framework, this tech-
nique should reduce the top-down inﬂuence of prior bodily beliefs,
increasing the bottom-up inﬂuences of “raw” sensations coming from
the physical body. Nevertheless, both psychiatry and psychotherapy
techniques do not directly modify the maladaptive prior beliefs but
rather some of the variables that may inﬂuence their updating. As both
frameworks also require that the intervention– pharmacological or psy-
chotherapeutic
– is followed by the new learning of a preferred behav-
iour different from the maladaptive one, i.e., counteractive learning.
Unfortunately, this process creates a secondary belief (new behaviour)
that competes with the existing maladaptive one, with the risk of relapse
and/or a limited degree of symptom relief (Ecker & Vaz, 2022). As noted
by different authors (Langkaas et al., 2018; Ecker & Vaz, 2022) mild,
partial, incremental change has been the typical outcome in psychiatry
and psychotherapy, both in general and in the treatment of AN (Zeeck et
al., 2018).
To overcome these problems, we recently suggested a new therapeut-
ical approach– regenerative virtual therapy (RVT)– that uses technol-
ogy-based somatic modi ﬁcation techniques to restructure the
maladaptive priors behind a pathological condition (Riva et al., 2019;
Serino et al., 2020; Fernandez-Alvarez et al., 2021; Riva et al., 2021).
The main goal of RVT is to allow a potential revision and de-weighting
of maladaptive prior beliefs (Riva et al., 2017) through the integration
of different technology-based somatic modi ﬁcation techniques with
mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal. Speciﬁcally, RVT is based on the
following steps:
1. The creation of a synthetic full-body illusion in virtual reality that is
synchronized with an interoceptive modulation, to update prior
bodily beliefs.
2. The use of brain stimulation techniques to lessen the impact of pre-
dictions errors made from the top-down distorted prior beliefs,
3. The application of awareness techniques to increase the accuracy of
the multisensory experience to foster bottom-up input integration.
11

4. The re-elaboration of the emotional content of the overall multisen-
sory experience to increase its level of reward using cognitive
reappraisal.
Differently from the methods discussed before, RVT aims at directly
targeting the pathological priors connected to the clinical condition,
generating a transformational change (Riva et al., 2016; Langkaas et al.,
2018) that modiﬁes longstanding symptoms and the altered state of
emotional activation associated to it. RVT is still a new perspective
method based on the principles of computational neuroscience that
need further validation. In this regard, future studies and clinical trials
are required for considering RVT as a possible alternative to the methods
used by psychiatry and psychotherapy.
Conclusions
As underlined byZeeck et al. (2018): “Although progress has been
made in the understanding of psychosocial and biological mechanisms
[of AN] that are responsible for the development of the illness and its
maintenance, there is still an urgent need to optimize treatment
approaches and demonstrate their efﬁcacy.” In this paper, we have sug-
gested that the emergence of a new neuroscience paradigm– predictive
coding accounts of mental diseases– and its related research area– clinical
computational neuroscience– may provide new insights for improving AN
treatment.
Computational neuroscience has two critical advantages that are
reﬂected in this paper (Smith et al., 2021): (i) it allows the development
of mathematical models that enable researchers to simulate neurocom-
putational processes - to conﬁrm how the brain works, and (ii) it allows
the making of empirical predictions for testing which neurocomputa-
tional processes the brain uses. Using this approach, we found that in
patients suffering from AN, actual bodily perceptions (both interoceptive
and proprioceptive – as the ones needed for the body measure estima-
tion task) have less relevance in the processes related to virtual reality
embodiment and real bodily estimations. This enforces the idea that
patients suffering from AN might disregard afferent (bottom-up) intero-
ceptive and proprioceptive bodily inputs in favour of distorted metacog-
nitive beliefs or altered prior expectations (prediction errors) regarding
their body, where these distorted metacognitive beliefs and prediction
errors drive both their ability to embody a virtual avatar and their distor-
tions in perceiving their own body.
Unfortunately, existing treatments only partially target these issues.
Given the promising new research avenues that were inspired by earlier
predictive coding accounts of mental diseases (Smith et al., 2021, Liddle
& Liddle, 2022, Putica et al., 2022), we think this perspective can also
offer unique insights and study into the understanding of mechanisms of
AN and into providing better treatment options.
