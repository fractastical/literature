Editorial on the Research Topic
Distributed and embodied cognition in scientiﬁc contexts
Three decades have passed since the distributed cognition programme began to modify
the landscape of the cognitive sciences ( Hutchins, 1995 , 2000; Kirsh, 2006 ). Distributed
cognition indicates that cognitive systems are individuated not by speciﬁc borders or
boundaries (such as skin or skull) but as distributed in socio-cultural environments
that situate individuals, artifacts, and patterns of their scaﬀolded collaborations across
multiple scales. Among others, the distributed cognition programme has inspired extended,
embodied, and enactive views on cognition (
Clark and Chalmers, 1998 ; Clark, 2005 ; Kirsh,
2010; Farina and Lavazza, 2022a ,b), and with those and other complementary and reciprocal
approaches, it has been seen as one of the mainstays of the contemporary cognitive sciences.
The contributions included in the present Research Topic improve upon our
understanding of distributed cognition in two signiﬁcant ways. On the one hand, they
unpack the theoretical implications of this paradigm in the domains of epistemology and
philosophy of science, the topic that to date has remained somewhat less researched in
the literature. On the other hand, some of the contributions presented in this Research
Topic advance preceding research by aligning it with breakthroughs in computational
embodied/extended neuroscience. Among them are the theory and application of the free
energy principle (
Friston, 2011 ; Clark, 2016 ), which have previously resulted in some fairly
sophisticated accounts of social cognition ( Friston and Frith, 2015 ), with implications for the
social aspects of science ( Nersessian and Chandrasekharan, 2009 ; Beni, 2021 ) and scientiﬁc
methodology ( Beni and Pietarinen, 2021 ; Pietarinen and Beni, 2021 ). The present Research
Topic signposts some recent developments in distributed cognition across the multiplicity
of scientiﬁc contexts.
Hipólito and van Es’s “Enactive-dynamic social cognition and active inference ” draws on
the formal framework of dynamical systems theory (DST) to explain the origins of socio-
cognitive novelty. The negative part of
Hipólito and van Es’s proposal addresses what is
regarded by them as a confusion about active inference, which is sometimes introduced
as a mix of the classic Theory of Mind (ToM) and enactivism. The positive part of their
contribution oﬀers a genuinely enactivist view on active inference as a modeling tool that
(when cast in the framework of DST) explicates social understanding as the generalized
synchronization observed in the natural and life sciences.

Pritchard’s “Socially extended scientiﬁc knowledge ” charts
out the general organization of social cognition and allocates
distributed scientiﬁc knowledge in that structure, in tandem
with developing a virtue-theoretic account of the extension of
cognitive agency that is characteristically found in collaborative
scientiﬁc enterprises. This proposal provides a viable way of
demarcating genuine cases of bona ﬁde technologically extended
scientiﬁc knowledge from cases in which technology only
facilitates scientiﬁc knowledge (in the former case, technology
is suﬃciently integrated into the agent’s cognitive practices to
be a proper part of the extended cognition process, whereas
in the latter case, technology merely facilitates cognition of
the unextended cognitive process without being integrated into
the process).
Gillett et al. , building up and expanding on Kaplan’s(2012)
seminal work on the mutual manipulability criterion (MM), defend
the legitimacy of using mechanistic strategies to demarcate the
bounds of cognition. In other words, by drawing from the literature
on constitutive mechanistic explanations in the philosophy of
science, the authors of this paper develop a new and improved
version of MM, which they claim can be instrumental in assessing
putative cases of extended cognition and hence in pushing forward
the debate about the locus of cognition.
Di Rienzo’spaper proposes bridging the gap between scientiﬁc
knowledge and its practical applications (known in the literature
as the “knowledge-to-action” gap) by situating the analysis of
distributed cognition in the context of clinical practices, which
often involve non-linear interactions and synergies between
materials, socio-cultural environments, and people skillfully
engaging with them.
The distributed cognition programme may beneﬁt from a
formal account of the dynamic interplay between the agent and
its environment. Indeed,
Miller et al.’s contribution, “ Resilience
and active inference ”, oﬀers a free energy-based account of the
“ﬁt” between an agent and their physiological, physical, or cultural
niche. To achieve this goal, they oﬀer a conceptual analysis of
resilience in terms of inertia onto high-precision beliefs, resilience
as elasticity onto relaxation back to characteristic (i.e., attracting)
states, and resilience as plasticity onto functional redundancy and
structural degeneracy.
In “Examining ecological and enactivist approaches to
modeling disability”,
Jurgens raises an issue with the commitment
of enactivist approaches to an individualist methodology. After
arguing that the problem haunts both the theoretical and
practical aspects of enactivist models,
Jurgens suggests that the
enactivist approach could be revamped by adopting elements from
the neurodiversity paradigm and Robert Chapman’s ecological–
functional approach.
The stated goal of this Research Topic has been to investigate
and critically evaluate the relevance, importance, and signiﬁcance
of the current status of distributed cognition in a variety of scientiﬁc
contexts. We hope our readers are equipped with some valuable
insights into this fascinating and lively Research Topic.
