Abstract
Attributing motives to others is a crucial aspect of mentalizing, can be biased by prejudice, and is affected by common psychiatric 
disorders. It is therefore important to understand in depth the mechanisms underpinning it. Toward improving models of mentalizing 
motives, we hypothesized that people quickly infer whether other’s motives are likely beneficial or detrimental, then refine their judg-
ment (classify-refine). To test this, we used a modified Dictator game, a game theoretic task, where participants judged the likelihood of 
intent to harm vs. self-interest in economic decisions. Toward testing the role of serotonin in judgments of intent to harm, we delivered 
the task in a week-long, placebo vs. citalopram study. Computational model comparison provided clear evidence for the superiority of 
classify-refine models over traditional ones, strongly supporting the central hypothesis. Further, while citalopram helped refine attribu-
tions about motives through learning, it did not induce more positive initial inferences about others’ motives. Finally, model comparison 
indicated a minimal role for racial bias within economic decisions for the large majority of our sample. Overall, these results support 
a proposal that classify-refine social cognition is adaptive, although relevant mechanisms of serotonergic antidepressant action will 
need to be studied over longer time spans.

Introduction
Relationships with others play a key role in well-being and social 
harmony; to wit, mental health suffers when important rela-
tionships deteriorate. Clinically, perceiving others as harmful is 
central in conditions ranging from post-traumatic stess disorder 
(PTSD) (assaults) to social anxiety (humiliation) to paranoia (con-
spiracy). It is thus important to understand in depth the ways in 
which perceptions of others, especially regarding under-privileged 
groups (Kaiser Trujillo et al. 2022, Singh et al. 2022), may interact 
with mental well-being.
The “Bayesian Brain Hypothesis” holds that confidence in 
beliefs, even those characterizing paranoia or PTSD, is updated 
by brains (approximately) implementing Bayes’ rule. How strong 
one “belief” is depends on conviction in related ones, so beliefs 
become organized into interconnected hierarchies, ranging from 
simple predictions regarding sensory data to abstract expecta-
tions about self and others, encoding high-level features from the 
environment. Belief-based models account well for data related 
to harm attribution, over and above associative learning models 
(Barnby et al. 2020, 2022), but much remains unclear. For example, 
understanding the neuro-computational basis of polarized attri-
butions about others is at an early stage (Brown et al. 2022, Story
et al. 2024).
The psychological literature has traditionally cast polarized 
thinking as maladaptive, contributing to us–them biases. How-
ever, taking inspiration from recent modeling work (Story et al. 
2024), here we ask whether polarized attributions may origi-
nate 
in useful adult cognition. We propose a “classify-refine” 
hypothesis, whereby people first (1) attempt to rapidly classify
others’ attributes as “beneficial vs. detrimental” to themselves, 
and subsequently (2) to refine beliefs about others through learn-
ing. This may be highly adaptive: quickly telling friend from foe, 
computationally easy, yet allowing one to refine one’s beliefs, 
and go beyond black-and-white thinking. Current understand-
ing contains limitations: We (Hopkins et al. 2021 ) proposed a 
model which, despite its advantages, gives a poor account of 
people’s fast initial learning. Pike (Bone et  al. 2021) addressed 
this with an exponentially reducing learning rate; however, this 
lacks a mechanistic account of why this may be the case. We 
tested new “classify-refine” models that used only one beneficial 
2  Moutoussis et al.
and one detrimental state along each dimension of attribution 
(overviewed in Fig. 2), against previously successful, “classic” 
learning models which employ a fine-grained range along each 
dimension.
Social experiments based on game theory have been useful in 
modeling cognitive processes of inter-personal inference (Raihani 
and Bell 2017, Greenburgh et al. 2019, Barnby et al. 2020, 2022). We 
extend this work toward a more ecologically valid task for prob-
ing brain mechanisms behind attributions, based on the repeated 
Dictator Task (Barnby et al. 2020, 2022). Here, a “dictator” (an on-
screen partner of the participant) decides how to split a sum of 
money between themselves and a “receiver” (the participant), who 
must accept the split. The motivation of the “dictator” is undis-
closed, but receivers rate, for each economic exchange, the extent 
to which decisions may have been motivated by harmful intent vs. 
the extent to which they were motivated by self-interest.
Work with this attribution task has not yet studied some impor-
tant social variables. One variable thought to influence beliefs in 
real life is race or ethnicity. For example, the implicit association 
task has consistently demonstrated implicit race-related biases, 
which frequently but not invariably influence behavior (Maina 
et al. 2018). Toward querying a possible role of race in attributions 
of intent, here we implemented the task using photos of either 
black or white individuals to portray “dictators.”
The neurobiological mechanisms of making attributions are 
uncertain, but may involve serotonin, which is important for 
social cognition. Higher levels are associated with pro-sociality, 
possibly via multiple mechanisms ( Crockett 2009). One mecha-
nism may be reducing attribution of intent-to-harm to others, 
through higher 5HT transporter availability (Yang et al. 2007 ). 
In depression, increased hostility is associated with interpreting 
ambiguous behaviors as hostile ( Smith et al. 2016), while Selec-
tive Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) reduce patient hostility 
in those responding to psychopharmacotherapy (Bian et al. 2024). 
During citalopram therapy, relationship factors are associated 
with improvements in depressive symptoms ( Joseph et al. 2011). 
We thus hypothesized that serotonin may reduce attributions of 
harm intent. To test this, we administered the repeated dicta-
tor task before and after subchronic citalopram treatment, while 
looking for changes in detailed cognitive mechanisms through 
computational modeling.
Increased attribution of harmful intent is implicated in anti-
black racism (Stjohn and Healdmoore 1995). Since then, the 
implicit association task has consistently demonstrated implicit 
race-related biases in the population, which often but not invari-
ably influence behavior (Maina et al. 2018 ). Strikingly, nega-
tive emotionality, which can be ameliorated by SSRIs, has been 
reported to mediate the impact of adverse events on bias against 
out-groups (She et al. 2022). As we increased the validity of our 
study by including diverse photos of either black or white indi-
viduals to portray “dictators” in the task, it became important 
to model and study the interaction between the effect of SSRIs, 
of potential race bias, and harm intent. At the same time, by no 
means do we oversimplify racism as rooted in neurotransmitter 
deficiencies.
In summary, the present study aimed to shed light on the 
neurocognitive basis for how individuals gauge harm vs. self-
interest using Bayesian modeling of a repeated Dictator task that 
we call the Sharing Game. This generated data for testing whether 
in interpersonal situations, individuals initially quickly classify 
others’ attributes as beneficial vs. detrimental to themselves, 
and subsequently refine and update their beliefs (“classify-refine 
hypothesis”). We employed two experimental manipulations to 
test two preregistered predictions. First, we manipulated sero-
tonin levels by randomizing participants to receive citalopram vs. 
placebo. We predicted that citalopram would result in attribut-
ing more beneficent motives. Second, we evaluated whether race 
plays a role in evaluations of harm vs. self-interest by using photos 
of white and black “dictators.” We predicted that more nega-
tive attributions would be made for out-group others (Moutoussis 
et al. 2022) i.e. those identifying as white would make more neg-
ative attributions for non-whites than whites, while non-whites 
would evaluate non-whites more positively than whites.
Materials and methods
Sample
Healthy UK residents were recruited from a University College 
London (UCL) subject pool. They gave informed consent to partic-
ipate in a week-long citalopram 20 mg vs. placebo study, approved 
by the UCL Ethics Committee, ID 19601/001. Participants had no 
history of psychiatric or neurological disorder and agreed not to 
become intoxicated by drugs or alcohol during the study. Seventy-
four participants were enrolled (44/74 self-identified female, 29/74 
male, 0/74 other, 1 missing). In all, 42 participants were random-
ized to citalopram. The commonest ethnicities were white and 
Chinese. The sample was highly educated, young adult (median 
age = 25), and of low income (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Task
In our Sharing Game task (Fig. 1a), a development of the repeated 
dictator task (Barnby et al. 2020, 2022), we increased task length 
by one block, we collected more data per trial, and tested a new 
set of computational models. In so doing we aimed to increase 
the stability and sensitivity of tasks, toward improving the assess-
ment of individual differences, including drug effects. Participants 
thus saw four Dictators, who made either fair (5:5) or unfair 
(10:0) splits of 10 pence of fictive money between themselves 
and the participant (2 Dictators 80% fair, 2 Dictators 20% fair). 
Participants reported their expectations about the fairness level 
of the Dictator, and then made attributions of motivation along 
two salient dimensions: harm-intent (HI) and self-interest (SI). 
(Fig. 1). The dictators were portrayed by photos of women of 
varying age (young adult to middle-aged) and ethnicity (black 
vs white), purchased under license for public use from www.

A total of 73 participants completed the Sharing Game at least 
once; 66 completed it again 1 week later. They faced each dicta-
tor just once, for 12 consecutive trials. A post-experiment survey 
probed awareness of the drug and its subjective effects. Of the 
42 citalopram participants, 25 experienced subjective drug effects 
(all minor) and correctly guessed that they took SSRI.
Modeling
All models had a simple hidden Markov process (HMM) as a cen-
tral “learning core,” implemented as a one-level, 12-trial HMM. 
Each model had three “reporting” processes, generating fairness 
expectation, HI attribution, and SI attribution reports. All mod-
els were derived from a published, successful Bayesian model 
(Barnby et al. 2022). Here we used the active-inference framework, 
which naturally accommodates the process of fast classification, 
accompanied by slower belief refinement ( Smith et al. 2022). We 
now describe the key features of the models (Fig. 2). The param-
eters are explained in Table 1, and their place in the different

Figure 1. One trial of the revised iterated dictator task, a.k.a. “Sharing game.” (a) Expectation stage. Participants were asked to estimate the probability 
that this Dictator would split two coins fairly. (b) Having observed the split (not shown here), participants had to infer the likelihood of SI and HI 
motivating the Dictator. Question order was randomized across trials. The expectation stage preceded attributions within a trial. Computationally, it is 
best thought of as the result of belief updates formed on the basis of the observations made so far, especially in the trial before. Unlike many 
economic games, we displayed ecologically valid Dictator images, and asked whether they elicited motivational attributions more beneficial or 
detrimental to the participant.
models is compared in Fig. 4. Detailed explanations and equations 
follow in the Supplementary data, where Supplementary Fig. S1 
exemplifies the workings of the classify-refine model.
Agents inferred the type of others over an array of SI × HI states, 
utilizing independently parametrized priors over each dimen-
sion (Supplementary Table S1). Each “type” (SI, HI) determined a 
probability of fair-split through a logistic function (Supplemen-
tary Eq. S1). Observed splits allowed agents to invert this model 
and update their beliefs. Beliefs held at the learning “core” pro-
duced “fairness predictions,” “HI reports” and “SI reports” via three 
simple active-inference modules.
In classic models, HI and SI grids had six bins each, with 
fixed values, covering the possible range; but for the classify-
refine models, the central core only had two states along each 
attribution dimension (Fig. 2b), giving four combinations. These, 
however, were not of fixed value, but could be adjusted via learn-
ing. Initially, each was taken to include low (5%) and high (95%) 
values of each attribute, so as to represent the psychological 
meaning of “beneficial” and “detrimental” and span the range of 
each attribute. Crucially, uncertainty over the location of the bins 
was parametrized by a typing confidence parameter aEv (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Beliefs about location of the “beneficial” and 
“detrimental” states were refined by crediting the evidence for 
“fair” or “unfair” split at each trial in proportion to the (posterior) 
belief that said state underlay the trial (Dorfman et al. 2019).
Ethnicity did not directly affect learning, but modulated the 
beliefs fed from the learning to the reporting processes. That is, 
the core HMM learned without taking race into account, but its 
output to the response modules was subject to a bias parameter. 
The magnitude and direction of this bias was fitted individually, 
allowing modeling of the bias in any direction—including being 
positively biased about an out-group.
Model fitting
We fitted participants’ expectations about how the Dictator would 
split the sum, and their attributions of the likely SI and harm-
intending motives of the Dictator, using models parameterized 
as per Table 1. Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) fitting with weakly 
informative priors defined over native parameter space was used 
(Moutoussis et  al. 2018). The sum-log-likelihood at the MAP 
estimate was then used to calculate Bayesian Information Cri-
terion (BIC; corrected for small samples) and Akaike Informa-
tion Criterion for each participant. In cases where a parame-
ter was fitted across the whole participant sample, we modi-
fied the complexity penalty associated with that parameter to 
be consistent with BIC/2 being an approximation to log model 
evidence. Gradient-descent methods (including matlab fmincon
and SPM spm_dcm_mdp; ( SPM development team 2022, MATLAB 
2023) encountered problems with local minima; hence, we used 
adaptive grid-search optimization with multiple initial conditions.
Regression analyses
Model fitting mostly resulted in approximately normal param-
eter distributions in transformed space, where regression anal-
yses were performed. Sometimes, however, outliers occurred. 
We therefore first used robust regression rlm in R (R Core Team 
2021), and we report hypothesis tests based on the t-value of the 
coefficient in question, e.g. rlm(pHI0_follow-up ∼ pHI0_baseline
+ drug_group + gender + subjective_socioecon_status). We then 
performed the equivalent ordinary least squares regression using 
lm and identified points with Cook’s distance > 1 and/or stan-
dardized residual distance > 3 from the theoretically predicted on 
Q-Q plots. We excluded these suspect datapoints from further 
analyses. After these few outliers were excluded, we performed 
longitudinal analyses using linear mixed effects models.
Results
Refined learning accompanies fast classification
In our baseline sample, the classify-refine model was superior to 
the classical learning model (Fig. 3a, median BIC 372.21 vs. 446.69, 
Wilcoxon rank sum P < 1E-5), strongly supporting our hypothe-
sis that individuals rapidly classify others’ attributes as beneficial 
vs. detrimental to themselves, followed by refining their attribu-
tions. People refined their attributions more slowly if they had a

Figure 2. Essentials of classic vs. classify-refine models. (a) In classic models, each of a fine-grained range of states maps to a specific policy. For 
example, the worst possible HI always maps to an “unfair splitting” polity. Participants have to infer which of these many states obtains. (b) In the new 
model, classification into coarse-grained values occurs, i.e. only detrimental and beneficial, but what these mean for each partner is refined through 
learning. (c) Beliefs about states form the “core” of the generative model, updated at each trial. (d) Returns seen at each trial. (e) Participants rated

higher typing confidence parameter, aEv. This quantified the ini-
tial amount of evidence underpinning their beliefs that each type 
of partner would follow a specific policy (a-matrix; see Table 1 
and “Materials and Methods” section). Further model compar-
isons performed on the baseline data indicated the necessity of 
including learning from one dictator to the next (𝜆other in Table 1) 
and imperfect memory for retaining learning from trial to trial (𝜔). 
We then fixed one parameter at a time, in order to discover more 
parsimonious models, or replicate our previous successful models 
as per preregistration. The necessity for all parameters was repli-
cated, except the need for separate uncertainties over prior Harm 
and Selfishness intent [analogous to uSI0 = uPI0 in our previous

only remarkable correlation between parameters was between 
initHarmInt and initSelfInt (baseline r = 0.438, P uncorr.= .000170, 
follow-up r = 0.428, P uncorr.= .000372, Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Coalitional factors: lower subjective status may 
attenuate attributions of harm intent
To examine the preregistered hypothesis that race stereotypes 
would modulate attributions, we examined the effect of a param-
eter that shifted the effective attributions as they were commu-
nicated from the “core belief” module to the “Dictator response 
function” (Fig. 2a and b), based on the apparent ethnicity of the 
Dictator.
Happily, we found strong evidence against our hypothesis that 
including this bias parameter regarding people of color (POC) 
would improve model fit for most participants. The model includ-
ing apparent ethnicity had a median BIC of 372.2, vs. for 366.2 for 
not including ethnicity, Wilcox. P = 8.5E-5). However, 10 of 73 par-
ticipants appeared better fit by a model including POC bias (Fig. 2b 
and c).
In preregistration, we hypothesized that across-participant 
coalitional threat, operationalized as perceiving oneself as of 
lower socioeconomic rank, would increase HI attributions—but 
we found evidence for the opposite. Average harm attribu-
tions increased with Subjective SES (SSES) score, beta = 0.109, 
SE = 0.048, P = .030. This was unchanged controlling for test-
ing wave and drug [HIAv ∼ SSES + wave*drug + (1|participant): 
P = .034, beta= 0.109, SE= 0.050].
The success of the winning model replicated 
between baseline and follow-up waves
A winning model over the baseline sample motivated the hypoth-
esis that the same model would be the best at follow-up. This 
hypothesis held, as the same model had the best total BIC in the 
follow-up testing. Model comparison at baseline vs. follow-up is 
shown at Fig. 4.
We then examined the hypothesis that each parameter of 
the model would show stability, i.e. that it would be correlated 
between baseline and follow-up. To do this, we regressed the 
follow-up values of the parameters on the baseline ones, control-
ling for group allocation (placebo vs. SSRI). We found evidence for 
stability of the following parameters: initHarmInt (P = .0096, adj. 
R2 = 0.096 excl. one outlier; see“Materials and Methods” section), 
decision noise decisPrec (P = .0024, adj. R2 =0.11), prior attribution 
certainty typingConf  (P = .00011, adj. R2 = 0.21 excl. one outlier), 
bias fairnessB (P = 1.5E-5, adj. R2 = 0.253 excl. one outlier; Note this 
is not bias about ethnicity but propensity to attribute beneficence), 
memory learnRet (P = .00122, R2 = 0.132), and learning over dic-
tators 𝜆other (P = .012, R2 =0.071). Other parameters were poorly 
correlated (pS0: P = .194, R2 =0.064; dEv: P = .731, adj. R2 = −0.032 
excl. one outlier; wH: P = .806, R2 =0.010; Ws:P = .436, R2 =−0.022). 
As often found, model fit was the most stable measure (log-
likelihood: P = 2.17E-6, adj. R2 = 0.287) and improved on re-testing 
(See Supplementary Fig. S6, B. vs. A.)
Including predictions along with attributions 
improves task and model stability
We then fitted the winning model only to the harmful intent 
and SI attributions (i.e. like the previously published version of 
the task). In support of preregistered hypothesis C, fewer mea-
sures were correlated at conventional levels of significance, and 
baseline values generally explained less variance of the follow-
up ones. As expected, model fit was most stable (log likelihood: 
P = .0074, adj. R2 = 0.085), and the overall bias fairnessB, deci-
sion noise deciPrec, and learning over dictators 𝜆other also showed 
significant correlations (w0: P = .012, adj. R2 = 0.106; alphaPrec: 
P = .00202, adj. R2 = 0.122; 𝜆other: P = .0208, adj. R2 = 0.055; Sup-
plementary Fig. S5). However, the other measures did not attain 
conventional significance by this simple measure (P-value for 
initHarmInt: 0.235, initSelfInt: 0.90, aEv: 0.814, typingConf: 0.108, 
wHarmInt: 0.228, wSelfInt: 0.948, and learnRet: 0.155).

worse than its main competitor shown here at baseline (c), but considerably better at follow-up (d).
Citalopram may reduce typing confidence, thus 
enhancing refinement of views
We first assessed the stability of the measure of average attribu-
tion levels for an individual per testing wave, as we preregistered 
the hypothesis that citalopram would reduce this measure levels 
across waves. These measures showed good stability, as shown 
by correlating follow-up attributions with baseline ones, while 
controlling for the effect of citalopram. Average HI attributions, 
Inferring motivation and serotonin  7
HIAv, correlated at P = .0015, beta= 0.442, R2 = 0.135. Average Self-
interest, SIAv, showed P= .0023, beta = 0.409, R2 = 0.152. Predic-
tions (predAv) showed P= 1.17E-5, beta= 0.437, R2 = 0.249.
We used linear mixed effects analysis [measure∼ wave*drug +
(1 | participant)] to assess the effect of citalopram. We found no 
evidence that citalopram affected HI attributions, P = .11 for the 
wave*drug term for measure = HIAv. There was modest evidence 
that SI attributions were enhanced by citalopram (wave*drug for 
SIAv: beta= 0.269, SE = 0.134, P =.0484). Average expectation was 
unaffected, P for predAv= 0.48.
We found a possible novel effect of citalopram on the con-
fidence of typing characters, typingConf. Otherwise, modeling 
measures were consistent with the analysis of average attribu-
tions, i.e. there was a modest effect of SSRI increasing init-
SelfInt (pSI0: beta = 1.32, SE = 0.62, P = .037), consistent with SIAv 
above. The novel effect was a decrease typingConf by citalo-
pram (aEv: wave*drug P = .023, beta= −1.18, SE= 0.50). This would 
enhance the attribution-refining process. Notably, this was on 
a background of initSelfInt reducing with wave (pS0: P = .014, 
beta = −2.612, SE = 1.033), unlike initHarmInt (pH0: P = .153). The 
wave*drug effect for other measures was unremarkable ( P val-
ues: LL: 0.729, initHarmInt: 0.217, dEv: 0.743, alphaPrec: 0.7638, 
fairnessB: 0.568, wHarmInt: 0.979, wS: 0.11, ω: 0.303, λother: 0.898).
Guessing which group participants were in was not associated 
with initSelfInt (P= .24), SIAv (P= .60), or typingConf ( P = .76); 
hence, expectation effects are unlikely to account for our findings.
Psychometric findings and the effect of 
citalopram
We administered the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) at base-
line, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self Esteem, 
Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, Perceived Stress 
Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder—7, and the Achievement 
Motivation Inventory at both baseline and follow-up. We exam-
ined the dependence of follow-up scores on citalopram treatment, 
controlling for baseline scores, gender, SSES, and HPS. Citalo-
pram had no statistically significant effect on any of the scores 
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
In order to reduce dimensionality and increase sensitivity, 
we performed a factor analysis on the baseline state-like symp-
toms (i.e. not the HPS), resulting in two factors on the basis 
of parallel analysis and scree plot ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). We 
tested the validity and stability of this by deriving factor scores 
on baseline and follow-up based on the baseline loadings only. 
The first factor scores, “anxious depression” correlated r = 0.791, 
P < 1E-10. The second factor scores, “stressful amotivation,” corre-
lated at r = 0.803, P < 1E-10, both showing good stability. Anxious 
depression was not affected by SSRI [anxDep ∼ wave*drug + (1 | 
participant) gave P = .759] but stressful amotivation marginally 
improved, P = .052, beta = −0.25. Exploratory linear regressions 
found no evidence that variance in psychometric ratings, or 
changes in these ratings, was related to model parameters.
Discussion
We sought to refine our understanding of the computational basis 
of attributing motives and examined the role of serotonin and 
ethnicity in such attributions. We tested whether SSRI treatment 
may promote attributions of more beneficent motives to others; 
and whether factors often postulated to recruit subtle coali-
tional dynamics, namely apparent race and subjective socioeco-
nomic status, affected attribution of motives. Importantly, we 
found strong evidence in favor of our hypothesized “classify-
refine” models, which postulated that participants rapidly
classified others’ attributes as positive or negative, and then 
sought to refine attributions. One week’s treatment with citalo-
pram did not result in more magnanimous attributions (Moutous-
sis et al. 2022), but exploratory evidence suggested that it ren-
dered the process of belief refinement more flexible. Contrary 
to our hypotheses regarding ethnicity, apparent race did not 
affect positive or negative attributions, consistent with most of 
our participants’ decision-making being unbiased in this respect. 
Notably, low subjective socioeconomic status reduced rather than 
increased attributions of harmful intent.
In line with our preregistered modeling hypotheses, we repli-
cated the set of features, or parameters, needed to model the 
data according to our previous work—with one exception (Barnby 
et al. 2022 ). That is, prior belief uncertainty over HI and Self-
interest could be condensed into a single uncertainty parameter. 
This is important, as the replication entails a task in a different 
population, a laboratory-based pharmacology experiment, with 
added task features of naturalistic photos of the “partner,” and 
questions about expected frequency of fair outcomes (Fig. 1). We 
found good evidence that the version of the task including these 
new questions was more stable, or reliable, than the original—as 
we predicted [(Moutoussis et al. 2022), main Hypothesis C]. Our 
close replication of a robust correlation between initial beliefs 
in HI and SI ( Barnby et al. 2022) suggests two things. First, that 
there is a general propensity to attribute beneficent vs. detri-
mental motives. Second, that future studies should consider 
their commonality (harm-benefit intent) and contrast (other-self 
focus). Here we used active-inference, which offers a natural 
framework for our models, but our modeling findings can be 
implemented in other frameworks (like reinforcement learning)
too.
The winning classify-refine learning shares much with 
posterior-belief-based credit allocation models (Dorfman et  al. 
2019), and has been considered in some detail by Story and co-
authors in the context of “black and white thinking” ( Story et al. 
2024). Here, we suggest that classify-refine updating may be a use-
ful socio-cognitive strategy, rather than suboptimal black-and-
white thinking. It is advantageous to rapidly distinguish friend 
from foe, and then do more justice to the true nature of others. It 
may thus be an example of benign “thinking fast and slow” (Kah-
neman 2011). Classify-refine may also explain the fast-then-slow 
social learning shown by Bone, Pike and co-workers, and others 
(Bone et al. 2021, Hopkins et al. 2021 ). Bone et  al. fitted their 
data with associative models wherein learning rates decayed in 
novel ways, partially inspiring the present work. Future research 
should compare our (Bayesian) classify-refine models with asso-
ciative learning employing multiple learning processes, by which 
the brain may approximate Bayesian inference. But how might 
classify-refine relate to the well-recognized, maladaptive polar-
ized thinking? This could be about the failure of the “refine” 
process, either due to excessive “typing confidence” leading to per-
sistent stereotyping, or by circular causation induced by tit-for-tat 
strategies.
Citalopram treatment did not increase attribution of more 
prosocial motives, either in terms of increasing the proportion 
of fair returns that participants expected, their average HI and 
SI attributions, nor the parameters pHI0 and pSI0. Indeed, there 
was weak evidence for a relative increase in average SI and pSI0 
(both at the 0.05 level uncorrected). Citalopram did not affect 
our healthy participants’ psychometric measures either, so the 
possibility remains that it may only ameliorate truly depressive 
attributions, or over a longer time course. We found intriguing 
exploratory evidence—much in need of replication—that citalo-
pram may reduce certainty over character types, allowing for 
8  Moutoussis et al.
faster learning of others’ true nature, and that it may reduce 
stress-induced amotivation.
Still, our computational modeling hints at neurobiological 
mechanisms yet to be established. This is important, as SSRIs are 
thought to have prosocial effects in patients who benefit from 
them ( Bian et  al. 2024), but the specific mechanisms involved 
are unclear, and very complex (Kiser et al. 2012, Duerler et al. 
2022
). Serotonin may interact with existing expectations to affect 
changes in dopaminergic transmission, associated with changes 
in social anxiety (Hjorth et al. 2021). Thus improvements in slow 
social learning may be particularly salient for depression suffer-
ers, who have higher harm-attribution expectations than healthy 
people. We thus speculate that during the treatment of depression 
with SSRIs, a synergy of psychological factors (expectations and 
learning) with changes in serotonergic neurotransmission may be 
required to build more benign priors about the social world. This 
may be implemented by changes in dopaminergic transmission 
(Barnby et al. 2024) in the basal ganglia, more or less specific to 
social contexts.
Important calls have been made in recent years toward a trans-
lational neuroscience sensitive to its own biases, one which is to 
elucidate and help mitigate prejudice (Iyer 2022, Kaiser Trujillo 
et al. 2022, Singh et al. 2022). Our findings about the role of race 
were unexpected, and in a sense cause for celebration. Models 
that included a parameter that would change motivational attri-
butions depending on the ethnicity of the partner, a parameter 
which was able to capture any direction of such effect at the 
individual level, were rejected as they did not improve model fit—
although a few individuals may be prone to this bias, and they 
may have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged individu-
als. Our findings contrast with literature showing affective biases 
against people of color (Davies and Turnbull 2011) and are consis-
tent with decision-making findings where appropriately educated 
participants behaved fairly toward POC others, despite having 
low-level affective biases ( Correll et al. 2007). Lower socioeco-
nomic self-ranking was associated, again contrary to our hypothe-
ses, with lower attributions of harm intent, a positive finding in 
the sense of lack of evidence for excessive mistrust in this group. 
We note that our participants were predominantly young, highly 
educated women from BAME backgrounds, the most common 
ethnicity being Chinese. Groups with a different experience of 
social disadvantage, or indeed advantage, may attribute motives 
differently. Although, therefore, our sample is not representative 
of the UK population, our inability to detect signs of attribu-
tion bias and socioeconomic-based suspiciousness are cause for 
measured celebration.
In terms of limitations, our study did not involve participants 
with clinically significant symptoms, nor did citalopram have an 
effect on their mood and anxiety, rendering moot the question of 
whether the attributional problems of depression are ameliorated 
by SSRIs. It would be important, therefore, for longer, clinical stud-
ies to include social-cognitive tasks such as the one used here. 
Similarly, the happy absence of detectable biases related to low 
subjective socioeconomic status or ethnicity needs replication in 
samples more representative of the general population.
In conclusion, classify-refine models appear to hold much 
promise for social neuroscience, have normalizing implications 
for “black-and-white” thinking, are well served by the active infer-
ence framework, and have learning-relevant parameters that may 
depend on serotonin function. SSRIs appear to have little effect 
on the motives and expectations healthy people have of each 
other. Importantly, computational neuroscience studies should be 
equipped to interrogate burning issues such as social inequality 
or racial biases, but, as importantly, also to elucidate mechanisms 
behind “the glass being half full.”
