Redefining ADHD in the Light of Predictive Coding and Active Inference: A Neuro 
Developmental Perspective 
Research Article
Richard Murdoch Mongomery*
Abstract
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is traditionally conceptualized within a framework emphasizing deficits 
in attention regulation and executive function. However, emerging evidence from the fields of predictive coding and active 
inference offers a novel lens through which to understand ADHD not merely as a disorder of attention but as a distinctive 
mode of neurodevelopmental variation. This article synthesizes current research and theoretical models to propose a redefined 
understanding of ADHD. By integrating insights from Ryan Smith, Paul B. Badcock, and Karl J. Friston (2020), we explore the 
premise that individuals with ADHD exhibit unique differences in how their brains generate and update predictions about the 
environment, leading to the characteristic behavioral patterns observed in ADHD. We argue that ADHD involves a divergence 
in the brain's predictive models and its ability to minimize prediction error, impacting sensory processing, attention allocation, 
and motor control. This perspective illuminates the adaptive aspects of ADHD, suggesting that what are often labeled as deficits 
could also reflect an adaptive fit to certain environmental contexts, underscoring the role of neurodiversity in human evolution. 
Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this reconceptualization for clinical practice, including diagnosis, treatment, and 
support for individuals with ADHD, emphasizing approaches that align with their unique neurocognitive profiles. This article 
calls for a shift in the narrative surrounding ADHD, advocating for a model that appreciates the complexity and adaptiveness 
of neurodevelopmental diversity.

1. Introduction 
The burgeoning field of computational neuropsychology has 
significantly advanced our understanding of brain function, 
leveraging the principles of Bayesian inference to model the 
complex dynamics of neural processes. Central to this endeavor 
has been the work of pioneers like Karl Friston, who, along with 
collaborators such as Thomas Parr, Paul Badcock, and others, has 
elucidated the mechanisms by which the brain engages with its 
environment through predictive coding and active inference. This 
introduction draws on seminal contributions from these researchers 
to frame our exploration of the brain's predictive capabilities 
and their implications for understanding clinical disorders and 
cognitive processes. 
At the heart of this exploration is the concept of the brain as a 
prediction machine, as detailed in the work of Parr and Friston 
(2017), where computational models are employed to understand 
the neural underpinnings of psychological phenomena. This 
perspective is further elaborated in Friston and Parr's (2020) 
investigation into the role of active inference in clinical disorders, 
suggesting a fundamental reevaluation of pathologies like 
schizophrenia through the lens of failed predictive processes [1-3]. 
The significance of predictive coding extends beyond pathological 
states, as highlighted by Badcock et al. (2017), who propose an 
evolutionary systems theory to account for the neurobiological 
basis of depression, suggesting that mood disorders may arise 
from maladaptive predictive models. 
 
Smith and Friston's (2020) examination of attention and sensory 
processing through predictive coding provides insights into how 
the brain modulates its response to surprising events, underscoring 
the adaptive nature of neural computation. This is complemented 
by Pezzulo, Parr, and Friston's (2021) discourse on the evolution 
of brain architectures, which posits that the complexity of neural 
structures is a direct outcome of the need to efficiently manage 
prediction and inference within an ever-changing environment [4-
7]. 
Further foundational work by Feldman and Friston (2010) and 
Friston's solo contributions (2005, 2009, 2011) delve into the

intricacies of attention, uncertainty, and the free-energy principle, 
providing a theoretical framework that integrates perception, 
action, and cognition into a cohesive model of brain function. This 
model posits that the brain strives to minimize the discrepancy 
between predicted and encountered sensory inputs, a process that 
underlies both normative and pathological cognitive states [8]. 
The predictive coding framework, rigorously reviewed by 
Millidge and Seth (2021), offers a comprehensive overview of the 
theoretical and experimental support for this model, illustrating its 
applicability across a range of cognitive functions and its potential 
to revolutionize our approach to neuropsychiatric treatment and 
diagnosis.  In synthesizing these contributions, this article aims 
to highlight the profound impact of predictive coding and active 
inference on our understanding of the brain. By conceptualizing 
cognitive and clinical phenomena within this framework, 
we not only gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity of 
neural computation but also open new avenues for therapeutic 
intervention. As we explore the intricacies of this model, we are 
reminded of the brain's remarkable ability to navigate and interpret 
the world, a testament to the evolutionary and adaptive processes 
that have shaped its development [9-10]. 
2. Methodology 
2.1 Literature Review 
A comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather existing 
research on ADHD, predictive coding, and active inference. Key 
databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, 
were searched using keywords such as "ADHD," "predictive 
coding," "active inference," "neurodevelopment," and "executive 
function." Articles from the last two decades were prioritized to 
ensure contemporary relevance. The review included seminal 
papers by Friston, Parr, Badcock, and their colleagues, as well 
as more recent studies that have built upon or challenged these 
foundational theories. 
2.2 Theoretical Framework Integration 
The theoretical models of predictive coding and active inference 
were synthesized to construct a comprehensive framework 
for understanding ADHD. This involved integrating insights 
from key studies to elucidate how these models can explain the 
neurocognitive profiles of individuals with ADHD. The synthesis 
process included identifying common themes, contrasting different 
perspectives, and highlighting gaps in the current understanding. 
2.3 Case Study Analysis 
To illustrate the practical implications of the theoretical framework, 
case studies of individuals diagnosed with ADHD were analyzed. 
These case studies were selected from clinical reports and 
existing research literature that provided detailed neurocognitive 
assessments and longitudinal data. The case studies were used 
to demonstrate how predictive coding and active inference can 
explain the behavioral and cognitive patterns observed in ADHD 
[11]. 
2.4 Model Development 
A conceptual model of ADHD as a neurodevelopmental variation 
was developed based on the integrated theoretical framework. This 
model emphasizes the role of divergent predictive models and 
prediction error minimization in shaping the sensory processing, 
attention allocation, and motor control characteristic of ADHD. 
The model was iteratively refined through expert consultations 
and feedback from specialists in neurodevelopmental disorders 
and computational neuroscience. 
2.5 Implications for Clinical Practice 
The practical implications of the proposed model were explored 
through a qualitative analysis of current diagnostic and treatment 
practices for ADHD. This involved reviewing clinical guidelines, 
treatment protocols, and patient outcomes to assess how well 
they align with the new theoretical insights. Recommendations 
for enhancing clinical practice to better support individuals with 
ADHD were formulated based on this analysis [12]. 
2.6 Data Analysis 
Qualitative data from the literature review and case studies were 
thematically analyzed to identify patterns and draw connections 
between predictive coding, active inference, and ADHD. 
Quantitative data, where available, were used to support qualitative 
findings and provide a more robust evidence base for the proposed 
model [13]. 
2.7 Validation and Peer Review 
The proposed model and its clinical implications were subjected 
to peer review by experts in neurodevelopmental disorders, 
computational neuroscience, and clinical psychology. Feedback 
from these reviews was incorporated to refine the model and ensure 
its theoretical robustness and practical relevance. The final model 
was validated through presentations at academic conferences and 
discussions with clinical practitioners. This methodology ensures 
a thorough and rigorous approach to re-conceptualizing ADHD 
within the frameworks of predictive coding and active inference, 
providing a solid foundation for the proposed paradigm shift in 
understanding and treating this neurodevelopmental condition 
[14]. 
3. Discussion 
3.1 Reconceptualizing ADHD through Predictive Coding and 
Active Inference 
The reconceptualization of ADHD within the frameworks of 
predictive coding and active inference provides a fresh perspective 
that goes beyond traditional deficit-based views. ADHD, 
characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, can 
be understood as a manifestation of divergent neurodevelopmental 
pathways, where the brain's predictive models and mechanisms 
for minimizing prediction error operate differently compared to 
neurotypical development [15]. 
3.2 Divergent Predictive Models 
Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates and 
      Volume 1 | Issue 3 | 3

updates predictions about sensory inputs. For individuals with 
ADHD, this process may be fundamentally altered. The divergence 
in predictive models can lead to difficulties in maintaining 
attention and prioritizing sensory inputs. These individuals may 
have heightened or misaligned predictions that do not match the 
actual sensory environment, resulting in frequent prediction errors. 
This misalignment can explain the characteristic inattentiveness 
seen in ADHD, where attention is not sustained on tasks that do 
not align with their predictive expectations. 
3.3 Impacts on Sensory Processing and Attention Allocation 
The difficulties in sensory processing and attention allocation in 
ADHD can be attributed to the brain's ongoing efforts to minimize 
prediction error. In ADHD, there may be an increased sensitivity 
to unexpected stimuli, leading to heightened distractibility. 
This sensitivity can cause individuals to frequently shift their 
attention in an attempt to resolve prediction errors, manifesting 
as hyperactivity and impulsivity. The struggle to align internal 
predictions with external sensory inputs can result in a chaotic 
attentional landscape, where focus is continuously redirected. 
3.4 Motor Control and Behavioral Manifestations 
Motor control in ADHD can also be understood through the lens of 
predictive coding and active inference. Hyperactive behaviors may 
arise from the brain's attempts to predict and prepare for motor 
actions. When these predictions are not met with corresponding 
sensory feedback, the brain generates new motor commands in an 
attempt to correct the perceived error. This can lead to a cycle of 
continuous motor activity, as seen in hyperactivity. Impulsivity, on 
the other hand, may result from an inability to inhibit prepotent 
responses due to a mismatch in the predicted and actual outcomes 
of actions. 
3.5 Adaptive Aspects of ADHD 
Viewing ADHD through this theoretical framework also highlights 
potential adaptive aspects of the condition. The heightened 
sensitivity to novel stimuli and rapid shifting of attention could be 
advantageous in certain environmental contexts, promoting quick 
detection of changes and adaptability. This perspective aligns 
with the concept of neurodiversity, suggesting that what are often 
labeled as deficits may also reflect adaptive strategies that have 
been evolutionarily beneficial in specific contexts. 
3.6 Clinical Implications 
The reconceptualization of ADHD has significant implications 
for clinical practice. Traditional diagnostic criteria and treatment 
approaches may not fully capture the complexity of ADHD as a 
neurodevelopmental variation. A predictive coding framework 
suggests that interventions should focus on aligning predictive 
models with sensory inputs. This could involve cognitive training 
exercises designed to enhance attentional control and prediction 
accuracy or therapeutic approaches that help individuals better 
anticipate and respond to environmental stimuli. Pharmacological 
treatments could also be reconsidered in light of this framework. 
Medications that modulate neurotransmitter systems involved 
in prediction and reward processing, such as dopamine and 
norepinephrine, may be particularly effective. Additionally, 
neurofeedback techniques that provide real-time feedback on brain 
activity could help individuals with ADHD learn to adjust their 
predictive models more effectively. 
3.7 Ethical and Societal Considerations 
This new understanding of ADHD also prompts a reevaluation 
of societal attitudes towards neurodevelopmental conditions. 
Recognizing ADHD as a variation rather than a deficit challenges 
the stigma often associated with the condition. It advocates for a 
more inclusive approach that values neurodiversity and supports 
individuals in leveraging their unique strengths. This perspective 
calls for educational and occupational environments that are more 
accommodating and supportive of diverse cognitive styles [1,12]. 
3.8 Future Research Directions 
Further research is needed to empirically validate the predictive 
coding and active inference models in ADHD. Longitudinal 
studies that track the development of predictive models in 
individuals with ADHD from childhood through adulthood could 
provide valuable insights into how these processes evolve over 
time. Neuroimaging studies that examine brain activity patterns 
associated with prediction error minimization in ADHD could also 
help elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the condition.  
Moreover, experimental interventions based on predictive coding 
principles should be developed and tested. These interventions 
could include targeted cognitive training programs, neurofeedback, 
and novel pharmacological treatments. Research should also 
explore the potential benefits of adaptive strategies observed in 
ADHD, investigating how these can be harnessed in educational 
and professional settings to improve outcomes for individuals with 
the condition [6,10]. 
3.9 Integrating Predictive Coding with Existing Models 
While predictive coding and active inference offer a robust 
framework for understanding ADHD, it is important to integrate 
these insights with existing models of the disorder. The executive 
function and reward processing theories of ADHD provide 
valuable perspectives that can complement the predictive coding 
approach. A comprehensive model that incorporates multiple 
theoretical frameworks could offer a more holistic understanding 
of ADHD, guiding more effective and personalized interventions.  
In conclusion, the application of predictive coding and active 
inference to ADHD represents a significant advancement in our 
understanding of the condition. It challenges traditional deficit-
based models, offering a more nuanced view that recognizes 
the complexity and potential adaptive aspects of ADHD. This 
reconceptualization has profound implications for clinical practice, 
societal attitudes, and future research, paving the way for a more 
inclusive and effective approach to supporting individuals with 
ADHD.

4. Conclusions 
This article has explored the reconceptualization of Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through the frameworks of 
predictive coding and active inference, offering a fresh perspective 
that transcends traditional deficit-based views. By understanding 
ADHD as a neurodevelopmental variation characterized by unique 
differences in the brain's predictive models and mechanisms for 
minimizing prediction error, we gain deeper insights into the 
condition's complexity and adaptive potential. The theoretical 
synthesis presented in this paper suggests that ADHD involves 
divergent predictive models that impact sensory processing, 
attention allocation, and motor control. This divergence leads 
to characteristic behaviors such as inattention, hyperactivity, 
and impulsivity, which can be understood as the brain's ongoing 
attempts to align predictions with sensory inputs. Moreover, this 
perspective highlights the adaptive aspects of ADHD, proposing 
that behaviors often viewed as deficits may, in fact, represent 
evolutionary advantages in certain contexts. 
The implications for clinical practice are profound. A shift 
towards interventions that align predictive models with sensory 
inputs, such as cognitive training, neurofeedback, and targeted 
pharmacological treatments, promises to improve outcomes for 
individuals with ADHD. Additionally, this reconceptualization 
calls for a reevaluation of societal attitudes, advocating for a 
more inclusive approach that values neurodiversity and supports 
individuals in leveraging their unique strengths. Ethical and societal 
considerations further underscore the need to recognize ADHD as 
part of the spectrum of human cognitive diversity. This perspective 
encourages the development of educational and occupational 
environments that accommodate diverse cognitive styles, fostering 
a more supportive and inclusive society. Future research should 
focus on empirically validating the predictive coding and active 
inference models in ADHD, exploring longitudinal and functional 
(EEG) and neuroimaging studies, and developing experimental 
interventions based on these principles. Integrating insights from 
existing models of ADHD with the predictive coding framework 
will also be crucial in forming a comprehensive understanding of 
the disorder. 
In summary, the application of predictive coding and active 
inference to ADHD represents a significant advancement in our 
understanding of the condition. It challenges traditional models, 
offering a more nuanced and adaptive view that recognizes the 
complexity of ADHD. This reconceptualization has the potential to 
transform clinical practice, societal attitudes, and future research, 
paving the way for a more inclusive and effective approach to 
supporting individuals with  ADHD [15].
