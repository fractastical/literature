A scheme to provide various mean-ﬁeld-type approximation algorith ms is presented by
employing the Bethe free energy formalism to a family of replicated sy stems in conjunction
with analytical continuation with respect to the number of replicas. In the scheme, survey
propagation (SP), which is an eﬃcient algorithm developed recently f or analyzing the micro-
scopic properties of glassy states for a ﬁxed sample of disordered systems, can be reproduced
by assuming the simplest replica symmetry on stationary points of th e replicated Bethe free
energy. Belief propagation and generalized SP can also be oﬀered in t he identical framework
under assumptions of the highest and broken replica symmetries, r espectively.
KEYWORDS: survey propagation, belief propagation, Bethe approximation, replica method,

Recent research in cross-disciplinary ﬁelds involving sta tistical mechanics and information
sciences has shown that methods and concepts from physics ca n be useful in the development
and analysis of eﬃcient algorithms for computing probabili ties or solving combinational prob-
lems.1) One of the most prominent examples in such research is the dev elopment of survey
propagation (SP). 2) This algorithm approximately evaluates the microscopic av erages of dy-
namical variables in a feasible amount of time for a ﬁxed samp le of disordered systems utilizing
the concept of replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which was di scovered in the study of spin
glasses.3) SP has been reported to give excellent results in studies on s pin glass models 4) and in
various combinatorial problems, 2, 5) promoting further extension of the applicable range. 6) It
has also been shown that SP reproduces the one-step RSB (1RSB ) solution of replica theory 3)
when applied to the mean-ﬁeld-type spin glass models. 7) This clarity of behavior is an impor-
tant feature of the SP algorithm. However, the nature of solu tions found by SP for general
systems remains poorly understood, which may restrict the r ange of possible applications.
The aim of the present Letter is to partially resolve this pro blem. More precisely, a family
of approximation algorithms employing the Bethe free energ y formalism 8, 9) is proposed for
replicated systems. Analytically extending the proposed a lgorithms with respect to the number
of replicas x = 1 , 2,... to x ∈ R under the simplest replica symmetric ansatz turns out to
provide a general expression of SP, in which x plays the role of a parameter specifying the

size of a subgroup of replicas in the conventional 1RSB schem e.3) In this way, SP can only
converge to a point oﬀered by the analytical continuity of sta tionary points of the x-replicated
Bethe free energy.
As a basis for proposed algorithms, consider a joint distrib ution of N dimensional state
variables S = ( S1,S 2,...,S N), as given by
P(S) = Z−1
M∏
µ=1
ψµ(Sµ)
N∏
l=1
ψl(Sl), (1)
where ψµ(Sµ) and ψl(Sl) are termed the clique and local evidences, which are depend ent on a
certain subset of multiple components (clique) Sµ and a single component Sl, respectively, and
Z = ∑
S
∏ M
µ=1 ψµ(Sµ) ∏ N
l=1 ψl(Sl) is the partition function. For simplicity, only the Ising s pin
systems S = {+1, −1}N are considered here, but extension to other cases is straigh tforward.
In such systems, evaluation of the marginal probabilities,
P(Sl) =
∑
S\Sl
P(S), (2)
is in general computationally diﬃcult, where X\Y denotes a subset of X from which Y is
excluded. The development of computationally tractable al gorithms achieving an accurate
approximation of eq. (2) is therefore of great importance.
The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), as given by
KL(Q|P) =
∑
S
Q(S) ln Q(S)
P(S), (3)
where Q(S) is an arbitrary test distribution of S, oﬀers a useful guideline for developing
such an algorithm. As KL( Q|P) is always nonnegative and minimized to zero if and only if
Q(S) = P(S), the minimization of KL( Q|P) with respect to Q(S) generally yields the correct
distribution Q(S) = P(S). Direct application of this algorithm, however, is not par ticularly
useful for computing eq. (2) because P(S) itself is in general not computationally tractable.
Instead, applying this variational (minimization) princi ple of KLD or its approximation to a
family of tractable test distributions systematically lea ds to a number of potentially eﬀective
approximation algorithms.
The central idea of the present treatment is the application of this principle not to the
original system but to a family of replicated systems, as fol lows:
Px({Sa}) =
x∏
a=1
P(Sa), (4)
where {Sa} is an abbreviation of the set of replicated systems {S1, S2,..., Sx}. The abbre-
viations {Sa
l } and {Sa
µ} are also used to represent {S1
l ,S 2
l,...,S x
l } and {S1
µ, S2
µ,..., Sx
µ},
respectively. Equation (4) yields the following equality r egarding free energy:
− ln Z = Fx(Q) − 1
xKL(Q|Px), (5)
2/9
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. Letter
which holds for arbitrary x= 1 , 2,... and the test distribution Q({Sa}), where
Fx(Q) = 1
x
∑
{S
a
}
Q({Sa}) ln Q({Sa})
∏ x
a=1
( ∏ M
µ=1 ψµ(Sa
µ) ∏ N
l=1 ψl(Sa
l )
) . (6)
As the true free energy − ln Z is constant, this implies that the minimization of KL( Q|Px)
is equivalent to that of Fx(Q). This yields the correct distribution Q({Sa}) = Px({Sa}) =
∏ x
a=1 P(Sa). Since ∏ x
a=1 P(Sa) is simply a product of duplications of eq. (1), the minimiza -
tion of eq. (3) for the original system and Fx(Q) for the replicated system are equivalent.
The introduction of the family of replicas therefore provid es no beneﬁts as long as the search
for the optimal test distribution covers all feasible funct ional spaces. However, the replicated
formalism can potentially provide better approximation ac curacy than the original algorithm
when the test distributions are limited to a tractable famil y or when the cost functions are
somewhat approximated, as the tractable family or characte ristics of the approximated func-
tion depend on the number of replicas x.
To show this, we approximate Fx(Q) by the Bethe free energy 8, 9) of the x-replicated
system, as follows:
Fx(Q) ≃ F Bethe
x ({bµ}, {bl})

N∑
l=1
(1 − Cl)
∑
{Sa
l }
bl({Sa
l }) ln bl({Sa
l })∏ x
a=1 ψl(Sa
l ), (7)
where L(µ) is the set of elements that directly relate to clique µ and Cl is the number of cliques
to which element Sl is directly related. The test distributions bµ({Sa
µ}) and bl({Sa
l }) are termed
beliefs which approximate the marginals ∑
{S
a
}\{S
a
µ } Px({Sa}) and ∑
{S
a
}\{Sa
l } Px({Sa}),
respectively, when FBethe
x is extremized. Note that since both of these marginals are re duced
from the identical distribution Px({Sa}), the reducibility condition
∑
{S
a
µ }\{Sa
l }
bµ({Sa
µ}) = bl({Sa
l }), (8)
must hold when Sl is an element of Sµ.
If the variable dependence in eq. (1) is represented by a cycl e-free graph, eq. (7) under
this constraint agrees exactly with Fx(Q) for the test distribution Q({Sa}) =
∏ M
µ =1 bµ ({S
a
µ })
∏ N
l=1 b
Cl− 1
l ({Sa

,
in which case extremizing eq. (7) leads to the exact assessme nt of eq. (2). 9, 10) Unfortunately,
Fx(Q) and FBethe
x ({bµ}, {bl}) do not accord in general. However, this indicates that the s ta-
tionary point of eq. (7) may provide a good approximation whe n the inﬂuence of the cycles
can be regarded as weak.
Extremizing eq. (7) with respect to the beliefs, adding the t erms
∑
{Sa

( ∑
{S

)
, where λµl({Sa

multipliers imposing constraint (8), yields
bµ({Sa

∏ x

l∈L(µ)(e−λµl ({Sa

. (10)
Then, inserting eqs. (9) and (10) into eq. (8) aﬀords the stati onary point condition of the
Lagrange multipliers, which can be read as
e−ˆλµl ({Sa

∑
{S

A remarkable property of these replicated systems is the inv ariance of stationary conditions
(11) and (12) under the permutation of replica indices a= 1 , 2,...,x . This naturally leads to
the assumption that the stationary point possesses the same symmetry. In the case of Ising
spin systems S = {+1, −1}N, this can be represented as the simplest replica symmetric ( RS)
ansatz on the Lagrange multipliers,

without a loss of generality, 11) where πl→µ(h) and ˆπµ→l(ˆh) are distributions that absorb the
degree of freedom of the Lagrange multipliers. Inserting th ese multipliers into eqs. (11) and
(12) provides a couple of saddle point equations in which ˆ πµ→l(ˆh) and πl→µ(h) are solved
explicitly for given πl→µ(h) and ˆπµ→l(ˆh), respectively. The natural iteration of the resultant
equations yields a family of algorithms that are parameteri zed by the number of replicas

There are two features to note here. First, the beliefs can be evaluated by inserting eq. (13)
into eqs. (9) and (10) using the stationary solution of eqs. ( 15) and (16). Speciﬁcally, eq. (10)
can be assessed as bl({Sa
l }) =
∫
dhρl(h) eh ∑ x
a=1 Sa
l
(2 cosh(h))x , yielding the following approximation of
eq. (2): P(Sl) ≃
∫
dhρl(h) ehSl
2 cosh(hl) , where
ρl(h) =
(2 cosh(h))x∫∏

. (17)
As the functional updates of eqs. (15) and (16) can be approxi mated by the Monte Carlo
method on a practical time scale, these equations constitut e a tractable algorithm for approx-
imating the marginal probabilities (2).
Second, although x= 1 , 2,... has been assumed, the expressions of eqs. (15)-(17) can be
analytically continued to x ∈ R. In addition, the extremized values of the replicated Bethe
free energy Φ Bethe
x = Extr {{bµ },{bl}}
{

can also be readily extended to x∈ R

where πl→µ(h) and ˆ πµ→l(ˆh) are the stationary solutions of eqs. (15) and (16). Analyti cal
extension of the variational functional (7), however, is no ntrivial. Nevertheless, the analytically
continued expressions of eqs. (15) and (16) eventually lead to a general expression of SP
in which πt
l→µ(h) and ˆπt
µ→l(ˆh) are termed surveys, which is the main result of the present
treatment. In this relation, x serves as the RSB parameter, which is introduced to represen t
the number of replicas in a subgroup in the conventional 1RSB formulation. For example, SP
for the K-SAT problem of ﬁnite temperature, corresponding t o eqs. (C1) and (C2) in ref. 12,
can be derived from eqs. (16) and (15) by setting x → m, ψµ(Sµ) = e−2β∏

ψl(Sl) = 1 in conjunction with rescaling ﬁelds as h
β → h and ˆ
hβ → ˆh, where β is the inverse
temperature and Jµ
l ∈ { +1, −1} are randomly predetermined constants. The derivation of SP
for the famous Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model 13) is shown brieﬂy in the appendix.
It has been reported that extremizing eq. (18) with respect t o the RSB parameter x
provides a reasonable description of equilibrium states in the conventional replica theory. 7)
However, it may be diﬃcult to deduce such a principle for the d etermination of x using
only the framework presented here. The derivation is compli cated by the dependence of the
approximation accuracy on x, which is generally related to the speciﬁc characteristics of the
5/9
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. Letter
target system in a nontrivial manner, although certain extr a constraints related to the concept
of thermodynamic limits (e.g., homogeneity 14)) may be utilized for problems in the physics
literature.
The formalism presented here is related to other algorithms as follows. Equations (15)
and (16) always have special solutions of the forms πt
l→µ(h) = δ(h− ht
l→µ) and ˆπt
µ→l(ˆh) =
δ(ˆh− ˆht
µ→l), independently of x. The parameters ht
l→µ and ˆht
µ→l are updated by ˆht+1
µ→l =
ˆh({ht
j∈L(µ)\l}), ht
l→µ = h0
l + ∑
ν∈M(l)\µ ˆ
ht
ν→l. Notice that these forms are an expression of
the belief propagation (BP) 15, 16) for eq. (1), the ﬁxed point of which is usually linked to the
variational condition of the conventional Bethe free energ y FBethe = FBethe
x=1 .17) In the current
formalism, on the other hand, BP can be characterized as the s olution of the highest symmetry
obtained assuming the Lagrange multipliers of the limited f orm e−λµl ({Sa
l }) ∏ x
a=1 ψl(Sa
l ) ∝
ehl→ µ
∑ x
a=1 Sa

l }) ∝ e
ˆhµ → l
∑ x
a=1 Sa
l
(2 cosh(ˆhµ → l))x , which exist for arbitrary RSB parameter x ∈ R.
This relationship between BP and the assumption of eqs. (13) and (14) is analogous to that
for the RS solution under the 1RSB ansatz in the conventional replica theory employed in
spin glass research.
The present algorithm can also be extended to the reduction o f replica symmetry. For
example, introducing the 1RSB ansatz 11) on the Lagrange multipliers, we obtain
e−λµl ({Sa
l })

where I(α) ( α = 1 , 2,...,m ) denotes subsets of replica indices of an equal size m while
DπΠ l→µ[π] and DˆπˆΠ µ→l[ˆπ] represent the variational measures of distributions π(h) and ˆπ(ˆh),
respectively. Analytically continuing this yields the con ventional two-step RSB solution in the
case of the SK model. This indicates that generalizing this p rovides an algorithm corresponding
to the r+ 1-step RSB solution of conventional replica analysis unde r the assumption that the
Lagrange multipliers are of the form of the r-step RSB.
In summary, a framework for the construction of a family of me an-ﬁeld-type approxima-
tion algorithms was derived by introducing the Bethe free en ergy formalism for x-replicated
systems. Analytically continuing the algorithm obtained f or x= 1 , 2,... to x∈ R under the
replica symmetric ansatz leads to a general expression of su rvey propagation for such systems
(eq. (1)), in which xplays the role of a replica symmetry breaking parameter in th e 1RSB so-
lution of conventional replica analysis. Belief propagati on and generalized survey propagation
can be reproduced from an identical variational functional (eq. (7)) corresponding to various
levels of RSB ansatz on the replica symmetry of the Lagrange m ultipliers. This may be useful
for clarifying the relationships between solutions obtain ed using these various algorithms.

Although the focus here was on algorithms derived from natur al iteration of eqs. (11) and
(12), a range of schemes for the minimization of the Bethe fre e energy are available. 18, 19)
Furthermore, it is known that the Bethe free energy formalis m itself can be generalized to
a more advanced scheme as the cluster variation method. 9) Extending the present results to
such schemes is a target of future work.

Appendix: SP for the SK Model
The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is an Ising spin sys tem characterized by the
Hamiltonian H(S) = − ∑
l>kJlkSlSk − ∑ N
l=1 HlSl, where Jlk is sampled from an identical
normal distribution N (J0/N,J 2/N ) independently of the unordered pair ⟨lk⟩, and Hl repre-
sents an external ﬁeld. Identifying ⟨lk⟩ with µ leads to ψµ(Sµ) = eβJlkSlSk and ψl(Sl) = eβHlSl .
Two distinct properties of this system are the denseness of c onnectivity and the weakness
of each coupling constant. Let ˆ πt

Notice that the ﬁxed point condition of eqs. (A ·3) and (A ·4) is in agreement with the 1RSB
analogue to the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equation of the S K model. 3, 21)This demonstrates
the consistency of SP with the 1RSB solution in conventional replica theory.
