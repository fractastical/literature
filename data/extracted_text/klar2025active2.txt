Abstract.We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a com-
putational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI). We present an AIF agent with continu-
ous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional
mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic sys-
tem to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual de-
lay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the
agent’s actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely
based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing click-
ing a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible
pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with
similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models
of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compen-
sation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing
target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done
in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize
the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent
interacting with continuous systems.

1 Introduction
Pointing is a fundamental interaction technique andHuman-Computer Inter-
action (HCI)has a long history of studying human pointing behaviour [18].
Pointing is a way of communicating information through an interface by ma-
nipulating a user-controlled cursor into spatial partitions corresponding to ac-
tions; typically, these are discrete actions like selecting a menu item. Modelling
pointing behaviour is crucial in engineering interactions well-suited to human
capabilities, or in predicting the behaviour of users in using an existing interface
without real users in the loop. As a prevalent and tractable interaction problem,
it has attracted substantial attention in the HCI literature. HCI has historically
focused on high-level descriptive models of pointing using summary statistics.

Fitts’ Law [5, 6, 14] is the classic model, and relates the expected time taken
to acquire a target (with a certain tolerated error rate) to the size and distance
of the target from the cursor origin. While such models are effective in explain-
ing movement time and are simple to apply, they do not attempt to model the
detailed process of target acquisition itself, and do not consider click dynamics.
Insights into complete cursor trajectories would enable more precise prediction
of user intentions and the development of improved assistive tools.
One way to improve this understanding is to build a fine-grained, compu-
tational, generative model of the human user that synthesizes the entire target
acquisition process. Approaches to model whole pointing trajectories have been
introduced, e.g. in [3, 16, 4, 15, 13], often with models derived from a control-
theoretic perspective, such as the Minimum Jerk model [7] or the E-LQG [25].
Other approaches have applied machine learning to derive policies that emulate
human behaviour from data [1, 2, 10]. These classical models typically rely on
the design of cost or reward functions, which are often defined by a combination
of the distance between the cursor and the target and the control effort required
to reach it. They are also typically deterministic in that they do not model
or represent uncertainty explicitly, some even requiring a predefined movement
time. Furthermore, in contrast to our approach, these focus on cursor movement
only and clicking is usually not included, or seen as a separate task.
We propose the application of active inference (AIF) [19] to create a pointing
model that is fully probabilistic, predictive and formulates the problem in terms
of preferences over observations, rather than rewards. Different behaviour for
difficult targets, which occurs in real user data (see Fig. 1), should emerge from
greater uncertainty in the target acquisition rather than changed model and re-
ward parameters – which is often the case in the classical models of pointing
mentioned above. As an underlying model, we make use of the well-understood
Second-Order Lag model which is commonly used to model human mouse point-
ing [23, 16, 4]. Using such a simple system to represent the human motor control
system allows us to focus on the AIF agent’s inference and control. We addi-
tionally apply perceptual noise and delay in order to achieve a more human-like
behaviour [20, 21]. AIF is a widely-applicable model of the behaviour of or-
ganisms that unifies Bayesian models of perception with a probabilistic model
for action under uncertainty. It postulates behaviour as a process of reducing
surprise to drive the environment into preferred configurations and minimizing
uncertainty that might, in the future, lead to disfavoured states.
Recently there has been interest in bringing active inference concepts into
the study and practice of HCI, see reviews such as [17] and [26]. Stein et al. [24]
explored ordinal selection with AIF, i.e., selecting the target from a set of dis-
crete elements, but modelling pointing with AIF has not been explored. In the
context of pointing, AIF offers a fundamentally different perspective. An AIF
formulation frames pointing as a continuous process of minimizing prediction
error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input. Active
inference defines the goals of a (simulated) user in terms of a distribution over
desired observations. For example, rather than moving the cursor exactly to the

centre of the target, the user might be satisfied as long as there is a high chance
of clicking the button correctly. However, AIF has typically been applied in dis-
crete contexts or in restricted forms. Modelling pointing, at the level of dynamic
trajectory generation, requires a continuous representation of actions (such as
potentials to be propagated to a simulated motor system), states, and obser-
vations (such as cursor position). We propose an AIF model that is capable of
modelling fine-grained pointing behaviour in this continuous setting, and which
generalises to different tasks and environments.
In summary, our contributions are:
–A continuous active inference formulation of point and click behaviour which
does not rely on arbitrary discretisations, appropriately models perceptual
noise and delay, and provides probabilistic predictions of cursor trajectories.
–An empirical study of a classical 1D pointing task with our active infer-
ence model, including a comparison of pointing trajectories with behaviour
observed in a user study.
2 Active Inference for Continuous Dynamic Systems with
Observation Noise and Perceptual Delay
Control of a human limb is an example of the general problem of control of a
dynamic system. Section A describes the notation for such continuous system
dynamics, how the agent constructs a belief about the states, dynamics and
noise, as well as how it updates them. Specific adaptations of the standard
general active inference approach in our model include:
4 M. Klar et al.
– System Dynamics:The general equations are described in Section A.1. In
the context of modelling a human pointing with a mouse, the system state
may be a combination of the cursor’s position and velocity and whether the
mouse button is being clicked. The observation reflects the user’s visual,
proprioceptive, or haptic perceptions, which are noisy by nature.
– Probabilistic Beliefs of AIF Agentare constructed about the states,
dynamics and noise: 1. Belief about system stateQs :=N(µ s, Σs). 2. Be-
lief about parameters of the system dynamicsQθ :=N(µ θ, Σθ). 3. Belief
about noise in observationsQp := exp(N(µp, Σp)). Each of these beliefs is
represented by the mean and covariance matrix of a (multivariate) Gaus-
sian distribution. Since the belief about the noiseQp describes the standard
deviation of the different noise factors and thus needs to be positive at all
times, we choose a log-normal distribution for robustness.
– BeliefUpdatemechanismsaremostlystandard,andaredescribedinSec-
tion A.2. To efficiently update the agent’s belief after performing an action,
we use an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which can be used to propagate
Gaussian random variables through system dynamics [27, 11].
– Action Selectionis based on minimising Expected Free Energy (EFE) as
describedinSectionA.3.Sincethesecalculationsrequirealotofcomputation
time, especially when the horizonNis large, the evaluation in this work will
exclude simulations with information gain.
– Perceptual Delayis modelled by constructing a belief abouts(t−τ)for
a given perceptual delay ofτ∈Ntimesteps and updating this belief using
the observationo(t−τ)obtained in stept. Before action selection, the agent
uses its generative model and the last actions to create a temporary belief
abouts(t)by sequential updates. Additionally, we let the agent know about
the exact target location only after the initial delay (see Section 3.2).
3 1D Mouse Pointing with Active Inference
We now demonstrate how AIF can be applied to simulate a human user per-
forming a 1D-mouse pointing task. In such a task, the user is asked to position a
mouse cursor within a one-dimensional target whose size and distance is varied
systematically. A detailed description about the pointing task is provided in Sec-
tion C. We simulate single trials which terminate as soon as the button is clicked
successfully or after two seconds. Due to numerical constraints, both the canvas
and the targets are scaled down by a factor of 1000. Furthermore, the initial po-
sition is recalculated to be centred at the origin. All shown results are however
rescaled to the original size. We apply our model to investigate whether a cursor
controlled with AIF: 1. allows us to model mouse clicking based on probabilistic
beliefs about the system and preference distributions; 2. shows similar variabil-
ity to observed human movements; and 3. can model the variety of behavioural
strategies shown for different target difficulties without separate models for each.
The complete interaction loop of the agent with the system is depicted as a block
diagram in Fig. 2 and provided as pseudo code in Section B.2.

3.1 The Generative Process and Model
To simulate human pointing, we need to build a model for the pointing technique
and interface. In Active Inference terms, this means that we construct a gener-
ative process that plays the role of the ‘real world’. The agent can interact with
the process via a Markov Blanket which also defines what the agent observes.
The agent also constructs a generative model of the world, which can be different
from the real world. We decided to keep the system dynamics identical, however,
the generative model is governed by the agent’s belief about system parameters
(which may be wrong or uncertain). Our model has two main components, the
arm dynamics and the finger dynamics, and an additional logic for mouse clicks.
Arm DynamicsAs a basis for our simulated arm dynamics we choose a
Second-Order Lag model [23, 16, 4]. The state of this system is given by the
cursor positions 1 and velocitys 2. The agent controls the accelerationa1 that
is applied to the cursor. When moving a computer mouse over a desk in a
reasonable area, there is no force pulling the mouse to a certain stable position.
Therefore we decided to set the cursor’s stiffness to zero. However, damping is
still applied with a factor ofd >0.
Finger DynamicsTo model the index finger pressing the left mouse button,
we use a simple First-Order Lag system [23] with stiffnessk >0. A click is
only initiated when the displacement applied to the mouse button exceeds a
threshold, requiring the agent to release the button before being able to click
again. Therefore, both the previous button displacements 3 and the current
button displacements 4 must be present in the system state. The agent can
increase or decrease this force with a second actiona2.
After time-discretisation with∆t= 0.02, the combined system dynamics
which take statesand actionaand obtain the new state are therefore given by

was missed. The parametersTand widthW >0are the target centre and width,
respectively, andαc >0is the clicking threshold. Thus, both functions depend
on the system parametersθ= [d, k, T, W, αc].
Click logicThe observation of clicks works as follows. If the previous but-
ton displacement was below and the current button displacement is above the
threshold, a click is issued andc= 1. In any other casec= 0. 1 If, addition-
ally, the cursor position is inside the target, i.e.,
 
|s1 −T| ≤W

, the button is
clicked successfully, i.e.,g(s)4 = 1(otherwiseg(s) 4 = 0). The last entry of the
output represents a negative feedback for clicking outside the button, such as a
beep tone commonly used in studies [16]. As such,g(s)5 =−1when a misclick
happens (otherwiseg(s) 5 = 0). We intentionally add this observation to allow
the agent to have a specific preference ofnotobserving a misclick.
Since human perception is inherently subject to noise, we add Gaussian
noise to the agent’s observations of cursor position and button displacement.
We assume that the other components of output are observed without any
disturbances, leading to an observation ofo= [o 1, o2, g(s)3, g(s)4, g(s)5]with
o1 ∼ N(g(s)1, σp
1)ando 2 ∼ N(g(s)2, σp
2). Except otherwise noted, we use the
parameters shown in Section B.1.
3.2 Belief Priors and Perceptual Delay
We explore agents that are supposedly well-trained in the pointing task, i.e.,
the means of the prior belief about the system parametersQθ are close to the
real values while the uncertainty is small. However, to model the initial delay of
perceiving the target, we initialise the agent’s belief about the target location
to be centred at the initial position and have a high uncertainty, i.e., the agent
believes that the target could appear anywhere on the display. In summary, the
agent’s initial beliefQθ is given by
µθ = [d, k,0.0,0.03, αc], Σθ =diag

After the delay period, we update the belief to include the correct target position

0.2,0.2,10 −6,10−6,10 −62
.(5)
Note that we keep some uncertainty about the damping and stiffness. This is due
to the fact that an agent with pristine knowledge about all system parameters
would not need to infer the system state from noisy observations. Instead, its
internal model of the world would allow for perfect prediction of the cursor
trajectory and clicking, resulting in super-human performance. However, to keep
the sources of uncertainty in check, we provide the agent with full knowledge
about the amount of observation noise, i.e.Qp is given by
µp = [σp
1, σp
2], Σp = 10−8I2.(6)
1 Following the convention thatTrueis represented as1andFalseas0.
An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour 7
In future work,Q θ andQ p might also be inferred by interacting with the
system over a longer time period.
The agent starts with a reasonable initial belief about the system state, that
is
µs = [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0], Σ s =diag([0.001,0.0001,0.00005,0.00005] 2).(7)
We address the time a perceived signal takes to be processed by a human as
follows. We delay observations that the agent received from the system after
applying an action byτ= 5timesteps (=100ms). To compensate for this per-
ceptual delay, the agent keeps a belief about the state before the delay,Qs(t−τ)
(instead oft). Prior to planning its next action, the agent then predicts the
system state at timetusing its internal model. This is achieved by sequentially
updating a temporary copy˜Qs(t−τ)ofQ s(t−τ)by using actions applied during
the delaya(t+i), i=−τ, . . . ,−1, until arriving at˜Qs(t)(see Section A.2, 1.).
After planning and performing the next action, the agent uses the “old” action
a(t−τ)and, if available, delayed observation fromo(t−τ)to obtain the belief
Qs(t−τ+ 1). This belief then serves as an initial point for the next planning
step.

3.3 Preference Prior
The agent’s goal is to control the generative process described in Section 3.1
in the same way a human does, i.e., such that the target button is clicked as
accurately and fast as possible. To model this in a natural way with Active
Inference, we define the agent’s preference distribution as a marginal distribution
on the observations of the cursor positiono1, button clicko4, and misclicko5,

.(8)
The mean of this distribution is centred around the cursor being at the target’s
centre, the button being successfully clicked, and not getting negative feedback
on a misclick. Adding the additional preference of not observing a misclick en-
sures that the agent only clicks when it is certain enough that the cursor is on
the button. Scaling the diagonal values of the covariance matrix allows creating
agents that have different focus on speed versus accuracy, a classical trade-off
that is present in human aimed movements [5, 22, 9].
The parameters used in the results are manually fitted to the data of one
user performing the pointing task described in Section C.1 and more details
about the fitting process can be found in Section B.1. We additionally present
the effect of changing individual parameters in Section D. It is important to
mention that we – other than previous optimal control based approaches – use
the same parameter set for all targets. The qualitatively different behaviours
emerge from the properties of the AIF agent instead.
4 Results
We investigate whether the AIF agent is able to produce movements which are
similar to human-controlled movements, despite the simplicity of the underlying
model. In particular, we are interested in the amount of variability produced by
the agent compared to a human performing the same task.
4.1 AIF Agent Performs Pointing Task
Fig. 3 shows a time-series view of how the AIF agent performs the pointing task.
Before obtaining knowledge about the target position (before0.1s), the agent
keeps the cursor close to the centre. During the fast surge movement (an initial
ballistic phase of a mouse movement, [16]), the agent’s perception of the cursor
position (left plot) is subject to increased uncertainty due to the larger impact
of the perceptual delay. After slowing down close to the target, the agent regains
a more precise belief about the cursor position and ultimately manages to click
on the target. The resulting corrective movements are commonly observed in
human pointing. In the right plot, the button displacement is represented. The
initiation of a click is prompted upon attaining a threshold ofαc = 0.05. Given
that the preference distribution is shaped by the observation of not missing the
button, the agent only clicks when it believes that the cursor is inside the target.

4.2 AIF Agent Follows Fitts’ Law
Fitts’ Law describes a logarithmic relationship between the ratio of a target
distance to target width and the time for humans to reliably acquire it. It is
usually given in the Shannon form:MT=a+b·log 2

is called theindex of difficulty (ID)and is measured in bits;
larger values indicate targets which are more difficult to acquire.
If our model is a plausible model of human pointing, it should follow this
relationship. If it is well-tuned for a specific configuration (such that we emulate
a realistic human motor system with a particular pointing device), we should
recover similar coefficientsa, bas in experimental data. Fig. 4 shows the Fitts’
Law evaluation for the AIF agent and a human user side-by-side. The AIF agent
follows the characteristic pattern of Fitts’ Law with an identical slopebas the
user, while having a shorter constant delaya.
4.3 AIF Agent Shows Changing Behaviour for Different Targets
Fig. 5 shows the trajectories produced by the AIF agent and a human user, split
up by target size. As predicted by Fitts’ Law, movements of both agent and
human, are longer for more difficult targets, i.e., smaller targets (right plots) or
targets with larger distance from the initial position at 900px. Similar to the
human, if targets are smaller or further away, the agent-controlled cursor often
shows one or multiple sub-movements, i.e., shorter corrective movements, after
the surge phase.

Fig.4: Following Fitts’ Law, human pointing movements show a linear relation-

Another characteristic of human behaviour is that it shows higher end-point
variance for larger targets. The end-point variance of the AIF agent’s move-
ments shows a similar trend, which is displayed via the error bars next to the
trajectories in Fig. 5. Similar to the user, for large targets (left plots in Fig. 5),
the endpoints of the agent’s movements are skewed towards the starting point,
showing that the agent makes use of the target size.
5 Discussion
Implications of the resultsThe results indicate that a full active inference
model of target acquisition and click actuation with appropriate perceptual de-
lays leads to behaviours that are comparable to human performance. The gross
behaviour, as quantified by the Fitts’ law plots, indicates human-like pointing
capacity, even without precise calibration. The AIF agent also shows realistic
end-point variance and makes use of the target size. Unlike optimal control meth-
ods, where parameters have to be fit not just for each user but for each target,
a single parameterisation leads to plausible pointing behaviour across targets
spanning a range of indices of difficulty. The AIF agent’s predictive models can
compensate for the delayed observations with variability that appears to corre-
spond well to human pointing in the presence of the well-known latency in the
visual system. The combination of cursor movement and clicking enables inter-
esting interactions, even in a simple model as ours, such as updating the belief
about the cursor position by observing a click or misclick.
LimitationsOur model has a radically simplified representation of human
perception and motor control as a second-order system with Gaussian-corrupted
observations and fixed perceptual delay. Our parameterisations are hand-tuned
and validated on the data of a single user. Our agent has a relatively short time

the consequent effect of “sample starvation” on policy selection. These inference
limitations have an implicit effect on the parameterisation of the agent – for
example, action selection is challenging if no sequence of actions in the time
horizon brings the predicted state close to the “correct click” state. This can also
lead to oscillating behaviour, as in Fig. 5, which is not as pronounced in humans.
The computational effort involved in the variational inference procedure and
limit the amount of plans that can be evaluated. However, our approach using
UKF with Monte Carlo sampled rollouts inference makes our fully continuous
formulation viable.

as our forward model and a similarly simplified perceptual model with known
delay. There remains opportunity to explore more authentic biomechanical mod-
els of the arm, or stronger perceptual models that, e.g. add uncertainty about
the perceptual delay, properly account for motor delays, or include models of
foveated vision. Although our model reproduces behaviour qualitatively similar
to our test user, we have much to explore in calibrating parameters to better
match human performance. This could involve automatic optimisation of agent
parameters to align with observed user data, and/or parameters informed di-
rectlybyestablishedbiomechanicalandperceptualdata.Optimisationcouldalso
be performed online, with an active inference agent learning system parameters
during simulated interactions. We also see scope to develop more sophisticated
metrics to establish what “similar” trajectories are, particularly when quantify-
ing variability in dynamics. There are obvious extensions of our model to e.g. 2D
or 3D pointing tasks, but these will likely require better inference, new datasets
and stronger biomechanical and perceptual models.
5.1 Conclusion
We presented an active inference simulation of human pointing and clicking
behaviour with continuous states, actions, and observations. Despite its simple
2OL forward model our model generates plausible trajectories across a range
of target sizes, and it includes a full model of actuation (“click”) planning and
predictive delay compensation.
While AIF control of even this elementary system is not straightforward
– our agent has a profusion of parameters and significant inference challenges
– our findings suggest that AIF is a promising model for fine-grained inter-
action models. The inherently probabilistic nature allows for a greater variety
of cursor trajectories than comparable methods, generating a wide variety of
plausible behaviours. Our model is the first step towards active inference-based
user modelling in HCI. Our results indicate that active inference is viable for
user behavioural models and highlight many open challenges in building more
sophisticated AIF-based synthetic users.

An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour 15
A Active Inference for Continuous Dynamic Systems
with Control and Observation Noise
A.1 System Dynamics
We control a general dynamic system with continuous states, actions, and obser-
vations with active inference. We take a discrete-time approach, with a constant
time step∆t. A dynamic system is then described by functions
st+1 =f θ(st, at),(9)
ot =g θ(st) +ϵt,(10)
where (9) maps the current systemstates t ∈R n and anactiona t ∈R m at
timestept∈Nto the new system states t+1 ∈R n, given some system parameters
θ. The system’s output (10) is given by a functiongθ :R n 7→R l and may be
perturbed by constant and/or state-dependent Gaussian noise to obtain the
agent’sobservationo t ∈R l at time stept.
A.2 Belief Updates
A human user will usually only have access to a limited set of system states
that they observe via output devices such as displays. For instance, although we
cannot perceive the velocity of a mouse cursor directly (as in a speedometer),
it is still an important source of information to prevent overshooting a target
button. The agentinfersthis information by propagating its belief about the
cursor velocity through its internal model, as explained below.
The agent has two ways to update its belief about the system stateQ s
t :
1. After performing an action, the agent uses its internal model of the world
to update its belief, resulting in a new beliefQs
t+1 for timestept+ 1. An ef-
ficient approach for this is to propagate the agent’s belief through time using
an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [11], which allows the estimation of states
under nonlinear transition functions with Gaussian belief distributions. It in-
volves choosing sigma points in the combined space ofQs andQ θ, evaluating
fθ on these with the chosen actiona t to obtain the correspondings t+1, and
estimating the parameters of the updated belief distributionQs
t+1 directly from
thes t+1 using Maximum Likelihood. Note that during this step we fold in the
application of the actionat into the transition function that the UKF applies
to make predictions of the future state under actionat. This update usually
increases uncertainty, since the agent is uncertain about the current state of the
world as well as the dynamics.
2. After a new observation, the agent updates its belief using variational infer-
ence. This means, that the agent minimizes the variational free energyFwith
respect to the belief distribution parameters and the noise belief,

whereQ s is the variational beliefpriorto making the new observation (but
after having taken the last action), ˆQs is theposteriorbelief, andD KL the
KL-divergence. The first term has an analytical solution for Gaussian belief dis-
tributions, whereas the second term requires sampling fromˆQs. For optimization
via gradient descent, we use the reparameterization trick [12] to backpropagate
throughn VI
s samples in each of thekVI update steps. Depending on the knowl-
edge of observation noise, this step may reduce the agent’s uncertainty.

whereQ s
ij are predicted via rollout, i.e. by successively updating the agent’s be-
lief after performing actionaij as described in Section A.2. Since these rollouts
are predictions ‘in the agent’s mind’, the beliefs cannot be updated using obser-
vations here.2 In practice, it is often impossible to calculate these analytically, so
we approximate based on observations sampled from the current belief. In case
of perceptual delay, the initial belief distribution is obtained by applying UKF
with the last performed actions as described in Section 3.2.

B Implementation Details
B.1 Parameters
Our AIF agent has many parameters that can have an influence in the resulting
trajectories. The following Table 1 gives an overview of these parameters. To
find suitable parameters that lead to movements similar to those of a human,
we proceed as follows.
–We roughly estimate the necessary dampingdand maximal hand controla1
by comparing the 99% percentile and maxima of accelerations and velocities
observed in the study to those created by applying the maximal activation
to the mouse cursor system Eq. (1) for one second.
–We aim to set the stiffness of the finger dynamic such that the earliest click
can not happen faster than observed in a user clicking as fast as possible,
that is≈0.14s per click. However, this had to be relaxed slightly to ensure
that the agent can click the button consistently.
–We obtain the reaction time of the agent by computing the first timestep
after the user exceeds an acceleration threshold of 10px/s2, that isτ≈0.1s.
–We tune the preference distributionP C such that the resulting behaviour
shows similar clicks and misclicks as humans.
The remaining parameters are tuned by visually comparing trajectories and the
Fitts’ Law results.
B.2 The Complete Algorithm
Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code for the complete interaction loop of an
AIF agent with the mouse model. Prior to planning the next action, the agent
compensates for the perceptual delay by estimating the system state at time
t. This is achieved by sequentially updating the temporary copy˜Qs using the
previously applied actions (for-loop in planning phase) and the agent’s internal
model of the system. After planning and performing an action, the agent uses
the ’old’ action and, if available, delayed observation fromτtimesteps before to
update the beliefQs(t−τ).

D Additional Results
D.1 Changing Model Parameters
Changing individual parameters can affect the point and click behaviour of the
AIF agent heavily. Fig. 7 shows trajectories to the same target (T= 1750,
W= 30px), while adapting only one parameter. Changing the damping param-
eter of the mouse cursor model (upper left) defines how steep the slope in the
surge phase can be, with higher damping leading to a gentler slope (red trajec-
tories,d= 40). The influence of the planning horizon (upper right) is harder to
distinguish. If the number of sampled plans during planning is not adjusted, the
chance of sampling a good plan with a higher horizon is decreased. Also, since
the agent only applies the first action of the best plan, having a longer plan re-
duces the influence of this action on the expected free energy, which might lead
to suboptimal control (long red trajectory). Similarly, adjusting the preference
of observing a misclick, i.e., changing
q
ΣC
3,3, (lower left) has no clear effect on
the resulting trajectories. Nonetheless, lower values lead to less misclicks (almost
no black crosses,
q
ΣC
3,3 = 10−6), while higher values can lead to many misclicks
(many red crosses,
q
ΣC
3,3 = 0.1). Increasing the agent’s perceptual delay (lower
right) increases the time to target in most cases (red lines,0.2s reaction time).
This is not surprising, since with longer delay the agent receives knowledge about
the target position later and has a higher uncertainty about the cursor position
after the surge phase (not shown).
