Qualia as query act, the 
phenomenology of predictive 
error coding
Herbert W. Harris *

This paper explores the intersection of phenomenology and neuroscience to address 
foundational questions about consciousness, particularly the nature of qualia—
subjective, ineffable contents of experience. Drawing on Thomas Nagel’s seminal 
inquiry into subjective experience and Husserlian phenomenology, we propose that 
phenomenological “What is it like?” questions can be integrated with neuroscientific 
models through predictive error coding (PEC). PEC reconceptualizes the brain 
as an active inference system, continuously generating and updating predictions 
about sensory inputs. We introduce the concept of “query acts” to describe the 
brain’s interrogative engagement with sensory information, linking intentionality in 
phenomenology with predictive mechanisms in neuroscience. By framing qualia 
as dynamic processes arising from query acts rather than static entities, we bridge 
the explanatory gap between subjective experience and objective inquiry. This 
interdisciplinary framework highlights structural parallels between noetic processes 
in phenomenology and PEC in neuroscience, providing a novel perspective on the 
emergence of conscious experience. Additionally, we explore the implications of 
query acts for clinical interventions in psychiatric disorders and the development 
of context-sensitive artificial intelligence systems. This synthesis fosters deeper 
integration of philosophical and scientific approaches to understanding the nature 
of consciousness.

1 Introduction
Thomas Nagel’s essay, “What is it Like to Be a Bat?” (Nagel, 1974), illustrates the challenges 
inherent in understanding consciousness from a first-person perspective. We can objectively 
describe the behavior of bats. We understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying 
their unique sensory processing. However, whether some aspect of the bat’s experience 
remains inaccessible to objective description remains. The answers we seek often point toward 
qualia—the subjective, ineffable contents of consciousness. When we inquire about what it is 
like to see a particular shade of red or to hear a specific musical note, we anticipate definitive, 
though private, responses. Qualia are considered the fundamental and irreducible facets of 
subjective experience. Y et, they gain significance only within the intentional context provided 
by the questions we pose. The “What is it like?” inquiries are central to defining and structuring 
our conscious reality.
Recent advancements in neuroscience have deepened our understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying conscious activity. However, this progress has unfolded independently 
of phenomenological methods emphasizing introspection and subjective experience. This 
divergence raises critical questions: How do concepts like qualia and intentionality integrate 
with neuroscientific models? Can phenomenology meaningfully inform neuroscience?

This paper proposes that phenomenological “What is it like?” 
questions can be conceptualized within the framework of predictive 
error coding (PEC). By examining the predictive processing of 
somatosensory and interoceptive signals, we will draw parallels to 
the noetic processes—the acts of consciousness—that constitute 
subjective experience. PEC systems do not merely transmit 
information; they actively query incoming data against predicted 
states, effectively asking, “Is this input like what we anticipated?” 
When predictions fail, error signals are generated, prompting 
top-down adjustments—a process reminiscent of Husserl’s concept 
of anticipatory apprehension in forming intentional objects 
(Husserl, 1982 ). In both phenomenological and neurobiological 
contexts, the mind adopts an active, interrogative stance 
toward information.
We introduce the term “query act” to encapsulate this process, 
emphasizing its biological basis and intentional character to provide 
a fruitful intersection between phenomenology and neuroscience. 
Ultimately, we  suggest rethinking qualia in terms of query acts, 
offering a novel perspective that fosters interdisciplinary alignment.
2 Qualia
The concept of qualia is central to discussions in the philosophy 
of mind, cognitive science, and neuroscience, serving as a focal point 
for debates about the nature of consciousness and subjective 
experience. Qualia refer to the intrinsic, subjective qualities of 
conscious experience—the “raw feels” or the phenomenal aspects of 
the mind (Lewis, 1929). Examples include the redness one experiences 
when seeing a sunset, the bitterness tasted in dark chocolate, or the 
sharp pain felt when touching a hot surface.
Thomas Nagel’s influential essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” 
(1974) revitalized interest in the subjective aspect of consciousness. 
Nagel argues that an organism has conscious experience if and only if 
there is something it is like to be that organism. He emphasizes that 
subjective experience is essentially connected to a specific point of 
view, which cannot be fully apprehended through objective, third-
person descriptions. Using bats—creatures with a sensory apparatus 
vastly different from humans—as an example, Nagel illustrates how 
we can study the neurophysiology of bats and understand echolocation 
scientifically. Y et, we  cannot know what it is like for the bat to 
experience the world this way. This illustrates the explanatory gap 
between objective accounts of brain processes and the subjective 
qualities of experience—qualia.
The relationship between qualia and “What is it like?” questions 
reveals the deep connection between subjective experience and 
intentionality. In phenomenology, intentionality refers to the 
directedness of consciousness toward objects or states of affairs 
(Husserl, 1982). When we ask, “What is it like to see red?” we are 
directing our consciousness toward the qualitative experience 
associated with perceiving red—a quale. Qualia are deeply subjective 
and resist complete articulation. Their ineffable nature means they 
cannot be fully conveyed through language or objective descriptions. 
This is why simply providing answers to “What is it like?” questions 
does not capture the essence of qualia.
We will argue that understanding qualia in terms of “What is 
it like?” questions may bridge the gap between subjective 
experience and objective inquiry. This view emphasizes the 
importance of first-person perspectives while recognizing that 
questions of this form have concrete embodiments in the neural 
circuitry of PEC.
3 Phenomenological accounts of 
perception
Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl in the early 20th 
century, represents a philosophical movement dedicated to describing 
the structures of experience as they present themselves to 
consciousness. This approach eschews theory, deduction, or 
assumptions from other disciplines to study phenomena—the 
appearances of things—as they are experienced from the first-person 
point of view (Husserl, 1982).
At the heart of Husserl’s phenomenology lies the concept of 
intentionality, originally developed by Brentano (1995)  and 
subsequently adopted by Husserl. Intentionality refers to the mind’s 
capacity to be directed toward or about something—every mental act 
is an act of consciousness of an object. This “object” need not be a 
physical thing; it can be an idea, a feeling, or any content toward which 
consciousness is directed.
Husserl dissected the structure of intentional acts into two 
correlated components: noesis and noema. The noetic component 
represents the subjective aspect of the intentional act—the mental 
activity or process by which the object is apprehended. It encompasses 
various modes of consciousness, such as questioning, judging, 
imagining, and remembering. The noematic component is the 
intentional content or the object as it is meant in the experience. The 
noema includes the object’s perceived properties and how it is 
presented to consciousness (Husserl, 1982).
The term hyletic refers to the raw, sensory data of experience—the 
sensations, feelings, and sensory impressions that serve as the 
substrate for intentional acts (Husserl, 1997). These data are passively 
received and provide the content structured by the mind in the process 
of perception. This structuring process involves anticipatory 
apprehension (Vorgriff), the notion that perception involves an active, 
forward-looking component. Consciousness does not merely register 
sensory inputs but anticipates what will come based on prior 
experience and context ( Husserl, 1991). This anticipatory aspect 
allows for the seamless flow of perception, filling in gaps and making 
sense of incomplete information. Husserl introduced the concept of 
horizon to explain how we experience objects and events within a 
broader context. The horizon is a dynamic context that shapes all 
experiences, providing the backdrop against which objects and events 
are meaningfully constituted in consciousness.
These phenomenological insights provide a valuable framework 
for understanding how intentionality might be  embodied in 
neurobiological systems. The parallels between phenomenological 
accounts and predictive coding models are striking. Just as Husserl’s 
consciousness anticipates and interprets sensory data, predictive 
coding models propose that the brain generates predictions about 
incoming stimuli and updates these predictions based on prediction 
errors. The noetic processes can be  likened to computational 
mechanisms that construct the intentional content (noema) from 
sensory inputs. At the same time, the concept of horizon aligns with 
the brain’s use of contextual information and prior knowledge to 
interpret sensory inputs.
Harris 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1531269
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
By drawing on these phenomenological concepts, we can explore 
how predictive error coding systems may embody a form of 
intentionality. The brain’s predictive mechanisms could embody 
intentional acts that construct and update models of the world, much 
like Husserl’s consciousness constitutes objects through intentionality. 
Parallels between the noetic process and PEC are illustrated in 
Figure 1. While PEC may not underlie all conscious perception, it 
offers promise as a bridge between phenomenology and neuroscience. 
It suggests that the structures of conscious experience have 
neurobiological correlates in the brain’s predictive architecture, 
opening avenues for interdisciplinary research that enriches our 
understanding of perception, cognition, and the nature 
of consciousness.
4 Predictive coding
Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that conceptualizes 
the brain as a predictive machine. It continuously generates and 
updates models of the environment to minimize the discrepancy 
between expected and actual sensory inputs, which is known as 
prediction errors. This approach has gained prominence in 
neuroscience for its ability to unify diverse cognitive and perceptual 
phenomena under a common computational principle.
The roots of predictive coding trace back to the 19th century with 
Hermann von Helmholtz’s notion of unconscious inference in 
perception (Helmholtz, 1867). Helmholtz proposed that the brain 
interprets sensory data by inferring the most probable causes of 
stimuli based on prior experiences. In the mid-20th century, Claude 
Shannon’s information theory (Shannon, 1948) laid the groundwork 
for understanding efficient coding and data compression. Building on 
this, Elias (1955) introduced predictive coding in signal processing, 
demonstrating how future inputs could be predicted from past data to 
reduce redundancy in communication systems. The application of 
predictive coding to neuroscience emerged prominently with the work 
of Rao and Ballard (1999), who developed a hierarchical model of the 
visual cortex. Friston further expanded the framework, integrating it 
with the free energy principle to explain a wide array of neural and 
cognitive processes (Friston, 2005; Friston, 2010).
The framework has demonstrated remarkable explanatory power 
across various domains of brain function. In sensory processing, 
predictive coding accounts for extra-classical receptive field effects in 
vision, such as contextual modulation and perceptual illusions, by 
explaining how the brain integrates contextual information to predict 
sensory inputs ( Alink et  al., 2010 ). It elucidates phenomena like 
repetition suppression and mismatch negativity through adaptive 
updating of predictions ( Summerfield et  al., 2008; Stefanics et  al., 
2014). In addition, the framework explains auditory scene analysis, 
including the cocktail party effect and speech perception in noisy 
environments, as demonstrated by Arnal and Giraud (2012)  and 
Heilbron and Chait (2018). For somatosensation, predictive coding 
accounts for sensory attenuation during self-generated movements, 
proposing that expected sensory consequences of actions are 
discounted, which helps differentiate between self and external stimuli 
(Brown et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2016).
In higher cognitive processing, predictive coding models suggest 
that attention enhances the precision of prediction errors for relevant 
stimuli, effectively allocating computational resources to important 
information (Feldman and Friston, 2010 ; Aitchison and Lengyel, 
2017). The framework extends to interoception and emotion, 
explaining how the brain predicts physiological states and how 
discrepancies contribute to emotional experiences and affective 
disorders (Barrett and Simmons, 2015; Seth and Friston, 2016). In 
consciousness studies, predictive coding suggests that conscious 
experience and the sense of self emerge from the brain’s predictive 
models of its own states and interactions with the environment 
(Hohwy, 2013; Limanowski and Friston, 2020).
Dysfunctions in predictive processes have been implicated in 
various psychiatric conditions. Altered precision weighting of 
prediction errors may underlie hallucinations in schizophrenia, 
sensory sensitivities in autism, and various symptoms in depression 
(Corlett et  al., 2019; Lawson et  al., 2017; Smith et  al., 2021). This 
clinical relevance highlights the framework’s potential 
therapeutic applications.
5 Bridging qualia and predictive error 
coding: the query act
Traditional views of sensory processing often depict the brain as 
a passive recipient of external stimuli, constructing perceptions based 
solely on incoming sensory data. However, the predictive coding 
framework reconceptualizes the brain as an active inference machine 
(Friston, 2010). In this model, the brain continuously generates 
predictions about sensory inputs based on internal models of the 
world and compares these predictions to actual sensory inputs, 
effectively engaging in an ongoing process of hypothesis testing 
(Clark, 2013). When sensory inputs match predictions, the brain’s 
internal models are reinforced. Conversely, when there is a 
mismatch—known as a prediction error—the brain updates its models 
to better account for new information. This iterative process reflects 
an active, interrogative stance toward sensory information, where the 
brain is not merely processing inputs but actively questioning and 
interpreting them (Seth, 2015).
In phenomenology, particularly in Husserl’s framework, 
perception is not a passive reception but an active constitution of 
experience through noetic processes (Husserl, 1982). Consciousness 
engages in intentional acts that interpret and give meaning to sensory 
data, forming coherent intentional objects within a contextual 
horizon. The parallels between PEC and noetic processes are striking. 
Both systems involve anticipatory mechanisms. In PEC, the brain 
predicts sensory inputs, and in phenomenology, consciousness 
engages in anticipatory apprehension (Vorgriff), which is expecting 
certain experiences based on past interactions. Both frameworks 
emphasize error detection and adjustment, where prediction errors in 
PEC prompt model adjustments ( Friston et  al., 2011 ), while in 
phenomenology, consciousness revises its interpretations to 
reconcile discrepancies.
To encapsulate the active, interrogative nature of both PEC systems 
and phenomenological consciousness, we introduce the term “query 
act. ” A query act represents the process by which the brain or 
consciousness actively interrogates sensory inputs against predictions 
or expectations, embodying intentionality in both biological and 
phenomenological contexts. In neuroscience, a query act reflects the 
brain’s predictive mechanisms that generate hypotheses about sensory 
inputs and test them against actual data, resulting in prediction errors

FIGURE 1
Parallel architectures in phenomenological experience and predictive processing. (a) Phenomenological framework of conscious experience. The 
diagram illustrates the hierarchical structure of conscious experience as conceptualized in Husserlian phenomenology. At its foundation lies hyletic 
data—the raw sensory impressions that enter consciousness, such as patterns of light or sound waves, forming the basic building blocks of experience. 
These uninterpreted sensory materials flow upward through successive levels of processing and interpretation. From this foundation, the system 
constructs intentional objects, representing the first level of organized perception. Here, the mind begins to recognize distinct entities and forms, 
integrating the raw sensory elements into coherent objects. These objects then develop into intentional content, where perception gains meaning 
through contextualization and association with memories and learned patterns. At the highest level, noetic acts represent sophisticated conscious 
processes that actively interpret and create meaning from the lower-level information. This hierarchical arrangement is animated by two essential 
flows: a bottom-up process (indicated by blue arrows) that carries sensory information upward through successive levels of interpretation, 
transforming raw sensation into meaningful experience, and a top-down process (shown by red arrows) that embodies anticipatory apprehension 
(Vorgriff), demonstrating how higher-level understanding actively shapes lower-level perception. (b) Neural architecture of predictive error coding. 
This diagram reveals how the brain implements predictive error coding through multiple levels of neural processing. The journey begins with sensory 
input—raw neural signals from sensory organs that provide the initial data for processing. As this information ascends through the neural hierarchy, it 
encounters successive levels of increasingly sophisticated processing. The second level generates error signals by comparing incoming sensory data 
against predictions, creating a crucial feedback mechanism for updating the brain’s internal models. These models, represented at the third level, 
maintain dynamic predictions about expected sensory input, continuously refined by incoming error signals. At the apex, higher cortical processing 
integrates this information into abstract representations and coordinates predictions across the entire system. The diagram shows two critical 
information flows: bottom-up processing (marked by purple arrows) carries prediction error signals upward, indicating how sensory mismatches drive 
model updates, while top-down processing (shown in green arrows) represents how predictive model updates cascade downward to shape lower-
level processing. This bidirectional flow creates a continuous dialogue between sensory evidence and predictive models, embodying the brain’s active 
inference framework. The parallel organization of these two frameworks—phenomenological and neural—reveals their fundamental structural 
similarities, supporting the paper’s central argument that conscious experience and neural prediction share core organizational principles. Both 
systems demonstrate hierarchical processing, bidirectional information flow, and active interpretation of sensory data, suggesting that query acts may 
indeed represent a common mechanism underlying both conscious experience and neural processing.

and model updates (Seth and Friston, 2016). From a phenomenological 
perspective, a query act embodies intentionality—the directedness of 
consciousness toward an object or content (Husserl, 1982). Central to 
the query act is the notion of questioning or interrogating inputs, 
where both the brain and consciousness are seen as asking, “Is this 
input like what we anticipated?”
To appreciate the significance of query acts as embodiments of 
intentionality, consider the role of interrogative statements in creating 
context and meaning in language. A traditional view in analytic 
philosophy holds that the meaning of a proposition, such as “The cat is on 
the mat, ” hinges on its successful reference to entities and states in the 
world. However, in ordinary language, much of the proposition’s meaning 
in ordinary language depends on context. The proposition may be  a 
response to the question, “Where is the cat?” or “What is that on the mat?” 
creating different contexts. We may think of query acts as prelinguistic 
questions embodied by neuronal processes. In language, the question’s 
nature shapes the proposition’s meaning. Similarly, when PEC circuits 
embody query acts, they shape the nature of conscious experience.
By reconceptualizing qualia in terms of query acts, we shift from 
seeing qualia as static, atomistic entities to a view of qualia as dynamic 
processes that result from active interrogation of sensory inputs. 
Qualia emerge from the brain’s continuous querying and updating of 
sensory predictions not as fixed entities but as active processes 
emerging from ongoing interactions between predictions and inputs 
(Clark, 2013; Seth, 2015 ). Furthermore, qualia are shaped by the 
intentional content of consciousness, influenced by context, 
expectations, and prior experiences. Seeing the color red happens 
when the brain, presented with a certain visual stimulus, engages in 
an active query that asks, “What is it like to see red?”
This reconceptualization offers several advantages. It provides 
interdisciplinary alignment by framing qualia as products of query 
acts, bringing into line phenomenological insights and neuroscientific 
models. On this interpretation, qualia retain their private nature 
insofar as individual differences in experience, predictive models, and 
query acts constitute the subjectivity of qualia. Therefore, qualia have 
a subjectivity that resists eliminative accounts like Dennett (1988, 
1991), but they become more accessible to neuroscientific 
understanding. This approach identifies a crucial contact point 
between neuroscience and phenomenology, enabling both disciplines 
to progress and inform each other.
The query act framework opens promising avenues for both clinical 
applications and artificial intelligence development. In clinical settings, 
hallucinations and delusions may arise from qualitatively mismatched 
queries—the brain asking inappropriate questions of sensory data. For 
example, synesthetic experiences where individuals perceive colors in 
response to sounds could result from the brain erroneously querying, 
“What color is this sound?” This suggests that therapeutic interventions 
might focus on restructuring these fundamental query acts rather than 
just addressing their symptomatic manifestations. Similarly, certain forms 
of psychosis might reflect disrupted predictive processes where the brain 
poses queries that generate systematic misinterpretations of social and 
sensory information. For artificial intelligence development, the query act 
model suggests new architectures for neural networks that explicitly 
incorporate question-asking mechanisms. Rather than simply processing 
input data through fixed pathways, AI systems could be  designed to 
actively query their inputs, leading to more flexible and context-aware AI 
systems that better mirror human cognitive processes.
