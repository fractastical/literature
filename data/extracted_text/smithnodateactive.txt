  Abstract 
Background: Antidepressant medication adherence is among the most important problems in 
health care worldwide. Interventions designed to increase adherence have largely failed, pointing 
towards a critical need to better understand the underlying decision-making processes that 
contribute to adherence.  A computational decision-making model that integrates empirical data 
with a fundamental action selection principle could be pragmatically useful in 1) making 
individual level predictions about adherence, and 2) providing an explanatory framework that 
improves our understanding of non-adherence.    
Methods: Here we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process model based on the 
active inference framework that can simulate several processes that plausibly influence 
adherence decisions.  
Results: Using model simulations of the day-to-day decisions to take a prescribed selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we show that several distinct parameters in the model can 
influence adherence decisions in predictable ways.  These parameters include differences in 
policy depth (i.e., how far into the future one considers when deciding), decision uncertainty, 
beliefs about the predictability (stochasticity) of symptoms, beliefs about the magnitude and time 
course of symptom reductions and side effects, and the strength of medication-taking habits that 
one has acquired.  
Conclusions: Clarifying these influential factors will be an important first step toward 
empirically determining which are contributing to non-adherence to antidepressants in individual 
patients. The model can also be seamlessly extended to simulate adherence to other medications 
(by incorporating the known symptom reduction and side effect trajectories of those

Introduction 
Medical treatment depends crucially on a patient’s decision to adhere. Unfortunately, the number 
of patients who follow treatment recommendations is quite low (1). Nearly half of prescribed 
medications are not taken and roughly 125,000 deaths each year are due to non-adherence; costs 
associated with non-adherence are between $100 and $300 billion annually (2). In the context of 
mental healthcare – the focus of this paper – roughly one in five patients adhere to antidepressant 
medication treatment for more than four months (3), and the majority discontinue within 30 days 
(4).  Low adherence rates do not appear fully attributable to an objective lack of efficacy, as 
those who follow treatment recommendations show lower recurrence risk (5), cardiovascular 
mortality (6), overall mortality (7, 8) and lower suicide rates (9). Individuals who adhere also 
report greater perceived benefits and fewer concerns than those who do not (1). Thus, it is 
somewhat perplexing that patients often do not adhere.  
Beliefs about medication and personality attributes both influence adherence. Adherence 
to psychiatric interventions is lower in those with lower treatment expectancy (10) and in those 
who experience sexual side effects (11). Such findings have led to the 'necessity-concerns 
framework' (12) which proposes that adherence decisions involve weighing expected negative 
outcomes against beliefs about the necessity/efficacy of treatment (13-18). Personality variables 
associated with greater adherence include higher persistence (19, 20), greater self-efficacy (21-
23), lower optimism (24), greater self-control (25), and greater internal locus of control (26)(27).  
Habit formation may also be central to the development of stable health behaviors (28), 
an effect that could generalize to adherence behavior (29, 30). However, studies have found that 
the amount of time required to form strong habits is highly variable (e.g., 18 to 254 days in one

study (31)). The processes that moderate habit formation time are therefore also relevant to 
understanding long-term adherence. 
While several interventions to promote adherence have been tested, involving educational 
(32, 33) counseling (34), and coaching (35) approaches, they have shown low efficacy in 
randomized controlled trials (36). There is therefore a need to better understand the decision-
making processes contributing to adherence. A precise and quantitative delineation of these 
processes could help inform and develop targeted interventions focused on specific adherence-
related processes and provide better measures for predicting adherence.  
Computational psychiatry approaches have recently gained prominence, due in part to their 
potential to quantitatively model behavior and illustrate how several underlying processes can 
contribute to maladaptive perception and decision-making (37-40). In this manuscript we 
introduce a computational model of antidepressant medication adherence, based on the active 
inference framework (41), and examine how it might provide a detailed characterization of 
different probabilistic beliefs and related inference processes that plausibly contribute to 
adherence decisions. This approach could help clarify the way individual differences in 
computational processes can arbitrate between adherence and non-adherence in individual 
patients. We will focus on the initial decision to adhere over the first 12 weeks of treatment, in 
which symptoms typically decline and stabilize (42) and in which side effects first appear and 
subsequently reduce somewhat in severity (43). We also simulate processes that may moderate 
the speed with which individuals develop strong medication-taking habits after their initial 
decision to adhere.

An active inference model of adherence 
The active inference framework (41) is one approach to provide a computational 
framework for adherence. This framework assumes the brain develops a generative model that 
represents different possible states of the world and generates predictions about the outcomes it 
will observe if its beliefs are accurate. It uses observations to update the model and to generate 
sequences of actions (policies) that minimize a statistical quantity called ‘expected free energy’ 
(G); briefly, policies that minimize G are those expected to produce the most preferred 
(rewarding) observations while also maximizing information gain (see table 2).  The specific 
model we use is a Markov decision process (MDP; figure 1), which is particularly useful for 
modeling decision processes that require consideration of distal future outcomes under 
uncertainty (44, 45). The formal basis for these models has been thoroughly detailed elsewhere 
(41, 46-49) (also see tables 1 and 2 for more mathematical detail).

Figure 1. Illustration of the Markov decision process formulation of active inference used in the 
simulations described in this paper. The generative model is here depicted graphically on the right, such 
that arrows indicate dependencies between variables. Here observations (o) depend on hidden states (s), 
where this relationship is specified by the A-matrix, and those states depend on both previous states (as 
specified by the B-matrix, or the initial states specified by the D-vector) and the sequences of actions 
(policies; π) selected by the simulated patient. The probability of selecting a particular policy in turn 
depends on the expected free energy (G) of each policy with respect to the prior preferences (C) of the 
simulated patient. The degree to which expected free energy influences policy selection is also modulated 
by an expected policy precision parameter (γ), which is in turn dependent on a prior over expected 
precision (β; the rate parameter of a gamma distribution, 𝑃(𝛾)  =  Γ(1, 𝜷)) – where higher β values 
promote lower confidence in policy selection (i.e., less influence of the differences in expected free 
energy across policies). The E-vector is a prior distribution over policies, p(π), which also influences 
policy selection and can be thought of as encoding a patient’s habits. For more details regarding the 
associated mathematics, see (46, 53). In our model, the observations were depression symptom levels and 
antidepressant side effects, the hidden states included beliefs about progress in treatment over time and 
beliefs about adherence decisions, and the policies included the choice to adhere or cease adherence at 
each week over 12 weeks of treatment (e.g., choosing to discontinue on a Wednesday vs. a Saturday of a 
given week was treated as the same choice in the model; as described in the main text, this modeling 
choice allowed the integration of week by week empirical data on symptom and side effect trajectories on 
antidepressants). As depicted on the left, our simulations began at “week 0” when treatment was initially 
recommended; the simulated patient then chose whether or not to adhere to treatment based on her beliefs 
about the way that symptoms and side effects would change over time if they did vs. did not adhere (and

her subsequent observations over time). Preferences were set such that the patient had stronger and 
stronger preferences to observe lower and lower symptom levels as well as lower and lower side effect 
levels.  
 
 
One approach to examine the computational processes that might affect adherence is to 
model the decision-making situation for an individual that is newly prescribed an antidepressant 
for a depressive episode (see figure 2). We selected a time frame of the first 12 weeks since most 
antidepressant trials focus on this period.  Moreover, we utilized previously reported decreases in 
depressive severity (42) and the temporal emergence of unwanted effects (43). In our model, the 
policy to adhere or not on (any day during) each of 12 weeks of treatment (13 policies total, 
formally modeled as one choice per week) was based on initial expectations about how 
depressive symptom severity (from 0-10) and side effect severity (from 0-3) would change over 
time given each policy, and on how these expectations were subsequently updated when changes 
in symptoms and side effects were observed by the simulated patient. The 2 state factors in our 
model correspond to beliefs about “progress in treatment” (which predict different combinations 
of observed symptom and side effect levels), and beliefs about whether one is currently choosing 
to adhere (which predict different patterns of change over time in symptom and side effect 
levels).

Figure 2. Displays the levels of hidden state factor 1 and 2 (treatment progress and adherence decisions) 
and their mapping to different lower-level representations of symptom levels and side effect severity (here 
modelled as outcomes). Each combination of levels in the two hidden state factors generated different 
observation patterns and state transitions with different probabilities. Red arrows correspond to the 
observations (and state transitions) generated when the simulated patient chooses to continue medication, 
whereas blue arrows correspond to the observations (and transitions) generated when the patient chooses 
to discontinue medication (see text for details). Black arrows correspond to observations generated by 
hidden states that do not depend on the selection of one policy vs. another. Each of the six parameters in 
the model are also illustrated with a brief description (and described in the text in more detail). For 
example, symptom predictability was modulated by reducing the precision of the mapping from hidden 
state levels to symptom severity observations. Response magnitude was modulated by shifting the 
observable symptom severities toward lower or higher levels. Side effect severity was modulated by 
shifting the observable side effect levels to higher or lower values. For example, while in the figure it 
shows that moderate side effects are generated in the first six weeks of treatment and mild side effects are 
observed thereafter, this could be shifted such that they instead transition from severe to moderate, or 
from mild to none. Policy depth controlled the number of future transitions in treatment progress specified 
for each allowable policy in the patient’s model, only allowing the patient to consider the outcomes of 
different policies over a limited number of weeks into the future. See the text and tables for a thorough 
description of these and other parameters.

π A distribution over action policies 
encoding the predicted value of each 
policy. In this model, each policy is a 
series of allowable actions, where 
actions correspond to different state 
transitions (i.e., different ‘B’ matrices) 
that can be chosen by the patient. 
Policies are chosen by sampling from this 
distribution. 
Allowable policies included the decision to 
continue taking the medication over 12 
weeks or to cease medication at any week 
prior to week 12. That is, the patient could 
choose to transition from the state of 
‘adhering’ to the state of ‘not adhering’ at 
each week.

A matrix encoding beliefs about how

each matrix corresponds to one action 
(state transition) that the patient may 
choose at a given time point (if 
consistent with an allowable policy). 
Encodes beliefs about the way treatment 
progress will change given the choice to 
adhere or not adhere at each week of 
treatment. For the hidden state factor 
corresponding to being in a state of 
‘adhering’ or ‘not adhering’, distinct B 
matrices encoded the controllable 
transitions of either remaining in the state 
of ‘adhering’ or transitioning to the state of 
‘not adhering.’

severities.

Higher values in this matrix indicate a 
greater number of previous choices to 
adhere vs. not adhere to medications in the 
past. 
 
 
Several matrices/vectors in an MDP define the probabilistic relationships between each 
of these variables (see figure 3A); these include matrices encoding the relationships between 
states and observations (A-matrices; 1 per observation modality), how states are expected to 
change over time (B-matrices; at least 1 per state factor – if greater than 1, each possible 
transition corresponds to an action option), the relative preference for some observations over 
others (C-matrices; 1 per observation modality), expectations about the initial states one will 
start out in (D-vectors; 1 per state factor), and prior expectations about which policies one is 
most likely to choose in general (E-vector; 1 probability entry assigned to each policy). For more 
mathematical detail about each of these variables/matrices, see tables 1 and 2 and figure 1.

 Figure 3. (A) Displays select A-, B-, C-matrices, and D-vectors, that specify the generative model. A 
encodes state-observation mappings (i.e., columns = states, rows = observations), B encodes policy-
dependant state transitions (i.e., columns = states at time t, rows = states at time t+1), C encodes 
preference distributions (i.e., columns = time, rows = observed symptoms [top] or side effects [bottom]), 
and D encodes priors over initial states (indicating that each simulation starts in an undecided state and at 
0 weeks of treatment progress), respectively. Lighter colors indicate higher probabilities. (B) Illustrates 
how A-matrices, the allowable policy space, and the E-vector (encoding priors over policies, 
implementing habits) are altered under different parameter values. Symptom predictability: the precision 
of the first A-matrix (i.e., encoding beliefs about how precisely different “progress in treatment” levels – 
corresponding to the amount of time on the medication – will lead to different observed symptom levels) 
could be adjusted via specifying the standard deviation of an associated Gaussian probability density 
function (SDs = 1, 2, and 4 are shown here from left to right). This allowed symptoms to fluctuate both 
upward or downward around the mean of the symptom response trajectory with different degrees of 
predictability. (Middle row, left) Response magnitude: Relative to that shown in figure 3A, medication 
response magnitude could be modulated down (from left to right) to moderate, weak, and very weak 
responses, corresponding to incremental shifts upward and to the right in the same matrix. (Bottom row, 
left) Side effect levels: The second A-matrix (i.e., encoding beliefs about how taking the medication will 
generate different side effect severities over time) could also be modulated to simulate the magnitude of 
side effect responses over time. From left to right, the patient either initially experienced severe side 
effects that eventually settled at moderate levels, initially moderate levels of that eventually settled at mild 
levels, or initially mild levels that eventually resolved. Each parameterization could be performed 
separately for the generative process and the simulated patient’s generative model – allowing the patient 
to observe outcomes inconsistent with her initial expectations. (Right, top) Policy depth: illustrates the 
allowable policies under different policy depths (number of future timesteps considered in decision-
making). (Right, bottom) Habit strength: In specific simulations (with a policy depth of 1) described 
below, the E-vector (a prior over policies) was specified so as to simulate medication taking habits based 
on 1, 15, 30, and 60 previous choices to take medication.

The prior on expected policy precision 
term (𝛃) is the 'rate' parameter of a 
gamma distribution, which is a standard 
distribution to use as a prior for 
expected precision (𝛾). This latter term 
modulates the influence of expected 
free energy on policy selection. When 𝛽 
is high (reflecting low confidence about 
whether one should choose to adhere 
to medication), policy selection 
becomes less deterministic and is more 
strongly influenced by prior habits. 
When subsequent observations alter 
the precision of the distribution over 
policies (𝛑 − 𝛑0), the value for 𝛽 is 
updated to reflect this change in 
decision uncertainty. 
 
The A-matrices were constructed such that steadily lowering (but fluctuating) symptom 
levels were generated for each week the patient continued to take the medication. Specifically, 
Gaussian distributions were specified over a symptom severity scale from 0 to 10, with 
empirically based means that probabilistically decreased from baseline levels over the 1st 6 
weeks of treatment and then remained somewhat stable thereafter (i.e., depending on the 
standard deviations set for these distributions). The means were based on dose response time 
courses characterized in a mega analysis of three SSRIs (42): 9.36, 8.04, 6.91, 5.94, 5.10, 4.38, 
3.77. Adherence also generated moderate side effect levels in the first six weeks and mild side

effect levels from weeks 7-12 (based on the antidepressant side effect time courses characterized 
in (43)). The choice to cease adherence led to the cessation of side effects and a gradual return to 
baseline symptom levels.  
The B-matrices were constructed so that the patient controlled the transition from the 
state of ‘continue medication’ to the state of ‘discontinue medication’ at each week (i.e., if two 
individuals ceased taking the medication on different days during the same week, these were 
formally treated as the same choice). Simultaneously, each action was associated with transitions 
toward increasing or decreasing “progress in treatment” levels, respectively. The C-matrices 
were constructed such that the patient most preferred the lowest symptom levels (ln 𝑃(𝑜): from -
10 to 0) and the lowest side effect severity (ln 𝑃(𝑜): 0, -2, -4, -6). The D-vectors were 
constructed such that the patient always began in an initial state of being “undecided” about 
choosing to adhere, and always began in an initial state of being at 0 weeks of treatment 
progress. The E-vector was initially set such that the patient had no bias (habit) for choosing to 
adhere or not (i.e., a flat prior distribution over policies).  
The parameters in our model are described in table 3, and their influence on the 
matrices/vectors defining the model are depicted in figure 3B. These correspond to individual 
differences in (beliefs about) the predictability and magnitude of changes in symptoms and side 
effects, how far into the future one considers when making decisions (policy depth), confidence 
in the consequences of choosing different actions (expected policy precision), and the strength of 
medication-taking habits.

Objective 
symptom 
predictability 
The standard deviation 
of a Gaussian

the A matrix in the 
generative process that 
produces observed 
symptom reductions 
over time when

Lower levels of

indicate that 
changes in

medication will be 
less 
stable/predictable 
(around the mean 
trajectory) from 
week to week. 
Generally, less predictable 
symptoms (greater day-to-day 
symptom fluctuations) deter 
adherence. Greater random 
(upward) fluctuations can also be 
sufficient in certain cases to 
change an individual’s beliefs 
such that they now think the drug 
is ineffective.

A parameter that

was specified as single 
symptom level shifts up

(strong, moderate,

response magnitudes 
corresponded to 0, 1, 2,

A parameter that

Policy depth The number of time 
steps over which action 
policies are specified. 
This ranged from 1 to 12 
weeks, indicating the 
distance in the future 
one considers when 
planning how to act. A 
12-week time period 
was chosen to match 
with the typical 
timeframe studied in 
antidepressant drug 
trials. Reducing policy 
depth was implemented 
by simply reducing the 
number of time steps in 
the simulation over 
which allowable policies 
were specified (i.e., 
while holding all other 
transition probabilities 
and other contingencies 
identical). 
Lower policy depth 
indicates that, when 
people are deciding 
whether or not to 
adhere, they do not 
consider the 
changes in 
symptoms and side 
effects that will 
occur as far into the 
future. For example, 
they might think 
“I’m not going to 
take the medication 
because it’s going to 
make me feel bad 
tomorrow” without 
considering that it 
will make them feel 
much better after 
several weeks. 
A high policy depth promotes 
adherence when an individual 
expects that, despite initially 
feeling worse (or not improving), 
in the long run they will 
ultimately feel better overall.

Results 
 
Simulating individual differences in adherence 
 
Initial simulations  
The left panel of figure 4 illustrates an example simulation under one set of parameter values, in 
which policy depth was at its maximum value of 12, symptom predictability was moderate (SD = 
2), symptom reductions were high (i.e., the simulated patient was a “strong responder” to the 
medication), side effects were moderate, expected policy precision was high (β = 1), and no 
medication-taking habit had been formed (the E-vector distribution remained flat over all 
policies). Here the patient chose to adhere and observed steady symptom reductions and some 
initial moderate side effects that decreased to mild levels after the first six weeks. The middle

panel illustrates another example simulation in which symptom predictability was moderate (SD 
= 2), symptom reductions were moderate, and side effects were severe. In this case, the patient 
chose not to adhere. In these simulations, the patient’s expectations were consistent with 
subsequent observations. The right panel illustrates a simulation in which the patient believed 
symptom predictability was higher than it really was (SD = 0.5 vs. 2) and side effects and 
symptom reductions were moderate (which was expected). The patient took the medication the 
first two weeks, but ceased adhering after observing an unexpected increase in symptom levels.

adhere at each of the 12 weeks, the middle plots display observed symptoms over time with severities 
from 10 to 1, and the bottom plots illustrate observed side effects from mild to severe. Under the 
parameter values used in the left simulation, including (accurate) expectations for moderate side effects, 
strong symptom reductions, and moderate symptom predictability (SD = 2), the patient chose to adhere. 
Under the parameter values used in the middle simulation, in which there were (accurate) expectations for 
moderate symptom reductions, moderate symptom predictability (SD = 2) and severe side effects, the 
patient chose not to adhere – leading to an absence of side effects and symptoms continuing to fluctuate 
around baseline levels. Under the parameter values used in the right simulation, in which the patient 
expected symptoms to be more predictable than they actually were, (SD = 0.5 vs. 2) the patient initially 
chose to adhere but then stopped when she observed an unexpected fluctuation upward in symptom 
intensity and a moderate increase in side effects (side effects and symptom reductions were moderate, 
which was expected). After ceasing medication, side effects resolved and symptoms continued to 
fluctuate around baseline levels. See the main text for more details about the parameter manipulations in 
each simulation. 
 
Parameter interactions in the context of accurate expectations 
To better characterize this parameter space, we repeated the simulations above under 
many combinations of parameter values. Figure 5 illustrates two example plots from part of this 
parameter space where the patient had accurate expectations; medication response magnitude 
and side effect severity were fixed at moderate levels. Here, the x-axis in each plot corresponds 
to symptom predictability (from low to high: SDs from 4 to 0.1); the y-axis corresponds to policy 
depth (from 2 to 12 weeks). The left plot corresponds low expected policy precision (β = 10), 
and the right corresponds to high expected policy precision (β = 1). Black squares correspond to 
patients that remained adherent, whereas white squares indicate ceased adherence prior to week 
12. As can be seen, there is a clear boundary in which, below a certain policy depth and level of 
symptom predictability, adherence ceases. Interestingly, adherence increases across the space 
when expected policy precision is low. This suggests that, with greater decision uncertainty (it is 
less clear that one policy will produce more preferred observations than others), one is more 
likely to adhere in an “exploratory” manner (e.g., “I don’t think this will work, but who 
knows?”).

Figure 5. Two example plots from a larger parameter space with dimensions corresponding to different 
values for policy depth, symptom predictability, drug response magnitude, side effect severity, and 
expected policy precision. In these two plots the simulated patient had accurate expectations about what 
she would observe under different policies, and medication response magnitude and side effect severity 
were fixed at moderate levels. The x-axis in each plot corresponds to symptom predictability (from low to 
high: i.e., SDs from 4 to 0.1), whereas the y-axis corresponds to policy depth (from 2 to 12 weeks). The 
plot on the left corresponds to a simulated patient with low expected policy precision (β = 10), whereas 
the plot on the right corresponds to a patient with high expected policy precision (β = 1). Black squares in 
these plots correspond to patients that remained adherent all the way into week 12, whereas white squares 
indicate patients that ceased adherence prior to week 12. The main text for interpretation.

levels of medication response magnitudes (larger x-axis across plots, left to right from very weak to

severity). As in figure 5, within each plot black indicates continued adherence and white indicates non-
adherence. Within each plot, the expected predictability of symptom changes over time increases from 
left to right (i.e., SDs from 4 to 0.1), and policy depth increases from bottom to top (from 2 to 12 weeks). 
The plot on the left corresponds to a simulated patient with low expected policy precision (β = 10), 
whereas the plot on the right corresponds to a patient with high expected policy precision (β = 1). See

Crucially, in the previous simulations it was assumed that the patient’s beliefs about the 
effects of medication were accurate. However, a patient’s beliefs need not match reality. As 
such, we then dissociated the patient’s beliefs from the statistics of subsequent observations to 
see if surprise would influence adherence in interesting ways. Supplementary figure S1 depicts 
some illustrative locations in this space. The x-axis in each graph corresponds to subjective 
beliefs about symptom predictability, where actual symptom predictability instead varies 
between groups of plots (see figure legend for more details). Similarly, beliefs about drug 
response magnitude and side effect severity are now depicted across plots within each group of 
plots, whereas actual drug response magnitude and side effect severity vary across groups of 
plots.  
 
When observed symptom reductions were highly unreliable/noisy, the patient only 
remained adherent if prior expectations very precisely predicted that they would be reliable. 
When observed symptom reductions were instead highly consistent/reliable, the patient 
surprisingly also chose to adhere when expecting symptom reductions to be highly unreliable. 
Thorough inspections of the parameter space confirmed that, in these cases of highly reliable or 
unreliable symptom reductions, there was little influence of expected policy precision, drug 
response magnitude, or side effect severity. Other interesting results were observable in cases of 
objectively moderate levels of symptom reduction reliability. For example, there appears to be a 
general effect in which adherence was higher when expectations about side effects matched the 
actual side effects observed. This effect was more pronounced in the case of objectively strong 
drug responses; in the case of objectively weak drug responses and severe side effects, adherence 
levels became more dependent on the expected reliability of symptom reductions. In cases of

objectively low side effects, adherence went up in general, most notably in cases of high policy 
depth and the belief that symptom reductions would be unreliable (unless expected side effects 
were severe). 
The finding that adherence is higher when expected observations about side effects are 
confirmed appears sensible, in that, if one initially chose to “try out” adherence based on one’s 
expectations, non-preferred surprising observations would be more likely to “change one’s 
mind” later. The finding that, in the context of objectively reliable symptom reductions, 
adherence occurs at low but not intermediate levels of expected symptom predictability is 
initially more surprising. However, when symptoms are expected to fluctuate very unreliably, it 
makes sense retrospectively that being “pleasantly surprised” that observations are more reliable 
than expected would promote adherence. In contrast, if one initially expects moderate 
predictability, the level of surprise may not be sufficient to change one’s mind. Finally, it is 
fairly intuitive that, in the face of highly fluctuating symptoms, adherence would require a strong 
counteracting belief that they would still be reliable at future time points (e.g., “it’s been a 
bumpy ride to start, but I think things are going to stabilize soon”). 
 
Parameter interactions in the context of habit formation 
To investigate why some individuals take much longer to form strong habits than others 
(as reviewed in the introduction), we ran a final set of simulations in which we manipulated the 
strength of the patient’s habit to take medication. We manipulated the E-matrix to simulate the 
effect of a patient having previously taken the medication different numbers of times (i.e., 1, 15, 
30, and 60 previous medication-taking decisions). Policy depth was set to 1, such that the patient 
was not forward-looking beyond the immediate expected consequences of adhering. As can be

seen in figure 7, different simulated patients begin to adhere habitually after different lengths of 
time depending on other parameter values. Longer time periods of previous adherence lead to 
habitual adherence. Habits took longer to develop when expected drug responses were low and 
unpredictable, and when expected side effect severity was high (i.e., the medication-taking 
“impulse” less effectively competed against explicit planning when strongly non-preferred or 
unpredictable outcomes were expected to occur immediately). Low expected policy precision led 
to much faster habit formation. Psychologically, this might be interpreted as indicating an 
interesting (and somewhat paradoxical) predicted effect. That is, in the context of higher side 
effects and lower drug responses, individuals who are less confident in decision-making should 
be more likely to adhere long-term than those who confidently predict at treatment onset that the 
drug will not be very helpful.

Figure 7. A depiction of the influence of habit formation at different habit strengths, based on the 
previous number of times (e.g., days) that a simulated patient has chosen to take the medication, under 
different values for the other parameters in the model. Within each square, black indicates adherence and 
white indicates non-adherence. Within each square, the expected predictability of symptom changes over 
time increases from left to right (i.e., SDs from 4 to 0.1). The expected magnitude of symptom reductions 
increases between squares from left to right (from very weak to strong response). The expected severity 
of side effects increases between squares from bottom to top (from low to high severity). The left and 
right plots within each quadrant correspond to low vs. high expected policy precision values (β = 10 and β 
= 1, respectively). Each quadrant corresponds to the number of previous medication taking actions. Habit 
formation was modeled via manipulation of the E-vector by increasing the probability, in terms of counts 
(i.e., 1, 15, 30, and 60 previous medication-taking decisions), of the medication-taking action relative to 
other allowable actions. Here the patient also had a policy depth of 1 (i.e., y-axis within each square only 
has 1 value), such that she was not forward-looking beyond the immediate expected consequences of 
adhering. The patient otherwise had accurate expectations about the observations she would make under 
different actions. See main text for interpretation.

The goal of this manuscript was to provide a computational framework to develop novel 
approaches that can be used to increase adherence.  Simulations were used to quantitatively 
illustrate distinct decision-making processes that could contribute to differences in adherence 
behavior. These simulations demonstrate how adherence can be influenced by several underlying 
computational processes. This supports the plausibility of heterogeneous causes of non-
adherence (for a summary of possible causes in our model, see table 3). For example, while some 
patients may focus on proximal as opposed to distal future outcomes (i.e., low policy depth), 
others may focus on distal future outcomes but believe those outcomes are highly unreliable or 
that they will be worse overall if they follow treatment recommendations. Some patients may be 
characterized by intermediate combinations, such as intermediate policy depth and competing 
beliefs about moderately beneficial medication effects and moderately aversive side effects, both 
weighted by the relative confidence they have in each of those beliefs. Finally, differences in 
previous experience taking medication can lead to differences in adherence-promoting habit 
formation – where each of the other factors described above can influence how quickly such 
habits gain sufficient strength to maintain long-term adherence behavior. One advantage of the 
model is that each of these factors and their interactions can be simulated mathematically. The 
pragmatic utility of this approach will depend on developing experimental paradigms and/or 
questionnaires to estimate parameter values based on a given individual’s behavior. This model 
could potentially make predictions about where interesting “tipping points” would begin to favor 
non-adherence over adherence in that individual’s decision process.  
At least three important research implications follow. First, it will be important to either 
identify or design simple measures (e.g., that could be administered in a clinic) capable of 
characterizing where an individual patient falls within the parameter space we have described.

31 
 
Such measures could potentially improve prediction of who will and will not adhere to a 
prescribed treatment. For example, our model would predict lower adherence in those who self-
report overconfidence in their current plan of action, the tendency to focus on short-term 
outcomes, and either pessimistic or unrealistic expectations about how their symptoms and side 
effects would change over time.  
With respect to existing measures, the values for some parameters might be assessed by 
those used within the “necessity versus concerns” framework, such as the Beliefs about 
Medicines Questionnaire (12) or the revised Medication Adherence Reasons Scale (50) – 
perhaps most plausibly the parameters associated with beliefs about the magnitude of symptom 
reductions and side effects. In table 4, we have also listed a number of example self-report items 
that, based on our model (and straightforward extensions of it), could be useful for gathering 
information about a patient’s adherence-relevant beliefs. Once in a validated form, this type of 
questionnaire could be tested for its utility in predicting adherence behavior in advance. 
The values of other parameters, in contrast, might be informed by personality measures. 
For example, the behavior associated with persistence (20) and locus of control (26) could follow 
from a combination of beliefs in high future predictability and high expected policy precision 
(and likely preferences with strong magnitudes as well). Low self-efficacy (21) could instead 
follow from a combination of low expected policy precision and precise expectations for non-
preferred outcomes (while optimism  may correspond to precise expectations for preferred 
outcomes, perhaps with or without taking medication – which could explain why more optimistic 
individuals are less likely to adhere; (24)). This is speculative, however, and will need to be 
examined in future work.

A second implication is that it will be important within the field of computational 
psychiatry to attempt to develop tasks, or find ways of acquiring detailed adherence behavior 
data, that could be used in conjunction with a formal model (such as the one we described above) 
to explicitly fit to patient behavior. This would potentially allow for a more detailed and 
informative way to phenotype decision-making processes within individual patients and afford 
more precise empirical predictions. It should be mentioned, however, that this may be 
challenging since the behavior in question involves simple binary decisions. If multiple 
parameter value combinations can produce the exact same behavior, this prevents identification 
of unique parameter values that best explain individual patients’ behavior. As such, this endeavor 
will likely require use of very detailed behavioral data, perhaps involving day-by-day 
medication-taking actions.  
A third implication pertains to the need for effective adherence-promoting interventions. 
As reviewed above, current interventions have met with limited success (36), which could be due 
to heterogeneity in underlying mechanisms as well as a failure to specifically target those 
mechanisms. Based on the factors highlighted in our model, it might be possible to improve the 
ability of current interventions (or design new interventions) to intervene in a targeted manner. 
The degree of modifiability in those factors is an open question, but certainly one worth 
pursuing. Based on our simulations, we would predict that both of the following should improve 
adherence: 
1. Increasing future-oriented thinking (policy depth) 
2. Attenuating overconfidence (expected policy precision) 
Additionally, we would predict that adherence would be improved by first providing 
patients with available information about what to expect regarding likely symptom and side

effect trajectories (and the actual uncertainty around those expectations) – and then using 
observations early in treatment to update expectations about the most likely trajectory for that 
individual. This goes beyond simple psychoeducation, which alone has been found to be 
ineffective in improving antidepressant adherence rates (51), and should motivate future research 
into how individual symptom and side effect trajectories could be diagnosed as early as possible. 
This also relates to potential uses of our model for psychoeducation. For example, by making the 
various model components salient to a patient (e.g., by considering their own answers to the 
example questions in table 4), they could become more aware of how these beliefs influence 
their own decision-making. 
It is important to stress the oversimplified and incomplete nature of the model we have 
presented. For simulations one must unavoidably make somewhat arbitrary decisions about the 
values that should be assigned to fixed parameters (and what parameters to fix). For example, we 
chose to set the preference magnitudes for side effects and symptom levels to specific values, 
and the simulation results would be expected to differ somewhat if different values had been 
chosen. A possible future direction could be to calibrate the model to individuals’ preference 
magnitudes (e.g., how much they personally dislike particular symptoms and side effects) and 
use this to simulate/predict their future adherence behavior. We also did not manipulate beliefs 
about the predictability of side effects, which could influence adherence decisions. In these 
cases, we instead chose to hold these factors fixed and examine the effect of altering the 
dynamics of observed symptoms/side effect levels over time on versus off treatment.  
There may also be additional factors that were not modeled explicitly, but that could be 
simulated within the model we have presented (and in principle used in characterizing patients’ 
decisions). For example, some individuals may simply forget to take their medication a couple of

times and then cease altogether (50). In our model, this could be captured in part by low 
expected policy precision (i.e., increasing randomness in behavior), but would need to be 
combined with other factors such as the belief that all progress has been lost (as could be 
encoded within the individual’s transition beliefs [B-matrix]). As another example, some people 
might cease medication after experiencing symptom improvement because they expect such 
improvements to remain stable after ceasing to take the drug (and the belief that side effects 
would go away (52)). This could also be captured in our model with straightforward adjustments 
to the B-matrix.  
Conclusion 
This active inference model is an important first step in developing a precise and 
quantitative delineation of decision-making factors and dynamics that influence a patient’s 
decision to adhere to treatment. Because of the model’s generality, it can also be very easily 
extended to model adherence to other medications, simply by inserting the symptom reduction 
and side effect profiles that characterize those medications. For example, it follows from the 
general model structure that adherence to immediately rewarding medications (e.g. 
benzodiazepines) would be high and promote fast habit formation, but behavior would also be 
influenced by the same parameters used here to investigate antidepressant adherence. The next 
steps in using these models will require identifying means of empirically characterizing and 
intervening on these mechanisms in an individualized manner.

them feel farther in the future. Please indicate below how far into the future you typically consider 
when trying to decide whether to take the medication. (Circle one)
