Abstract  
 
The optimism bias is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the likelihood of good 
outcomes and underestimate the likelihood of bad outcomes. Associated with improved quality 
of life, optimism bias is considered to be adaptive and is a promising avenue of research for 
mental health interventions in conditions where individuals lack optimi sm such as  major 
depressive disorder.  Here we lay the groundwork for future research on optimism as an 
intervention by introducing a domain general formal model of optimism bias , which can be 
applied in different task settings. Employing the active inference framework , we propose a 
model of the optimism bias as precision over a positive outcome. First, we simulate  how 
optimism may be lost during d evelopment by exposure to negative events. We then ground 
our model in the empirical literature by showing how the developmentally acquired differences 
in optimism are expressed in a  belief updating task typically used to assess optimism bias. 
Finally, we show how optimism affects action in a modified two-armed bandit task. Our model 
and the simulations it affords provide a computational basis for understanding how  optimism 
bias may emerge, how it may be expressed in standard tas ks used to assess optimism, and 
how it affects agents ’ decision-making and actions; in combination, this  provides a basis for 
future research on optimism as a mental health intervention.

Introduction 
The optimism bias is cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the likelihood of good 
outcomes and underestimate the likelihood of bad outcomes (Sharot, 2011; Sharot et al., 
2007). Studies of the optimism bias suggest optimism is adaptive , as it is associated with 
improved quality of life  (Sharot, 2011). Benefits related to optimis m include lower risk of all-
cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (Krittanawong et al., 2022), engagement in more 
self-care behaviours and lower fatigue symptoms reported in chronic illness (de Ridder et al., 
2004), improved cogniti ve functioning  following traumatic brain injury  (Lee et al., 2019) , 
improved cardiovascular response to stress (Terrill et al., 2010),  and immune function, where 
optimists have improved immune response following a stressor (Curzytek et al., 2018). Social 
factors that are improved by optimism include higher salaries at work, greater achievement in 
education, and better performance in sport (Sharot, 2011). Taking these findings together, it 
is unsurprising that optimistic individuals have less overall stress and worry (Conversano et 
al., 2010). Interestingly, optimism is a robust bias and is seen across species (Bateson et al., 
2011; Iki & Adachi, 2023; Lagisz et al., 2020) . However, mental health conditions, such as 
major depression, are linked to diminished optimism or a negativity bias suggesting optimism 
may be los t throughout life (Garrett et al., 2014; Korn et al., 2014) . Specifically, individuals  
suffering from depression have been shown to either have no optimism bias, or a pessimism 
bias where individuals overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes (Garrett et al., 2014; 
Hobbs et al., 2022; Korn et al., 2014). Core symptoms of depression, such as anhedonia and 
apathy result in withdrawing from the world, the opposite behaviour that optimism promotes 
(Cooper et al., 2018 ; Fisher et al., 2024 ; Rizvi et al., 2016) , and treatment of depression 
includes behavioural activation that reverses this behaviour by encouraging engagement with 
the world (Soucy Chartier & Provencher, 2013; Tindall et al., 2017).  
 
Given the multitude of beneficial outcomes related to the optimism bias, and its propensity to 
increase one's engagement with the world in line with behavioural activation treatments, this 
bias may offer a promising avenue of research into interventions for mental health conditions 
in cases where individuals appear to lack optimism or have a negativity bias. To consider the 
optimism bias as a potential  target for mental health interventions , it is important to have a 
grounding quantitative understanding of how it can be acquired over the course of 
development, how it is expressed in common tasks designed to measure it, and how it affects 
actions. Here, we propose a computational model of optimism and use a series of simulation 
experiments to deepen our understanding of optimism bias across these domains . This 
quantitative understanding of optimism allows us to approach a number of questions relevant 
to treatment such as the level of optimism most conducive for positive outcomes, who may 
benefit from an optimism bias intervention, and potential unwan ted side effects of increasing 
optimism. The aspirational end goal in developing this computational model  is to explore 
treatments tailored to  individual patients, taking into account their particular symptoms and 
environment (Adams et al., 2015; K. Friston, 2022; Goldway et al., 2023; Huys et al., 2016; 
Montague et al., 2012). 
 
To provide a formal conceptualisation of the optimism bias, we employ the active inference 
framework (K. J. Friston & Stephan, 2007; Parr et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022)  to propose a 
computational model of optimism based. We model optimism bias as a domain general prior 
belief of higher precision over positive outcomes than negative outcomes; this is the belief ‘I 
3 
believe I will observe a good outcome’. A domain general model of the optimism bias allows 
us to apply the model to a range of different task settings through simulation, speaking to the 
rich literature on the bias. We begin by showing how optimism bias may be lost and acquired 
in development, taking arousal into account. We then leverage a belief updating task to show 
how our model corresponds to studies of levels of optimism, as found in the literature. Finally, 
we use a modified two-armed bandit task to show how optimism affects action in a task setting. 
By developing an optimism bias model that demonstrates how optimism is related to 
development, belief updating, and action, we provide a foundation for further research into 
optimism as a potential intervention.

Methods 
The active inference framework  
The active inference framework models perception, planning and decision making as hidden 
state inference, and learning as parameter estimation , under a generative model of the 
environment (K. J. Friston & Stephan, 2007; Parr et al., 2022; Sajid et al. , 2021; Smith et al., 
2022). The generative model takes the form of a partially observable Markov decision process 
(Littman, 2009), which models perception and decision making in environments where there 
is an uncertain mapping between the hidden states (s) generating sensory observations and 
the sensory  observations themselves (o). The full joint probability for POMDP under a specific 
policy is shown below where 𝑝(𝑠1) is the prior over the initial state of the agent, 𝜋 is the policy 
of the agent, 𝑝(𝑜τ |𝑠τ) the likelihood, and 𝑝(𝑠τ |𝑠τ−1,𝜋) the transition probability.  
 
𝑝(𝑜1:T ,𝑠1:T |π)= 𝑝(𝑠1) ∏𝑝(𝑜τ |𝑠τ)
T
τ=1
 ∏𝑝(𝑠τ |𝑠τ−1,𝜋)

τ=2
  
 
 
Perception and decision making under this model proceed in a two-step fashion. For the first, 
perceptual step, the agent must invert the generative model to infer the posterior probability 
of hidden states given a set of observations. Under active inference this is formulated as 
variational Bayesian inference, which infers an approximate posterior distribution 𝑞(𝑠) through 
the minimisation of marginal free energy  (F), an objective function encoding the expected 
difference between the approximate posterior and generative model (the POMDP).  The 
equation for marginal free energy is show n below in matrix form  where 𝐀∶( 𝑝(𝑜τ |𝑠τ))  is a 
likelihood matrix encoding how likely an observation is given the state an agent is in. The 
transition matrix, 𝐁 :(𝑝(𝑠τ |𝑠τ−1,𝜋)) encodes how the hidden states change over time (that is, 
given the agent was in one state at time 1, what is the probability they are in that state at time 
2). 𝐁† denotes the transpose of 𝐁 with normalised columns (i.e., columns that sum to 1).  
 
𝐹𝜋,𝜏 = 𝑠𝜋,𝜏 ⋅ ( ln 𝑠𝜋,𝜏 − 1 
2 ( ln𝐁𝜋,𝜏−1𝑠𝜋,𝜏−1+ ln 𝐁†𝜋,𝜏𝑠𝜋,𝜏+1 ) − ln𝐀T∙𝑜𝜏) 
 
 
The approximate posterior is iteratively updated through gradient descent (where 𝜀𝜋,𝜏 = 
𝜕𝐹𝜋,𝜏
𝜕𝑠𝜋,𝜏
) 
until the model converges (in practice for relatively simple models, such as those used in this 
paper, the posterior converges rapidly so we only consider a maximum of 16 steps).  The 
posterior distribution over states (𝑠𝜋,𝜏) updates with each iteration. The update equations 
describing this process are shown below: 
 
 
𝜀𝜋,𝜏 ←ln𝐀T∙𝑜𝜏 +1
2(ln(𝐁𝜋𝜏𝑠𝜋𝜏−1)+ln(𝐁𝜋𝜏𝑠𝜋𝜏−1))− ln𝑠𝜋,𝜏 
 
𝑣𝜋,𝜏 ← 𝑣𝜋,𝜏 +𝜀𝜋,𝜏 
5 
 
𝑠𝜋,𝜏 ←𝜎(𝑣𝜋,𝜏) 
 
 
As the state of the environment depends on the actions of the agent (e.g. the location of the 
eyes in a visual field), the inference procedure for hidden states is conditioned on each policy 
(𝑠𝜋,𝜏 =𝑞(𝑠|𝜋)). This inference procedure equips the agent with a posterior distribution 𝑞(𝑠|𝜋) 
(the final 𝑠𝜋,𝜏 value) approximating the true state of the environment under each action. 
 
Next the agent must infer policies  (𝜋) (action sequences) that will minimise expected free 
energy (𝐺), which encodes the  expected difference between the approximate posterior 
distribution and the generative model. Note that for the decision -making step, observations 
must be treated as random variables as future observations by definition are not yet known by 
the agent.

To minimise expected free energy  (𝐺𝜋) the agent must select policies which maximise the 
probability of receiving preferred observations (i.e. minimise risk), reduce uncertainty between 
hidden state s and observations (i.e. minimise ambiguity), and minimise uncertainty in the 
parameters of the generative model (i.e. maximise novelty). The first term in 𝐺𝜋, risk, scores 
how well the observations expected under each policy align with the agent’s prior preferences 
encoded in the matrix 𝐂. The second term , ambiguity, scores the precision of the mapping 
between the hidden states and observations expected under each policy. The third  term, 
novelty, quantifies the extent to which the observations expected under each policy increase 
the agent’s certainty about the parameters of the likelihood matrix, which drives the agent to 
seek novel information. 
 
Under active inference, learning involves updating the concentration parameters of the (prior) 
Dirichlet distributions over the categorical distributions encoded in the  D vector and A and B 
matrices. For 𝐀 matrix learning, a count representing the co-occurrence of a state-observation 
pair is added after every observation, and for 𝐃 vector learning a count representing the state 
the agent found itself in  is added to the parameters of the 𝐃 vector. The relevant equations 
are shown below.

𝒅𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙+1 =   𝒅𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙 + 𝑠𝜏=1   
 
We have so far described the  generative model capturing the agents’ beliefs about the 
environment. The environment itself is captured by the generative process, which in this case 
is identical in structure to the generative model (i.e. , shares the same A, B, D matrices) but 
can differ in terms of the parameters of the probability distributions , and does not include 
parameter learning or policy selection . For example, the generative process of a gambling 
task might have the objective probability of a win in  the left arm at 70%, but the agent may 
believe that it is more or less than this value. This aspect of the active inference framework is 
crucial to our model of optimism bias which, by definition, involves agents overestimating the 
likelihood of good events. 
 
Finally, we note that in principle , when formulated as a POMDP , the active inference 
framework is equivalent to variants of model based reinforcement learning that include  
information seeking terms that maximise the information gain about the mapping between 
hidden states and observations (e.g. Houthooft et al., 2017) and maximise parameter novelty 
(e.g. UCB  (Sutton & Barto, 2018) ). We opted to use active inference for reasons of 
convenience as it is not necessary to include ad hoc terms in the objective function, and for 
congruence with a previous study, which used active inference models to fit to behavioural 
data on optimism bias (Fisher et al., 2024) 
Optimism Bias Model 
We formalise optimism as a state factor in the generative model that can be applied across 
simulations and tasks. We use the state factor (D), learnt in our first simulation experiment, in 
the subsequent two tasks to represent how the agent may implement an optimism bias in a 
wide range of situations, where agents can use prior beliefs flexibly in different scenarios. 
Thus, applying the state factor (D) from one model to another allows us to investigate how one 
may use the same prior belief across task settings. 
 
The optimism hidden state factor ( D) encodes the precision over positive outcomes for each 
agent, that is, the precision of the agent’s preferred observations. This belief formalises the 
hypothesised role of optimism in everyday life, for example, ‘If I go to the party, I am likely to 
meet someone I connect with’ or ‘If I work out, I am likely to reduce my risk of cancer’ where 
the (optimistically overestimated) positive outcomes are meeting someone to connect with and 
reducing the risk of cancer, respectively. The optimism hidden state factor (D) has two states, 
so that the agent can be in an optimistic or pessimistic state. We refer to the optimism bias in 
terms of the probability of the agent being in either state. For example, if the optim ism state 
factor for an agent is D=[0.8, 0.2], the agent would be at optimism level 0.8.

Simulation Overview  
In order to explore how optimism bias, formalised as the precision over preferred observations,  
relates to development, belief updating, and action selection, we ran three simulation 
experiments (Figure 1). First, we investigate how optimism can be lost or maintained during 
(in silico) childhood. The optimism learnt from the first simulation is then applied to Experiment 
2 and 3, with the aim of exploring how the same agent would perform in different environments. 
Experiments 1 and 2 involve minimising marginal free energy (𝐹𝜋,𝜏) and Experiment 3 involves 
minimising both 𝐹𝜋,𝜏 and expected free energy (𝐺𝜋).

Figure 1: i. The left panel shows Experiment 1, which is a simulation where the agent is exposed to 
negative and positive valence and high and low arousal events. This simulates how the optimism bias 
is lost or maintained during development. The right panel shows a graphical depiction of the hierarchical 
active inference model. Level 1 sets the valence and arousal observations ( o1) for the valence and 
arousal states (s1) that provide the observations for level 2. Level 2 establishes the optimism bias, where 
the optimism bias is a state factor (d2) that is learnt over time. A2 is the likelihood mapping of optimism 
states to valence and arousal observations. a2 is the likelihood mapping the agent learns over  time. ii. 
The left panel shows Experiment 2 which is the belief updating task where the agent updates their belief 
to good or bad news. The right side of the figure displays a simplified graphical depiction of the active 
inference model of the belief upda ting task. The centre panel shows the generative model likelihood 
matrix (A). The right panel shows the optimism state factor (D) and the state factor corresponding to the 
prior belief of a good or bad outcome  (d). See main text for full explanation of the  model iii. The left 
panel shows Experiment 3 which is a modified version of the two -armed bandit task where the agent 
can opt out of selecting an arm and stay safe. The right side shows a graphical depiction of the active 
inference of the two armed bandit  task. The figure displays the likelihood matrices for the generative 
model that are conditioned on the optimism and pessimism state factor  (D), as well as the likelihood 
matrix generative process (A). See the main text for a full explanation of the model. 
 
Experiment 1: Simulating Loss of Optimism Bias  
 
Individuals with higher optimism have improved cardiovascular responses to stress, which 
leads to healthy arousal outcomes (Terrill et al., 2010). In contrast, individuals with anxiety can 
experience high arous al (Alkozei et al., 2015 ; Beidel et al., 1985; Rowa et al., 2017) . To 
explore how optimism may be related to arousal we use a hierarchical active inference model. 
The model simulates how optimism bias can  plausibly be lost during development in 
childhood. We simulate how children in environments that expose them to a greater number 
of high arousal and negative valence events, whether this be from a low socioeconomic 
environment, hostile child-rearing or other, cause them to lose an already existing  optimism 
bias.  
 
Our hierarchical active inference model has two levels (Figure 1i). The first level exposes the 
agent to valence and arousal observations (o). This is representative of the life events a child 
may have that cause them to experience different valence and arousal states (s). Learning in 
the hierarchical model occurs at the second level, and there is no learning for the first level. 
The first level serves to create a set of arousal and valence states for the agent. There are no 
policies (π) at either level. 
 
The agent has two state factors (D1 vectors), which represent valence and arousal. The agent 
can be in a high or low arousal state and  in a positive or negative valence state. Before the 
simulation, the agent begins with the belief  it can be in all states equally. The arousal and 
valence states are representative of what different experiences may cause the child to feel. 
For example, a high arousal state and positive valence state might represent playing with other 
children in a par k. A high arousal state and negative valence state could be being told off 
angrily by a parent. 
 
9 
There is a one -to-one mapping with the state factor and outcome ( A1 matrix), that is, if the 
agent is in a high arousal state, it has a high arousal outcome. T he transition probability (B1 
matrix) is an identity matrix, which means the agent stays in the same state for each trial.  
 
We define a healthy environment for an agent to develop in as one with more positive ly 
valenced high and low arousal states. In contrast, an agent that develops in a less healthy 
environment will be in more negatively valanced high and low arousal states. 
 
The second level in the hierarchical active inference model encodes the agent’s optimism bias. 
We model optimism as one s tate factor, the agent can be in either an optimistic state or a 
pessimistic state. The agent begins with an optimistic state factor of [0.8, 0.2]. As optimism is 
a robust bias and is seen across species, we hypothesise that humans and animals alike are 
innately optimistic and therefore begin life with an optimism bias (Bateson et al., 2011; Iki & 
Adachi, 2023; Lagisz et al., 2020) . In the second level of the model the agent changes its 
optimism or pessimism through exposure to high and low arousal and negatively and positively 
valanced events, where high valence observations are considered more likely conditional on 
the optimistic hidden state factor, and vice versa. 
 
As the model is hierarchical, states in the first level act as  observations for the second level. 
For the valence state, if the agent is in an optimistic state it believes that it is more likely to 
have a positive valence outcome and if it is in a pessimistic state that it is more likely to have 
a negative valence outcome. For the arousal outcomes, the agent begins with a flat likelihood 
mapping (a2) between high and low arousal  observations and optimistic and pess imistic 
hidden states. The agent learns the likelihood mapping for arousal over time (a2). By learning 
the likelihood mapping for arousal, the model simulates how children exposed to repeated 
negative events can infer a pessimistic state  from being exposed to repeated high arousal 
outcomes co-occuring with negative valence with greater frequency in biased environments ; 
conversely, we simulate  how children who are not exposed to such statistically biased 
environments do not develop this pessimistic response.   
 
As the agent receives valence and arousal observations  across its in silico  childhood, it 
changes its belief about what state it is in. If an agent observes more negative valence events 
across low and high arousal obser vations, it receives more information that it is in the 
pessimistic state. This then changes the belief of the agent, so that the agent begins to believe 
it is in a pessimistic state. The state transition matrix ( B) is an identity matrix and the agent 
stays in their optimistic or pessimistic state across that set of trials. There are no policies or 
preferences. The agent is learning from their observations but cannot act to change these 
observations. 
 
We simulate 200  agents where the arousal and valence states are randomly selected and 
ordered. The first level is 52 trials which is representative of the 52 weeks in a year. And the 
second level is 5 trials which is representative of the first 5 years.  
Experiment 2: Optimism Bias Belief Updating Task 
One method of measuring optimism is with Sharot and colleagues’ belief updating task 
(Bottemanne et al., 2022; Garrett et al., 2014; Sharot et al., 2007). In this task, participants are 
10 
asked to estimate their risk of a bad event, for example chance of getting cancer, then they 
are told their estimate is either higher or lower than their actual risk. Good news is when their 
risk is lower than their estimate and bad news is when their risk is higher than their estimate. 
Optimism is measured by how much the participant updates their belief to good versus bad 
news, where optimists update more to good new s than bad news. The asymmetry in belief 
updating is how the optimism bias is maintained – when individuals come up against negative 
evidence against their beliefs, they update their beliefs less (Sharot, 2011). We next simulate 
the belief updating task to ground the model in this experimental literature on optimism bias , 
which allows us  to test whether the formulation of optimism as the precision of positive 
outcomes reproduces key empirical findings.  
 
For the belief updating task there are two hidden state factors. The first hidden state factor (d) 
corresponds to the prior belief that the agent has about the good or bad outcome of the trial. 
For example, the trial could be the belief that the agent will not get cancer (good outcome) or 
get cancer (bad outcome). The hidden state factor generative process is separate from the 
generative model as the agent updates their belief in response to a good news outcome or a 
bad news outcome. The second hidden state factor (D) is the optimism bias state factor which 
controls how much the belief is updated to good versus bad news. We use the optimism state 
factor learnt in the Experiment 1 simulation (Figure 1ii). 
 
The task has two outcomes: good news and bad news. There is one likelihood matrix (A) and 
the likelihood generative process is separate from the generative model. In the generative 
process, the likelihood matrix (A) is an identity matrix as the good versus bad news outcome 
is the same regardless of the optimism of the agent. For the generative model (a), if an agent 
is in an optimistic state they have higher precision for a good outcome and lower precision for 
a bad outcome, whereas for the pessimistic state they have higher precision for a nega tive 
outcome and lower precision for a good outcome.  
 
Each trial in the belief updating task is represented in one model. The update to good versus 
bad news is calculated by the difference in the initial hidden state factor belief (d) about good 
versus bad news and the hidden state factor after the observation (𝒅𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙+1).

𝐵𝑎𝑑 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠 𝑢𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒= 𝒅𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙[2,1]− 𝒅𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙+1[2,1] 
 
 
The belief upda ting average is taken from good news on trials where the agent receives a 
good outcome and the average is taken to the bad news trials where the agent receives a bad 
outcome. The model is 1 trial and has a time step of 1. We run the model 70 times for 70 trials. 
The prior beliefs about good and bad outcomes are randomly generated.

To determine what precision best replicates the optimism bias literature results we swept the 
a matrix precision parameter.  
Experiment 3: Performance on a two -armed bandit task with 
various levels of the optimism bias 
Finally, to explore the influence of optimism on actions, we leverage a two-armed bandit task 
with the same optimism hidden state factor from Experiment 1 and 2 (Figure 1iii). For the two-
armed bandit task there is a state factor ( D) corresponding to the location of the agent in the 
task. The agent can be positioned at the start of the task, or at the left arm, or the right arm. 
There is one outcome modality ( A) encoding the location of the agent, they observe either 
being at the start, in the left arm, or right arm. As the agent always knows the location they are 
in, the location likelihood (A) is an identity matrix. 
 
In the task, the agent can receive a null outcome, a large win, a large loss, a small win, or a 
small loss. The reward outcome modality ( A) sets the probability of the wins and losses in 
each arm. For the generative process, the reward outcomes are the same regardless of the 
optimism of the agent as this sets the outcomes for arms in the task. We separate the 
generative model from the generative process to show how optimism changes the beliefs  
about the outcomes of the task. In the generative model, the precision over the good outcomes 
(a) is conditioned on the optimism of the agent. In this task, the agent has a preference for 
wins. The optimistic agent has higher precision over wins compared to losses and null 
outcomes. 
 
The agent can choose from three policies (π); select the left arm, select the right arm, or remain 
at the start. If the agent selects the right or left arm they have a chance of winning money but 
they also have a chance of losing money, so there is risk involved in that decision. If the agent 
decides to remain at the start they will not win any additional money, but they won’t lose the 
money they have. There is no risk remaining in the start position, but there is also no chance 
of reward. For the preferences (C), the agent has the highest preference for a large win, and 
the lowest preference for a large loss. In the middle of these preferences is a null outcome, 
where although the agent would rather observe a win to null it would rather observe a null to 
a loss. We set there to be no preference for the null outcome as this doesn’t change the overall 
position of the agent, as they don’t set to gain or lose anything.  
 
The left arm results in large win and large loss outcomes, representing an action where there 
is a lot to gain but also more to lose. This could be going to a party where the agent does not 
know anyone, they could make new friends but there is a chance they awkwardly fail to meet 
anyone. The right arm results in small win and small loss outcomes. In the world, this is 
representative of a scenario that is still more risky than doing nothing but not as risky as the 
other option. This could be going to the party that friends have put on, where there is a small 
chance they will not have a good time but overall it should be a pleasant experience with 
known friends albeit falling short of meeting someone entirely new. The action to not 
participate in that trial is equivalent to staying at home and not going to any party. There is no 
chance of meeting anyone new, but nothing bad will happen either. One will remain in the 
same position.

Each agent completed 60 trials. We summed the overall performance: the large win is gaining 
$4, the large loss is losing $4, the small win is gaining $1 and the small loss is losing $1. 
Results 
Loss of Optimism Bias  
In Figure 2i, we plot the number of negatively valanced events and the optimism state factor 
learnt at the end of the simulation. The simulation explores how optimism may be lost in 
development from exposure to negatively valanced events. The optimism bias shown in Figure 
2i,  is the belief that the agent is in an optimistic state from the optimism state factor after the 
simulation. For the negative valanced events, we take the proportion of these events the agent 
experiences across the time. The results show that the more negative ly valanced events the 
agent is exposed to the lower level of optimism they have. The finding s of the simulation 
reproduce empirical literature on the optimism bias as we show that the environment the agent 
is exposed to  during development impacts their optimism  (Heinonen et al., 2005, 2006) . 
Additionally, we find that there is not a one-to-one mapping between the number of negatively 
valanced events and the optimism bias. This suggests that even in a simple, idealised model 
there can be variability in the loss of optimism bias during development which in the real world 
would likely be due to variability in the timing of exposure of negative events, and variance in 
genetic and protective factors.

the agent was exposed to. ii. Resulting likelihood matrices from simul ation for an agent with optimism 
level 0.07 and an agent with optimism level 0.86. 
 
Figure 2ii shows an example of two second level likelihood matrices that were learnt after the 
simulation concluded. The agent with optimism level 0.07 had more high arousal outcomes 
cooccurring with negative valence, leading it to infer a precise mapping between high arousal 
and a pessimistic state. The agent had a proportion of 0.98 negatively valanced events. This 
lead to a set of  beliefs plausibly descri bing an anxious phenotype with  high arousal events 

13 
leading the agent to infer a pessimistic state. As the agent was exposed to mainly negative 
events it learnt that the environment consists of negative experiences , and learns to expect 
these.  
 
In contrast, the agent with optimism level 0.86 has a flat likelihood matrix at the end of the 
simulation, meaning in each state it can experience high and low arousal without being led to 
infer that it is in either an optimistic or pessimistic state . These arousal outcomes are 
consistent with a healthy agent. Even when the agent is in a pessimistic state it still maintains 
high and low arousal equally. Such an agent may enter a stressful situation and be in a 
pessimistic state but not experience a disproportionate amount of high arousal, which may be 
associated with a state of panic. This agent had a proportion of 0.56 positively valanced events 
during the simulation, it still experienced negatively valanced events but had positive 
experiences as well. This suggests that to maintain optimism and a healthy arousal response, 
the agent does need to experience some negative events. For all the  agents, there was 
variability in the resulting likelihood matrix after the simulation, depending on the number of 
events and time or exposure . The variability in the likelihood matrix is similar to how we 
interpret the variability in the optimism, that is , a range of factors could contribute to an 
individual’s arousal response, resulting in variability.  
Performance on Belief Updating Task 
The results of the belief updating task showed that for increasingly optimistic agents , the 
agents updated their beliefs more to good news versus bad news. This result replicate findings 
in empirical research on optimism where optimists learn more from good versus bad news. 
Figure 3i shows the asymmetry in belief updating as a function of optimism. We find the highest 
asymmetry in belief updating was for agents with optimism of 0.9. As optimism decreased and 
pessimism increased, the agent updated more to bad news than good news. Figure 3ii  plots 
the results from Garrett and colleagues (2014) to compare the simulated results to empirical 
data. Garrett and colleagues showed that participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
update more to bad news than the controls. The controls in this study have results similar to 
our 0.9 optimism agent, implying, in line with our model, that people in the healthy population 
are op timistic. The MDD results are comparable to optimism level 0.5, which can be 
considered an example of depressive realism.

Performance on Two-Armed Bandit Task  
The two -armed bandit task explored how optimism related to act ions of the agent. Th is 
modified two-armed bandit task was a novel task design so there were no empirical findings 
to compare the results. However, as optimism involves increased engagement in the world, 
we hypothesised that increased optimism levels would result in increased task engagement.  
 
We found that the performance on the two-armed bandit task varied depending on the agent’s 
level of optimism. Figure 4i plots the total winnings of the agent and their optimism level. The 
best performing agent had 0.7 as their level of optimism. Agents from level 0 - 0.4 had lower 
total winnings than the agents 0.5 - 0.9. To further highlight how the levels of optimism affected 
task performance we plot the actions and outcomes of the best performing agent and the 
pessimistic agent and an 0.5 agent (Figure 4ii).

probability of the agent. The outcome line p lots the large win, large loss, small win, small loss and null

Figure 4ii shows the agent who received the highest total winnings, agent optimism level 0.7. 
After a few initial trials where the agent ch ose both arms, the agent stay ed selecting the left 
arm. This is the best strategy overall as it is the high risk, high reward arm. The actions of the 
optimism level 0.7 agent show that the agent always engaged with the task and  they never 
selected the action of stay. This finding translates to behaviours of optimists who engage in 
the world as they believe their actions will result in their preferred outcome.   
 
In contrast, the most pessimistic agent, optimism level 0.1, selected the left and right arm for 
the first few trials and then decides to select the stay action for the remaining trials. This series 
of actions result ed in a net loss for the pessimistic agent. This behaviour is what we would 
expect from an individual with depression, they don’t believe they will achieve their preferred 
outcome in the world so engage less than an optimistic individual. The action of stay is a safe 

16 
decision as there is no risk of any loss. If an agent does not believe they would achieve their  
preferred outcome, the decision to stay protects them from experiencing loss.  
 
Figure 4ii also plots the actions of the 0.5 optimism level agent. This agent selects both left 
and right arms throughout the trials. When receiving losses in one arm it switches to the other 
arm. The agent does not experience enough losses to decide to select the stay action.

Discussion  
In this paper, we have developed an active inference model of optimism bias. The model we 
have presented is domain general, meaning it can be applied to different task settings and 
environments by running tasks that test optimistic belief updating and optimistic action with a 
shared optimism hidden state factor . Using our model, we have explored how the optimism 
bias could be l ost during development , replicated key findings in the optimism literature 
showing asymmetric belief updating to good and bad news, and showed how such beliefs 
change action through a modified version of the two -armed bandit task. The simulation 
findings provide a computational proof-of-concept for the active inference model of optimism 
bias. This lays the groundwork for future research on how we can measure the optimism bias 
in human p articipants, with the aim of using manipulations of optimism as a  mental health 
intervention.  
 
In Experiment 1, the hierarchical active inference model demonstrated how the optimism bias 
could plausibly be lost during development. The results show that exposure to more negatively 
valanced events results in less optimism bias, in line with empirical work showing that children 
exposed to more negative valanced events are less optimistic (Heinonen et al., 2005, 2006), 
a finding for which we provide a plausible computational basis. Environmental risk factors such 
as socioeconomic status in childhood (Heinonen et al., 2006) and hostile child rearing attitudes 
in mothers have also been found to have lower optimism levels later in life (Heinonen et al., 
2005).  
 
The relationship between the optimism bias and exposure to negatively valenced events was 
variable, as there was not a one-to-one mapping of the number of negatively valenced events 
and the level of optimism. The variability in results can be due to the timing of exposure to the 
events; thus , in active inference, when learning about the environment, observations that 
happen earlier (when Dirichlet concentration parameters are small) have more weight. For 
example, if an agent initially experiences a positively valenced event and then a negatively 
valenced event, the negatively valenced event will affect them less. This variability may be  
shown in the literature where different experiences that would be associated with positive 
valence result in protective factors for well-being for children (Buchanan et al., 2002; Moore & 
N. Ramirez, 2016). More research is needed to explore in the model when and how the timing 
of exposure effects might occur; this could lead to empirical predictions of how quickly 
optimism can be lost, and how slowly it can be regained. There may also be a genetic 
component that contributes to the variability in optimism as it has been suggested that additive 
genetic factors account for about a third of the variation in optimism levels (Bates, 2015; 
Mosing et al., 2009) 
 
Additionally, the simulations in experiment 1 found that an agent who was exposed to more 
negatively valenced events and had lower optimism also had a likelihood matrix that resulted 
in more high arousal outcomes. Individuals with anxiety can experience more high arousal 
states (Alkozei et al., 2015; Beidel et al., 1985; Rowa et al., 2017), and this symptom of anxiety 
is plausibly shown in the likelihood matrix results for some low optimism agents. In contrast, 
agents who were exposed to more positive valenced events with higher optimism had a flat 
likelihood matrix, meaning that high and low arousal are experienced equally; we would expect 
this likelihood mapping for a healthy individual. The likelihood matrices showed variability due 
18 
to the timing of the negative or positive events. It has been suggested that valence and arousal 
can be highly variable depending on the individual, and the variability in the model is a strength 
in this regard, as it can capture this feature (Kuppens et al., 2013). The results from Experiment 
1 show how our active inference model of optimism bias can link to the literature on 
development in children, which supports our modelling approach and could be used to 
generate quantitative predictions and potentially be explored for phenotyping in computational 
neuropsychiatry.  
 
In Experiment 2, the optimism bias state factor from Experiment 1 was simulated in the belief 
updating task. The belief updating task results showed that with higher levels of optimism, 
agents updated their belief s more to good rather than bad news. The asymmetry in belief 
updating shown in the simulation is similar to the asymmetry in belief updating found in the 
literature (Garrett et al., 2014; Korn et al., 2014; Sharot,  2011). Additionally, the task f ound 
that agents who are in a pessimistic state update more to bad news rather than good news , 
replicating the behavioural phenotype of people with MDD (Garrett et al., 2014).  
 
Optimism bias is typically assessed by the belief updating task used in Experiment 2, however 
this does not capture optimistic action. As the adaptive aspect of the optimism bias is mediated 
by increased engagement with the world through actions, it is beneficial to be able to measure 
and model that action. We therefore developed a modified two -armed bandit task that tests 
optimistic action, in Experiment 3. The main advantage of the task is that the agent can choose 
to not select the left or right arm, selecting to stay instead, which is the action of not engaging 
in the task; here choosing to stay is similar to deciding to stay at home and not go to the party 
or not going out to exercise. Importantly, by selecting to stay the agent does not lose anything, 
as they remain in the same position. It is not a negative action, but a safe one where potential 
rewards by engaging in the environment are missed (cf. lost opportunities).  
 
The results of Experiment 3 show what level of optimism is best for maximum reward in this 
task setting. Specifically, optimism level 0.7 results in the highest amount of winnings , and 
when considering the action selection, this agent selected the left arm, which is the high risk 
high reward arm that overall will result in the most winnings. Hence, the optimistic agent is not 
deterred by losses and can keep engaging with the task even after a few losses in a row. This 
action selection can be conceived in terms of how an individual with the optimism bias would 
engage in the world – even if they come up against some losses they will keep engaging (e.g., 
an optimist might go to a party and have a bad experience, but be able to attend another party 
the next week). In contrast, the actions of an agent with the lowest level of optimism, 0.1  
resulted in an overall loss. The 0.1 level agent selects the left and right arm initially but after 
experiencing enough losses they decide to select the action of stay for the remainder  of the 
trials. These actions are similar to what may be observed with someone who lacks the 
optimism bias, when experiencing any losses they decide to stay safe even if this means there 
is no opportunity for a reward (e.g., someone who lacks the optimism bias may go to the party, 
have a bad time, and decide not to go again). This result may speak to individuals with 
depression, who decide to stay at home, often suffering with apathy.  
 
Interestingly, in the two-armed bandit task, the overly optimistic agent is less optimal, 
beginning to experience more losses. This finding is consistent with empirical research 
suggesting that in certain scenarios optimism can be related to negative consequences. For 
optimism and immune respon se, it has been shown that optimism help s to maintain T cell 
19 
percentages and natural killer cytotoxicity cells (NKCC) when exposed to a stressor (Cohen 
et al., 1999), where the stressor in this study was any life event the participant found stressful. 
However, when the stressor lasted more than one week, optimism was shown to be 
associated with a lower T cell percentage and NKCC compared to pessimism. It is suggested 
that as optimistic individual s engage more with a stressor, they may cope well for a small 
stressor that they can resolve and overcome, resulting in a positive immune response, 
whereas when the stressor is larger, they have the same engagement without the ability to 
overcome, resulting in more stress and a weakened immune response. In contrast, individuals 
who lack optimism do not engage with either type of stressors. This results in a negative 
outcome for the mild stressor as they miss the opportunity to overcome it w hen they could. 
Yet ignoring the large stressor can be a positive outcome as the individual is not constantly 
thinking and worrying about this issue. These are important considerations for developing an 
optimism bias intervention, as there may be circumstances where optimism is suboptimal.  
 
The active inference model of the optimism bias presented here is domain general, meaning 
it applies to more than one task setting. Modelling optimism as a state factor that can be used 
in different tasks demonstrates how an individual may have a bias that affects different aspects 
of their decision making in many contexts. As shown in the three experiments, we provide 
evidence for a domain general model by replicating findings and behaviours of optimistic 
individuals in  various contexts. This has clinical relevance, as one could measure an 
individual's optimism in different settings to gain more information on whether an optimism 
intervention is best suited for that individual. These advantages are one of the aims of the field 
of computational psychiatry (Adams et al., 2015; Browning et al., 2023; Huys et al., 2016; 
Montague et al., 2012).  
 
The future directions of this work include collecting and fitting part icipant data from healthy 
and depressed cohorts. The design of the simulations are such that the optimism bias model 
can be tested for its validity for use in clinical settings. For depressed cohorts, the modified 
two-armed bandit may provide a novel way o f testing those who may benefit from a 
behavioural activation treatment (Soucy Chartier & Provencher, 2013; Tindall et al., 2017), by 
understanding those who chose not to engage in the task. Add itionally, using the optimism 
model and modified two-armed bandit task, we can begin to explore the relationship between 
optimism and behavioural activation, and if treatments that target behavioural activation could 
use an optimism intervention. Other fut ure work should investigate what treatments may 
increase the optimism bias and how these treatments can be computationally modelled using 
the optimism bias model.  
 
Conclusion  
Here, we present and provide support for a domain general active inference mode l of the 
optimism bias. Using three simulations, we show how the optimism bias model applies to 
optimistic belief updating and optimistic action, relating this to the optimism bias in 
development. Our simulation results replicate findings in the literature and lay the groundwork 
for future work on the optimism bias model for use in a clinical setting.
