Abstract
The fear-avoidance model is a well-established framework in the understanding of persistent pain. It proposes a dichotomous 
path: either the context is interpreted as safe; there is no fear reaction and, therefore, the individual engages in active (posi-
tive) coping; or the context is interpreted as threatening, leading to a self-reinforcing vicious circle of fear and (negative) 
avoidance. We propose an embodied interpretation of this phenomenon employing the joint framework of predictive coding 
and active inference. The key idea is that multisensory integration of exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sen-
sory inputs can lead to dysfunctional experiences of threat in nonthreatening situations. Threat inference can promote fear 
responses, maladaptive strategies (i.e., avoidance) and self-provides evidence for threat in associated or future contexts, or 
both. Under this treatment, the prediction of nonrealized threat becomes self-evidencing and context-invariant, and hence 
self-perpetuating. Safety cues are unable to attenuate the interpretation of the negative context as the dominant inference of 
the context is threatful and gains more precision and becomes resistant over time. Our model provides an explanation for the 
emergence of a dysfunctional fear response in the clinical setting despite apparent safety based on modern concepts from 
theoretical (computational) neuroscience.

Introduction
The purpose of this review is to integrate the free energy 
principle—an increasingly popular and prominent neuro-
scientific paradigm that aims to explain the complexities of 
consciousness, perception, and behavior (Friston & Frith, 
2015; Hesp et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022; Nave et al., 
2022; Parr et al., 2022; Parr & Friston, 2017; Pezzulo et al., 
2015; Ramstead et al., 2022; Seth, 2013, 2015)—with a 
well-established clinical presentation (Asmundson et al., 
2004; Crombez et al., 2012; Leeuw et al., 2007; Pincus 
et al., 2010; Vlaeyen, 2015; Vlaeyen et al., 2016; Vlaeyen & 
Linton, 2000) to better describe and identity novel insights 
to enhance our understanding of fear and fear avoidance 
behaviors. Because of this ongoing shift in the understand-
ing of conscious processes and behaviors, scientists and 
clinicians may be required to change their paradigms of 
understanding and practice (Kuhn, 2018).
We first provide an introduction to the fundamentals of 
the free energy principle, predictive coding, and active infer-
ence. Then, we provide a detailed examination of intero-
ceptive inference under this framework, emphasizing the 
synergistic interaction between exteroceptive and intero -
ceptive forms of inference especially in psychopathological 
conditions. Finally, we employ these concepts to suggest a 
new approach for modeling avoidance behaviors in chronic 
pain patients. Our work offers a proof-of-concept for the 
fear-avoidance model within the active inference paradigm 
and suggests potential clinical implications and hints at a 
framework for the development of new clinical strategies 
for those with ongoing pain. * Clovis Varangot-Reille

The free energy principle, predictive coding, 
and active inference
The free energy principle states that in order for an organ-
ism to maintain equilibrium, i.e., within the physiological 
bounds of homeostasis, they must avoid surprising sensory 
states, here the word “surprise” is used in a technical sense 
that reflects the degree to which the organism’s sensory 
states diverge from acceptable ranges (e.g., for a fish, being 
out of water represents a highly surprising state). Specifi-
cally, the theory proposes that the central nervous system 
(CNS) must minimize an information-theoretic quantity, 
variational free energy (see Friston, 2010  and Parr et al., 
2022 for highly detailed accounts of the theory), which 
can be used as a proxy for the surprise and uncertainty of 
the environment (e.g., considering the brain, the environ-
ment represents both exteroception, and interoception). To 
minimize surprise (or more technically, (variational) free 
energy), the CNS uses a statistical (generative) model about 
the probable causes of its sensory states (Fig.  1).
The generative model permits calculation of the degree 
of “surprisal” by directly comparing the sensory states pre-
dicted by the generative model (“Inferred Hidden State” 
in Fig.  1) and the actual sensory states generated by the 
true causal structure of the environment, called generative 
process(“True Hidden State” in Fig. 1). The CNS strives to 
minimize the discrepancy between predictions 1 and actual 
sensory states (sometimes called a “prediction error” or 
“surprise” in Fig. 1). However, the final impact of prediction 
errors is not uni-mechanistic but rather involves a complex 
series of weighting relationships. Precision-weighting is an 
important aspect of inference, because whether the predic-
tion error is assigned importance will depend on the weight-
ing that is given to the likelihood (realized sensory states) in 
relation to the prior predictions (anticipated sensory states). 
We can think of the prior predictions in terms of the learn-
ing that has already occurred, for example, about possible 
threats to the body when considering the nociceptive system. 
The weighting afforded to the likelihood relative to this past 
learning is referred to as the “precision” of the prediction 
error where precision refers to the inverse variance of a prob-
ability distribution. We can think of the precision of the pre-
diction error as equivalent to the learning rate (but note that 
the precision influences inference, not just learning). Thus, 
precision of the generated prediction error is high when the 
likelihood is estimated to be precise but decreases with pre-
cision of the prior predictions. The result of this kind of 
precision weighting is that inferential processes rely more 
on past learning when new sensory information is weighed 
as imprecise and unreliable.
The organism has two complementary ways to mini-
mize free energy (white squares and dotted arrows in 
Fig. 1): by either updating predictions (in Bayesian terms 
this involves the posterior becoming the new prior at the 
next time step of inference, in brief, updating the genera-
tive model) to more closely match realized sensory states 
Fig. 1  Action-perception loop of active inference. The figure emphasizes the differences between the agent’s generative model and the genera-
tive process. See the main text for explanation
1 Prediction within the framework of active inference refers to the 
process of minimizing prediction error by changing the internal gen-
erative model. This process involves actively sampling the environ-
ment to alter sensory observations such that they better fit with sen-
sory predictions. Active inference thus reduces prediction error by 
changing (indirectly) sensory observations to confirm the organism’s 
beliefs about the world or to gather evidence in support of a hypoth-
esis about the world. Prediction therefore is not synonymous with the 
everyday use of the word, which we acknowledge can lead to confu-
sion.

(i.e., perception-as-inference or predictive coding) and/or 
by acting to change the environment, in such a way that the 
next sensations will match the internal beliefs and predic-
tions (i.e., action-as-inference or active inference) (see the 
Chapter 2 of Parr et al., 2022). It is vital to be cautious, as 
beliefs signify probability and not conscious cognitive state 
(Seth & Friston, 2016).
This process is considered adaptive insofar as the organ-
isms’ preferred (e.g., homeostatically valid) states that 
ensure its existence are themselves encoded as priors in the 
organism’s generative model (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; 
Kiverstein et al., 2022; Pezzulo et al., 2015).
The first way to minimize free energy corresponds to an 
inferential view of perception, which dates back at least to 
Helmholtz ( 1866) and has been reintroduced several ways 
under the labels of Bayesian brain and (at the neurophysio-
logical level) predictive coding (Friston, 2005; Friston et al., 
2017; Knill & Richards, 1996; Pezzulo et al., 2018; Rao & 
Ballard, 1999). Historically, perception was seen as a passive 
bottom-up process, where a stimulus elicits a brain response. 
The inferential (Bayesian brain) view instead considers per-
ception as an active process involving statistical inference 
(De Ridder et al., 2014; Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2022 ; 
Tabor et al., 2017; Van den Bergh et al., 2017). Accordingly, 
perceptual processing is based on an approximate Bayesian 
inference of the world where there is a prediction of the pos-
sible causes of the sensation generated by its interaction with 
its environment (Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2022).
The perceptual process is therefore assumed to follow (an 
approximation to) Bayes’ rule (De Ridder et al., 2014; Fris-
ton, 2010; Parr et al., 2022; Pezzulo, 2014), which describes 
how to use sensory states to infer and form beliefs (in the 
technical sense of probability distributions) about the latent 
causes that generated them:
Where, C is the hypothetic cause of the sensation; P 
(C|Sensation) is called the posterior probability of a certain 
cause: It is the probability of the cause given the sensory 
inputs; P (Sensation|C) is called the likelihood of the cause: 
It is the probability of the sensory inputs giving the spe-
cific cause; P(C) is the prior probability learned about the 
occurrence of a cause before the evidence is observed; and 
P(Sensation) is the evidence.
Note that the above inferential (Bayesian) view of percep-
tion and abstracts away from neural implementation (i.e., 
can be considered a computational-level theory in David 
Marr’s terminology). Marr ( 1982) proposed that the nerv -
ous system be considered an information processing sys -
tem. The hypothesis states that in order to understand the 
function of the information processing systems we consider 
P (C/uni007C.varSensation)=P(C )× P(Sensation/uni007C.varC)
P(Sensation)
three distinct and complementary levels of analysis; compu-
tational level: what does the system do (e.g., what problems 
does it solve or overcome) and similarly, why does it do 
these things; algorithmic level (sometimes representational 
level): how does the system do what it does, specifically, 
what representations does it use and what processes does it 
employ to build and manipulate the representations; imple-
mentational/physical level: how is the system physically 
realized (in the case of biological vision, what neural struc-
tures and neuronal activities implement the visual system) 
(Friston, 2005; Marr, 1982; Rao & Ballard, 1999).
A popular proposal of how the brain might implement the 
inference is called predictive coding (Friston, 2005; Rao & 
Ballard, 1999). In this theory, the nervous system, or per -
haps more accurately the neural-endocrine-immune system 
(see Kiverstein et al., 2022 for justification of this broader 
terminology, traditional approaches treat these systems as 
independent from one another), operates like a hierarchical 
generative model that performs inferences having the same 
form as the equation above, through the reciprocal message 
passing between hierarchical layers, where top-down mes-
sages (from higher to lower areas of the nervous system) 
convey predictions, and where bottom-up messages (from 
lower to higher brain areas) convey prediction errors (Kiver-
stein et al., 2022). In turn, the prediction errors serve to 
revise the predictions at the higher layers (or in other words, 
to ultimately update the systems’ beliefs—again, in the sense 
of probability distributions), in such a way that when predic-
tion errors are minimized, the predictions match the exter -
nal sensory event—and the predictive coding hierarchy has 
performed its job of inferring the most likely causes of its 
sensations.
The second way for an organism to minimize free energy 
is by acting in the world to change incoming sensations in a 
way that reduces the discrepancy with the organisms’ brain 
predictions. This is called “active inference” and extends 
predictive coding (which is only concerned about how to 
change beliefs i.e., perceptual inference) to the domain of 
action.
Given the focus of the article, we do not elaborate in any 
great detail on the motor aspects of active inference, but the 
interested reader is a encouraged to access Parr et al. (2022) 
for in an in-depth understanding.
It is important to note that in predictive coding and active 
inference, the term “perception” does not only apply to the 
inference of “what is out there” through exteroceptive (e.g., 
visual or auditory) sensations, but also to the inference of the 
inner state of the body, i.e., interoceptive inference of things, 
such as hunger, thirst, or fatigue (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; 
Iodice et al., 2019; Pezzulo, 2014 ; Seth & Friston, 2016 ). 
By the same token, the term “action” is intended not just 
in the usual sense of steering bodily movements to change 
exteroceptive sensations (e.g., move away from a source of 
784 Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792
heat), but also in the sense of steering autonomic responses 
to change interoceptive sensations (e.g., vasodilation). Both 
kind of actions, moving and vasodilation can potentially 
achieve the same homeostatic or allostatic goal (e.g., cool 
the body). In addition, these perception/action processes 
involve other modalities, including, most notably proprio-
ception, although for sake of simplicity, we limit ourselves in 
the ongoing account to only interoception and exteroception.
Implementing interoceptive processing
Interoception is the sense of the physiological condition of 
the body and refers to the processing of information from 
within the body, e.g., cardiac or gastric signals (Ameri-
can Psychological Association, n.d.). Interoception can be 
understood using the same “predictive coding” account elu-
cidates earlier (Allen & Tsakiris, 2018; Katsumi et al., 2022; 
Seth, 2013; Seth et al., 2012; Seth & Friston, 2016; Tschantz 
et al., 2022).
For example, Barrett & Simons proposed the Embodied 
Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model describes 
the ways our brains can infer inner bodily states crucial 
for homeostasis and allostasis (Barrett & Simmons, 2015). 
Homeostasis refers to the preservation of a state of equilib-
rium of the internal environment of our organism and the 
control of essential physiological variables, such as glucose 
level, whereas allostasis refers to the predictive regulation 
of physiological processes (Libretti & Puckett, 2022). The 
supraspinal interoceptive-allostatic system involves the 
agranular cortices and the granular “primary interoceptive 
cortex” or mid-to-posterior insular cortex. Agranular cor -
tices send prediction to the body that will be satisfied by 
the action, while expected interoceptive sensory states from 
these actions are projected to primary interoceptive cortex. 
These autonomic, hormonal, and immunological predic-
tions adjust internal systems for maintaining homeostasis 
(see Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Kiverstein et al., 2022 for 
detailed discussion). Once these predictions reach the pri-
mary interoceptive cortex, they are compared with actual 
inputs from interoceptive system, expanded to the whole 
cortex from the layer IV. Differences between predictions 
and ascending inputs generate prediction error signals. 
These prediction errors are recursively projected to the 
agranular cortices to update predictions and start the mini-
mization of surprise. Agranular interoceptive cortices are 
thought to be poorly responsive to prediction errors due to 
their cytoarchitecture because of the lack of fully expressed 
layer IV. In brief, prediction errors have a poor influence on 
the update of interoceptive predictions. The agranular cor -
tices will modulate their predictions to elicit the exact sen-
sation they are expecting and modulate the gating of inputs 
to prioritize self-confirming interoceptive information. This 
has the consequence that there is a long-lasting “stickiness” 
(Corlett et al., 2019; Tabor et al., 2020) of these predictions 
despite changes (and resultant prediction error generation) 
in the internal systems.
Hierarchical integration of multiple 
sources of sensory information in aversive 
experiences
Recently, the theory of predictive coding has been used to 
provide a formal ground to understand aversive experiences 
and psychopathological conditions (Adams et al., 2013; 
Barca & Pezzulo, 2020; Barrett et al., 2016; Corlett et al., 
2019; Corlett & Powers, 2018; De Ridder et al., 2014; Har-
rison et al., 2021; Kiverstein et al., 2022; Maisto et al., 2021; 
Paulus & Khalsa, 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2019; Smith et al., 
2020; Sterzer et al., 2018; Tabor et al., 2017).Symptoms 
(e.g., pain, dyspnea) can be seen as the overall estimation 
of threat to the body in a particular context (Tabor et al., 
2017). We dynamically infer the high-order concept of threat 
through a hierarchical centrifugal multisensory integration 
(Allen & Tsakiris, 2018). When an event causes a deviation 
from homeostasis (a mismatch between the generative model 
of body integrity and sensory information [Kiverstein et al., 
2022]), prediction errors elicit interoceptive actions aimed 
at minimizing surprise (Van den Bergh et al., 2017). How -
ever, if the interoceptive strategies are not sufficient, then 
we become aware of these unaccounted for interoceptive 
sensory states and employ specific behaviors in attempt to 
reestablish homeostasis (Van den Bergh et al., 2017). Symp-
tom experience arise when abnormal interoceptive inputs 
are expected (priors) and given excessive precision weight-
ing (Van den Bergh et al., 2017). Only the most precisely 
weighted error signals, indicating a credible threat to the 
body get to have an influence on what happens next in the 
nervous system consistent with the principle of precision-
weighting (Kiverstein et al., 2022).
Contextual cues are seen to enhance precision of high-
level predictions based on prior beliefs. When the sensory 
states are ambiguous, reduced, or imprecise, predictions may 
rely more on experience and expectations (more precision 
on priors) to generate an (aversive in this example) experi-
ence, and consequently be poorly updated by sensory states 
(less precision on prediction errors) (Marlow et al., 2019). 
For example, placebo effect occurs to explain away predic-
tion errors, or discrepancy, from the mismatch between prior 
(positive expectation on a specific treatment) and current 
sensory inputs. To reduce them, the predictions, or posterior 
beliefs, are adjusted and the intensity of the experienced pain 
is reduced (Büchel et al., 2014).
Vanneste et al. and De Ridder et al. explore predictive 
coding's role in tinnitus (De Ridder et al., 2014; Hullfish 
785Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792 
et al., 2019), drawing parallels with phantom limb pain. 
Auditory deprivation (i.e., hearing loss) deprives the CNS 
of external information, increasing uncertainty. Sounds are 
expected, but no sensory inputs are processed. To reduce 
prediction errors, mechanisms attempt to “find” the missing 
information (e.g., decreased lateral inhibition, thalamocor -
tical dysrhythmia, map plasticity, or memory), enhancing 
neural sensitivity and spontaneous activity. Normally, this 
spontaneous activity is considered “noise” and does not have 
a high precision weighting, limiting its’ potential to update 
models. However, if the precision is not attenuated, it may 
update the generative model and lead to the generation of 
perceived sound in the form of tinnitus, effectively “filling 
in” the absent information.
It was recently suggested that some apparently irrational 
thoughts, such as the presence of a danger that is very 
unlikely (e.g., a thief in a safe place) or even imaginary 
agents, such as the fabled Bogeyman, might not be entirely 
irrational but rather the result from a predictive coding pro-
cess that integrates both exteroceptive and interoceptive sen-
sations during the inference (Pezzulo, 2014). For example, a 
person might hear an odd sound during the night and try to 
infer whether it was caused by “the wind” or “a thief,” using 
the Bayesian scheme introduced above. In normal condi-
tions, the person might consider (the prior knowledge) that 
the place is safe and hence favor “the wind” hypothesis. 
However, imagine that the person has just experienced an 
event that raised their arousal and sympathetic tone and put 
their body state in a heightened state of fear (e.g., horror 
movie, car accident, or social aggression). The proposal is 
that interoceptive information from their body (e.g., high 
heart rate) could impact of the inference to decide whether 
“the wind” or “a thief” is the most likely hypothesis. In other 
words, in the inference, the person uses two sensory states 
to be explained: the odd sound and their unpleasant intero-
ceptive sensations (e.g., high heart rate). During the multi-
sensory integration, each input is weighted according to its 
precision and sum to provide the model evidence.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that interoceptive 
inputs, from an evolutionarily perspective, are afforded a 
high precision (Allen & Tsakiris, 2018) and are more reli-
able than exteroceptive ones (e.g., vision or sound), espe-
cially during the darkness of night. So, whilst the wind 
could explain the sound, it is potentially a less reliable input 
compared with the thief hypothesis, which better explains 
away the more reliable interoceptive input (the high heart 
rate), hence the latter hypothesis is preferred. The example 
goes even further, see Pezzulo (2014). In Bayesian inference, 
model selection considers not just the accuracy but also the 
complexity of the competing models (or hypotheses)—in 
the sense that simpler models should be preferred. Continu-
ing the example of the window and the thief, it is possible 
to assume two competing models. According to one model, 
both the odd sound and the high heart rate are explained by 
the same cause (the thief). In the other model, the odd sound 
and the high heart rate are explained by two distinct causes 
(the wind and the that the individual previously watched a 
horror movie). While the second model is probably more 
accurate, it also is more complex, and hence under certain 
conditions, it will not be selected.
This example highlights that a hypothesis that at first 
appears “irrational” could in fact be a highly rational one 
when we consider the scenario from a Bayesian inference 
perspective that jointly considers both exteroceptive and 
interoceptive information. Following similar arguments, it 
also is possible to explain how we might give a “grounding” 
to imaginary entities, such as a “Bogeyman,” that have never 
been/or ever likely to be truly witnessed. In this perspective, 
the concept of a Bogeyman could be confirmed entirely by 
our interoceptive sensory states (and false prior knowledge; 
underpinned by an increase in precision weighting of the 
interoceptive states) and not on the actual exteroceptive 
sensory states. In other words, the knowledge that we have 
about this creature is the threatful significance of its pres-
ence—and the very fact that we experience high arousal and 
sympathetic response (perhaps due to the experience of a 
previous fearful event)—provides evidence for the appar -
ently irrational hypothesis that that there is a Bogeyman.
Embodied predictive coding interpretation 
of the fear‑avoidance model
Earlier, we have observed that the concept of generative 
models and prediction error (or free-energy) minimization 
can be utilized to explain aversive experiences and dysfunc-
tional behaviors. This framework could help us understand 
our clinical models algorithmically (Friston, 2005; Marr, 
1982; Rao & Ballard, 1999) and simplifies them under a 
common objective: the minimization of surprise. We will 
focus on one of the most elaborated clinical models in pain 
science, the fear-avoidance model, and see how it fits within 
this framework.
The models posits that when we face a threat, predict it, 
or detect it, we adopt strategies that promote our survival 
(i.e., avoidance, fighting [active coping], fleeing [active 
coping], or freezing [passive coping]) (Mobbs et al., 
2015). The confrontation with threat involves a phasic fear 
response encompassing behavioral, autonomic, endocrine, 
and cognitive response mechanisms (Adolphs, 2013). One 
way to promote survival is to minimize the number of 
encounters with threatful contexts (Mobbs et al., 2015). 
Patients experiencing chronic pain often perceive every -
day social or physical activities as threatening and avoid 
engaging in them to prevent possible consequences (e.g., 
exacerbation of the pain felt) (Crowe et al., 2010). This 
786 Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792
concept of avoidance has been schematically described 
within the fear-avoidance model in chronic musculoskel-
etal pain (Asmundson et al., 2004; Crombez et al., 2012; 
Leeuw et al., 2007; Pincus et al., 2010; Vlaeyen et al., 
2016; Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000). In the presence of pain, 
two potential scenarios may arise: a) If the context and/
or stimulus are not perceived as threatening, and no pain-
related fear is experienced, the individual may engage in 
confrontation behaviors that promote recovery; b) How -
ever, if the context and/or stimulus are perceived as threat-
ening, possibly due to beliefs or expectations, pain-related 
fear and anxiety may develop, leading to avoidance of the 
perceived cause of the pain experience (Leeuw et al., 
2007; Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000). The latter (b) may lead to 
a vicious cycle in which high pain-related fear will lead to 
higher avoidance, which will lead to higher disability and 
ultimately higher pain intensity (Asmundson et al., 2004; 
Leeuw et al., 2007; Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000).
Here, we use the principles of active inference to 
advance a novel interpretation of the fear-avoidance model 
of Vlaeyen and Linton. Our explanation follows the same 
logic of the "wind versus thief" example illustrated above; 
we again limit our account to the integration of extero-
ceptive and interoceptive streams in perceptual inference 
(Pezzulo, 2014) (Fig.  2).
Practical example of this framework 
with a patient with ongoing knee pain
To set the scene for our clinical example, we focus on 
a patient suffering from chronic knee pain. This person 
has expectations about certain treatment modalities in this 
case, exercise, based on their own experiences and infor -
mation gathered from family, friends, social media, and 
wider healthcare trends. The patient is currently under -
going physiotherapy management. As part of the initial 
physical examination, the physiotherapist instructs the 
patient to perform several repetitions of a deep squat.
First, we consider the exteroceptive and proprioceptive 
sensory states; during performance of the movement, there 
are multiple sensory states that arise from the afferent appa-
ratus of muscles, joints, skins, eyes, ears, among others.
Let’s set the scene: the patient is now performing a 
squat, which has exacerbated his pain.
Priors swing the predictions toward safety
They have seen several physicians and other allied health 
professional previously and have been repeatedly told that 
Fig. 2  Clinical example of threat management and avoidance. (A) 
Hypothetical situation in which exteroceptive and proprioceptive sen-
sations (somatosensory sensations of movement, vision, sound, etc.) 
are the only referenced sources of evidence for inferring whether deep 
squat movement is threatening or safe. Given this source of evidence, 
the likelihood of threat or safety is equivalent and the movement 
produces nothing out of the “ordinary.” (B) Hypothetical situation 
where interoceptive (fear response) and exteroceptive and propriocep-
tive sensations (somatosensory sensations of the movement, vision, 
sound, etc.) are taken as evidence. The likelihood of threat is much 
more likely given the presence of the fear response (here the intero-
ceptive evidence has more weighting [Allen & Tsakiris, 2018]). As a 
result, the threat results in the movement being associated with fear or 
maybe even avoidant behaviors. Grey figures represent exteroceptive 
evidence and black figures represent interoceptive evidence. Priopio-

there was no serious structural cause for their ongoing pain 
and so are without any diagnosis. So, from a Bayesian per -
spective, we may consider the prior probability distribu-
tion over two hypothesis (P(Safety): the exercise will not 
cause structural damage to the knee) and P(Threat): the 
exercise is harmful to the knee). Given the patient’s prior 
experiences; healthcare interactions, the prior probability 
P(Safety) is higher than P(Threat) (Fig.  2). [Please note 
that, for simplicity, we are using discrete probability distri-
butions, whereas a more complex example might consider 
Gaussian distributions that have an associated variance].
Taking into account the probability of these 
sensory contexts occurring on the basis of different 
hypotheses
Whilst the patient was informed by the clinician that squat-
ting is safe for them, they have been told by a trusted friend 
that deep squats are the worst type of exercise for those 
with injury of the knee. Consequently, when perform-
ing the movement, the probabilities of the sensory inputs 
originating from either a threatening (informed by pain 
experienced and friends’ advice) or a safe event (informed 
by lack of pathology and clinician reassurance) are consid-
ered to be equivalent (please note the same caveat about 
Gaussian distribution as above applies as above) (Fig.  2).
Here, we can apply Bayes’ rule to perform a possible 
inference of threat:
S denotes the sensory inputs. In this case, P(S|threat) 
and P(S|safety) denote the probability of these sensory 
inputs occurring given a threat hypothesis and a safety 
hypothesis, respectively. Following this rule, if we con-
sider only the exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensory 
states, “safety” posterior belief will result as more prob-
able as P(safety|S) = 0.6 and P(threat|S) = 0.4.
Our proposal assumes that the experience of pain—akin 
to the experience of other biologically relevant variables 
and somatic states, such as effort, pain, and the so-called 
“medically unexplained symptoms,” does not just stem from 
peripheral sensory inputs but is the result of an inference that 
integrates multisensory (i.e., proprioceptive, interoceptive, 
exteroceptive) information to estimate the overall bodily 
condition and threat (Iodice et al., 2019; Kiverstein et al., 
2022; Maisto et al., 2021; Tabor et al., 2017; Van den Bergh 
et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2013). Therefore, to fully under-
stand how threat is inferred, we must consider interocep-
tive streams in addition to exteroceptive and proprioceptive 
streams as well as other neuro-immune-endocrine streams.
P (threat/uni007C.varS)= P(threat)×P(S /uni007C.varthreat)
P(threat)× P(S/uni007C.varthreat)+ P(safety)×P(S/uni007C.varsafety)
When including interoception makes the difference
Because of the patient’s fears and concerns about the pos-
sible negative consequences of squatting and their previous 
experiences of pain whilst performing the movement, they 
have avoided squatting over a sustained period, and now the 
therapist has asked them to perform the movement. It is a 
likely scenario that the person starts to be fearful resulting in 
attendant sensory states. They feel their heart rate increase; 
they start to perspire and feel on edge as their stressed state 
raises sympathetic tone. The best causal hypothesis now 
has to include and explain the combined impact of both the 
sensory and interoceptive states. A context of threat has a 
greater probability of generating a fear response. This means 
that any consideration about the probability of threat under 
the conditions of the same therapist requested squat must 
take into account both exteroceptive and proprioceptive 
squat sensory states and the squat induced interoceptive 
sensory states.
Under these hypothetical conditions, given the squat sen-
sory states and the interoceptive sensory states, the prob-
ability of safety giving sensory and interoceptive inputs has 
now decreased to 0.2 for example, and the probability of 
threat giving sensory and interoceptive inputs has therefore 
increased to 0.8. Now, if we reapply Bayes’ rule under these 
conditions to calculate threat versus safety; it is the threat 
hypothesis that ‘wins out’ with a P(threat|S) = 0.73. The 
“threat model” is both the more probable and the less com-
plex hypothesis, here the presence of a threat induced by 
the movement can explain both the fear response and the 
sensory evidencing state (the “safety model” can explain 
the squat sensory input state, but not the fear response). Fur-
thermore, the ‘safety model’ is more a complex hypothesis, 
as it requires that whilst the safe movement depends on the 
sensory input states, the learned dysfunctional beliefs are 
responsible for the fear response (Fig.  3). It is important 
to note that in active inference (underpinned by the FEP ), 
organisms like us act parsimoniously, utilizing simpler pre-
dictive models with less divergence and therefore complexity
The hypothesis of threat will therefore dominate in this 
hypothetical patient with on-going knee pain. Strategies such 
as action planning, perception, or even patient’s beliefs, will 
be heavily influenced by the hypothesis of threat and there-
fore the priority of survival of their body. Future genera-
tive models will be dynamically influenced by this threat 
model, acting like an attractor (Kiebel et al., 2008, 2009). As 
a result, there may be an increased precision given to other 
associated regularities that result from normally accounted 
random fluctuations of the world, resulting in everyday non-
noxious sensory states producing defensive strategies. These 
alterations in precision weighting will impact on predictive 
mechanisms at all levels of the nervous system, even our 
actions (Fig. 4).
788 Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792
Clinical relevance of our framework
According to the proposal advanced here, in individuals 
such as the case above, with on-going pain, even if there 
is no reason to feel fear in a specific context, alterations in 
internally driven interoceptive sensory states that generate 
a hypothesis of fear and threat will be preferentially sam-
pled confirming a threat prediction and an associated lived 
experience of vulnerability. In these vulnerable individuals, 
the impact of safety states will lose their ability to counter 
the above alterations in predictive models throughout the 
interoceptive system. Thus, normal movement will be asso-
ciated with the concept of threat and be perceived as aver -
sive. It will begin to elicit more pain-related fear response 
and pain-related anxiety. Fear responses might generalize to 
prescribed exercise and strategies that are employed with the 
intention of helping. This negative cycle will continuously 
confirm unhelpful beliefs and the individual’s experience 
of pain will increase in intensity. Whilst we have offered a 
somewhat one-sided (negative) account detailing how these 
factors link pain and the development of associated behav -
iors (e.g., fear avoidance), the same framework also offers 
the potential for the development of novel management 
strategies. Exposing a patient to settings/movements/activi-
ties that are predicted to be dangerous in an individualized 
dosed fashion but in a context of support and safety would, 
we suggest, have potentially positive outcomes and could 
be already considered analogous to elements of some of the 
existing behavioral-based management strategies employed 
in clinical settings. It is our belief that such approaches could 
be further nuanced and advanced by incorporating the key 
tenets presented above.
Fig. 3  Complexity of the two generative models of safety (A) and threat (B)
Fig. 4  Hierarchical influence of change in precision-weighting. 
At the higher level, threat hypothesis has been privileged. Thus, 
interoceptive channels (on the left) are favored, because they con-
firm high-level predictions and are influenced in such a way that 
they are inclined to confirm high-level predictions themselves (prone 
to increase sympathetic and gastric tone). On the other hand (right), 
the lower and intermediate exteroceptive/proprioceptive levels by 
violating the higher-level predictions, errors are attenuated (lower 
precision weight, low importance of feedback), being considered as 
non-informative/noise, although they are influenced to confirm the 
higher-level predictions themselves (strong influence from higher lev-
els). This last point reflects by a tendency to avoid movement and see 
threat-related objects
789Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792 
Avoidant behaviors are “rational”—if not helpful
Consequent behavioral avoidance will reduce the heightened 
probability of threat and update it toward safety and there-
fore makes “sense” (see above example of the Bogeyman). 
Fear response and threat perception toward these types of 
movement will be integrated and learnt as a valuable (non-
surprising) state. Additionally, resultant errors that do not 
confirm the prediction about error will have low precision 
and therefore low impact on the updating of predictive mod-
els. If there is no available alternative to disconfirm the pre-
diction of danger, then the prediction around threat will be 
unchallenged. One way to minimize prediction errors asso-
ciated with specific movements are by avoiding them. This 
will potentially amplify (apparently) irrational and anxious 
thoughts about the perceived threatening nature of move -
ment and therefore perpetuates avoidant behaviors. In brief, 
the patient is now prisoner of the cycle of fear-avoidance 
and will hold beliefs that seem irrational if one only consid-
ers exteroceptive and proprioceptive (but not interoceptive) 
information (Fig. 5).
Thus, fear-avoidance seen through the lens of predictive 
coding and active inference highlights two major aspects:
1) The embodied nature of the model. The categorical 
classification of the context arises from a multisensory 
integration, including exteroceptive and interoceptive 
sensory states (Kiverstein et al., 2022).
2) The dynamical nature of the model. The generative 
models are continually updated according to the context. 
There is no time-invariant assignment to one pathway or 
the other.
Threat and safety predictions will act as two attrac-
tors that will dynamically influence how the patient acts 
according to the context (Kiebel et al., 2008, 2009). Rec-
ognizing these factors and applying appropriate strategies 
aimed at the reestablishment of a normal balance between 
an individuals’ safety and threat models will facilitate a best 
care and personalized approach to their management.
Conclusions
Predictive coding is now a leading theory of how the brain 
performs perceptual inferences, and it has been used to 
explain several aversive sensations (Büchel et al., 2014; De 
Ridder et al., 2014; Hullfish et al., 2019; Tabor et al., 2017; 
Van den Bergh et al., 2017). Here, we have used the formal 
construct of predictive coding—and critically, the proposal 
that predictive coding could jointly consider exteroceptive, 
proprioceptive, and interoceptive information—to provide 
a new way to understand fear-avoidance, a behavior seen in 
several chronic conditions (Janssens et al., 2018; Kleinstäu-
ber et al., 2013; Nijs et al., 2013). We have seen that irra-
tional fears and excessive avoidance behaviors might arise 
from an attempt of surprise minimization. We have shown 
how prior patient’s beliefs, along with the multisensory inte-
gration, can drive the inference toward a threat interpretation 
even with apparently “safe context,” resulting in a vicious 
cycle of fear-avoidance.
If fear response and threat interpretations are not cor -
rectly managed, the simplest causal inference will be of 
danger to bodily integrity despite its apparent irrationality. 
Through operant conditioning and negative reinforcement 
(Vlaeyen, 2015), the patient will avoid the activity to prevent 
the appearance of pain. They also may generalize their fear 
response to other relative treatment/movement/activity. A 
stressful encounter or experience is therefore likely to predis-
pose the patient to weight a hypothesis of threat over one of 
Fig. 5  Interpretation of the Fear-Avoidance Model through the 
lens of the predictive coding theory; “The embodied predictive 
model of fear-avoidance.” When subjects interact in the world, it 
is necessary to infer whether events are threatening or safe to main-
tain the equilibrium of the internal environment. Depending on the 
prediction, they will enter a fear-avoidance or recovery cycle; how -
ever, there is not a finite cycle. Because of the dynamic nature of the 
model, hypotheses are continually updated based on the different suc-
cesses and failures of the therapeutic management, thus, switching 
from one cycle to another. The goal of therapeutic management will 
be to remain or move into the recovery cycle
790 Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2024) 24:781–792
safety, especially where there is an increase in sympathetic 
arousal. One of the pillars of the clinical reasoning should 
be to promote safety-related generative models. Clinicians 
are therefore encouraged to use this knowledge to become 
active actors to prevent patients being attracted toward the 
cycle of fear-avoidance and to help extricate those embedded 
within it, by managing fear responses as key element of the 
therapeutic encounter. Several chronic aversive experiences 
(including not only pain, but also fatigue in chronic fatigue 
syndrome or long COVID, dyspnea in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, nausea in cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy) can be explained through the prism of pre -
dictive coding. We propose that the reasoning detailed here 
should be included in the understanding of chronically disa-
bled patients in general.
In conclusion, we have proposed a new formulation of the 
fear-avoidance model through the lens of the predictive cod-
ing theory. Future works should extend the rationale behind 
this review to evaluate if other clinical models could fit with 
the predictive coding and active inference frameworks.
