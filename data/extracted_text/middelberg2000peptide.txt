We present a study of the adsorption of two peptides at the
octane–water interface. The ﬁrst peptide, Lac21, exists in mixed
monomer–tetramer equilibrium in bulk solution with an apprecia-
ble monomer concentration. The second peptide, Lac28, exists as a
tetramer in solution, with minimal exposed hydrophobic surface. A
kinetic limitation to interfacial adsorption exists for Lac28 at
moderate to high surface coverage that is not observed for Lac21.
We estimate the potential energy barrier for Lac28 adsorption to
be 42 kJymol and show that this is comparable to the expected free
energy barrier for tetramer dissociation. This ﬁnding suggests that,
at moderate to high surface coverage, adsorption is kinetically
limited by the availability of interfacially active monomeric ‘‘do-
mains’’ in the subinterfacial region. We also show how the com-
monly used empirical equation for protein adsorption dynamics
can be used to estimate the potential energy barrier for adsorption.
Such an approach is shown to be consistent with a formal descrip-
tion of diffusion–adsorption, provided a large potential energy
barrier exists. This work demonstrates that the dynamics of inter-
facial adsorption depend on protein thermodynamic stability, and
hence structure, in a quantiﬁable way.
P
rotein adsorption at interfaces is a ubiquitous phenomenon
of importance to diverse fields ranging from food processing
to biomedical science. Consequently, research in this area has
been widespread over the last century and a half, since Ascher-
son’s observation regarding the formation of proteins skins
around oil droplets in 1840 (1). Fundamental understanding of
the processes involved in protein adsorption is, however, still
lacking. Three key questions concern the protein structure at the
interface, the adsorbed layer thickness, and the dynamics of
protein adsorption.
The first question is the subject of considerable research,
particularly at the solid–liquid interface (2). Recent insight has
been obtained from studies on peptides. Amphipathic helices
adopt a preferential orientation parallel to the air–water inter-
face (3). The
a-helical content of b-casein-derived peptides
increases on adsorption to a hydrophobic solid surface (4).
The second question, regarding the thickness of surface-
adsorbed layers, has been addressed by using ellipsometry (5)
and neutron reflectivity (6, 7). Surface pressure at the liquid–
liquid interface is dictated by the first layer of irreversibly
adsorbed molecules, whereas subsequent layers may bind re-
versibly, causing an increase in thickness with no appreciable
increase in surface pressure (5).
The third question concerns the dynamics of protein adsorp-
tion and particularly how this is affected by protein structure and
protein stability. Diffusion to the interface often controls the
rate of protein adsorption and hence governs the interfacial
tension at low surface coverage (8). At moderate to high
coverage, an activation barrier to further adsorption has been
observed for
b-casein and lysozyme (8). The dynamic behavior
in this regime is described by Eq. 1.

where P is the surface pressure (N ym), g is the interfacial
tension (N ym), k is a rate constant (1 ys), and t is time (s).
Subscripts ss and o denote long-term and initial values, respec-
tively. After complete surface coverage, a further slow regime for
interfacial tension decrease has been reported for lysozyme (8).
The dynamics in this stage could also be described by Eq. 1 with
a reduced value of the rate constant, k. It was argued that this
stage results from conformational changes in the interfacial
layer. Such changes were not observed for
b-casein, which is a
relatively unstructured protein.
Despite further studies on the dynamics of protein adsorption
(9, 10), an understanding of how the adsorption process, and in
particular the value of k, is affected by protein structure is
completely lacking. In this work, we seek such an understanding
using a model amphipathic peptide system, namely the four-
chain coiled–coil based on the carboxyl-terminal oligomeriza-
tion domain of the lac repressor (11). We examine two specific
Lac peptides: a 21-mer peptide that exists in mixed monomer–
tetramer equilibrium in bulk solution and a 28-mer peptide that
exists primarily in tetrameric form even at low bulk concentra-
tion. The different behavior of these peptides during interfacial
adsorption demonstrates that the value of k in Eq. 1 is controlled
by the stability of peptide self association in the subinterfacial
layer. Because helical protein domains will behave similarly to
helical peptides, it is likely that k will be a complex but
quantifiable function of protein structure.
Materials and Methods
Peptides were synthesized by using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
solid-phase chemistry and were purified by reversed-phase chro-
matography by D. S. King (Howard Hughes Medical Founda-
tion, University of California, Berkeley, CA). The 21-mer and
28-mer helical peptides (Lac21 and Lac28, respectively) were as
described previously (11) and were acetylated at the amino
terminus and amidated at the carboxy terminus. Purified peptide
fractions were lyophilized, and molecular weights were con-
firmed by mass spectrometry. Final preparation purity was also
confirmed by mass spectrometry. Identity and concentration
were confirmed by quantitative amino acid analysis (Protein
Structure Laboratory, University of California, Davis, CA).
CD of the peptides was measured by using an Aviv Model
62DS Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimeter (Aviv Instru-
ments, Lakewood, NJ) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at
various peptide concentrations and path lengths (data not
shown). The CD spectra showed the same behavior as a previ-
ously reported characterization of peptide thermodynamic sta-
bility (11). Briefly, Lac21
a-helix content was strongly concen-
tration dependent, with a substantial amount of nonhelical
content even at the highest concentration studied. This is

consistent with findings that this peptide exists in mixed mono-
mer–tetramer equilibrium in bulk (11). Lac28 showed high
a-helix structure even at 10 mM, indicating that this form exists
primarily as a tetramer in solution. The reversibility of this
tetrameric association was confirmed by thermal denaturation.
Interfacial tension was determined by using a pendant drop
apparatus (12) at the octane–water interface. All glassware in
contact with reagents was acid washed before use; steel com-
ponents were washed repeatedly with ethanol, acetone, and
water. All chemicals were analytical grade. Octane was the
highest grade available (Sigma) and was purified further by
repeated stirring with silica that had been heated at 600 K over
night. Water was MilliQ quality. Purity of the final chemicals was
confirmed by monitoring the clean-surface interfacial tension
for at least 12 h before peptide experiments.
Results and Discussion
Fig. 1 shows the dynamic interfacial tension response for Lac21
amphipathic peptide adsorbing to an octane–water interface.
The decrease in interfacial tension (30–40 mN ym) is larger than
that achieved by most proteins, including
b-casein, lactoglobulin,
and lysozyme (12). The rate of interfacial tension decrease was
clearly concentration dependent, and a well-defined equilibrium
tension was attained at long times, in contrast to the behavior of
proteins (12). There was a small concentration dependence for
equilibrium tension, from 16.9 mN yma t1 5
mM to 14.5 mN ym
at 450 mM. These equilibrium data did not fit conventional
two-parameter adsorption isotherms.
Fig. 2 shows the corresponding behavior of the Lac28 peptide.
Concentrations are expressed without reference to quaternary
structure (i.e., as monomer equivalents) to allow direct compar-
ison with Lac21. The interfacial tension at moderate times was
comparable to that for Lac21. However, the dynamics were
characterized by a rapid decrease in interfacial tension to 20–30
mNym, followed by a slower decrease. At moderate to high
concentrations ( $45
mM), no significant delay was seen in
interfacial tension reduction for Lac21, whereas Lac28 still
exhibited significant time dependence. This is shown clearly in
Fig. 3. Lac28 exhibited interfacial gelation at higher concentra-
tions and long times (e.g., over night) with further small reduc-
tions in interfacial tension (typically ,0.25 mN ym). Neverthe-
less, a reasonably well-defined steady tension could be identified
before gelation onset (i.e., at moderate times). The variation in
these pseudo-steady-state values with concentration was less
than observed for Lac21 and ranged from 13.85 mNyma t1 5
mM
to 13.35 mN yma t3 0 0 mM.
We propose that the difference in dynamic behavior may be
explained with reference to Fig. 4. In reaction A, tetramer in the
subinterfacial region is in equilibrium with an activated transi-
tion state (an interfacially adsorbed tetramer, T
I
6) that dissoci-
ates to give four interfacially adsorbed monomers ( MI). We
expect kdiss .. k21, because the interface will constrain hydro-
phobic side chains less than the tetramer interior (i.e., the
dissociation will be entropically driven). We also expect k
1 to
decrease substantially as the fractional interfacial coverage, u,
increases. Initially, the adsorption of tetramer occurs by rela-
tively weak hydrophobic forces (e.g., alanine exposed on the
exterior of the tetramer complex). As
u increases, interfacially
adsorbed monomer with charged residues projected toward the
aqueous phase will create an electrostatic and steric barrier to
further tetramer adsorption (the tetramer has a high number of
charged residues on its surface). The potential energy barrier to
further tetramer adsorption will therefore increase with
u.A t
high surface coverage, k1 will become negligible, and reactions
B and C will dominate. Reaction B represents the equilibrium in
the subinterfacial region between a tetramer and its partially
dissociated forms, including monomer activated for interfacial
adsorption (M
S
6). This monomer has significant hydrophobicity
and adopts an essentially random structure in the aqueous phase
(11). This flexible chain will be able to orientate its hydrophobic

residues toward a partially covered interface, allowing the
creation of an interfacially adsorbed transition state as in
reaction C. This is expected to be fast, because it involves the
energetically favorable removal of hydrophobic residues from
aqueous contact (as in rapid hydrophobic protein collapse). Note
that we expect k
i..k2(i21)[MS
6] for reaction B in the subinter-
facial region because of the removal of monomer to the inter-
face. Once interfacially anchored, the remaining steps for full
interfacial adsorption, and hence k
6, will be determined by
interactions between adsorbed monomers. Note that the above
mechanism assumes that mass transport to the interface is not
limiting the adsorption process at any stage.
The differences in Lac21 and Lac28 dynamic behavior may be
understood now with reference to the preceding mechanism.
Lac21 exists primarily as a monomer in bulk. Conversely, Lac28
exists primarily as a tetramer. Lac21 should therefore show rapid
adsorption, primarily via reaction C. Conversely, we expect
Lac28 to show rapid dynamics initially (via reaction A), followed
by a slower phase as
u increases and k1 decreases. In this region,
adsorption will be limited by the dissociation reactions, which are
determined by the thermodynamic stability of the associated
forms (11). This expected behavior is shown in Figs. 1–3.
Specifically, Lac28 shows a rapid decrease in interfacial tension
to 20–30 mN ym at high concentration ( $45
mm; reaction A)
followed by a slower decrease (reactions B and C). Lac21 simply
shows a rapid decrease because of the high subinterfacial MS
6
concentration. We now provide evidence that the activation
barrier to Lac28 adsorption at moderate to high surface coverage
is comparable to the free energy barrier expected for the
tetramer dissociation reactions (i.e., the process is indeed limited
by the production of M
S
6).
Before analyzing dynamic data by using the proposed mech-
anism, we must confirm that mass transport was not limiting the
adsorption of Lac28 at higher concentrations. We first estimated
the characteristic time, t
d, of a diffusion-controlled adsorption
process assuming a linear isotherm (13),

where D is the peptide diffusion coefficient in bulk, estimated by
using the Polson equation (14), § C‘ is the bulk peptide concen-
tration [expressed as mol ym3 of monomer (Lac21) or tetramer
(Lac28)], and Gmax is the maximum interfacial coverage.¶ Results
of this calculation for both peptides are provided in Table 1. It
appears that adsorption may be diffusion limited at low concen-
trations ( #15
mM). However, the adsorption of Lac28 is con-
siderably slower than would be expected under diffusion control,
particularly at concentrations above 45
mM. At the highest
concentrations, diffusion times are negligible compared with the
observed time constant for Lac28. To confirm further kinetic
limitation for Lac28, we estimated the diffusion coefficient from
the gradient of a
g vs. t21/2 curve in the limit of t3‘ (17). The
analysis yielded apparent diffusion coefficients that varied be-
tween 10
213 and 10 215 m2ys, depending systematically on con-
centration (data not shown). These estimates are three orders of
magnitude below the estimate of 1.2 3 10
210 m2ys from the
Polson equation (14). We conclude that the adsorption of Lac28
peptide at moderate to high surface coverage ( P. 20 mNym)
is not limited by diffusion, and we may consequently analyze
adsorption with regard to the preceding mechanism. We return
to a fuller discussion of mass transfer subsequently (see Further
Discussion).
To analyze adsorption under kinetic limitation we begin with
Eq. 3, which is the usual expression for adsorption from a
subinterfacial region to an interfacial monolayer under kinetic
limitation.

¶A hydrophobic residue has a volume of approximately 170 Å 3 (15), giving a projected
equivalent spherical cross section of 35 Å 2. Helical peptide adsorbed at a hydrophobic
interface adopts a helical conformation (3, 4) presenting two residues of every heptad
repeat to the hydrophobic phase. It is assumed that the helical Lac21 and Lac28 peptides
will behave similarly, giving six and eight residues per molecule of Lac21 and Lac28 in
contact with the oil phase, respectively. This gives a projected cross-sectional area of
approximately 210 Å
2 for Lac21 and 280 Å 2 for a monomer of Lac28, corresponding to
monolayer surface coverages (Gmax)o f7 9 03 1029 molmonomerym2 for Lac21 and 580 3
1029 molmonomerym2,o r1 4 53 1029 moltetramerym2 for Lac28. The use of 35 Å2 per residue
is also supported by monolayer compression studies for poly- DL-phenylalanine at the
oil–water interface, which showed an increase in surface pressure when monolayer
compression exceeds 30–40 Å
2 per residue (16). Additionally, the above surface coverages
equate to 2 mg ym2 on a mass basis, which matches the surface coverage for b-casein-
derived peptides almost precisely (4). Finally, application of the Gibbs equation to equi-
librium data for Lac21 at the lowest concentrations examined gave a surface coverage of
approximately 690 3 10
29 molmonomerym2, consistent with the preceding calculations.
Note that the Gibbs equation was inapplicable at higher bulk concentrations, because a
plot of interfacial tension vs. ln(peptide concentration) was concave upward, implying
that lower peptide concentrations give a higher G.

reasonable to assume that the subinterfacial concentration is
equal to that in the bulk (i.e., C

assumption. We also assume that Lac28 adsorption may be
modeled as irreversible ( k

both assumptions are reasonable (see Further Discussion ). This

where GTmax is the maximum interfacial coverage on a tetrameric

that the Gibbs equation does not apply.

where g0 is the interfacial tension (Nym) at time 0 assuming that
Eq. 4 describes the process for all t, and gss is the steady-state
interfacial tension as t3‘ . Concentrations in Eq. 6 have been
converted to a monomeric basis simply to facilitate direct
comparison with Lac21 data ( C
M‘ 5 4CT‘ , and GMmax 5 4GTmax).
Note that g0 in Eq. 6 is the interfacial tension at time 0, assuming
that Eq. 4 controls the entire adsorption process with a coverage-
invariant value of ka.I ti sn o t gu50, the measurable interfacial
tension at zero surface coverage, and hence cannot be specified
a priori for Lac28 (doing so would ignore adsorption via reaction
A at low surface coverage).
Eq. 6 is equivalent to Eq. 1 with a concentration-dependent
constant k. This confirms that k in Eq. 1 is indeed a quantifiable
function of protein structure, as proposed in the Introduction.
gss
is poorly defined for Lac28 because of gelation at long times. As
noted earlier, reductions in tension at long times are small
(typically ,0.25 mNym), and a well-defined steady tension could
be identified before the onset of gelation (i.e., at moderate
times). We therefore approximate
gss with these pseudo-steady-
state values. A plot of Eq.6 is shown in Fig. 5 for Lac28 at various
peptide concentrations. Repeat experiments at 15 mM and 150
mM show high reproducibility. Deviation from the regressed
curve at the lowest concentration (15 mM) is probably because
of diffusional limitation (see Table 1). Deviation at longer times
and higher concentrations (e.g., 150
mM) is probably because of
limitations in the simplifying assumptions underlying Eq. 6 in the
limit of high surface coverage (e.g., gelation is not included, and
a linear equation relating surface coverage and surface pressure
is assumed). This is similar to protein behavior (e.g., lysozyme),
where a single linear region is not seen when data are plotted
according to Eq. 1 or Eq. 6 (5). This nonlinearity therefore
reflects a change in the rate-controlling step, probably so that k
5
or k6 in Fig. 4 become limiting. Interestingly, this gelation was not
observed for Lac21, which exhibited a well-defined adsorption
equilibrium.
The gradient from Fig. 5 may be plotted against concentration
and should, according to Eq. 6, yield a straight line through the
origin. This is shown in Fig. 6. The gradient of this plot gives k
a
5 (175 6 8) 3 1029 mys( R2 5 0.991). The intercept is (2.0 6
2.1) 3 1023 1ysec confirming the line passes through the origin
within statistical bounds. Note that Fig. 6 displays some nonlin-
earity, and in particular the regression residuals are biased. This
again reflects limitations resulting from the underlying assump-
tions. If the highest concentration point is removed from the
regression, then the bias in residuals is removed. This deletion
results in a modest 10% increase in k
a, but reduces the intercept
by two orders of magnitude, further suggesting that Lac28
adsorption may be modeled as irreversible in this system.
Given the adsorption rate constant k
a, we may estimate the
activation energy DGa for peptide adsorption by using Eq. 7.

iStudies on amphipathic helices at the air–water interface by Boncheva and Vogel (3)
suggest that a two-dimensional van der Waals state equation is appropriate at low surface
coverage (P, 10 mNym). They concluded that electrostatic repulsion plays an important
role at low surface pressure. However, the van der Waals equation of state becomes less
accurate at higher interfacial coverage, and the experimental data suggest an almost
linear relation between interfacial coverage and surface pressure in the limit of high
coverage (20 ,P, 30 mN ym). The use of a highly parameterized state equation is
therefore unjustiﬁed in the limit of high interfacial coverage for the current study.

where M is the molecular weight of the adsorbing molecules
(13.032 kg ymoltetramer), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314
JymolzK), and T is temperature (293 K). This gives a potential
energy barrier for adsorption of 42 kJ ymoltetramer. This will be
related to the thermodynamic stability of the tetramer if ad-
sorption is controlled by the availability of M

6 in the subinter-
facial region. The total thermodynamic stability of this tetramer
has been estimated at approximately 126 kJymol
tetramer by fitting
guanidinium chloride denaturation data by using a two-state
model (11). No information is available regarding the activation
barrier for removal of individual monomers from the tetramer.
However, we may simplistically assume that k
2, k3, and k4 are
characterized by approximately the same activation energy, so
that Fig. 7 describes the dissociation and adsorption reactions.
We then estimate DG
M i nF i g .7t ob e4 2k J ymoltetramer (126
kJymoltetramer for total dissociation, divided by three dissociation
steps). The calculated potential energy barrier for adsorption
matches this estimate precisely. It is therefore reasonable to
conclude that the interfacial adsorption of Lac28 is indeed
limited by the availability of free monomer in the subinterfacial
region.
Further Discussion
Two assumptions in the preceding analysis are that the rate of
Lac28 adsorption is far greater than the desorption rate (i.e., the
process may be modeled as irreversible so that Eq.4 applies) and
that the subinterfacial concentration approximates the bulk
concentration (i.e., C
TS ’ CT‘ ).
The applicability of an irreversible approximation for Lac28 is
confirmed by examining the concentration dependence of gss
(13.85 mNyma t1 5 mM and 13.35 mNyma t3 0 0mM). If ue 5 1.0
at 300 mM, then a linear state equation givesue 5 0.987 at 15 mM,
where the subscript e denotes equilibrium. The variation in gss is
minimal despite a 20-fold variation in concentration; the iso-
therm is essentially horizontal. Eq. 3 at equilibrium gives

which is a restrictive relationship between the two rate constants.
This value of kd corresponds to a potential energy barrier for
interfacial desorption of approximately 68 kJ ymolmonomer. This
compares extremely well with an estimated barrier of 69 kJ y
molmonomer, assuming that desorption requires the removal of six
leucines and one valine (per Lac28 monomer) from octanol to
water (19). Equivalent data for octane are not available, but
octanol is less hydrophobic than octane, so the estimate for k
d is
conservatively high. At 150 mM, we therefore estimate that
kaCTS(1 2 u)yGTmax is three orders of magnitude greater thankdu
at moderate to high surface coverage. Any desorption may
therefore be safely ignored, provided the subinterfacial concen-
tration does not approach zero.

This boundary condition is implicit in Y(X 5 0,t) and must

containing k
d in Eq. 10 to be three orders of magnitude below
dYydX at X 5 0, confirming that this term can be neglected safely
(i.e., adsorption may indeed be modeled as irreversible).
Importantly, we note from Fig. 8 that the concentration of
tetramer in the subinterfacial region (Y at X 5 0) rises to 95% of
the bulk value within a few seconds of the kinetic limitation
commencing. This is before the first interfacial tension measure-
ment, so the assumption thatC
TS 5 CT‘ in our analysis is justified.
This numerical approach, combined with the restriction im-
plied by Eq. 8, could be used to directly estimate ka (and kd)b y
regression of experimental data. However, this approach is
numerically intensive because of the implicit boundary condition

that must be solved at each time step. Such an approach would
seem to offer no advantage over the simplified analysis presented
earlier in this paper when the system is characterized by a high
value of DG
a.
A Mechanism for Protein Adsorption
The preceding analysis and in particular the striking difference
between Lac21 and Lac28 behavior confirm a two-stage mech-
anism for Lac28 peptide adsorption. In the first stage, at low
surface coverage, peptide is able to move into the interfacial
region in associated or dissociated form (i.e., as a monomer or
tetramer). Once in the interfacial region, interaction with the oil
phase is energetically favorable with an apparently negligible
activation energy. At higher surface coverage, the movement of
tetramer into the interfacial region is energetically unfavorable,
presumably because of either steric or electrostatic exclusion
causing a reduction in k
1. Adsorption then occurs via smaller
monomers that have an exposed hydrophobic region. The rate of
adsorption will thus be limited by the rate of monomer appear-
ance in the subinterfacial region. No kinetic barrier will be
observed when the subsurface contains a sufficient amount of
monomer. This is evident for Lac21.
This mechanism suggests the activation barrier is apparent
only at reasonably high surface coverage (i.e., when interaction
of the entire tetramer with the oil phase is no longer possible).
This is supported by a closer examination of Eq. 6 and Fig. 5.
g0
in Eq. 6 is not the peptide-free interfacial tension, but rather the
surface tension at time 0 that would have occurred had kinetic
limitation (via reaction B) been controlling for all t. This will be
less than the initial clean-surface tension because of the initial
rapid adsorption of tetramer via reaction A. Fig. 5 gives
g0 in the
range 20 to 25 mNym, corresponding to between 70 and 80% of
the total interfacial tension decrease ( gu50 2 gss), justifying our
selection of u 5 0.80 for the commencement of kinetic limitation
in the preceding section. This implies the kinetic limitation
commences at a surface coverage equal to approximately [3 y4]
of the maximum possible coverage and lends support to the
assertion that kinetic limitation becomes significant when ad-
sorption requires the removal of a single monomer from a
stabilized tetramer.
Graham and Philips (5, 8) used Eq. 1 to describe protein
adsorption at the air–water interface and identified two distinct
linear regimes. The first, at moderate to high interfacial coverage,
followed any limitation at low coverage because of diffusion.
Adsorption in this regime was limited by penetration into the
interfacial layer. In the second regime, surface pressure increased
slightly, whereas interfacial adsorption remained essentially con-
stant. This, it was argued, was because of conformational changes.
Our present study supports the proposed mechanism in the first
regime. We have demonstrated that a thermodynamically stable
tetramer exhibits a definite barrier to adsorption, whereas a mono-
mer with exposed hydrophobicity does not. In this sense, our
tetramer acts like a simple protein. Removal of a domain (mono-
mer) from protein (tetramer) in the subinterfacial region into the
interfacial layer is energetically unfavorable when the entire protein
cannot interact as a single unit with the interface (i.e., at high
interfacial coverage). The adsorption kinetics are determined by
the thermodynamic stability of a specific ‘‘domain’’ within the
native ‘‘protein.’’ Clearly, proteins having domains with differing
thermodynamic stability will exhibit complex adsorption kinetics, as
observed experimentally. This may explain why complex globular
proteins such as lysozyme having numerous domains and folding
intermediates exhibit adsorption dynamics that are more complex
than for simply structured proteins such as
b-casein. Graham and
Philips (5) argued that the second regime is caused by conforma-
tional rearrangement of molecules in the interfacial region. In our
system, a complex nonlinearity corresponding to this second regime
was observed at long times and high concentration (e.g., 150
mMi n
Fig. 5). This condition corresponded to the onset of gelation, where
complex interactions between adsorbed peptides will significantly
affect the values of k
5 and k6 in reaction C. In light of this result,
further study of the gelation region for multilayer adsorption is
warranted. Such a study could then be combined with our findings
for moderate interfacial coverage to allow a complete description
of adsorption dynamics in terms of protein structure and thermo-
dynamic stability.
