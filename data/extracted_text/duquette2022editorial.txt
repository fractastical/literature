Editorial on the Research Topic
Enactivism and active inference in the therapeutic alliance
The brain has no knowledge of reality but access only to the evidence of its
sense organs. Thus, we can only know the world by actively inferring the causes of
our sensations. The brain builds generative predictive models of the likely causes of
sensory input from the individual’s inner (interoceptive or proprioceptive) and outer
(exteroceptive) environment. These models infer the most likely cause of incoming
sensation, and this inference is a “prediction” of what will happen next. Predictions
can be considered “beliefs, ” but they are unconscious, subpersonal, and probabilis tic
inferences about what the cause of the sensation might be.
The Free Energy Principle provides an over-arching principle of how these processes
support life. This holds that the embodied brain must minimize the diﬀerence between
what the generative model predicts the sensation should be and what the sensatio n
actually is, to lessen life-dispersing entropy, i.e., to minimize free energy. A disc repancy
between what is predicted and what happens is termed “prediction error”—os tensibly
uncertainty. Essentially, generative models are actively constructed, i.e., require action
upon the sensory input. We actively sample data to build and maintain them through
the process known as “active inference.” The process is also referred to as “enactive
inference, ” stressing the enactive nature of the embodied organism, interacting w ith
its environment.
Processes of model building and updating may become inﬂexible or disturbed, for
many reasons, with resulting pathology. Regardless of whether the pathology is e xpressed
in the body or in the mind, aberrant belief updating is always involved (
Friston, 2022).
The therapeutic alliance, involving dyadic and group exchanges, creates interpersona l
synchrony that serves as a relational anchor to the patient’s (en)active infer ence processes
and facilitates increased ﬂexibility in these inference processes. The papers in this special
issue represent diﬀerent disciplines and clinical approaches but are linked by how the
therapeutic alliance can be employed, from the perspective of enactive inference , to
promote eﬀective treatment.

Duquette et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/two.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum
Hauke and Lohr posit that to alter the patient’s habitual
exploitation of limited model evidence, the therapeutic
relationship must support exploratory strategies that introduce
new data into model updating, from multiple sensory sources.
Exploratory actions expand the sensory ﬁeld and allow the
development of alternative priors. In Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy this includes mutually designing experiences that
allow the patient to experiment with “directed exploration, ” for
example, exploring historical narratives within the treatment
hour and exposing related physical and emotional reactions,
followed by similar exercises. The strength of the therapeutic
alliance can be reﬂected in the patient’s commitment to
goal-directed work.
Synchrony is a stabilizing aspect of the therapeutic alliance,
as the treatment creates disorganization within the patient’s
habitual generative models. Synchrony is likened to “singing
from the same hymn sheet” (
Friston and Frith, 2015 ), as each
individual agent’s generative model moves closer to the other’s,
to minimize their own free energy within the relationship.
Connolly explores this process within the psychotherapeutic
dyad, describing how the individual generative models converge,
under the inﬂuence of the therapist’s model, which is held
with greater precision/conﬁdence. It is an outgrowth of mutual
predictability that such entrainment occurs for both individuals.
As
Connolly explains, this is the juncture where the work
of therapy can begin, as synchronized activity promotes
“the emergence of a new hierarchical level in the client’s
generative model, ” reducing the false precision/conﬁdence of
their previous beliefs.
Several papers consider the role of touch in enabling
model updating, within an osteopathic framework of care.
Kim
et al. address distortions in interoceptive and proprioceptive
inference that has led to faulty inference. Touch, coupled with
purposeful verbal guidance of the patient’s attention to sensory
experience, and suggestions of new and diﬀerent explanations
for these sensations, allows the patient to reconsider old
hypotheses. New sensations can be paired with new “rules”
(i.e., predictions) about the cause of these sensations, thus
establishing healthier generative models.
Touch, guided by verbal interactions, is similarly discussed
by
Bohlen et al. , who propose that this increases the accurate
perception of interoception information, with subsequent
prediction error generation that updates faulty priors. An
improvement in physiological dysfunction can result, for
example, in better-regulated autonomic activity. They propose
that osteopathic care, as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic
approaches, can increase the chance of health-promoting shifts
in the patient’s model updating.
Esteves et al. consider how persistent physical pathology,
e.g., chronic pain, can be treated with touch and directed
verbal interaction by the clinician, which alters the patient’s
habitual attentional processes, develops synchrony, and alters
the aﬀordances that the environment oﬀers to the individual.
As new sensations develop, and the inference process is
updated, these aﬀordances allow the creation of a new
shared narrative, elevated by “mutually predictive sensations”
that beneﬁt the patient’s sense of self and relationships.
A “shared ecological niche” is created, speciﬁc to the
therapeutic dyad.
How touch generates biobehavioral synchrony and
contributes to an alignment between clinician and patient,
through mutual sensory experience, is explored by
McParlin
et al. “Ostensive cues” that are oﬀered to the patient through
touch, alongside the consistent and empathetic stance of the
clinician, speciﬁcally lend predictability to the interaction,
lessening uncertainty. This bidirectional aspect of touch furthers
the therapeutic alliance, creating opportunities for generative
model updating.
Importantly, exploration amidst model certainty generates
destabilizing uncertainty, instigating a state of relative “chaos”
(
Connolly) in the patient’s generative models as they explore
new states. As these papers emphasize, the therapeutic
alliance is the essential element that enables the patient
to weather this uncertainty, without pushing against new
model development, or regressing to old model exploitation.
Whatever the discipline, the clinician can empathetically elicit
the narrative that may reveal dysfunctional belief updating
and support the change process with relational stability, as
the patient is helped to foment instability that will update
their previously strongly-held models and beneﬁt them over a
time span that they have no way to measure. Metaphorically,
this can be viewed as the clinician listening carefully to
the patient’s verbal and physical expressions, initially oﬀering
a hymn sheet, and then persisting in helping them create
their own.
