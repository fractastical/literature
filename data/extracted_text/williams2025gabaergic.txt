Abstract  
Rationale: Apathy is a common symptom in many neurological and psychiatric conditions , 
associated with poor prognosis and increased caregiver burden. There are currently no proven 
treatments, in part due to a lack of mechanistic understanding. We have proposed a novel 
framework for apathy, based on the failure of active inference due to impr ecise priors on the 
outcome of actions. The loss of precision on action outcomes causes apathy by reducing the 
expected difference between the state of the world followi ng action versus non -action. Here 
we test the hypothesis that the loss of prior precision on action outcomes  is reversible and  
mediated neuronally by GABAergic gain on the superficial pyramidal neurons in a prefrontal-
motor decision -making hierarchy. We test this in a healthy cohort and people with two 
syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.  
Methods: Twenty healthy controls, twenty people with behavioural variant frontotemporal 
dementia (bvFTD) and twenty people with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) took part in a 
randomised placebo -controlled double -blind trial using zolpidem, an established GABAA 
agonist. This study was registered with ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN10616794). We use the 
‘Goal Prior Assay’ task and  dynamic causal modelling of MEG resting -state data to explore 
the cognitive and neural  concomitants of prior precision, and the effec t of GABAergic 
regulation on both prior precision and superficial pyramidal gain. Apathy was primarily 
assessed with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (Self and Carer). Principal analyses were conducted 
using Bayesian statistics, supplemented by classical frequentist tests.

Results: Forty-three participants (20 controls and 23  patients) were included in the final 
analysis. We found strong evidence for a difference in measures of apathy (B>1000, p<0.001) 
and prior precision (B=20.4, p<0.01) between healthy controls and people with bvFTD and 
PSP. This difference in prior precision was not found in the drug condition (B=0.86, p=0.11) . 
There was strong evidence of a correlation between apathy and prior precision across groups 
(B>100, p<0.001). Dynamic causal modelling of MEG resting-state data confirmed reductions 
in gain on the prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons in patients. The  prefrontal superficial 
pyramidal gain was partially restored on zolpidem and linked to participants’ prior precision 
on their action outcomes. 
Conclusion: We confirm that apathy in conditions associated with frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration is underwritten by a reduction in prior precision on action outcomes, mediated by 
reduced synaptic gain of prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons. GABAergic regulation 
using zolpidem partially restores prior precision by acting on this gain and reinstating neuronal 
message-passing within the prefrontal-motor decision-making hierarchy.

Introduction  
Apathy is a common symptom in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including 
syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration 1 (FTLD). It is defined as a 
reduction in goal-directed action2, and predicts both functional independence 3 and mortality4 
over and above age or cognitive ability. Apathy is positively associated with caregiver burden5,6 
and is a priority target symptom for treatment in dementia by both clinicians and carers7,8. 
While preclinical models of apathy have emphasised the role of reward and dopaminergic 
depletion, apathy can also be considered as the result of a failure of active inference, resulting 
from the loss of prior precision on action outcomes 9. In the ‘Bayesian Brain10–12, prior beliefs 
are key to learning accurate models of the environment, including action outcomes. Priors are 
combined with sensory evidence to update beliefs about the world, allowing us to predict and 
interact with our surroundings. When there is a discrepancy between  predicted outcomes and 
sensory observations, beliefs may be updated passively ( i.e., changing one’s perception or 
understanding of the situation), or  one may actively shape the environment , so that it better 
matches with prior expectations (active inference) 13. Prior precision, characterised as the 
certainty or confidence afforded a prior belief , is a key factor in active inference. When prior 
precision on action outcomes is very low, the difference between the expected consequences 
of acting versus not-acting disappears. For example, if your  beliefs about how much warmer 
you will be with a jacket on are imprecise, you are less likely to take the action of putting a 
jacket on to keep warm. This prior precision is a distinct property from the magnitude of the 
expected reward. Apathy can therefore arise as a failure of active inference due to imprecise 
priors on action outcomes, as there is an implicit uncertainty about how actions will bring the 
world closer to a  goal state. This hypothesis is supported by the association between apathy 
and prior precision in healthy individuals and in people with Parkinson’s disease9,14,15.  
There are currently no proven pharmacological treatments for apathy 16. Selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors are commonly used to treat apathy in FTLD 8 despite mixed evidence of 
efficacy17–19 and concerns of worsening amotivational syndromes 20. Similarly, selective 
dopamine agonists and levodopa in isolation do not reliably treat clinical apathy 16,21–23. 
However, compounds with joint noradrenergic and dopaminergic action like methylphenidate 
have shown some positive effects 24–26, including in neurological conditions such as 
Alzheimer’s disease24. Noradrenaline has also been linked to the related processes of effort 
processing27, learning under uncertainty28, and prior precision29. Such noradrenergic effects on

prior precision may be direct, or indirect, through interactions with gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)30–34.  
GABAergic deficits are well -established in FTLD -associated conditions, with evidence of 
reduced pyramidal neurons 35 and GABA-receptors36,37 in the frontal and temporal lobes.  A 
GABA deficit has also been confirmed in vivo in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 
(bvFTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)  using magnetic resonance spectroscopy38. 
The consequence of these GABA deficits has been further characterised using dynamic causal 
models of human cortical physiology 39. GABA is critical in maintaining the dynamic 
modulation of information processing in the frontal cortex40, and its loss results in effective 
disconnection in networks for goal -directed decision-making. In these networks, modulation 
of synaptic gain on superficial pyramidal cells by GABA is proposed to  encode or mediate 
prior precision 40. If confirmed, this hypothesis would open new GABAergic strategies to 
normalise prior precision, and in turn treat apathy. 
We test this hypothesis using zolpidem, a GABA A receptor agonist (licensed as a sedative -
hypnotic). Zolpidem modulates GABA levels and glucose metabolism in human prefrontal 
cortex41 and has been used off-label for the treatment of symptoms in disorders of movement42 
and consciousness 43, with small scale studies of severe amotivational states reporting 
benefits41,44,45. Preclinical studies also demonstrate potential anti-apathy mechanisms46, with the 
potential for broader clinical impacts highlighted in conditions like PSP 47. We therefore 
selected zolpidem to test the hypothesis that GABAergic modulation may improve  prior 
precision in people at risk of a GABAergic deficit as a result of bvFTD or PSP.   
We undertook a randomised placebo -controlled double -blind trial to test the neural and 
computational mechanisms underpinning apathy. Specifically, we hypothesised that zolpidem 
would improve prior precision in individuals with bvFTD and PSP, but not in healthy controls, 
by restoring GABAergic neuromodulatory mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex. We investigate 
these neural mechanisms using  dynamic causal modelling of resting -state MEG data, with a 
focus on the gain of superficial pyramidal neurons in the pre frontal cortex. This mechanistic 
study is not a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product ( i.e. not a CTIMP), but 
confirmation of the hypothesis would indicate the potential for future CTIMPS to evaluate 
GABAergic drugs to reduce apathy.

Materials and methods  
Participants 
Twenty people with probable behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD 48), 20 
people with probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP - Richardson syndrome49) and 20 
healthy controls were recruited. Recruitment for this stage of the study took place from March 
2022 to January 2025. The controls were recruited from either the volunteer panel of the MRC 
Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit or the Join Dementia Research register. Healthy volunteers 
were included if they were right-handed, aged between 50 and 75 years old, and had normal or 
corrected-to-normal vision and hearing. Volunteers with probable bvFTD or PSP were 
recruited from the NHS dementia clinics . Exclusion criteria in both groups included those 
currently taking GABAergic medications, and individuals with a history of brain injur ies. 
Normal clinical care continued through participation in the study with no change in 
concomitant medications.     
Diagnoses were made by a consultant neurologist at a multidisciplinary clinic, based on 
international consensus criterion. Individuals with other types of dementia, or PSP phenotypes, 
were not included. The study was registered with ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN 10616794; 
https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10616794) and the protocol was exempted from clinical trials 
status by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, UK, as a mechanistic 
study with non -clinical primary outcomes. Participants gave written informed consent  
according to the Declaration of Helsinki , and the study protocol was approved by the local 
Research Ethics Committee. The duration of the study days, disease severity, behavioural and 
technical factors meant that approximately half of patients were able to complete the task with 
sufficient data and quality for analysis. 
There are clinical and neurological distinctions between bvFTD, and PSP. However, there is 
also significant clinical overlap between the two, including apathy, prefrontal 
neurophysiological deficits and GABAergic deficits 39. We therefore collapse d across 
diagnostic groups for principal analyses and separated them for secondary tests.

Procedure 
Participants completed three testing sessions. The first two sessions constituted a randomized 
double-blind placebo -controlled crossover design and were conducted approximately two 
weeks apart, at the same time of day. Participants were given a single dose 5mg oral tablet of 
zolpidem or matched placebo. The randomisation order was permuted in sequential blocks of 
six participants and known only to the dispensing pharmacist . The Clinical Research Facility 
team (independent of the study team) administered the  tablets on each visit  at Addenbrookes 
Hospital, Cambridge, UK . Venus blood samples were taken approximately 90 minutes after 
drug administration, immediately before the MEG recording, close in time to the estimated 
peak plasma levels and central nervous system penetration. MEG recordings took place at the 
MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, UK. At the start of each 
session, participants completed a 5 -minute resting-state MEG recording with eyes closed. At 
the end of the session, p articipants completed the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ paradigm 14 (detailed 
below) out -of-scanner. The third testing session included 7 -Tesla MRI — for source 
reconstruction of the MEG data — at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of 
Cambridge, UK.  
Materials 
The primary behavioural task in this study was the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ task, developed by 
Hezemans et al. (2020)14. This task was designed to infer the precision of prior beliefs and its 
influence on the perception of action outcomes. The aim of the task is for participants to land 
a virtual ball on a target by applying sufficient power to a force sensor. In a pseudo -random 
subset of trials the ball disappears before reaching its end position, and participants are asked 
to estimate where they believe the ball’s final position to be (see figure 1).  
The task consisted of 120 trials, including 40 estimation trials, with 15 additional practise trials, 
which are excluded from analysis. The trials are split into 4 blocks, randomised in their 
presentation. 2 blocks are considered ‘high effort’ (i.e. the target is farther away, requiring high 
force) and 2 blocks ‘low effort’ (i.e. the target is closer, requiring low force).

MEG Data Acquisition 
MEG data were acquired at 1  kHz in a magnetically shielded room using the 306 -channel 
MEGIN TRIUX neuro system which includes 204 planar gradiometers and 102 
magnetometers. Eye movements were measured using pairs of vertical and horizontal EOG 
electrodes. Prior to data acquisition, a 3D digitizer (Fastrak Polyhemis Inc.) was used to record 
(1) three fiducial points, one on the nasion and one each on the left/ right pre-auricular points, 
(2) the location of five HPI coils, and (3) ~300 ‘head points’ across the scalp.  
The preprocessing pipeline for our resting state data is based on Vaghari et al (2022; 
https://github.com/delshadv/BioFIND-data-paper). MEG preprocessing was conducted in 
MATLAB v2018a using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) toolbox. Raw MEG data 
were preprocessed using Maxfilter software (version 2.2.14, Neuro -TRIUX), including 
standard signal-space separation, movement compensation and translation to default space. The 
data were segmented into epochs of 1 second duration and downsampled to 500Hz, and filtered 
using a 0.5-150Hz bandpass filter followed by 48-52Hz notch filter. Artefact rejection used the 
Figure 1 – The ‘Goal Prior Assay’ task originated by Hezemans et al (2020). When the ball appears, participants are 
asked to press a force sensor with sufficient force, sustained for 3s, for it to reach the target under learned stable 
kinematics. On pressing the sensor, the ball turns red. After 3 seconds, the ball turns green , and participants release the 
force sensor. The virtual ball then travels across the screen, with initial velocity scaled to the average force applied to 
the sensor, subject to consta nt deceleration. In non -catch trials, the ball is seen to stop. In pseudo -random catch trials, 
the ball disappears early in its trajectory and participants are asked to estimate the final position of the ball using an 
estimation scale that appears on screen.

OHBA Software Library. Finally, the cleaned data was manually coregistered to a 7T scan 
(N=28) using the fiducials digitised at MEG acquisition. Where a 7T MRI scan was not 
available, a volumetric 3T MRI scan was instead used for coregistration (N=10). Where neither 
was available, we used a symmetrical 7T template (https://www.templateflow.org/ 51). One 
participant was unable to tolerate either an MEG or MRI scan. 
7T MRI used a Siemens MAGNETOM Terra scanner with a 32 -channel head receiver and 
single channel transmit head coil (Nova Medical) at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, 
University of Cambridge. A high resolution isotropic whole brain Magnetization Prepared 2  
Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence (repetition time=4300 ms, echo 
time=1.99 ms, resolution=99 ms, bandwidth=250 Hz/px, voxel size=0.75 mm3, field of view= 
240 × 240 × 157mm, acceleration factor (A  ≫ P) =3, flip -angle=5/6° and inversion 
times=840/2370 ms) was acquired for the purposes of MEG coregistration. 3T MRI used a 
Siemens PRISMA scanner, with a 32 -channel head receiver and single channel transmit head 
coil (Nova Medical) with T1 -weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Grad ient 
Echoes (MPRAGE; TR=2000ms, TE=2.93ms, TI=850ms, FA=8°, 208 slices, 1.1mm isotropic 
voxels). 
Modelling and Statistical Analysis 
Principal analyses were conducted using Bayesian statistics. For completeness, frequentist 
statistics are also reported but note that they are not interchangeable tests as the nature of the 
inferences supported is different. The Bayes Factor (B) is interpr eted in keeping with 
convention: standard evidentiary thresholds are used for moderate (>3), strong (>10) or very 
strong (>100)52,53 evidence in favour of the alternate hypothesis, or 1/3, 1/10 and 1/100 for 
corresponding strength of evidence for the null hypothesis. In the case of frequentist statistics, 
results are considered significant if p<0.05. 
Participants with relevant data missing were excluded at the level of individual analyses . 
Analyses comparing the demographic and clinical characteristics of responders and non -
responders to the ‘Goal Prior Assay Task’ are reported in Supplementary Material 1.

Behavioural 
Behavioural analyses were conducted with custom scripts using R (v4.3.1) with RStudio 
(2023). Our primary hypothesis is that individuals with bvFTD and PSP are (a) more apathetic 
and (b) have more imprecise priors relative to healthy controls. This was analysed using two 
Bayesian pseudo-t-tests, comparing apathy scores and prior precision between patients and 
controls. Apathy was measured using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES; Self and Carer)54 and 
the motivation subscale of the Cambridge Questionnaire for Apathy and Impulsivity Traits 
(CamQUAIT-M)55. Prior precision in this task was operationalised as the best -fit regression 
slope between performance and estimation error on the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ task . Performance 
error was the difference between the target and final ball position, whereas estimation error 
was the difference between the estimate and final ball position. Participants with greater prior 
precision should be biased towards the location of the target (i.e. their action outcome prior), 
meaning a negative association between performance and estimation error. The gradient of the 
regression slope can therefore be used as a proxy of prior precision.  
We also hypothesised that (a) individuals with FTLD-associated conditions on zolpidem would 
have more precise priors than those on placebo, but (b) this would not be the case for healthy 
controls. Given the established GABA deficits in FTLD 56, we hypothesise that zolpidem may 
succeed in increasing GABA levels and improv e prior precision through augmenting cortical 
gain on the prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons. However, as healthy controls have normal 
GABA levels, we hypothesised that zolpidem may lead to over-dosing of GABA resulting in 
no improvement, and potentially worsening of, prior precision. We  tested these hypotheses 
using Bayesian pseudo t -tests. We analyse the significance of drug -group interaction by 
comparing evidence for linear regression models with and without an interaction term. 
Our co-primary hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation between prior precision and 
apathy. This is a replication of previous work by Hezemans et al. (2020), implemented in a 
new diagnostic group and assessed using a Bayesian correlation.  
 
Dynamic causal Modelling 
We implemented dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of cross spectral densities to analyse 
resting-state data of participants in MEG. DCM is a generative modelling procedure designed 
to characterise the synaptic connectivity of neuronal networks using neural mass models and

Bayesian modelling procedures (i.e., Variational Laplace)57–59. DCM operates by identifying a 
biologically-plausible neuronal model which is inverted and fitted to the dataset by varying key 
parameters, such as intrinsic connectivity between neuronal populations within a cortical 
source, and extrinsic connectivity between  sources. We predicted a reduction in gain of the 
superficial pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and a reduction in the top-down extrinsic 
connectivity needed for integration of prior beliefs with sensory evidence.  
Based on prior literature60 and previous modelling of the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ task in scanner 9 
we selected three sources of interest in our model: right inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) 
[56; 26; -12], left premotor cortex [-14; 16; 58], and left motor cortex [-37; -25; 64].  
We investigated the role of diagnostic group, drug condition and prior precision in modulating 
estimates of connectivity within and between these three  sources using Parametric Empirical 
Bayes (PEB)61.  
Results  
To ensure effective estimates of prior precision, participants were included in analysis if they 
completed two or more of the four testing blocks (with catch trials > 20). This led to the 
inclusion of 20 controls and 17 patients in the placebo condition, and 19 controls and 21 
patients in the zolpidem condition. Differences in demographics and clinical scores between 
patient responders and non -responders is available in Supplementary Material 1. 19 controls 
and 15 patients had complete data from both visits. There were no une xpected adverse 
reactions.  
Demographics of the participants with complete data from one or both sessions is available in 
Table 1. There was no evidence of a difference in age between controls and patients ( B=0.36, 
p=0.53), though there was strong evidence for a difference in years of education ( B=29.3, 
p<0.01) with patients having less education than controls. There was also very strong evidence 
of a difference in ACE -R and CBI -R between controls and patients, with patients being 
significantly more impaired (B>100, p<0.001).

There was very strong evidence of a difference in apathy scores between controls and patients 
for the AES -Self (B>1000, p<0.001, d=1.64 ), AES-Carer (B>1000, p<0.001, d=2.42 ) and 
motivation subscale of the CamQUAIT (B>1000, p<0.001, d=2.26) such that patients scored 
significantly higher than controls.  
The median prior precision in controls was 0.49 in the placebo condition and 0.53 in the drug 
condition. The median prior precision in patients was 0.12 in the placebo condition and 0.32 in 
the drug condition (see figure 2). There was no evidence for a difference in prior precision 
between patients with a diagnosis of bvFTD or PSP (B=0.45, p=0.64, d=0.21), and so groups 
remained combined for subsequent principal analyses.

The critical result is that there was evidence for an improvement in prior precision in the patient 
group when on zolpidem vs placebo (B=3.09, p=0.04, d=0.48), and evidence for no difference 
in prior precision between placebo and drug condition in controls ( B=0.25, p=0.86, d=0.07). 
There was strong evidence for a difference between controls and patients in the placebo 
condition (B=20.4, p<0.01, d=1.12) such that controls had higher levels of prior precision than 
patients, but no evidence for or against a difference between controls and patients in the drug 
condition ( B=0.86, p=0.11, d =0.5). There was no evidence for or against an interaction 
between group and condition (B=1.31). 
The second most important result was that across all participants (patients and controls), there 
was very strong evidence for a correlation between prior precision and apathy as assessed by 
AES-Self (r=-0.46, B>100, p<0.001), as well as moderate evidence for a correlation between 
prior precision and AES -Carer ( r=-0.33, B=5.82, p=0.01 ) and CamQUAIT -M ( r=-0.29, 
B=3.07, p=0.02; see figure 3). When separating by diagnostic groups, there remained moderate 
evidence for a positive correlation between prior precision and the AES -Self in controls ( r=-
0.37, B=3.44, p=0.02), but no evidence for or against a correlation when using the AES-Carer

evidence for or against a correlation between prior precision and apathy in patients (AES-Self:

When collapsing across group and condition, there was no evidence for or against a correlation 
between age or education and prior precision (Age: r=-0.16, B=0.6, p=0.18, Education: r=-
0.24, B=2.1, p=0.03). With separate groups, there was no evidence for or against a correlation 
between prior precision and age or education in patients (Age: r=-0.15, B=0.52, p=0.36 , 
Education: r=0.008, B=0.36, p=0.96) or controls (Age: r=-0.09, B=0.42, p=0.58, Education: 
r=0.2, B=0.65, p=0.23). Partial correlations were run to explore the impact of including age 
and education on the relationship between apathy and prior precision but there were no 
significant effects. There was no evidence for a correlation between the AES -Self and AES-
Carer in either controls (r=0.16, B=0.54, p=0.4) or patients (r=0.17, B=0.58, p=0.47). There 
was very strong evidence for a correlation between the AES-Carer and CamQUAIT-M in both 
groups (r=0.93, B>1000, p<0.001 for both groups). 
Dynamic Causal Modelling 
We compared extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity between controls and individuals with FTLD-
associated disorders  in both drug and placebo conditions (see figure 4 ). In the placebo 
condition, there was strong evidence of a reduction in extrinsic connectivity between the

premotor and prefrontal cortex in patients compared to controls. In the drug condition, there 
was evidence that the reciprocal connection from the prefrontal to premotor cortex was 
increased in individuals with FTLD. In both conditions forward connectivity from the motor 
to premotor and prefrontal cortex was increased in FTLD versus controls while backward 
connectivity from the motor to premotor and prefrontal cortex was reduced. 
Regarding the difference in gain on the prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons, there was 
strong evidence that gain was reduced in patients compared to controls in the placebo condition 
but not in the zolpidem condition. Gain on the superficial pyramidal neurons in the premotor 
and motor cortex was reduced in patients compared to controls in the placebo condition but 
was not different from controls in the zolpidem condition. 
The second model compared drug conditions for controls and patients. There was no evidence 
of a difference in extrinsic connectivity between drug conditions for controls, but strong 
evidence of an increase in the connectivity from the premotor to prefronta l cortex in patients 
on zolpidem compared to placebo (Pp>0.99). In controls, t here was strong evidence for a 
decrease in gain on the superficial pyramidal neurons following GABAergic modulation using

zolpidem across all three brain regions. However, there was evidence of an increase in gain in 
the prefrontal cortex in individuals with FTLD-associated disorders. 
Models using only parameters reflecting GABA time constants had higher model evidence than 
those incorporating only AMPA or NMDA time constants when explaining the difference 
between conditions in both patients ( ∇AMPA=466.09, ∇NMDA=378.89) and controls 
(∇AMPA=197.15, ∇NMDA=160.16; see figure 5). However, GABA time constants were not 
sensitive to drug effects.  
 
The third set of (PEB) models incorporated individuals’ prior precision as an empirical prior. 
In the placebo condition, lower prior precision in those with FTLD-associated conditions was 
associated with higher reciprocal connectivity between the prefrontal and premotor cortex, 
however this association altered in the drug condition such that lower prior precision was 
associated with lower reciprocal connectivity between these regions ( see figure 6A). In the 
placebo condition, lower prior precision was also associated with higher levels of gain on the 
prefrontal and premotor superficial pyramidal neurons whereas in the drug condition lower 
levels of prior precision were associated only w ith lower gain on the prefrontal superficial 
pyramidal neurons (see figure 6B).

Discussion  
There are three key insights from this study. First, we confirm the role of prior precision as a 
mechanistic explanation for apathy in two disorders associated with frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration. Second, we show that prior precision can be partially restored with the GABAA 
agonist zolpidem in people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Third,  dynamic causal 
modelling of magnetoencephalography confirmed  that the effect of zolpidem may be in part 
due to changing the postsynaptic gain of prefrontal superficial pyramidal ne urons, and 
subsequent restoration of connectivity in the prefrontal -premotor network. This work 
highlights the potential for treating apathy by GABAergic restoration in disorders associated 
with GABA deficits. 
As expected, people with bvFTD and PSP differed from controls in apathy on all three 
qualitative measures (AES-Self, AES-Carer & CamQUAIT-M); and had lower levels of prior 
precision on the task in the placebo condition. This group differ ence was abolished on 
zolpidem, primarily driven by an increase in prior precision in patients but not controls . We

also confirmed a correlation between apathy and prior precision. The study was underpowered 
to test this correlation in the patient group alone (i.e. data lacked sufficient precision for 
Bayesian inference), though trends were in the expected direction and of similar magnitude in 
both controls and people with FTLD-associated disorders. 
Dynamic causal modelling of neurophysiological observations supported novel mechanistic 
insights. The reciprocal connectivity between the prefrontal and premotor cortex, and gain on 
the prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons, are particularly relevant correlates of apathy and 
markers of the zolpidem drug effect. Patients had stronger forward connectivity than controls, 
but weaker backward connectivity from prefrontal cortex. This suggests that behavioural 
decisions may be  dominated by  ascending sensory in put without the appropriate top -down 
modulation according to goals and context62.  
Of particular relevance, the connectivity between the prefrontal and premotor cortex was 
reduced in patients in the placebo condition but partially restored on zolpidem. In the placebo 
condition, gain on the superficial pyramidal population was also reduced across all three 
regions in individuals with FTLD compared to controls. However, this was partially restored 
on zolpidem, such that prefrontal gain was higher than average in the drug condition. This may 
be partially driven by a reduction in gain across all three sources in controls on zolpidem, 
consistent with baseline -dependency by which drug effects are subject to an individual’s 
baseline. 
The dynamic causal modelling of MEG resting -state data also confirmed the associations 
between prior precision (as the index of apathy) and network connec tivity both on and off  a 
GABAergic agonist. In patients on placebo, prior precision was negatively associated with 
reciprocal connectivity between the prefrontal and premotor regions, but the direction of this 
relationship reversed in the drug condition such that higher levels of prio r precision were 
associated with higher levels of connectivity. Similarly , there was a negative association 
between prior precision and gain on the superficial pyramidal neurons in both the prefrontal 
and premotor cortex when on placebo, but this relationship changed on drug such that higher 
prior precision was associated with higher prefrontal gain. This mirrors healthy elderly controls 
who demonstrated a similar association between prior precision and prefrontal gain9. Together, 
these results suggest that prior precision may be  mediated by gain on superficial pyramidal 
neurons, which tunes effective communication across the prefrontal-premotor-motor hierarchy, 
subject to optimal GABAergic innervation.

There are several limitations to the current study. Firstly, despite the use of Bayesian statistics 
confirming sufficient precision (c.f. power) in the majority of our analyses, we were unable to 
draw inferences either way for some comparisons (1/3 < B <3 indicating insufficient precision 
in the data, analogous to lack of power for frequentist tests). Variants of the ‘Goal Prior Assay’ 
may improve power in future studies, to quantify the precision of priors on action outcomes ; 
for example, with additional trials or task simplification to encourage meaningful engagement. 
Incorporating measures which are not reliant on verbal or manual self -report63 (e.g. eye 
tracking) could be an advantage, given the challenges to the interpretation of self -report 
measures for people with frontotemporal dementia 63. In addition, the imaging analysis here 
compares out-of-scanner task performance to in -scanner neurophysiology, albeit on the same 
study visit. Though we are able to quantify network dynamics and its causes from baseline 
resting-state analysis, task-based imaging may be used in future studies to further quantify the 
neural mechanisms at play.   There are further limitations relating to the use of zolpidem. 
Though GABA-A receptors are reduced in individuals with PSP37, the evidence is limited and 
GABAergic deficits in FTLD may be more widespread than can be targeted with zolpidem 
alone. Moreover, zolpidem acts across the brain, whereas GABAergic deficits are relatively 
localised in FTLD38. This may lead to overdosing of GABA-replete brain regions, resulting in 
side-effects. Therefore, though this study suggests that GABA agonism may be an effective 
mechanism to improve prior precision, further research is needed to identify net clinical benefit 
and examine more selective interventions. Finally, results in people with FTLD may have 
selection bias (including acceptance bias and completion bias), with more capable individuals 
completing both the task and resting-state scan. The patient group in the current study therefore 
represents only a subgroup of the wider patient community, and one with limited diversity.  
Future research directions include the extension to other conditions in w hich apathy is highly 
prevalent, such as  Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease 64,65, depression and 
schizophrenia66,67. It remains to be shown whether prior precision contributes to apathy across 
all these conditions (noting that it does so in Parkinson’s disease 29). It is possible that apathy -
associated diseases vary in the functional anatomical changes underlying apathy, or the 
differential contributions of prior precision, effort avoidance and reward sensitivity 68,69. 
Exploiting the effect of GABAergic interventions on apathy into clinical trials would also be 
an important next step, given that the current study was exempted from clinical trials status (in 
terms of the regulatory framework for clinical trials of interventional medicinal products) as 
we did not investigate the impact of zolpidem on clinical endpoints. Baseline dependency also

remains to be tested as a treatment -decision criterion, implementing a precision medicine 
approach to treat according to an individual’s GABAergic deficit rather than clinical diagnostic 
group assignment.  
In conclusion, we show that apathy in two disorders associated with fro ntotemporal lobar 
degeneration is underpinned by the loss of prior precision on action outcomes and a subsequent 
failure of active inference. This loss of precision is accompanied by a reduction in gain on the 
prefrontal superficial pyramidal neurons and subsequent  functional disconnections across the 
prefrontal-motor decision-making hierarchy. The GABAA-agonist zolpidem partially restored 
prior precision, and frontal network connectivity, opening potential new approaches to treat 
apathy.
