Abstract 16 
The fact that we cannot tickle ourselves is traditionally explained by the attenuation of 17 
somatosensation by predictions from a forward model of self -generated movements. 18 
Alternatively, it has been suggested within the framework of active inference that Bayes-19 
optimal reduction of sensory precision can explain this phenomenon. Combining a pain 20 
paradigm with stimulus -related expectations allows to compare both models through 21 
predictions from the Bayesian account of expectation -based hypoalgesia, where pain is 22 
influenced by the precisions of somatosensation and expectation. In two experiments, 23 
heat pain was sham-treated either externally or by the subject, while a cue created higher 24 
or lower treatment expectations. Both experiments revealed greater pain relief under 25 
self-treatment and high treatment expectations. Electroencephalography revealed a 26 
modulation of theta -to-beta frequencies linked to agency and top -down modulations of 27 
pain perception. Computational modeling showed that this is better explained by an 28 
attenuation of somatosensation than a downregulation of somatosensation precision, 29 
favoring the forward model. 30 
Introduction 31 
Charles Darwin observed that “from t he fact that a child can hardly tickle itself, or in a 32 
much less degree than when tickled by another person, it seems that the precise point to 33 
be touched must not be known” 1. The phenomenon that s elf-generated touch feels less 34 
intense – and less ticklish – than identical externally generated touch  has been 35 
reproduced repeatedly 2–5. In the classical formulation of the forward model 6, t his 36 
somatosensory attenuation is explained by  continuously generated predictions of the 37 
sensory consequences of a motor command and th ese accurate predictions are used to 38 
attenuate the sensory consequences of self -produced movement.  Under this model, 39

smaller prediction errors during self -generated movement lead to a percep t of a less 40 
intense sensation, relative to externally generated unpredicted outcomes. 41 
An alternative explanation of sensory attenuation has been proposed in the framework of 42 
active inference 7. In act ive inference8,9, the brain consistently attempts to reduce 43 
prediction errors of its generative model of the world. It is proposed that prediction errors 44 
can be minimized in one of two ways. As a first option, we can minimize prediction errors 45 
by changing predictions to explain sensory input (i.e. we update our model in a way that 46 
explains the world better). Alternatively, we can minimize prediction errors by 47 
performing an action (i.e. we act in a way that the world fulfills our predictions). In order 48 
to act, a contradiction has to be resolved: Self -generated actions (which are 49 
proprioceptive predictions to move) must overcome sensory information of the current 50 
state of the world – namely, the se nsory information that we are currently not moving. 51 
Proprioceptive predictions to move would therefore be inhibited by prediction errors 52 
elicited by sensory information that one is currently not moving. This contradiction can 53 
be resolved by lowering the pr ecision of sensory evidence to the consequences of one's 54 
own actions7. 55 
To disentangle predictions derived from active inference from the classical forward 56 
model, the paradigm of expectation-based hypoalgesia can be helpful . Placebo  57 
hypoalgesia is seen as an expectancy-driven phenomenon, which describes a  pain relief 58 
mediated by prior experiences, in the absence of active treatment 10–14. It has been 59 
proposed that pain perception can be seen as  a Bayesian problem requiring the 60 
integration of expectations with stimulus intensity15–18. Expectations are integrated with 61 
incoming nociceptive  stimulus information, and both are weighted by their respective 62 
precision to form a pain percept .  This has been shown by manipulation of the level of 63

precision of prior treatment expectations, where expectation-based effects were more 64 
pronounced with more precise treatment expectations19.  65 
Similar to an application in visual perception20, less precise information about the current 66 
stimulation would lead to a relatively higher influence of prior expectation, while more 67 
precise stimulus information would lead to less influence of prior expectation on 68 
perception. Importantly, it is possible to design a placebo hypoalgesia paradigm in which 69 
sensory evidence (i.e. enhanced or reduced treatment efficacy) is either self-generated or 70 
externally generated. The active inference framework predicts that self-treatment would 71 
lead to a reduced precision of somatosensation and consequently to a lower weight of 72 
somatosensation; therefore, positive and negative expectations would have a relatively 73 
large impact on pain intensity in the respective direction. In contrast, the forward model 74 
predicts that self -treatment should always lead to a decrease in perceived intensity ; 75 
therefore, self -treatment would always be associated with a lower pain percept , 76 
compared to external treatment, regardless of whether a positive or negative expectation 77 
existed.  78 
It has been shown that pain perception is modulated by agency on a neurophysiological 79 
and behavioral level21–35. This beneficial effect is utilized in Patient-Controlled Analgesia 80 
(PCA) commonly used in post -operative care  – patients receiving PCA  experience less 81 
pain as compared to patients receiving traditional (i.e. externally applied) analgesia36,37.  82 
In two experiments, we manipulated both expectations and agency. We established the 83 
illusion that heat pain could be treated through two variants of (putative) TENS 84 
(Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation) associated with either a highly effective or 85 
less effective  treatment effect. In reality , treatment was implemented by reducing the 86 
temperature of the heat stimulator.  This supposed treatment was either actively started 87

by the participant  (self-treatment) or by the experimenter (external treatment, actually 88 
administered by computer ). In an initial stage , participants were conditioned to expect 89 
different treatment outcomes by an actual ly stronger reduction of the painful heat 90 
stimulation, as predicted by a visual cue indicating highly effective treatment. During the 91 
test stage following the conditioning , treatment was identical , irrespective of the cue 92 
indicating either highly effective or less effective treatment (i.e. heat was reduced to the 93 
same level in both conditions). In this fashion, we combined placebo (expectation is better 94 
than the test stimulus) and nocebo (expectation is worse than the test stimulus) 95 
expectation effects in pain treatment, creating bidirectional modulations of pa in by 96 
placebo/nocebo expectations. 97 
Derived from the Bayesian model of expectation-based hypoalgesia (see Fig. 1), we 98 
hypothesized that if the forward model applied, self -treatment would result in overall 99 
lower pain ratings, i.e. regardless of prior expectations. In contrast, if the active inference 100 
model applied, less precision of self -generated sensory consequences would enhance 101 
expectation eff ects (i.e. placebo/nocebo effects); this would manifest in pain ratings 102 
influenced more strongly by expectations in self -treatment test trials.  See Fig. 1d for 103 
statistical hypotheses based on the forward model; see Fig. 1e for statistical hypot heses 104 
based on active inference.  105 
In placebo test conditions, the forward model would predict a better treatment outcome 106 
due to sensory attenuation leading to lower sensed stimulus intensity in self-treatment 107 
(as compared to external treatment) . The active inference model would also predict a 108 
stronger influence by expectations , but due to sensory attenuation leading to lower 109 
stimulus precision. Thus, in placebo conditions, both models predict an improvement of 110 
treatment outcome by self -treatment as compared to external  treatment. In nocebo 111

conditions (i.e. a worse outcome is expected than the actual outcome) on the other hand, 112 
the forward model would also suggest an improved treatment outcome in self-treatment, 113 
due to lower sensed stimulus intensity. In contrast, crucially, active inference would 114 
predict a stronger influence of nocebo expectations due to a lower stimulus precision in 115 
self-treatment and thus, relatively weak er treatment success in self -treatment as 116 
compared to external treatment. This can also be translated to formal models of Bayesian 117 
integration (Fig. 1a) in pain perception incorporating the forward model  (Fig. 1b) and 118 
active inference  (Fig. 1c), respectively. With these models, we  performed a formal 119 
Bayesian model selection (see Fig. 1 for an overview of the candidate models and model 120 
predictions). 121 
The first experiment (N = 25) used continuous pain ratings to establish a precise readout 122 
of pain perception during painful heat stimulation and after treatment, while the second 123 
experiment ( N = 54) additionally employed electroencephalography (EEG) to further 124 
evaluate neurophysiological correlates of the top-down modulation via expectations and 125 
agency. In both experiments, we applied heat pain to capsaicin-sensitized skin on the left 126 
radial forearm, after individual calibrat ion to create comparable pain levels for each 127 
participant. To avoid a contamination of EEG data by movement artifacts through button 128 
presses by continuous pain ratings, we altered the paradigm for experiment 2 to include 129 
single outcome ratings instead of the continuous pain rating  (see Fig. 2 for a graphical 130 
overview of the trial design).  131

Figure 1.  Bayesian models of pain perception. Bayesian model comparison was used to evaluate two 133 
Bayesian pain placebo/nocebo models. (a) The core of both models is the Bayes-optimal integration of prior 134 
experiences (here centered at VAS = 10 for placebo and at VAS = 50 for nocebo) with incoming nociceptive 135 
information (i.e. likelihood) to form a percept ( i.e. posterior). Prior, likelihood and posterior we re 136 
approximated by Gaussian distributions allowing for an analytic solution of Bayesian integration (for details 137 
see supplemental methods). The sensory attenuation model (b) has a free parameter that allows to shift the 138 
likelihood mean for self-treatment trials (see Methods, Eq.2) . For example , the likelihood mean for self-139 
treatment can be shifted (blue, solid line) as compared to the mean for external treatment  (blue, dotted 140 
line). In high treatment expectation (placebo), this will lead to a shift of the posterior (dark green, solid line) 141 
to lower VAS values as compared to external (dark green, dotted line)  because of the integration of the 142 
shifted lower likelihood with the prior . Similarly, in low treatment expectation (nocebo), this will lead to a 143 
shift of the posterior (purple, solid line) to lower VAS values as compared to external  treatment (purple, 144 
dotted line). This is in contrast to the active inference model (c) which has a free parameter that can change 145 
likelihood precision (see Methods, Eq.3) . If self-treatment is linked to a lower likelihood precision (blue, 146 
solid line) as compared to external treatment (blue, dotted line)  this model should explain the data better 147 
than the forward model. As an example, this can lead to a posterior (dark green, solid line) which is more 148 
strongly drawn to the prior  (VAS10 conditioning)  in self -treatment than external treatment, due to the 149 
lower “impact” of the likelihood  (dark green, dotted line). In low treatment expectation, the posterior 150 
(purple, solid line) would be drawn more strongly to the prior (VAS50 conditioning) in self-treatment than 151 
external treatment (purple, dotted line).  Note that for actual modeling we utilized individual prior and 152 
likelihood parameters , whereas here , paramet ers are based on calibration target values for illustration 153 
purposes. The forward model (d) predicts a decrease of perceived stimulus intensity in self -treatment 154 
(green line) as compared to external treatment (purple line), meaning a higher treatment succe ss in self -155 
treatment trials as compared to external treatment trials. In active inference (e), self-treatment is associated 156 
with a decrease in precision, and thus a larger influence of expectations in self -treatment (green  line) as 157 
compared to external treatment (purple line). 158

design for experiment 2. Colored lines represent VAS50 conditioning (red), test trials (VAS30; green) and 160 
VAS10 conditioning (blue). The black line represents alterations in temperature common to all trial types, 161 
blue, green and red lines represent changes based on VAS10 conditi oning, VAS30 test trials and VAS50 162 
conditioning trials, respectively. At trial start, the thermal-heat stimulator (thermode), attached to the left 163 
radial forearm of the participant, is at the baseline temperature (set to 30°C for experiment 1 and to 28°C 164 
for experiment 2). A red bar indicates the start of the pain phase concurrent with an increase of thermode 165 
temperature to the individually calibrated pain level of VAS70. The start of the treatment phase is indicated 166 
by a cue showing whether self- or external treatment and whether highly or low effective treatment follows. 167 
This then leads to actual low (VAS10) or high (VAS50) temperatures during conditioning trials, respectively. 168 
In test trials, the final temperature is always  at VAS30 regardless of the cued  treatment efficacy. Arrows 169

thermode), re spectively. In experiment 1  (b), a rating scale controlled with two buttons was presented 172 
during the whole trial. At trial start (5s), an empty bar was presented alongside the rating scale (set to 0 at 173 
the beginning) and a display of rating buttons (lighti ng up in green when pressed). During the following 174 
pain phase (8-10s), the empty bar was filled red as an indication for pain. After the pain phase, the treatment 175 
cue was presented. The treatment cue showed a reduction of the red bar, where a reduction to 1/3 of the 176 
total height was associated with highly effective treatment and a reduction to 2/3 of the total height was 177 
associated with a low effective treatment. Additionally, a signal word indicated self - or external treatment. 178 
After a lag of 2 s, the treatment buttons appeared on the display, lighting up in green when pressed by the 179 
subject or externally. After the treatment button was pressed, the temperature was decreased to the 180 
respective pain level. An ITI (intertrial interval) of 18s followed. In experiment 2 (c), pain ratings scales and 181 
buttons were only presented during designated rating phases. Treatment could be started immediately 182 
after the onset of the treatment cue. Here, the timing of each trial was: trial start (4s), pain phase (8s), pain 183 
rating phase (6s), treatment phase (8s) and treatment rating phase (6s) with an ITI of 4 s.  184

these three intensities to be different, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA on the 199

intensities, including conditioning and test trials  (averaging across expectations ) which 201 
revealed a significant difference (F(2,48) = 43.78, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.646) (Fig. 4a).  202 
Post-hoc analyses using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons indicated that all 203 
three stimulus intensity levels differed significantly  from each other , revealing  higher 204 
post-treatment VAS ratings for VAS50 conditioning trials ( M = 50.35, SD = 15.78) versus 205 
VAS30 test  trials ( M = 38.98, SD = 12.86) and for VAS30 test trials versus VAS10 206 
conditioning trials (M = 24.47, SD = 11.95; all p < 0.001). 207 
As a next step, we evaluated the effects of our manipulations for the test trials, where 208 
intensity of the painful stimulus was always reduced to an individually calibrated level of 209 
VAS30. Here, post-treatment VAS  ratings could either be in fluenced by agenc y (self - 210 
versus external treatment) , expectations (low  versus high treatment expectations) , or 211 
their interaction. Considering the forward model  (see Fig. 1d), we would expect higher 212 
treatment success in self -treatment test trials as compared to external treatment test 213 
trials regardless of prior treatment expectations. In other words, we would expect a main 214 
effect of agency with or without a main effect of expe ctation, but no interaction between 215 
both factors. Conversely, for the active inference  model (see Fig. 1e), by  lowering the 216 
precision of sensory evidence, prior treatment expectations would gain a higher relative 217 
weight compared to the sensory information in self -treatment trials as compared to 218 
external treatment trials, which would manifest itself as an interaction (i.e. expectation 219 
effects should be larger in self-treatment). 220 
Here, again we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA to test for main effects of agency, 221 
expectation, and their interaction in the test conditions (VAS30). We found a significant 222 
sensory attenuation effect , that is,  a main effect of agency (F(1,24) = 6.2, p = 0.02, ηp2 = 223 
0.205), meaning that post-treatment VAS ratings were lower for self-treatment trials (M 224

= 37.99, SD = 12.57) versus external treatment trials (M = 39.98, SD = 13.45). Furthermore, 225 
we found a significant expectation effect (F(1,24) =  10.738, p = 0.003, ηp2 = 0.309), i.e. high 226 
treatment expectations were associated with  lower post-treatment VAS  ratings (M = 227 
35.00, SD = 13.66; conditioned with VAS10) than those following low treatment 228 
expectations (M = 42.97, SD = 14.77; conditioned with VAS50 ). Importantly, we did not 229 
observe a significant interaction of expectation and agency ( F(1,24) = 0.679, p = 0.42, ηp2 230 
= 0.028).  231 
For model-based analysis of our behavioral data, we created two Bayesian models of pain 232 
perception in placebo pain treatment (see Fig. 1) which were inverted and compared 233 
using variational Bayesian methods (VBA, see Methods for details). We used the Bayesian 234 
integration model of pain perception for both the active inference model and the forward 235 
model (Fig. 1a). In self -treatment test trials under the forward model, we included the 236 
parameter p shift which allowed for a shift of the likelihood and thus for a posterior 237 
distribution which was shifted into the same direction in low and high treatment  238 
expectation conditions, as predicted by the forward model (Fig. 1b). This was contrasted 239 
to the active inference model, where the poste rior distribution should be drawn to the 240 
conditioned pain experience which is explained by a decrease of the likelihood precision, 241 
and thus we included the parameter prelax which allowed for such a decrease in likelihood 242 
precision (Fig. 1c).  243 
We used a random effects (RFX) Bayesian model selection approach 38,39 to estimate the 244 
overall posterior model probability across subjects . T he RFX model exceedance 245 
probability was at φ = 0.9986 for the forward model compared to φ = 0.0014 for the active 246 
inference model . Hence, we see clear evidence for the forward model with a free 247 
parameter enabling likelihood shift over the active inference model with a free parameter 248

allowing a relaxation of likelihood variance  (see Fig. 4e). Both models  (φ > 0.999) 249 
outperformed a null model without  these free parameters  (φ < 0.001), and a more 250 
complex full model including both free parameters (φ < 0.001). See Supplementary Fig. 1 251 
for a comparison of all candidate models. See Supplementary Fig. 2 for forward model 252 
comparison with the null model and full model and Supplementary Fig. 3 for respective 253 
active inference comparisons.  254 
In summary, results using continuous pain ratings clearly demonstrate both sensory 255 
attenuation effects (i.e. self -treatment lead to better outcomes ) and expectation effects 256 
(i.e. high treatment expectations lead  to better treatment outcomes), but no interaction 257 
between expectation and agency. Model selection provides strong evidence in favor of the 258 
forward model over the active inference model (see Fig. 4 for a summary of the results). 259

Experiment 2: Behavioral results 276 
As in the first experiment, a repeated measures ANOVA with all three stimulus intensities 277 
(including conditioning and test trials) revealed a significant difference 278 
(F(2,106) = 118.32, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.691) between all three intensities  (VAS10, 30 and 279 
50) in post-treatment VAS ratin gs. Post -hoc analyses using Bonferroni correction for 280 
multiple comparisons indicated that all three stimulus intensity levels differed 281 
significantly from each other , revealing higher post-treatment VAS  ratings for VAS50 282 
conditioning trials (M = 49.66, SD = 15.46) versus VAS30 test trials (M = 38.24, SD = 17.18) 283 
and for VAS30 test trials versus VAS10 conditioning trials ( M = 31.04, SD = 17.45; all 284 
p < 0.001). 285 
For the evaluation of main effects of agency and expectation and their interaction for the 286 
test trials, we again conducted a repeated measures ANOVA. We observed a significant 287 
sensory attenuation effect (F(1,53) = 19.13, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.265), i.e. post-treatment VAS 288 
ratings were  lower for self -treatment trials ( M = 37.15, SD = 17.26) as compared to  289 
external treatment trials (M = 39.33, SD = 17.30). Also, we found a significant expectation 290 
effect (F(1,53) = 35.57, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.402), i.e. high treatment expectations (M = 34.91, 291 
SD = 17.69; conditioned with VAS10) were associ ated with lower post-treatment VAS  292 
ratings than low treatment expectations (M = 41.56, SD = 17.64; conditioned with VAS50). 293

As in the first experiment, w e did not observe a significant interaction of treatment 294 
expectation and agency (F(1,54) =  0.02, p = 0.887, ηp2 = 0.003).  295 
Again, we used a random effects (RFX) Bayesian model selection approach to estimate the 296 
overall posterior model probability across subjects for the post-treatment VAS ratings in 297 
experiment 2. For experiment 2, the RFX exceedance probability  of φ = 0.9995 for the 298 
forward model compared to  φ = 0.0005 for the active inference  model again strongly 299 
favored the forward model over the active inference model ( Fig. 5e).  Both models ( φ > 300 
0.999) outperformed a null model without these free parameters ( φ < 0.001), and a full 301 
model including both free parameters ( φ < 0.001). See Supplementary Fig. 4 for a 302 
comparison of all candidate models. See Supplementary Fig. 5 for forward model 303 
comparison with the null model and full model and Supplementary Fig. 6 for respective 304 
active inference comparisons. 305 
Taken together, in the second experiment, we replicated the rating-related results of the 306 
first experiment. Again, these results demonstrate sensory attenuation effects (i.e.  self-307 
treatment leads to better treatment outcomes) and expectation effects (i.e. high treatment 308 
expectations lead to better treatment outcomes) but no interaction between expectation 309 
and agency. Model selection provides strong evidence in favor of the forward model over 310 
the active inference model (see Fig. 5 for a summary of the results).  311

cue-locked data, we set t = 0 to the onset of the cue indicating the conditioned 341 
effectiveness of the treatment and the agency condition of the treatment phase. Outcome-342 
locked data sets t = 0 to the point when the thermode reached the calibrated treatment 343 
VAS target , and thus, takes individual variations in treatment latency  into account . All 344 
tests were corrected for multiple comparison using Monte Carlo cluster tests (see 345 
Methods for details). See Supplementary Fig. 7-9 for z-scored cue-locked time-frequency 346 
data and Supplementary Fig. 10-12 for z-scored outcome-locked time-frequency data for 347 
all conditions at Fz, Cz and Pz, respectively. 348 
Conditioning 349 
In each trial, a cue indicated an upcoming highly or low effective treatment on the 350 
ongoing VAS70 stimulus. This association was established during conditioning trials, 351 
where a cue indicating high treatment efficacy was associated with a (physical) stimulus 352 
intensity decrease to a temperature individually representing VAS10. Similarly, a cue 353 
indicating low treatment efficacy was associated with a decrease to a temperature 354 
representing VAS50.  A cluster-corrected dependent samples t-test on cue-locked data 355 
(0 to 2s after the cue, 4-181Hz) revealed no differences between VAS10 and VAS50 356 
conditioning trials immediately after cue presentation (all p > .05). However, differences 357 
were significant for outcome-locked data (in a window of -1 to 2s with t = 0 at target 358 
temperature, 4-181Hz), revealing three clusters of activity associated with different 359 
conditioning types (VAS10 versus VAS50; Fig. 6; also see Supplementary Fig. 13 for 360 
topographies of significant clusters of activity for different frequency bands and 361 
Supplementary Fig. 14 for bar graphs representing the averaged power at significant 362

temperatures were stable at the final outcome level. We found a positive cluster (p < 365 
.001) including frequencies from 7 to 75Hz in a time frame from -0.4 to 1s, indicating an 366 
increase of EEG power for VAS10 conditioning versus VAS50 conditioning. Additionally, 367 
we found two negative clusters associated with lower EEG power of VAS10 versus 368 
VAS50 conditioning. Firstly, we found a negative cluster (p = 0.01) in the theta range 369 
including frequencies from 4 to 9.5Hz in a time frame from -0.65 to 0.9s. Secondly, we 370 
found another negative cluster (p = 0.043) ranging from -1 to -0.35s including 371 
frequencies from 9.5 to 45Hz.  This demonstrates a modulation of theta (4-7Hz), alpha-372 
to-beta (8-30Hz) and low gamma (31-50Hz) frequencies by treatment efficacy via 373 
differences in stimulus intensity, i.e. more effective treatment (VAS10) was associated 374 
with lower alpha-to-beta activity during the relief phase followed by lower theta and 375 
increased alpha-to-beta power at the treatment outcome phase, as compared to less 376 
effective treatment (VAS50).  377

Agency 385 
Agency was manipulated as either participants initiated the treatment themselves, or the 386

we again considered both phases and conducted t -tests contrasting self -treatment and 388 
external treatment during test trials. Here, a cluster -corrected dependent samples t -test 389 
revealed no association between EEG time -frequency data and agency with cue -locked 390

data (0 to 2s after cue onset, 4-181Hz; all p > .05). Treatment outcome-locked data (-1 to 391 
2s at target temperature, 4-181Hz) revealed two significant clusters of activity associated 392 
with agency ( Fig. 7). Data showed a negative cluster ( p < 0.001) ranging from -1 to 1s 393 
including frequencies from 4 to 45Hz, indicating a negative association between agency 394 
and low frequency EEG power during the relief phase (-1 to 0s) and the outcome phase (0 395 
to 2s). Another positive cluster was significant ( p = .028), ranging from -0.2 to 0.65s 396 
including frequencies from 9.5 to 54Hz, indicating higher alpha-to-beta (8-30Hz) and low 397 
gamma (31-50Hz) power during the treatment outcome phase for self -treatment versus 398 
external treatment.  399 
To further evaluate the influence of between-subject differences in sensory attenuation, 400 
we conducted a Pearson’s correlation analysis based on the Bayesian parameter estimate 401 
of the  individually estimated likelihood shift parameter per subject (i.e. self -treatment 402 
benefit; see Methods for details ). Here, no significant clusters were revealed associating 403 
between-subject differences in likelihood shift (i.e . self-treatment benefits)  with EEG 404 
time-frequency data (all p > .05) in cue -locked (0 to 2s after cue onset, 4 -181Hz) and 405 
treatment outcome-locked (-1 to 2s at target temperature, 4-181Hz) data.   406

The analysis of agency revealed two clusters associated with differences between self - 407 
and external treatment. Firstly, we observed a negative cluster during the relief and 408 
treatment outcome phase including frequencies from the theta (4 -7Hz) to low gamma 409 
(31-50Hz) range. Secondly, when the target temperature was reached, data showed a n 410 
increase of alpha -to-beta and low gamma activity associated with self -treatment (as 411 
compared to external treatment). 412

Expectation 420 
As a next step, we evaluated the effects of treatment expectations. During test trials, 421 
stimulus intensity (i.e. the target temperature of the treatment)  was set to an individual 422 
value of VAS30. To evaluate the effects of different treatment expectations, we conducted 423 
a cluster-corrected dependent samples t-test on cue-locked data (0 to 2s after cue onset, 424 
4-181Hz) which revealed no differences between hig h and low treatment expectations 425 
(all p > .05). Likewise, a cluster-corrected dependent samples t-test did not reveal 426 
significant clusters associated with treatment expectations at the treatment outcome (-1 427 
to 2s at target temperature, 4-181Hz; all p > .05). 428 
To further evaluate the effects of treatment expectations, we conducted  a Pearson’s 429 
correlation on z-standardized behavioral expectation effects per subject (see Methods for 430 
details). Here, positive or negative clusters would indicate a correlative association of EEG 431 
power and the size of the expectation effects. However, no significant clusters were 432 
revealed associating between -subject expectation effects with EEG time -frequency data 433 
(all p > .05) in cue-locked (0 to 2s after cue onset, 4-181Hz) and treatment outcome-locked 434 
(-1 to 2s at target temperature, 4-181Hz) data.   435 
Interaction of agency and expectation 436 
Finally, we tested for an interaction of treatment expectation and agency. At cue -locked 437 
data (0 to 2s after cue onset, 4 -181Hz), a cluster -corrected dependent samples t -tests 438 
revealed a significant association of EEG power and the interaction term (p = .038; Fig. 8) 439 
ranging from 0 to 1.6s  after cue onset and including frequencies from 4 to 13.5Hz . Here, 440 
we also conducted post-hoc t-tests, which revealed a crossed interaction  (all p < .05, see 441

interaction). Treatment outcome-locked data did not reveal any cluster associated with 443 
an interaction of treatment expectation and agency (all p > .05). 444 
The analysis of the interaction term revealed differential integration of treatment 445

starting shortly after the presentation of the cue (see Fig. 8 for a summary of the results).  447

Discussion 456 
In the present study, we demonstrated greater pain relief of self -treatment and high 457 
treatment expectations but no modulation of self -treatment benefits by expectations . 458 
Bayesian model selection provided strong evidence for the forward model  (decrease of 459 
perceived intensity of sensory consequences of self-generated outcomes) over the active 460 
inference model  (decrease of precision of sensory consequences of  self-generated 461 
outcomes). These effects also manifested in EEG data:  Stimulus intensity and agency 462 
modulated low frequency oscillatory responses in the theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-12Hz), beta 463 
(13-30Hz) and low gamma (31 -50Hz) ranges at the treatment outcome. Cue -related 464 
theta-to-alpha (4-12Hz) activity was differentially modulated by agency and expectation  465 
(representing a crossed interaction of agency and expectation).  466 
We took great care to match both conditions  (self- versus external treatment)  with 467 
respect to cognitive and motor demands  and adjusted the trials for visual, cognitive, and 468 
motor components. During both self -treatment and external treatment, a single button 469 
press was made by the subject - either to start the treatment or to acknowledge the 470 
(supposed) experimenter's treatment. In addition, the correspondingly pressed butt ons 471 
lit up on the screen, i.e. in both conditions two buttons changed to green, as in external 472 
treatment, self-treatment was “acknowledged” by the experimenter.  473 
Concerning the role of agency, w e expected an increased treatment efficacy 27,35. Indeed, 474 
data from both experiments support this hypothesis: self-treatment was associated with 475 
lower post-treatment VAS ratings as compared to external treatment , despite identical 476 
objective stimulus intensity . Based on previous studies , we also expected that pain 477 
perception is modulated by expectation 40–45. Both experiments support this hypothesis 478

and show ed a graded effect of expectation , i.e. high treatment  expectations were 479 
associated with a higher treatment success than low treatment expectations.  480 
Crucially, our experiment was designed to investigate the mechanism underlying 481 
improved treatment efficacy when treatment was self -initiated. The forward model 6 482 
posits that small prediction errors during self-generated movement lead to a percept of a 483 
less intense sensation, relative to externally generated unpredicted outcomes; applied to 484 
our pain protocol, this suggests an improvement in treatment outcome by self-treatment 485 
(see Fig. 1d). In contrast, the active inference model suggests that a decrease in precision 486 
of sensory consequences underlies the sensory attenuation phenomenon 7. In a Bayesian 487 
sense, pain perception can be seen as the integration of expectation (prior) and 488 
nociceptive input (likelihood), with the precision of each term determining the amount of 489 
its contribution. Thus, as a consequence of the reduced nociceptive (likelihood) precision 490 
in the active inference model during our experiment, the effect of expectation should 491 
increase, as its precision remains constant. Consequently, we expe cted that the relative 492 
influence of prior expectations would be increased relative to the sensory evidence, which 493 
would be attenuated in precision . Therefore, self -treatment should lead to a greater 494 
influence of treatment expectation relative to external t reatment16. From a statistical 495 
perspective, this would manifest as an interaction between agency and expectation, i.e. 496 
larger differences between low and high treatment expectations in self -treatment as 497 
compared to external treatment (see Fig. 1e). 498 
Our data show clear effects of sensory attenuation and treatment expecta tions in two 499 
experiments with differ ent pain rating modalities. At the same time, however, our data 500 
gives no indication of a significant interaction between sensory attenuation and treatment 501 
expectation effects, clearly favoring the forward model of perception  for self -initiated 502

pain treatment . This is corroborated by Bayesian model comparison , which strongly 503 
favored the forward model over the active inference model. 504 
The Bayesian model representing the forward model included a free parameter (p shift) 505 
able to shift the mean of the likelihood distribution. One might argue that the likelihood, 506 
representing nociception , is a pure sensory signal which should be immune to any 507 
contextual modulation. However, given that the active inference model explicitly varies a 508 
term of the likelihood (i.e. precision), we decided to formulate the forward model  in 509 
analogy, by also varying a likelihood component (i.e. mean). However, it should be noted 510 
that the forward model can be implemented in an alternative manner, namely using a free 511 
parameter that c an vary the mean of the prior distributions instead of the mean of the 512 
likelihood.  513 
To unravel neural mechanisms associated with top -down mechanisms of expectations 514 
and agency, EEG was measured during the second experiment.  Here, we focused our 515 
analysis on two phases. Firstly, we investigated EEG power shortly after cue presentation, 516 
and secondly, we explored a time frame including the pain relief phase and the outcome 517 
phase, i.e. 1s before the target outcome temperature was reached by the thermode and 2s 518

Our analysis revealed a clear difference between VAS10 and VAS50 conditioning trials at 520 
the treatment outcome. Relative to the VAS50 condition, higher treatment success  521 
(VAS10) was associated with decreased alpha-to-beta (8-30Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) activity 522 
during the relief phase, while the outcome phase was associated with increased alpha-to-523 
beta and decreased theta  activity for VAS10 as compared to VAS50 trials. Interestingly, 524 
the same pattern emerged for self - versus external treatment trials, suggesting a similar 525 
mechanism for the sensory attenuation effect. Even though behavioral ratings indicated a 526

comparable influence of treatment expectations, we did not find expectation s associated 527 
with alterations of EEG activity at the treatment outcome. Instead, theta and  alpha 528 
oscillations at the cue onset were differentially representing agency and expectations.  529 
Oscillatory EEG responses after treatment do not represent a reliable correlate of pain – 530 
if this was the case, one would expect shared oscillatory mechanisms of all three pain 531 
suppressing behavioral effects (i.e. sensory attenuation, expectation and stimulus 532 
intensity). If there was a cortical oscillatory “pain matrix” 46–48, both expectations and 533 
agency, which evidently modulate pain perception , should also modulate outcome -534 
associated EEG responses. Here, we found modulations by stimulus intensity and agency, 535 
but not by expectations in outcome-locked EEG data. This is in line with previous studies 536 
which revealed cue -related expectation effects in the alpha -to-beta band before painful 537 
stimulation44,45, but not during painful stimulation.  In another study, pain-induced alpha 538 
and gamma responses were significantly  influenced by stimulus intensity but not by 539 
placebo hypoalgesia49. However, it has been demonstrated that expectation -based pain 540 
modulation can influence event-related pain potentials43,49–52. 541 
Interestingly, oscillatory activity induced by agency (representing the sensory 542 
attenuation phenomenon ) was comparable to differences in oscillatory patterns by 543 
different stimulus intensities (VAS10  versus VAS50) in conditioning trials, i.e. th e same 544 
pattern emerged in different sets of trials. Here, sensory attenuation shares mechanisms 545 
with stimulus intensity processing , whereas expectation effects were not evident at the 546 
treatment outcome, but only after cue onset, which we attribute to cue-related processes. 547 
Following this line of thought, sensory attenuation might be directly related to alterations 548 
of oscillatory activity at pain -encoding areas associated with sensory processing. 549

Expectation effects, on the other hand, might be encoded in oscillatory processes of brain 550 
areas typically associated with contextual influences of top-down processing.  551 
In conclusion, pain treatment is additively enhanced by agency and positive expectations. 552 
Sensory attenuation and objectively different stimulus intensities both modify oscillatory 553 
activity at the relief and outcome phase of pain treatment, whereas expectation effects 554 
were associated with EEG activity directly following the cue. Using Bayesian model 555 
comparisons our data revealed no evidence for a decr ease of precision in self-treatment, 556 
thus favoring a forward model as the mechanism underlying the positive effect of self -557 
treatment.  558 
Methods 559 
We conducted two experiments in which positive and negative treatment expectations as 560 
well as self - and external treatment were combined. I n experiment 1, subjects were 561 
continuously rating their pain experience during painful stimulation and after  self- or 562 
external treatment of pain. In experiment 2 with EEG recordings, we restricted th e 563 
paradigm to include only two rating phases instead of a continuous rating  to avoid 564 
excessive movement . Experiment 2 was preregistered at the German Clinical Trial 565 
Register (ID: DRKS00025541).  566 
Subjects  567 
In experiment 1, 29 healthy participants  were enrolled. All participants gave informed 568 
consent and were paid as compensation for their participation. Applicants were excluded 569 
if one of the following exclusion criteria applied: neurological, psychiatric, dermatological 570 
diseases, pain conditions, current medica tion, or substance abuse. All volunteers gave 571 
their informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Board of the Hamburg 572

Medical Association. Four participants had to be excluded due to adverse reactions to the 573 
capsaicin cream, leaving a final sampl e of 2 5 participants (mean age 29.3, range 19–61 574 
years, sex: 14 female / 11 male).  575 
The required sample size of experiment 2 was determined according to a power 576 
calculation (G*Power V 3.1.9.4) based on the behavioral sensory attenuation and 577 
expectation effects in experiment 1. For the sensory attenuation effect, we observed an 578 
effect size of Cohen’s f = 0.508 (ηp2 = 0.205) and an effect size of f = 0.669 (ηp2 = 0.309) for 579 
the expectation effect. Using a power of (1 -beta) of 0. 8 and an alpha level of 0.05  and 580 
assuming low correlations (0.2) among repeated measures , this leads to a required 581 
sample size of 15, taking into account  the weaker agency effect. However, given the 582 
different rating in the second experiment we increased the planned number of 583 
participants to 60 . Assuming the same proportion of excluded participants as in 584 
experiment 1, this allowed us to potentially detect a medium effect size of f = 0.2553 with 585 
a sample size of 53.  586 
We enrolled 60 healthy participants in experiment 2. Five participants had to be excluded 587 
due to adverse reactions to the capsaicin cream and 1 participant had to be excluded due 588 
to technical errors during recording, leaving a final sample size of 54  (mean 28.2, range 589 
20–60 years, sex: 34 female / 20 male).  590 
Thermal stimulation and capsaicin application 591 
Both experiments started with the same preparation procedure with the application of a 592 
capsaicin cream (ABC Heat Cream, Beiersdorf AG, 750µg capsaicin/g) to the left radial 593 
forearm. Two skin patches of the size of the thermal stimulator probe were covered with 594 
the capsaicin cream for a total of 15 minutes. Thermal stimulation was performed using a 595

30 × 30 mm 2 Peltier thermode (Pathway model ATS, Medoc). The baseline temperature 596 
was set to 30°C for experiment 1 and the rise rate was set at 8°C/s for both experiments. 597 
The baseline temperature for experiment 2  was set at a lower temperature of 28°C to 598 
minimize skin irritation  and attrition.  After 2 blocks (experiment 1 ) or after the first 599 
experimental block (experiment 2), the capsaicin cream was reapplied for 5 minutes, and 600 
the stimulated skin patch was changed to avoid sensitization. In a first step, a single 601 
thermal stimulation with a slowly increasing ramp was used to familiarize the participant 602 
with the thermal stimul ation. To test if the capsaicin cream was effectively reducing the 603 
pain threshold participants were asked to report the moment they felt a sensation of pain. 604 
If participants reported pain only above 46°C, the cream was reapplied for another 5 605 
minutes on th e skin patch  (this applied to 2 participants in experiment 1  and to  4 606 
participants in experiment 2). 607 
TENS illusion as a treatment situation  608 
Afterwards, TENS (Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation) was established as a cover 609 
story for the treatment situation. TENS was presented as a nerve stimulation to effectively 610 
reduce pain by modulation of the nerve transmission. Putative TENS has been used to 611 
reliably generate treatment expectations in pain paradigms19,54–56. We provided 612 
volunteers with a deceptive “sham brochure” explaining that different stimulation 613 
frequencies result in different treatment efficacies. An electrode was attached to the 614 
elbow which was connected to an electrical current stimulator (Digitime r Ltd., model 615 
DS7A). Participants were told that the electrical current stimulator  needed to be 616 
individually calibrated. For this, we applied short trains of electrical currents with 617 
increasing intensity and asked the participant to report if there was a sensation; this was 618 
intended to establish the belief that the device is actually active and capable of producing 619

said currents. Afterwards and without knowledge of the participant, the electrical current 620 
stimulator was turned off and the participants were told that the settings for optimal 621 
stimulation were found. During the experiment, no actual electrical stimulation was 622 
applied. Additionally and to reinforce the TENS cover story , participants were asked to 623 
report if they felt a stimulation during the experiment and they were told that if this was 624 
the case, the stimulator needed to be recalibrated.  625 
Pain calibration 626 
We individually calibrated the heat stimulation using an adaptive procedure to the levels 627 
of 10, 30, 50 and 70 on  a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from -100 to 100 where a VAS of 0 628 
represented the pain threshold. The VAS was presented on a computer screen and ratings 629 
were given using the cursor keys on a conventional  keyboard. At first, participants were 630 
stimulated with 34°C, 34.5°C, 35°C and 35.5°C and were asked to report if any of these 631 
stimuli were painful. Note that temperatures required to generate pain on capsaicin 632 
sensitized skin are in this temperature range.  If the participant reported that the 633 
stimulation was painful, the procedure was continued with a starting temperature of 634 
35°C, otherwise the starting temperature was set to 36°C for a stepwise procedure to find 635 
the pain threshold. Stimulus duration was se t to 8s, according to the duration of VAS 70 636 
pain during the experiment. For the stepwise stimulus determination , 8 stimuli were 637 
presented with fixed reductions and increases in temperature relative to the pain 638 
threshold and participants were asked to rate the stimuli on a scale which was labeled as 639 
“normal sensation” at VAS -100, “minimally painful” at VAS 0 and “extremely painful” at 640 
VAS 100. Individual VAS levels of 10, 30, 50 and 70 w ere estimated using a linear 641 
regression of the VAS ratings recorded during this calibration phase. See Supplementary 642 
Information for calibration data. 643

Trial design and block structure: experiment 1 644 
Each trial was structured in 3 phases: Trial start, pain phase and treatment phase (see Fig. 645 
2b). At trial start, an empty bar was presented in the center of the screen. The thermode 646 
temperature remained at the baseline of 30°C for 5s. Afterwards, the pain phase started, 647 
which was signaled by a filled red bar in the center of the screen. Thermode temperature 648 
was increased with a rate of 8°C/s to the temperature corresponding to the calibrated 649 
pain value of VAS70. The pain phase lasted for randomly jittered 8-10s. At the beginning 650 
of the treatment phase, a  cue was presented which indicated whether a strong or weak 651 
treatment was to be expected and whether self -treatment or external treatment would 652 
occur. The cue was designed as a reduction of the centered red bar (i.e. more reduction to 653 
1/3 of the total height with high treatment expectation as compared to 2/3 of the total 654 
height with low treatment expectation) and the word YOU (i.e. self-treatment) or HE (i.e. 655 
experimenter-induced, external  treatment) written inside the bar , indicating self-or 656 
external treatment. After a lag of 2s, two treatment buttons were activated and appeared 657 
on the display, changing to green when pressed either by the subject or automatically. The 658 
external treatment was communicated as being done by the experimenter to reinforce the 659 
notion of a treatment setting, but was in fact computer initiated  with a naturalistic 660 
“reaction time” delay . In the case of self -treatment, the participant presse d a button (A) 661 
and the treatment started  with a reduction of the thermode temperature to the target 662 
level of VAS50, VAS30 or V AS10, depending on the condition . Meanwhile, participants 663 
received the signal of a button press (B) from the experimenter as an indication that the 664 
experimenter had acknowledged the self-treatment. In the case of an external treatment, 665 
a button press (B) by the participant had to acknowledge the external treatment. 666 
Meanwhile, experimental participants receive d an indication of a button press (A) from 667

36 
the experimenter, signaling that the treatment has  been started.  Participants were 668 
instructed to perform this task as soon as the treatment buttons appeared on the screen.  669 
Importantly, this procedure ensured identical motor output for the self-treatment and the 670 
external treatment condition s. In conditioning trials, the expectation of highly effective 671 
treatment resulted in a relatively more effective treatment and a reduction of the pain 672 
stimulus to the individual level of VAS10, as compared to a reduction of the pain stimulus 673 
to VAS50 in conditioning trials with low treatment expectations. For test trials, regardless 674 
of cued treatment effectivity , the pain stimulus was reduced to VAS30. The reduction of 675 
the pain stimulus was set at -8°C/s. In total, the treatment phase lasted 17-19s for a total 676 
trial duration of 32s including all three phases. 677 
Additionally, participants were asked to continuously rate their pain level on a scale from 678 
0 (minimal pain) to 100 (extreme pain)  during the whole trial duration.  A rating scale 679 
with a starting point at VAS0 (i.e. position of a red rating indicator) appeared ranging from 680 
VAS0, labelled as “minimally painful” to VAS100, labelled as “extremely painful”. The two 681 
buttons used for the rating were represented on the screen and were lighting up when 682 
pressed on the keyboard. After completion of the rating phase , the heat stimulus was 683 
reduced to the baseline temperature for the remaining intertrial interval of 18s. 684 
During experiment 1, 4 experimental blocks were presented. Each block consisted of a 685 
total of 26 trials. It started with 8 conditioning trials, 4 of which were associated with low 686 
treatment success, 4 with high treatment success, each with the respective cues.  After the 687 
conditioning trials,  3 micro blocks were presented consecutively. Each microblock 688 
consisted of 6 trials of following types: 689 
(1) 1 conditioning reinforcement trial with high expectation of treatment success with 690 
actual high treatment success (reduction of pain from 70 to 10). 691

37 
(2) 1 conditioning reinforcement trial as a reinforcement with low expectation to 692 
treatment success with actual low treatment success (reduction of pain from 70 to 50). 693 
(3) 4 test trials with medium treatment success (reduction in pain from 70 to 30). I.e.: 694 
a. 1 trial with high expectation of treatment success and self -treatment with a reduction 695 
of pain from 70 to 30. 696 
b. 1 trial with high expectation of treatment success and external treatment with a 697 
reduction of pain from 70 to 30. 698 
c. 1 trial with low expectation of treatment success and self-treatment with a reduction of 699 
pain from 70 to 30. 700 
d. 1 trial with high expectation of treatment success and an external treatment with a 701 
reduction of pain from 70 to 30. 702 
The order of trials within the se micro blocks was randomized. Randomization was 703 
constrained so that a trial was not directly followed by the same type of trial , e.g. there 704 
were no two consecutive low expectation self-treatment test trials. For the 8 conditioning 705 
trials at the beginning of a block, it was ensured that at most two consecutive conditioning 706 
trials with the same condition (e.g. high treatment success) occurred.  707 
In total, four experimental blocks were presented. During the first block conditioning and 708 
reinforcement trials were either exclusively self -treatment trials or external treatment 709 
trials. This was switched after two blocks, i.e. if the first two blocks were self-conditioning 710 
blocks the last two blocks were external conditioning blocks and vice versa.  711 
Before the first  experimental block w as presented, 4 training trials were performed, 712 
during which the illusion of treatment was demonstrated by pressing the button 713

connected to the heat stimulation device for pain reduction.  At this stage, an actual button 714 
press by the experimenter was required during external t raining trials to establish the 715 
illusion of a direct link between TENS and the button press  as for the participant . To do 716 
so, the experimenter sat next to the participant and demonstratively pressed the required 717 
button on the keyboard of the participant . In the remainder of the experiment, external 718 
“button presses” were performed by the computer unbeknownst to the subject. 719 
Trial design and block structure: experiment 2 720 
During experiment 2 (see Fig. 2c), the paradigm was split into 5 phases: Trial start (4s), 721 
pain phase (8s), pain rating phase (6s), treatment phase (8s) and treatment rating phase 722 
(6s). Rating scales and relat ed rating buttons  on the screen were only presented during 723 
rating phases. During the pain rating phase, a red indicator on the VAS was presented with 724 
a random starting position. During the treatment rating phase, the final pain rating 725 
position of that red indicator was presented for orientation  alongside a  new green 726 
indicator initially appearing at a random position. The green indicator was used to rate 727 
the treatment outcome. In the treatment phase of experiment 2, treatment buttons were 728 
presented and activated simultaneously with the treatment cue without a jittered lag (as 729 
compared to experiment 1).  730 
In total, 2 experimental blocks were presented. The first block consisted of conditioning 731 
and reinforcement trials which were either exclusively self -treatment trials or external 732 
treatment trials. This was switched after one block, i.e. if the first block w as a  self-733 
conditioning block the second blocks was an external conditioning block, and vice versa. 734 
In total, 56 trials were presented per block, consisting of 8 conditioning trials followed by 735 
8 micro blocks each containing both reinforcer s (VAS10 and VAS50 conditioning trials) 736

and each of the 4 test trial types (self - versus external conditioning , low versus high 737 
treatment expectation). Trials were presented with an inter trial interval of 4s. The first 738 
experimental block was presented after 4 training trials which were performed as in 739 
experiment 1.  740 
Questionnaire Data 741 
After experiment 2 was concluded, participants were asked to complete several 742 
questionnaires. We included the BDI -V (Simplification of the Beck Depression 743 
Inventory)57,58, LSHS-R (Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale – German revised version)59–61, 744 
STAI-X2 (Trait) and STAI-X1 (State) (State-Trait-Anxiety-Scale)62, FKK (German locus of 745 
control scale, Fragebogen zu Kompetenz - und Kontrollüberzeugungen)63, SWE (German 746 
self-efficacy scale; Skala zur Erfassung der Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen)64 and PCS  747 
(Pain Catastrophizing Scale - German translation)65,66 scales. Pearson product-moment 748 
correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between questionnaire 749 
data and agency and placebo benefits. Agency benefits were defined as the difference 750 
between post-treatment VAS ratings of self-treatment and external treatment conditions. 751 
Placebo benefits were de fined as the difference between post-treatment VAS ratings of 752 
high treatment expectation and low treatment expectation conditions. See 753 
Supplementary Information for a summary of the correlational results  of the  754 
questionnaire data. 755 
EEG recording 756 
EEG data were acquired using a 64-channel Ag/AgCl active electrode system (ActiCap64; 757 
BrainProducts) placed according to the extended 10 –20 system67. Sixty electrodes were 758 
used of the most central scalp positions. The EEG was sampled at 500  Hz, referenced at 759

FCz, and grounded at Iz. For removal of ocular movement artifacts, horizontal and vertical 760 
bipolar electrooculogram (EOG) were recorded using the four remaining electrodes.  761 
EEG preprocessing 762 
The data analysis was performed using the Fieldtrip toolbox for EEG/MEG analysis68. For 763 
preprocessing, data were epoched and time -locked to the onset of the cue signaling the 764 
start of the treatment phase. Each epoch was centered (subtraction of the temporal mean) 765 
and included a time range of 19s before and 9s after trigger onset (starting with the empty 766 
cue signaling the start of the trial up to the end of the treatment phase). 767 
We employed a preprocessing approach by Hipp et al. (2011) by splitting the data into 768 
two band-pass filtered sub-sets from 4 to 34Hz for low frequencies and from 16 to 250Hz 769 
for high frequencies 69. This enabled efficient separation of low - and high frequency 770 
artifacts in subsequent ICA analysis. EEG epochs were visually inspected, and trials 771 
contaminated b y artifacts due to gross movements or large technical artifacts were 772 
removed. Trials contaminated by eye -blinks, muscle activity, technical artifacts or 773 
movements were corrected using an independent component analysis (ICA) 774 
algorithm70,71 after careful inspection of topographies, power spectra, relation of ICA time 775 
courses to the temporal structure of the experiment and time-frequency representations. 776 
Artifactual components were removed before the remaining components were back -777 
projected and resulted in corrected data. Subsequently, the data w ere re-referenced to a 778 
common average of all EEG channels and the previous reference channel FCz was reused 779 
as a data channel.  Finally, epochs were visually screened and trials with remaining 780 
artifacts were excluded from analysis. 781

Before time–frequency transformations for data analysis were performed on the cleaned 782 
datasets, the time axis of single trials was shifted to create cue-locked and outcome-locked 783 
data. For cue-locked data, we set the onset of the cue signaling to the start of the treatment 784 
phase as t = 0. Outcome-locked data takes individual differences in response time into 785 
account and sets t = 0 to the time point when the thermode reached the treatment target 786 
temperature (calibrated VAS10, VAS30 and VAS50 levels for low conditioning, test and 787 
high conditioning trials, respectively). Trials were excluded if this duration (from cue 788 
onset to treatment outcome) was longer than 6s. This allowed us to create an analysis 789 
window of 2s in subsequent time-frequency analysis  without contamination by the 790 
subsequent rating phase.  791 
EEG spectral analysis 792 
Spectral analysis was adapted from  Hipp et al. (2011)69. This approach ensured a 793 
homogenous sampling and smoothing in time and frequency space. We calculated 794 
spectral estimates for 23 logarithmically scaled frequenc ies ranging from 4 to 181 Hz 795 
(0.25 octave increments) for the pain phase and treatment phase in 0. 05s steps. For cue-796 
locked data, this included the treatment phase from cue onset up to 2s after cue onset. For 797 
treatment-locked data, this included  the relief  phase from 1s before the treatment 798 
outcome (target temperatures of VAS10, VAS30 or VAS50) was reached, and the outcome 799 
phase up to 2s after the target temperature was reached . Using the multitaper  (DPSS) 800 
approach, we set the temporal and spectral smoothing to match 250 ms and 3/4 octave, 801 
respectively. For frequencies below 16 Hz, we employed 250ms temporal windows and 802 
varied the number of Slepian tapers to approximate a 3/4 octave spectrum smoothin g. 803 
We changed the time window for frequencies below 16 Hz to achieve a frequency 804 
smoothing of 3/4 octaves with a single taper. We computed the frequency transform using 805

high- and low -frequency data for frequencies above and below 25 Hz, respectively. 806 
Analysis was then continued with the combined spectral data  after averaging of spectral 807 
estimates per block and condition over trials for each subject. 808 
For the baseline correction of time –frequency data, the mean and standard deviation 809 
were estimated (for each subject/channel/frequency combination, separately) from 0.5 810 
to 7.5s of the pain phase (i.e. increases and decreases in EEG power activity indicate 811 
deviations from EEG power during painful stimulation). The mean spectral estimate of the 812 
baseline was then subtracted from each data point, and the resulting baseline -centered 813 
values were divided by the baseline standard deviation (classical baseline normalization 814 
– additive model; see Grandchamp & Delorme, 2011)72. 815 
Behavioral data analysis 816 
For experiment 1, we performed analysis on the continuous VAS rating by simply using 817 
the last data point  of each trial. For experiment 2, we performed analysis on the single 818 
post-treatment VAS rating. Here, we have 2x2 conditions for test trials (low  versus high 819 
treatment expectation / self- versus external treatment) and 2 conditions for conditioning 820 
trials. Firstly, we conducted a 3x1 repeated measures ANOVA  with post -hoc t -tests to 821 
evaluate the differences between VAS10  (conditioning), VAS30  (test) and VAS50  822 
(conditioning) conditions, respectively. Secondly, we conducted a 2x2 repeated measures 823 
ANOVA to evaluate differences between the different test conditions (low  versus high 824 
expectation / self- versus external treatment) and the interaction term of expectation and 825 
agency.  826

Bayesian integration models of placebo pain treatment 827 
For model-based analysis of our post-treatment VAS rating  data, we designed two 828 
Bayesian integration models of pain perception in placebo pain treatment (see Büchel et 829 
al., 2014 for a review)16 in accordance with the forward model and active inference model. 830 
In the Bayesian formulation of pain perception, Bayes’ theorem is used to estimate the 831 
level of perceived pain, taking precision-weighted prior experiences into account (Fig. 1a 832 
and Eq.1). Formally, the model integrates a prior with a likelihood to estimate a posterior.  833 
Both, the prior and the likelihood were approximated by normal distributions allowing 834 
for an analytical integration using normal-normal conjugate priors to estimate the normal 835 
posterior.  836 
(Eq.1) 837 
𝜇𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 = 𝜇𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 ∗ 𝜎² 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 +  𝜇𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 ∗ 𝜎² 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟

 839 
With respect to the behavioral data, our model predicted the painfulness of the test phase 840 
post-treatment VAS rating s (posterior) by integrating conditioning post-treatment VAS 841 
ratings as a prior (mean and variance derived from VAS10 and VAS50 post-treatment VAS 842 
ratings for high and low treatment expectation  conditions, respectively ) with an 843 
individual estimate of the likelihood ( average of VAS10 and VAS50 parameters for each 844 
subject). Gaussian approximation of the rating data was performed by fitting a Gaussian 845 
cumulative probability density functions  to the cumulative sum of the ratings  using a 846 
robust grid search19.  847

44 
For the estimation of the posterior parameters in self -treatment trials we created two 848 
derived models, based on predictions of the forward model  and the active inference  849 
model. For the forward model, we included a free parameter pshift to enable a likelihood 850 
shift (Eq.2; Fig. 1b): 851 
(Eq.2)  852 
𝜇𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 = 𝜇𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 ∗ 𝜎2
𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 +  (𝜇𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 + 𝑝𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡) ∗ 𝜎² 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟

 854 
 855 
Active inference assumes a higher likelihood variance (i.e. lower precision) in self -856 
treatment trials, and thus we included a free parameter prelax in the active inference model 857 
to represent a modulation of likelihood variance by self -treatment. Under active 858 
inference, posterior parameters  are estimated by  the following equations (see also Fig. 859 
1c): 860 
(Eq.3)  861 
𝜇𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 =
𝜇𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 ∗ (𝜎2
𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 ∗ 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥) + 𝜇𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑑 ∗ 𝜎² 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟

 863 
We used a variational Bayesian inference  to estimate the parameters of all models using 864 
the VBA toolbox73 for Matlab (R2021a). We used uninformative priors for both 865 
parameters (prelax ~ Normal(1,1000) and pshift ~ Normal(0, 1000). In addition, we fitted a 866 
combined model with both free parameters and a null model (Eq.1) in which both 867

45 
parameters were “constrained” through their priors (prelax ~ Normal(1, 1e-20) and pshift ~ 868 
Normal(0, 1e -20). Given our behavioral post-treatment VAS rating  data (i.e. empirical 869 
posterior), VBA recovers an approximation to both the posterior density on unknown 870 
variables (prelax and p shift for the active inference model and the forward  model, 871 
respectively) and the log model evidence (which is used for model comparison). We used 872 
a random effects ( RFX) Bayesian model selection approach 38,39 to estimate the overall 873 
posterior model probability across subjects . Finally, we estimated the protected 874 
exceedance probability as a metric for the Bayesian model comparison of the active 875 
inference model and the forward model38.  876 
EEG data analysis    877 
Here, we analyzed the effects of two phases of pain treatment. Firstly, we wanted to 878 
analyze effects associated with the treatment cue indicating low or high treatment success 879 
and self- or external treatment. For this analysis, we used a cue -locked analysis window 880 
of 2 s after the onset of the cue. Secondly, we wanted to evaluate the  relief phase and  881 
treatment outcome based on low or high treatment expectations , agency , and their 882 
interaction. As the treatment outcome occurred at highly variable time points based on 883 
the response, we analyzed –1 to 2s in relation to the time point when the thermode 884 
reached the treatment target temperature (where -1 to 0s was defined as the relief phase 885 
and 0 to 2s was defined as the treatment outcome phase).  886 
We corrected all statistical tests in electrode space for multiple comparis ons using non-887 
parametrical permutation tests of clusters74. Samples (exceeding the threshold of p < .05) 888 
were clustered in connected sets on the basis of temporal (i.e. adjacent time points), 889 
spatial (i.e. neighboring electrodes), and  spectral adjacency. Clustering was restricted in 890

46 
a way that only samples were included in a cluster which had at least one significant 891 
neighbor in electrode space (i.e. at least one neighboring channel also had to exceed the 892 
threshold for a sample to be i ncluded in the cluster). Neighbors were defined by a 893 
template provided by the Fieldtrip toolbox corresponding to the used EEG montage. 894 
A cluster value was defined as the sum of all statistical values of included samples. Monte 895 
Carlo sampling was used to generate 1000 random permutations of the design matrix, and 896 
statistical tests were repeated in time–frequency space with the random design matrices. 897 
The probability of a cluster from the original design matrix (p -value) was calculated by 898 
the proportion of random design matrices producing a cluster with a cluster value 899 
exceeding the original cluster. Muscular and ocular electrodes were excluded from the 900 
cluster analysis. 901 
Further, we wanted to explore correlations of between-subject time-frequency responses 902 
and benefits of high treatment expectation versus low treatment expectation in post -903 
treatment VAS rating s, as well as  sensory attenuation model parameters . For each 904 
participant, we calculated the placebo benefit by the within-subject z -normalized 905 
difference of behavioral ratings between high and low trea tment expectations in test 906 
trials. For the benefit of agency, we used the single subject  mean estimate of the p shift 907 
parameter from the VBA model inversion procedure, accordingly.  908 
Any positive or negative cluster in correlation analysis  of EEG power during test trials  909 
would indicate an association with placebo or agency benefits. Here, a p-value of p < 0.05 910 
obtained from the Pearson’s correlation test statistic  as implemented in  the Fieldtrip 911 
toolbox was used as a threshold for clustering.  912

Supplementary Information 1100 
Calibration data: experiment 1 1101 
During experiment 1, pain levels were calibrated to achieve VAS10 (M = 38.1°C, SD = 3.5°C, 1102 
Min = 31.8°C, Max = 44.8°C), VAS30 (M = 39°C, SD = 3.5°C, Min = 32.2°C, Max = 45.3°C), 1103 
VAS50 (M = 39.9°C, SD = 3.6°C, Min = 32.5°C, Max = 46.2°C) and VAS70 (M = 40.8°C, SD = 1104 
3.8°C, Min = 32.8°C, Max = 47.2°C) pain levels (for highly effective conditioning, test trials, 1105 
low effective conditioning and VAS70 pain stimulation, respectively).   1106 
Calibration data: experiment 2 1107 
During experiment 2, pain levels were calibrated to achieve VAS10 (M = 38.2°C, SD = 3.1°C, 1108 
Min = 31.72°C, Max = 44.5°C), VAS30 (M = 39°C, SD = 3.1°C, Min = 32.1°C, Max = 45.3°C), 1109 
VAS50 (M = 38.19°C, SD = 3.1°C, Min = 32.5°C, Max = 46.1°C) and VAS70 (M = 40.5°C, SD 1110 
= 3.2°C, M in = 32.8°C, Max = 46.9°C) pain levels (for highly effective conditioning, test 1111 
trials, low effective conditioning and pain stimulation, respectively).   1112 
EEG data analysis: interaction    1113 
We conducted post -hoc t -tests to confirm the crossed interaction of agency and 1114 
expectations at cue -locked EEG data. Post-hoc t -tests confirmed a crossed interaction 1115 
where all 4 comparisons were significant, i.e. self -treatment with high treatment 1116 
expectation trials were associated with larger EEG power than self -treatment trials with 1117 
low treatment expectations (t(53) = 3.74, p < 0.001), whereas external treatment trials 1118 
with high treatment expectations were associated with smaller EEG power than external 1119 
treatment trials with low treatment expectations (t(53) = -5.17, p < 0 .001). Also, high 1120 
treatment expectation trials with self-treatment were associated with higher EEG power 1121

that high treatment expectation trials with external treatment (t(53) = 5.84, p < 0.001) 1122 
and low treatment expectation trials with self-treatment were associated with lower EEG 1123 
power than low treatment expectation trials with external treatment (t(53) = 3.04, p = 1124 
0.004).  1125 
Questionnaire data 1126 
We correlated z -scored agency VAS benefits (self -treatment – external treatment post-1127 
treatment VAS rating) and placebo VAS benefits (high treatment expectation – low 1128 
treatment expectation  post-treatment VAS rating) with  scores from  various 1129 
questionnaire data (BDI_V, FKK, LSHS_R, PCS, STAI-X2 (Trait), STAI-X1 (State), SWE). All 1130 
correlations were not significant (all p > 0.05, uncorrected; Supplementary Table 1). 1131
