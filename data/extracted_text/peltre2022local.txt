1 Local statistical systems: topology and combinatorics
Consider a finite free sheaf E : P(Ω)op → Set of microstates, defined for every region a ⊆ Ω by
E = (cid:81) E . For every b ⊆ a the natural restriction πa→b : E → E forgets the state of variables
a i∈a i a b
outside b, we write x = πa→b(x ). We recall necessary definitions and theorems from [9] in this

section.
Local observables form a cosheaf1 RE : P(Ω) → Alg of commutative algebras, whose arrows

consist of natural inclusions REb ⊆ REa when identifying each local algebra with a low dimensional

Local densities form a dual functor RE∗ : P(Ω)op → Vect of vector spaces, whose arrows consist
of partial integrations πa→b :REa∗ →REb∗, also called marginal projections. In the cochain complex

Consistent densities satisfying dp = 0 are hence characterised by cohomology classes [p] ∈ Ker(d) in
C (K,RE)∗. They can be extendend to a global measure p such that p =πΩ→a(p ) for all a∈K,

We shall write p = ρβ(H) with H = ζ(h). Then ρβ is the non-linear Gibbs state map describing
statistical equilibrium in physics, and the zeta transform ζ, acting by local summation on subre-

2 Cluster variational principles solved by diffusion
In the following, assume K ⊆ P(Ω) is fixed and closed by intersection. Let us introduce notations
C =C (K,RE) for the complex of observables, ∆ ⊆C∗ for the convex subspace of positive beliefs,
• • 0 0
constrained by p ∈ Prob(E ) and p > 0 for all a ∈ K, and Γ = ∆ ∩Ker(d) for the subconvex of
a a a 0 0
consistent beliefs, further constrained by dp=0.
In this section, we define variational principles on Γ and characterise the dynamical equations
0
one can be use to solve them. Because ρβ is not linear, the manifold Fixβ = (ρβ ◦ζ)−1(Γ ) defined
0
below is not a linear subspace of C , despite Γ ⊆∆ being a convex polytope of C∗.
0 0 0 0
Definition 1. We call consistent manifold the non-linear subspace Fixβ ={v ∈C |ρβ(ζv)∈Γ } for
0 0
any choice of inverse temperature β >0, and let Fix=Fix1.
Definition 2. We say that a flux functional Φ:C →C is projectively faithful at β >0 iff:
0 1
δΦ(v)=0⇔v ∈Fixβ (7)
We call Φ projectively consistent if it satisfies the weaker condition δΦ =0.
|Fixβ
When Φ is projectively faithful at β = 1, stationary potentials of the diffusion dv = δΦ(v) in C
dt 0
are projected onto stationary beliefs p = ρ(ζv) ∈ Γ of GBP [9, thm 5.15]. The purpose of GBP is

hencetofindpointsattheintersectionofenergyconservationandconsistencyconstraintsurfaces,i.e.
given initial potentialsh∈C , GBPlooksfor v ∈[h]∩Fix, where[h]=h+δC isthe homologyclass
0 1

The standard flux functional associated to GBP is projectively faithful [9, prop 5.17] at β =1. It
is defined for every pair a⊃b in K by:

at least in a neighbourhood of Fix [9, prop 5.37]. A consequence of faithfulness is that stationarity of
beliefs implies stationarity of messages3. One can hence shift the focus from messages to beliefs (or
from flux terms to potentials), without losing information on GBP equilibria.
Definition 3. For every a⊆Ω and β >0, let us introduce the following local functionals:

the two dual variational principles on entropy and free energy we are concerned with.
As in the exact global case, the max-entropy principle takes place with constraints on the Bethe-

We will now show that problems 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent to solving local consistency constraints
on the beliefs p = ρβ(ζv) induced by potentials v ∈ h+δC that satisfy the energy conservation

constraints.
3 Correspondence theorems
Solutions of the local max-entropy and free energy principles share a very common structure. Dual
mean energy and temperature constraints may however not lead to a univocal relationship between
U and β, as is the case for their global counterparts.
Theorem 1. Let β > 0 and h ∈ C . Under the correspondence p = ρβ(ζv), problem 1 is equivalent
0
to finding consistent conservative potentials v ∈[h]∩Fixβ.
Theorem 2. Let U ∈ R and h ∈ C . Under the correspondence p = ρ1(ζv¯), problem 2 is equivalent
0
to finding consistent conservative potentials v¯∈[βh]∩Fix1 for some β >0 and such that (cid:104)p,h(cid:105)=U.
Let c : C → C denote multiplication by Bethe-Kikuchi coefficients. This operation may not be
0 0
invertible in general, as c may vanish on some b∈K. In fact, one knows that c =0 whenever b is
b b
not an intersection of maximal regions a ,...,a ∈K, although assuming that K is the ∩-closure of
1 n
a set of maximal regions does not always imply invertibility of c.
4
Definition 4. Let us call Fixβ ={v+b|v ∈Fixβ,b∈Ker(cζ)}⊆C the weaklyconsistentmanifold.
+ 0
In particular, Fixβ =Fixβ when c is invertible.
+
Theorem 3. Given β > 0 and h ∈ C , problem 3 is equivalent to finding weakly consistent conser-
0
vative potentials w ∈ [h]∩Fixβ and they can be univocally mapped onto [h]∩Fixβ by a retraction
+
rβ :Fixβ →Fixβ.
+
The retraction rβ will be defined by equation 16 in the proof below, it maps solutions of problem
3 onto those of 1. We now proceed to prove theorems 2 and 3. We shall discuss their relationship
afterwards. The following combinatorial lemma is essential to the proofs and rather subtle in spite of
its apparent simplicity (see [9, chap 4] for detailed formulas).
Lemma 1. There exists a linear flux map Ψ:C →C such that c−µ=δΨ.
0 1
Proof of lemma 1. One can completely characterise homology classes [h] = h+δC by the global
1
(cid:80)
energyconservationconstraint h =H whenK ⊆P(Ω)isclosedunderintersection[9, cor2.14].
a a Ω
Therefore equation 6 implies that h = µH and cH are homologous, i.e. (c−µ)(H) ∈ δC and one
1
can construct Ψ:C →C such that (c−µ)(H)=δΨ(H).
0 1
Proof of theorem 1. Verysimilartothatof2below,thepreciseproofcanbefoundin[9,thm4.22].
Proof of theorem 2. Given U ∈ R and h ∈ C , let p ∈ Γ such that (cid:104)p,h(cid:105) = U be a solution of 2.
0 0
Define local energies V¯ = ζv¯∈ C by letting V¯ = −lnp for all b so that p = ρ1(V¯) = ρ1(ζv¯). The
0 b b
consistencyofpthereforeimpliesv¯∈Fix1. Thisholdsforanyotherpotentialv¯(cid:48) ∈v¯+RK,asaddition
of local energy constants preserves Gibbs states.
Letusnowshowthattheenergyconstraint(cid:104)p,h(cid:105)=U andtheconsistencyconstraintsdp=0imply
v¯ ∈ [βh] for some β. By duality, recalling that δ = d∗ we know that (cid:104)q,u(cid:105) = 0 for all q ∈ Ker(d) is
equivalent to u∈Im(δ). The consistency constraint hence introduces Lagrange multipliers δϕ∈δC .
1
The linear constraints (cid:104)p ,1 (cid:105) = 1 and (cid:104)p,h(cid:105) = U respectively introduce Lagrange multipliers terms
a a
of the form λ+βh∈RK +Rh.
A classical computation yields the differential of local entropies S (p )=−(cid:104)·,1 +ln(p )(cid:105), which
b∗ b b b
coincides with (cid:104)·,V¯ (cid:105) on tangent fibers of Prob(E ) due to the normalisation constraint. Therefore p
b b
is critical if and only if:
Sˇ (p) =c (V¯ −1 )=λ 1 +βh +δϕ (13)
∗ a a a a a a a a
By lemma 1 we know that cV¯ and v¯ = µV¯ are homologous, i.e. v¯ = cV¯ −δΨ(cV¯). Therefore 13 is
equivalent to v¯∈λ+βh+δC . Up to a boundary term of δC , the local constants λ∈RK could also
1 1
be absorbed into a single constant λ(cid:48) ∈ R. Enforcing the constraint (cid:104)p,v¯(cid:48)(cid:105) = βU on the equivalent
potentials v¯(cid:48) ∈v¯+RK, one may furthermore ensure that λ(cid:48) =0 so that v¯(cid:48) ∈[βh]∩Fix1.
Proof of theorem 3. Given H = ζh ∈ C and β > 0, let V = ζv ∈ C be a solution of 3. The energy
0 0
constraint on v ∈h+δC implies Fˇβ(V) =0 with the differential Fˇβ :C →C∗ given by:

p = ρβ(V) criticality is then equivalent to Fβ(V) = cp ∈ Im(ζδ)⊥. Recall that d = δ∗ by definition
∗
and denote by ζ∗ :q (cid:55)→q◦ζ the adjoint of ζ:
cp∈Im(ζδ)⊥ ⇔ ζ∗(cp)∈Im(δ)⊥ ⇔ ζ∗(cp)∈Ker(d) (15)
Therefore V is critical for Fˇβ if and only if ζ∗(cp)=ζ∗(cρβ(V)) is consistent.

Notethatβ <0shouldbeunderstoodasareversalofinteractions,thelimitβ →±0beingequivalent

Assume p∈Ker(d) is consistent. Then by the dual form of lemma 1 involving (δΨ)∗ =Ψ∗d which
vanishes on Ker(d), we have cp = µ∗p and ζ∗(cp) = p is consistent as well. This shows that any
consistent potential v ∈[h]∩Fixβ yields a critical point V =ζv of the Bethe-Kikuchi energy Fˇβ(V).
Reciprocally assume q =ζ∗(cp)∈Ker(d), then µ∗(q)=cq by lemma 1 and cq =cp, which means
that p and q coincide on any b∈K such that c (cid:54)=0. Let us define energies W =ζw ∈C by:

W =− ln(q )+Fβ(V ) (16)

4 Conclusion
Letting v¯ = βv, note that solutions of 2 can be written p = ρβ(ζv) with v ∈ [h]∩Fixβ solution
of 1, as v¯ ∈ [βh]∩Fix1 is equivalent to v ∈ [h]∩Fixβ. The form of theorem 2 involves a simpler

of solutions for a given energy constraint U may however occur for different values of the Lagrange
multiplier β.
In the high temperature limit β → 0, one can show that [h] is transverse to Fixβ [9, prop 5.11],
or equivalently that Im(δ)∩T Fix = {0}, so that a univocal energy-temperature relationship β (U)

therefore equivalent to finding the intersection [h]∩Fixβh(U) restricted to V .
