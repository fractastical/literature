 Evaluation of binding free energy  of a protein-ligand complex  in silico is quite
signMcanL  in a diug disceveT)' process but many  metho  1 are  time  c[msuming.  In
this wotk,  we  present a llew technique  to evatuate  binding free energy  based on  the
z free cncrgy  variation principlc, whieh  is describcd as <H-H,>,  > G-G,, wherc  G,,
H,,, G and  H  are  free energy  ttnd  enthatpy  nf  the non-perturbed  and  pertuthed
systems  respeetively.  < >o denotes the ensemble  average  ",ith  non-peTturbed
Hamiltonian. Based on  this principle, the free energy  clifference  of  these ligands
can  be approximattd  by avcraging  thcir encrgy  difference, i,e,, <E2-Ei>, =  G2-Gi, if
physicochemicat features of  ligand 1 and  ligand 2 aTe  sin]ilar.  This can  be applied
alsc) to the proLein-tigarid coillplexes,  and  final]]' we  obtain  approximate  binding
free energy, Our aim  is to proposc a niethod  which  provides binding free cncrg]r
wi thin :easonable  sirmu] ation time. In this study, we  use the dihydrofolate reductase
and  trirnethopriTne deTivatives as  inhibitors for the exarnination  ef  our  zechnique,
because their protein-ligand eomplex  structures  and  ligand binding properties were
wcU-invcstigatcd,  By taking cnscrnble  aycrage  of cncrgy  valucs ef Ligand-protein
complexes  calculated  by molecular  dynmnics, we  attempt  to ebtain  precise binding

the binding free energy  values  eomparable  with  the experimentally  obtained  Kd

2P584Bootstrap-based
 consensus  seoring  method  for high-performance
and  robust  drug screening  by single  scoring  function

 We  develuped u boetstrap-based censensus  scering  (BBCS). -'hich  is inspired
from bagging of ensemble  lcarning, to improve perifonnance of thc existing seoring
functiun. Tn the BBCS,  the bootstrap methed  is emptoyed  te  increuse u trHining set
from one  to two  more,  which  are  used  for opimizing  energy  parameter set  of  the
scering funcLion. Each training scl includcs protcin-ligancl cemplcxcs;  each
complcx  has X-ray  structure and  dccoy ones, Thc  optjmization  mcthod,  which  Ls
empioyed  in each  training set, explores  energy  paranlleter set  maximizing  an
average  z-score  vf  X-ray strucnire  for al1 complexes.  Once two  or  more  different
energy  paranieter sets are generated, by combining  scoring with  these paratnerer
sets,  consensus  scoring can  be  implemented. The  reagon  why  we  reached  the idea
of  the BBCS  is that  it is diffic-lt te uniquety  determine energy  purameter set  give
global rninimurn  for binding frec energy  from one  tTaining data. in paTticular, whcn
propenies of complexes  in training set are biascd. On the other hand, a
conventional  consenslls  scoring  (CS) gets consensus  among  a few scorin.o.  functions.
Judging ffom published reperts,  it seems  thut it is not  easy  to find the best
combination  of scoring functions because ot' hcuristic search, in contrast, for the
BBCS,  the bothersome work  such  as  the heuristic search  is not  necessary.
