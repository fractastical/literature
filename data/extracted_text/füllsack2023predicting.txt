Abstract
Methods to forecast critical transitions, i.e. abrupt changes in systems’ equilibrium states
have relevance in scientific fields such as ecology, seismology, finance and medicine
among others. So far, the bulk of investigatio ns on forecasting methods builds on equation-
based modeling methods, which consider system states as aggregates and thus do not
account for the different connection strengths in each part of the system. This seems inade-
quate against the background of studies that insinuate that critical transitions can originate
in sparsely connected parts of systems. Here we use agent-based spin-shifting models
with assortative network representations to distinguish different interaction densities. Our
investigations confirm that signals of imminent critical transitions can indeed be detected
significantly earlier in network parts with low link degrees. We discuss the reason for this cir-
cumstance on the basis of the free energy principle.
Introduction
Critical transitions (CTs) are state or equilibrium changes in a system’s dynamics that tend
to occur abruptly compared to the rather slow development of a critical parameter that is
assumed to drive the system’s change [1–3]. An example of such a critical parameter could be
the nutrient load in a shallow lake, which when slowly increased can cause abrupt regime shifts
in the lake’s vegetation coverage and thus the water’s turbidity [4]. Since such transitions often
move a system from an accepted to a detrimental condition—with climate change possibly
providing one of the most prominent examples [5] -, much effort is undertaken to anticipate
the onset of a CT in time to revert it. For this a set of methods has been suggested, which is
commonly referred to as Early Warning Signals (EWS) [6, 7].
EWS have been tested extensively, on empirical data [8, 9] as well as on model data [2, 7].
In the latter case, the predominant modelling method so far is equation based, which in
essence represents the state variables of a system as statistically averaged aggregations with the
help of differential equations. This contrasts to the suggestion from theory that the abrupt
equilibrium changes causing CTs are driven by non-linear interactions at the component level
of a system [10, 11], and what is more, that these interactions are not evenly distributed in
most natural systems, but tend to be subject to all sorts of clustering. Since most equation-
based models (EBMs) consider system dynamics in an aggregate (i.e. averaged) form, they do

not represent particularities of micro-level interactions. Therefore, the proposition seems rea-
sonable to extend the investigation of the causes of CTs and the possibilities to predict them to
agent-based modeling (ABMs) [12, 13], which allows capturing component interactions in
detail by considering different neighbourhood influences. In particular, network representa-
tions of such models offer the chance to distinguish fractions of component populations with
regard to their impact on the momentum of an aggregating CT.
Early considerations on the dimensionality of physical models [14] and some more recent
explorations with network representations of social systems [15, 16] indicate that an essential
influence on the build-up of CTs may stem from peripheral, rather sparsely linked parts of a
system, rather than from the densely interwoven center. While the early physical explorations
built their assumptions rather implicitly on the fact that higher-dimensional models imply
higher interaction densities, the more recent investigations on networks differentiate system
components explicitly with regard to their closeness centrality in above-median and below-
median nodes. Although the signals obtained are unambiguous in these settings, the network
fractions considered are still composed of nodes with several different link degrees. The two
classes thus contain very different sizes of interacting neighborhoods which do not allow for a
clear picture of how different neighborhood influence affects the build-up of CTs.
In this paper we report on a setting where the particles of ABM spin-shifting models are
positioned in assortative networks, allowing to separately monitor clusters of particles with
equal link degree. This seems to confirm the assumptions of [14] and the more recent findings
of [15, 16], and to propose that attempts of EWS-analysis may direct more attention to periph-
eral or sparsely connected parts of systems prone to undergo a CT.
The paper is organized as follows: the next subsection introduces an assortatively differenti-
ated network implementation of a basic version of a spin-shifting model, which was designed
to distinguish what could be called a “factual” from a “social” influence on the dynamics of the
system in order to focus analytical attention to the effect of neighborhood interaction. The sub-
sequent section introduces a corresponding implementation of the 2D-Ising model for ferro-
magnetism and shows results of an EWS-analysis of different degree clusters. On the basis of
the results from these investigations, the last section discusses some assumptions about the
causes of CTs in general and about why it might be more promising to look at sparsely linked
parts of dynamical systems for predicting CTs.
Model 1: Distinguishing “factual” and “social” influence
In order to enhance the observability of interaction effects by simplifying some assumptions of
the 2D-version of the Ising-model for ferro-magnetism (see next section), [16] suggested an
agent-based model (ABM), which was designed to enable an investigation of CT-forecasting
by differentiating between internal and external forces that drive a system’s dynamics. In its
design as well as in its response, the model has similarities to the well-known fiber bundle
model with local load sharing [17], as will be discussed in the last section. However, like in the
Ising-model, the model consists of particles, which can be in one of two states (+1 or −1)
dependent on an internal state and an external parameter. The model allows for a separate
observation of the overall spin-orientation of the particles (i.e. in physical contexts the magne-
tization) and the interaction effects before being ‘mixed into’ the control parameter that drives
the system. In a non-physical context, this could be understood as a separation of what could
be called a “factual” (external) and a “social” (internal or neighbourhood) influence on the
overall spin orientation of a particle population. A timely example to explain the rationale
behind this would be the distinction of the influence of the “factual” (i.e. medical) effect of a
Covid 19 vaccine from the “social” influence of rumours about its alleged side effects on the

number of people who choose to be vaccinated. In the fiber bundle model, the external influ-
ence could be seen as the overall strain on the fiber bundle. The internal force would consist of
the distribution of the strain over the remaining fibers once a fiber ruptures. In the Ising, the
external force could be thought of as the external magnetic field that is sometimes applied at
fixed temperature to provoke a first order phase transition. The internal force would be tem-
perature, as implicitly caused by particle interaction (but usually not modelled in this way).
The reason for developing this alternative model, as detailed and discussed in [16], is the
assumption that neighbourhood interactions are a main driver of CTs, but EBMs do not ade-
quately represent them.
What is called “factual” influence in this model is expressed by a parameter c varying
between 0 and 1 that acts as a probability for a positive spin orientation. The “social” (or inter-
nal) influence is defined through a function, which compresses the actual spin orientation of
a neighborhood into a relatively small interval around the tie of an agent’s neighbours with
opposing orientations. This function reads:
f ðxÞ ¼ 1  
2b
e
ax

ð1Þ
and corresponds to the tangens hyperbolicus function when a = 2 and b = 1. f(x) is added to the
control parameter c (i.e. the “factual” influence), with both terms being weighted in regard to
an α-value representing the predominance of the one term over the other. The sum is then
min-max-normalized to the interval {0, 1} in order to serve as a probability p for a particle’s
spin to be in state +1, like so:

with α 2 {0, 1} expressing the weight of social influence being added to factual influence,

s

is the sum of the spins of its neighbours, c
is the critical parameter (the “factual” influence), and norm is a min-max-scaling function to
the interval {0, 1}.
The effect of compressing the neighbourhood interaction with equation (1) into a small
range around the neighbourhood tie is that the overall spin orientation of a population of par-
ticles interacting in a Moore-neighbourhoo d on a 2-D-grid, when started in an all –1 mode
and c increasing linearly from 0 to 1, executes a typical sigmoid transition with a slowly
ascending initial phase, a steep ascend once the social feedback sets in and a slow saturation
phase when the majority of agents has shifted its spins (see [16]). The same effect can be
observed in networked versions of the model—as shown in Figs 1 and 2 bottom row.
A comparison of the dynamics of internal forces on their own and internal plus external
forces is provided in [16]. Here, we focus on the fact that by emphasizing the “social” (that is,
the neighborhood interaction) influence by considering an α > 0.5, we can make the differ-
ences in transition times of different network clusters more clearly visible. Consider Fig 1. All
the shown transitions are taken from a networked version of the model which has been driven
into a degree assortativity of 0.99 by 20000 iterations of rewiring [18, 19], causing nearly all
nodes to be linked to nodes with the same link-degree but leaving no nodes unlinked. The dif-
ferent degrees are indicated with different colors, starting with orange as lowest degree color.
The left-most plot shows a transition with the α-value in equation (2) being set to 0.3 imply-
ing strong external and relatively little internal influence on the system’s dynamics. The transi-
tion shows a slight sigmoid form. With α = 0.5 (second plot from the left), implying an
equality of external and internal influence, the sigmoidity becomes more pronounced and the
individual transitions of network clusters become visible. Only with α = 0.7 however (third

plot from the left), the individual transitions differentiate and it becomes visible that the cluster
with the lowest link-degree (orange) shifts spins significantly earlier than clusters with higher
degrees, causing the overall transition (shown in black) to cascade in several steps. Addition-
ally, it can be seen that the tipping point, that is the onset of the CT is shifted to the right to
higher c-values. In [16] it is shown that the transition is subject to a bi-stable phase causing
hysteresis (that is, different tipping points in dependence of whether c increases or decreases
[20]). The fact that this shift of the CT towards higher c-values is noticeable only with social
influence values of α > 0.5, reinforces the assumption that the actual cause of hysteresis is
social interaction, a fact that might go unnoticed in EBM-representations (see [16]).
The possibility to bias the driving dynamics in this system towards social influence by
considering higher α-values allows for an untarnished observation of the details of the
development of the transition when the interacting population is sufficiently differentiated.
Considering the system in a near-aggregate form, as it is insinuated in the left-most image
in Fig 2 with a low assortativity of 0.323, shows a clear right-shifted CT (α = 0.7) with some
suggestions of more variation and an earlier CT-onset in network parts with lower link-
degrees. With a high differentiation of network clusters however, from driving assortativity
to levels beyond 0.8 (middle image) or 0.9 (right image), it becomes indisputable clear that
the onset of the CT takes its initial momentum in the low-degree clusters (orange and
green). What is more, it becomes visible that, while there is quite some variation in spin-ori-
entation in the low-degree clusters, the higher degree nodes tend to shift their spin orienta-
tion almost in unity. The higher the link-degree, the more switch-like the shift becomes, a
fact that we will meet again in the next section when considering the Ising-model in an ana-
log setting.
Ising as network
The model described in the above section represents a simple spin-shifting system which in its
setting and its behavior has some similarity to the Ising model for ferro-magnetization [21].
However, different from the Ising its driving parameter is a simple probability which does not
imply a necessity to equilibrate the system before considering its state. In order to test whether
the observed particularities of CTs in this system, in particular the earlier onset of tipping in
low-degree nodes, is generalizable to more complex systems, we subject a 2D-version of the
Ising model to an analog investigation.
In its 2D-version [22], the Ising can be seen as an agent-based model representing magnetic
dipole moments of atomic spins. Agents can be in one of two states (+ 1 or −1) dependent on
an ambient temperature and an external magnetic field. Spins are seeking a low energy state
causing them to flip abruptly depending on a potential gain in energy. Consequently, as tem-
perature increases, flipping to a higher energy state becomes more likely. However, flipping
also depends on the state of a particle’s neighbouring particles and this neighborhood depen-
dence can create clusters of equal spin alignments causing clusters to flip together. When rais-
ing temperature in the model, the spin transition follows a second order phase transition (see
the discussion section) which shows in the form of a pitchfork-bifurcation [23]. But when
altering the external magnetic field at fixed temperature, the system develops a bi-stable region
with two stable states and an unstable state of spin orientation. It undergoes a first order phase
transition, the dynamics of which are determined by a combined saddle-node bifurcation
making the transitions subject to hysteresis (for more details, see S1 Appendix). Usually, the
2D-Ising model is implemented on an NxN lattice with neighboring particles considered in a
von Neumann neighborhood [24]. Here, we implement it in a networked version with 2000
linked particles, the link-degrees of which initially are randomly-distributed around particular

link-degrees and then iteratively driven into different levels of assortativity, analog to how the
networks in the preceding section are treated.
These networks of particles are then exposed to the above described Ising-dynamics by line-
arly increasing the external magnetic field h over 3000 time steps from -0.4 to 0.6 (Note that in
the usual von Neumann implementation a much smaller range of h suffices to trigger the spin
shift [23]) The overall magnetic shift of the system—which would be the system’s overall state
variable when considered, as usual, in an aggregated form (indicated by the black curve in Fig
3)—proceeds in the form of a cascade, with the number of cascade-steps corresponding to the
number of clusters with different link degrees. The spin shift of clusters of equal-degree nodes
however (colors: orange, green, red, magenta, brown), happens at distinctly different h-values,
with the lower degree nodes (orange, green) clearly shifting significantly earlier than the high-
degree nodes (magenta, brown).
This appears to support the proposition that sparsely linked particles play a significant role
in the build-up of a CT. What is more, the detailed analysis of the spin variation patterns of the
individual clusters shows that only the sparsely linked clusters exhibit a notable variance in
the onset of the CT, whereas the more densely linked clusters tend to shift spin orientation
block-wise in unity. The higher the link-degree of a cluster, the less variance is to be seen in the
onset of the CT. Densely interwoven clusters tend to switch abruptly when changing spin ori-
entation, triggered by increasing spin variations in less densely interwoven parts of the system.
This affects attempts to predict CTs with Early Warning Signal (EWS) indicators.
EWS-analysis builds on the presence of noise in a system’s dynamics. Its core aspect is Crit-
ical Slowing Down, indicating declining resilience and thus slower recovery rates from pertur-
bations when the system approaches a CT [25]. When simulating such systems with equation-
based methods, noise often is artificially added when generating time series for EWS-analysis
[26]. In the case of this 2D-Ising-implementation the noise is ‘naturally’ caused by the variance
in spin orientation of particles and is seen as an ongoing perturbation activity from which the
system attempts to recover. However, the recovery gets delayed more and more the closer the
system is driven towards the CT, and this delay is what EWS-analysis detects in terms of statis-
tical signals (for a detailed exposition see a.o. [27]). To analyse these signals, we used the
Python-library EWS-tools (https://github.com/ThomasM Bury/ewstools), covering most of the
statistical signals so far suggested as potential indicators of an imminent CT.

range of h suffices to trigger the spin shift).

significantly earlier in the low-degree clusters (yellow and green). Additionally, the trend of
the signals, as shown in terms of the Kendall’s τ coefficient [28] in the legends of Fig 4, also
indicates more information to be gained from the low-linked clusters. The higher degree
clusters (magenta and brown) do not provide clear signals on parts of their range, due to an
absence of noise. Analog results were obtained from all constellations of differently linked
Ising-networks we investigated.
In order to show that analog signals can be gained from more aggregated states of systems
as well, and that the information about link degrees (resp.interaction density) can be used to
locate promising system parts for EWS-analysis, the above analysis was analogously applied to
pre-CT time series of the alternative spin-shifting model as introduced in the preceding sec-
tion, networked with an assortativity of only 0.317 as shown in the leftmost image in Fig 2. Fig
5 shows results from comparing the dynamics of the two lowest-degree clusters (blue and
orange) with the one of the aggregate system (black). As can be seen, in AC-1, Skewness and
Kurtosis the aggregate information eventually exceeds the low-degree signals, but seems to
increase a bit later in AC-1 and does not much differ in Skewness and Kurtosis. Additionally,
it appears to perform worse in STD and the peak of the power spectrum (Smax). These results
indicate that applying EWS-analysis to particular low-degree clusters of complex systems
could suffice to gain information about imminent CTs in time to revert a system’s dynamics.
We take this as an additional confirmation that directing attention to signals from less densely
linked parts of a system can be useful in attempts to forecast CTs.
Discussion
The investigations described in the above sections raise the question of why signals from a
sparsely interconnected part of a complex system should be better suited for predicting CTs.
Common explanations of the causes of CTs in bi-stable systems refer to self-enforcing inter-
actions of a system’s components, in the course of which positive feedbacks may drive the sys-
tem’s state beyond an unstable (i.e. improbable) equilibrium point into one or the other
attractor basin of alternative equilibria. An often-cited example is the shallow lake whose bot-
tom can be covered with vegetation depending on the incidence of light. Vegetation provides
shelter for zooplanton, which in turn keeps the lake free of phytoplankton and thus ensures
high light incidence. Slightly different nutrient loads, however, can cause the phytoplankton
level to trigger an opposite feedback loop, where less light causes less plants and thus less pro-
tection for zooplankton, which in turn implies less reduction of phytoplankton and thus higher
turbidity. The lake hence is subject to two opposing positive feedback loops which, on the base
of small differences in nutrient loads, may trigger rapid state changes between a clear water
and a turbidity state of the water [29]. Empirical investigations seem to support this theoretical
reasoning [2]. The emphasis on positive feedback as the cause of CTs is supported by insights
from social sciences, where in particular research in the wake of innovation diffusion [30]
stresses the build-up of rich-get-richer dynamics in the onset of the diffusion of innovations,
rumours or viruses [31, 32]. Adhering to the logic of positive feedback it stands to assume that
a dense network of interaction possibilities will enforce its effects. The more social contacts,
the more neighborhood interaction, the better the chances for the roll-out of positive feedback.
Within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau form [33] from statistical physics the
dynamics of the two opposing feedback loops can be expressed as a potential well of free
energy f.

termed a second order phase transition in the course of which a slowly changing parameter T
generates two alternative equilibria for the marble (green curve in Fig 6), corresponding to the
symmetry break of a pitchfork bifurcation as exhibited in the Ising model when reducing tem-
perature [23].
Although EWS investigations and other attempts to forecast bifurcations have been applied
to second order phase transitions as well [23], what is termed a CT in ecology is supposed to
happen in the course of what physicists call a first order phase transition, often accompanied
by a spinodal instability [34] (see Fig 7). First order transitions occur when the rate of fluctua-
tions are large enough such that the energy barrier between two metastable states is overcome.
Spinodal instabilities facilitate this phase transition: the two alternative attractor basins gradu-
ally shift so that one gains prevalence over the other (green and blue curve in 253 middle and
right images in Fig 5), as is the case in the course of a double saddle-node bifurcation in the
Ising model when the temperature remains constant but the external magnetic field changes
[23]. The actual CT then occurs in what is called a spinodal instability, that is, the secession of
the metastable state in a local minimum of free energy (right image in Fig 6 and middle image
in Fig 7). The bifurcation point of the spinodal instability (the spinodal point) arises when the
critical parameter driving the CT reaches a point where the energy barrier disappears.
Due to the large discontinuous jumps in system states that this kind of transitions can
cause, and the phenomenon of hysteresis (see Fig 7), it is considered more consequential and
also seems to attract more research activity [34]. The bulk of this activity however, bases its
analysis on equation-based methods and insights from dynamical systems theory. On this
background, it appears that CTs are predominantly caused by the dynamics of free energy as
visualized with the gravity following marble, that is, by opposing positive feedback loops driv-
ing the marble into the one or the other attractor basin. As surmised above, the focus on posi-
tive feedback seems to give reason to assume more effect in the densely interconnected parts of
a system than in its more loosely woven clusters.
This however stands in contrast to the above described findings according to which the
onset of CTs seems to get-going in the sparsely linked parts of a network. A possible explana-
tion for this is suggested in [16]. In the opinion of the authors, it is not so much the opportuni-
ties for diffusing positive feedback effects as they may prosper in densely linked network parts,
but rather the lack of such opportunities for the spread of negative feedback effects in the
sparsely linked network clusters. Negative feedbacks, or in other words, conservative

dashed line) when h = 0 and the free energy of the two global minima equal each-other. No critical transition however occurs. The system remains
trapped in a metastable state (blue curve in right image). Right: spinodal instabilit y. Here, the transitions happens when the derivative of h in the left
attractor basin becomes zero, that is, when the left local minim um disapp ears and the metastable state loses stability. The system finally shifts to the
lowest free-ene rgy state. The actual CT occurs.

influences from the neighbourhood, they reason, could play a greater role in causing CTs than
is commonly assumed. In the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau form, such conservative
forces can be expressed with a parameter μ indicating the size of the particle population partic-
ipating in the interactions that drive the transition. Fig 8 visualizes the differences in μ as dif-
ferent depths of the attractor basins.
A lower μ thus would indicate a smaller number of interacting particles, or in network
terms, a lower link degree. In Fig 8 we differentiate the μ condition with respect to the low-
degree/high-degree-cluster-disti nction in our networks in section 2 and 3, thus associating

μ = 0.5 with a sparsely linked condition and μ = 1.5 with a more tensely linked condition. As
can be seen, a marble on the surface minimum of the (blue) low-degree condition would have
a significantly earlier transition point, or in terms of EWS: a higher variance in case of pertur-
bations, than the one on the (orange) surface minimum of the high-degree condition. The
low-degree clusters have less resilience, and thus react faster to the changes in h in the case of a
spinodal instability, as expressed in the middle image in Fig 8.
Such spinodal instabilities have been associated with earthquakes [35] and with a wide vari-
ety of sociological and economic phenomena, such as market crashes, spontaneous adoption
of new technologies, or even political revolutions [36], with one of its characteristics being the
avalanche cascade with which the transition proceeds. Such cascading transitions are charac-
teristic also for the fibre bundle model [37], which in its simplest form represents a system of
fibres to which a linearly increasing load is applied. Each fibre in the bundle has an individual
threshold of how much strain it can withstand before it breaks. If the least strong fibre breaks,
the load is distributed to the remaining fibres, causing further ruptures of exponentially
increasing size, until a single rupture orders magnitude greater than all preceding ones causes
catastrophic failure of the entire bundle. In the Ising model, similar is known as Barkhausen
effect caused by the avalanches of spin flips as the magnetic field increases.
The fibre bundle model provides a vivid example of the effect of conservative forces in the
descriptions above. The bundle offers resistance to the load. The more fibres in the bundle, the
more resistance. Less fibres, less resistance. The spin-shifting model described in the model 1
section above can be seen as an equivalent of the so-called local load sharing version of the
fibre bundle model [17], in which the neighborhoods to which the load gets distributed have
different sizes. In both cases, resistance is enacted through neighbors. The sole difference is
that in the spin model the driving parameter is considered a probability and not a load. Small
neighbourhoods fall victim to its increase faster than big ones, causing higher variance in small
communities or, respectively, in the sparsely linked network clusters described in the preced-
ing sections.
As similarly shown by [14], this can also be seen by simply calculating the impact of single
spin flips on the overall flipping probability of a node-neighborhood (here done on the exam-
ple of the networked Ising-model. Note however, that [14] was primarily concerned with the
interaction differences between the original 1-dimensional Ising model and a 2-dimensional
version, without any considerations of networks). Assume a neighborhood with all spins being
in state 1 and rising temperature causes one single node to flip into state −1. Only when this
flip leads to a second flip, the transition can gain momentum. The relevant term for this chance
is the difference in energy ΔE, which is linearly dependent on the sum of all neighboring spins
∑
ne
s
ne
. For a node with degree 3 a single flip changes the ∑
ne
s
ne
from 3 to 1, while the change
for a node with degree 7 is only from 7 to 5. Since ΔE appears in the exponent of the spin flip
chance, this difference is even more drastic: For the weakly connected node exp(∑
ne
s
ne
)
changes from � 0.05 to � 0.37, while the flipping probability for a node with degree 7 remains
nearly unaffected, as it changes from � 0.001 to � 0.007. Fig 9 shows the changes in flipping
probability for different degree-neighborhoods as a consequence of one single neighboring
spin flip. Obviously, the change in probability caused by one single spin flip in a neighborhood
decreases exponentially with the increase of the degree of the neighborhood. While changes
are large for weakly connected nodes, they may have little to no impact in high-degree
neighborhoods.
Low-degree neighborhoods thus appear to be way more reactive to small changes in a sys-
tem’s state. They cannot offer much resistance to impending dynamics and thus become the
actual starting points for the development of CTs. One could read this as a low chance for con-
servative forces in sparsely linked network clusters and thus a plea to regard negative feedbacks

of neighboring particles trying to maintain their state against the drive of the critical parame-
ter, and not so much the positive feedback of a propagating rich-get-richer dynamic, as a cen-
tral determinant for the development of a CT. Where there is less conservation, due to a lack
of connections, there is more drive towards change—and hence more signals of an imminent
CT to be gained.
