8.1. INTRODUCTION 
The primary objective of the application of the various linear free energy 
relationships in enzymology, as is often the case in non-enzymic studies of 
this type, is the elucidation of reaction mechanism. Thus, it is expected that

systematic perturbations in the structure of the substrate for a particular 
enzyme will affect the catalysed reaction in such a manner as to provide 
evidence concerning the mode of catalysis, which can be rationally interpreted.

Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to realise the above expectation in a 
straightforward fashion in practice, because every enzymic reaction consists

reaction: non-covalent adsorption of the substrate(s) onto the active site,

of at least two steps which will, in general, respond differently to structural 
changes in a substrate. This minimal two-step mechanism is illustrated 
schematically in Fig. 8.1, in which the step (1) is shown as an adsorption of 
the substrate onto the enzyme surface to form an enzyme-substrate complex, 
in a process analogous to that occurring in heterogeneous catalysis. This 
adsorption step does not involve the making or breaking of covalent bonds. 
The subsequent steps are concerned with the conversion of the substrate(s) 
into product(s), and must necessarily involve a redistribution of covalent 
bonds. These two processes can be expected to respond in different ways to 
structural modifications of the substrate, and the resulting change in the 
observed rate of the enzyme-catalysed reaction will in general reflect a 
change in each of the processes. 
The specificity of the adsorption reaction is generally quite rigorous and in 
some cases absolute or nearly so. Even minor modifications in substrate 
structure usually severely reduce the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme, 
or cause it to be bound in such a way as totally to preclude the subsequent 
catalytic steps. An example of such a fastidious enzyme is urease, which 
catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and water, and which will 
accept only mono- or di-hydroxyurea as alternative substrates. 1 •2 
The high degree of specificity exhibited by enzymes has been recognised for 
many years and was explained by Fischer in terms of a 'lock and key' hypo­
thesis.3 Recently it has become clear that the idea of a rigid template, as 
implied by Fischer, must in many instances be modified to what has come to 
be known as the 'induced fit' model, in which the substrate induces a
