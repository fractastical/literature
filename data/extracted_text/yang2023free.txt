Abstract: The free energy of nucleosomal DNA plays a key role in the formation of nucleosomes in
eukaryotes. Some work on the free energy of nucleosomal DNA have been carried out in experiments.
However, the relationships between the free energy of nucleosomal DNA and its conformation,
especially its topology, remain unclear in theory. By combining the Landau theory, the Hopﬁon model
and experimental data, we ﬁnd that the free energy of nucleosomal DNA is at the lower level. With
the help of the energy minimum principle, we conclude that nucleosomal DNA stays in a stable state.
Moreover, we discover that small perturbations on nucleosomal DNA have little effect on its free
energy. This implies that nucleosomal DNA has a certain redundancy in order to stay stable. This
explains why nucleosomal DNA will not change signiﬁcantly due to small perturbations.

theory; Hopﬁon model
1. Introduction
It is well known that DNA is genetic material. DNA is a semi-ﬂexible polymeric
macromolecule [1–3]. The diameter of the cross-section of a double helix is about 20 Å [3].
But its length is up to the centimeter scale [ 4–6]. DNA is prone to forming disordered
knots, which can have detrimental effects on its biological functions. In order to avoid this
entanglement, eukaryotes have evolved nucleosomes, which wrap the DNA around the
histone octamer, to achieve an unentangled compaction of DNA. Then, the nucleosome
forms chromatin ﬁber. The chromatin ﬁber further folds into topologically associated
domains via the process of loop extrusion mediated by chromosome structure maintenance
complexes [7]. Finally, DNA is compacted into a very small volume of the cell nucleus
and performs various biological functions correctly. The nucleosome is the basic unit of
chromatin [8]. There are four types of proteins to form the histone octamer. The histone
octamer is wrapped around by approximately 145–147 bp in a left-handed superhelix. The
turns of the wrapping are about 1.7 [9–11]. All of these constitute complex structures called
nucleosome core particles (NCPs). The DNA on the histone octamer is called nucleosomal
DNA. The H1 histone associates with the linker DNA on the entry and exit sites of the
NCPs [12]. The nucleosomal DNA is locked at the entry and exit points of the NCPs by
histone H1. Thus, we take nucleosomal DNA as a closed circular DNA, which can be
considered a knot. Moreover, nucleosomes are a dynamic platform for connecting and
integrating various biological processes [ 13–15]. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the
dynamic changes in the nucleosome structure.
In recent years, a lot of work has been carried out regarding the nucleosome DNA’s con-
formation and free energy [13,16–20]. With the development of technology, more and more
single-molecule mechanics experiments have shown that force and free energy are impor-
tant parameters for understanding the biochemical processes at the molecular scale [21–25].
Free energy is also the bridge between theoretical calculations and experimental data [26].
Especially, in Ref. [27], the authors deﬁne the fraction of native contacts Q to represent the

free energy of the histone octamer. They obtained the free energy landscape during the
process of the assembly of the histone octamer in the frame of a predictive coarse-grained
DNA–protein model. Then, the free energy proﬁle of the full nucleosome disassembly as a
function of the radius of gyration is presented. The results show the number of base pairs
bound to the histone octamer decreases with an increase in the radius of gyration. The
free energy proﬁle has an inﬂection point and there is a minimal value near the radius

A. They also veriﬁed the asymmetry of DNA unwrapping. How does the free
energy of the nucleosomal DNA wrapped around the histone octamer behave?
To answer the above question, we take closed circular DNA as a knot, which is de-
scribed by the linking number. Then, we combine the Landau theory and the Hopﬁon
model to derive the free energy density of the DNA. The free energy density has a rela-
tionship with the linking number and other geometrical parameters [28]. Finally, we apply
the free energy density to the nucleosomal DNA and discuss how the linking number
and geometrical parameters affect the free energy. The results show the free energy of
the nucleosomal DNA is at a lower level. The formation of a stable nucleosomal DNA
may not be accidental and may follow the energy minimum principle. In addition, we
also ﬁnd that the nucleosomal DNA has a certain redundancy from the viewpoint of free
energy. The small changes in the conformation of the nucleosomal DNA have little effect
on its free energy. These ensure to keep the nucleosomal DNA relatively stable. When the
perturbations are removed, DNA can automatically revert to its original structure.
2. Theory
2.1. The Topology and Mechanical Properties of Nucleosomal DNA
DNA undergoes bending and twisting to form various complex topological structures;
its topology properties follow White’s formula:SL = Wr + Tw [29]. SL is the self-linking
number, which is the number of strands crossing the other when double-stranded DNA is
completely unwound. It is an integer that does not change as long as the double strands
do not break. The self-linking number can be calculated from a two-dimensional diagram
of a framed curve, obtained using its projection on a selected plane. Then, the self-linking
number is given by Lk = Wr + Tw. Wr is the writhing number of the DNA helix axis and
Tw is the twisting number of the DNA. Both Wr and Tw can be non-integers, which are not
topological numbers. Canonical NCPs are generally formed of B-DNA with 145–147 bp,
which wraps around a histone octamer approximately 1.7 times in a left-handed helix. For
example, 1KX5 [30] and 5AVC [31] are the NCPs of humans, which are selected from the
Protein Data Bank. Their structures are shown in Figure 1a–d. The schematic diagram of
the NCPs is displayed in Figure 1e,f.
In this paper, we assume the nucleosomal DNA is a B-form double helix with 147 bp.
Therefore, the linking number of the nucleosomal DNA can be given by [3]
Lk = N
ni
, (1)
where N is the total number of base pairs of the nucleosomal DNA and ni is the number
of the base pairs per turn of the DNA double helix, where ni = 10.5 [3,10,11]. Therefore,
the linking number of the nucleosomal DNA with 147 bp is Lk = 147
10.5 = 14. The nu-
cleosomal DNA wraps around a histone octamer by 1.75 turns in a left-handed fashion.
So, Wr = −1.75. Based on White’s formula, it is known that the writhing number can
transfer to the twisting number for closed circular DNA. The twisting number changes
with −∆Lk when the writhing number changes with ∆Lk. This leads the linking number Lk
to be a topological invariant if the closed circular DNA does not break. For a linear chain,
the linking number is not a topological invariant. Therefore, the twisting number of the
nucleosomal DNA is Tw = 14 −(−1.75) =15.75.

top view of the NCPs. Where the gray part represents the histone octamer core, the pink/purple part
represents the DNA double helix. The black dotted line represents the axis of the DNA double-helix.
A and B represent the ends of one turn of a helix of the nucleosomal DNA. O is the geometry center
of the NCPs. θ is the angle corresponding to the arc length joining the ends of one turn of the helix of
the nucleosomal DNA. l is the pitch of the nucleosomal DNA. ˜r is the distance from the geometric
center of NCPs to the axis of DNA double-helix.
It is well known that the diameter of a B-DNA double helix is d = 2 nm and the
distance between the adjacent base pairs is l = 0.34 nm. The radius of the NCPs is
r = 5.5 nm [32,33]. The sketch of the top view of the NCPs as shown in Figure 1f. From
the top view, it can be seen that the nucleosomal DNA helix axis forms a circle. The center
of the circle is exactly the geometric center of the NCPs. The distance between the DNA
helix axis and the geometrical center of the NCPs is the radius of the circle. Considering
the diameter of the NCPs is 11 nm and the diameter of the B-DNA is 2 nm, the radius of
the circle is ˜r = 4.5 nm. The bending is a key factor in the DNA conformation, which has a
signiﬁcant effect on the free energy of DNA. So, we should deﬁne a quantity to describe
it. Taking one pitch of the nucleosomal DNA as a unit of arc length, the average bending
angle corresponding to the unit arc length is θ = |Wr|×360◦
Tw = 1.75×360◦
15.75 = 40◦. This angle
can be used to describe the bending of the helix.
The mechanical properties of the nucleosomal DNA can be expressed using the bend-
ing rigidity and torsional rigidity. Let us consider the bending persistence of the B-DNA
is lp = B/kBT [1], where lp = 50 nm. B is the bending rigidity of the B-DNA. kB is the
Boltzmann constant, kB = 1.38 ×10−23 J/K [34,35]. T is the absolute temperature, where
T = 300 K. Therefore, the bending rigidity of the B-DNA is taken asB = 2.07 ×10−19 J ·nm.
Similarly, the torsional rigidity of the B-DNA isC = 3.933 ×10−19 J ·nm, where its torsional
persistence length of lt = 95 nm [36].
2.2. The DNA Free Energy Relating to Its Topology
In Ref. [37], one end of the linear DNA is ﬁxed on the glass coverslips and the other
end is ﬁxed on the magnetic beads. The magnetic tweezers formed using an external
magnetic ﬁeld can control the magnetic beads. They applied a negative torque to the DNA
by rotating the magnetic tweezer. Then, they found that the minute negative superhelicity
can facilitate the B–Z transition at low tension with the help of the single-molecule Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET). The experimental schematic is shown in Figure 2a. If
Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1686 4 of 13
τ > τc, the DNA left-handed helical DNA converts into the right-handed helical DNA. If
τ < τc, the opposite is true. In this process, the local interactions between the successive
base pairs play an important role in the transition. This local interaction can be described
using the chiral gauge potential ρ, which is just the rotational angle between the successive
base pairs. ρ > 0 and ρ < 0 represent the DNA in the right-handed helix and left-handed
helix, respectively. Thus, the effective potential energy of the DNA [38] is expressed as:
Ve f f(ρ) =V0
[( ρ
ω0
)2
−1
]2
−(τ −τc)ρ, (2)
where V0 = 6 ×10−21 J. ω0 is the helix rotation angle between the consecutive base pairs;
ω0 = 2π/ni = 0.6 rad/bp [36]. τ is the external torque applied to the ends of the linear
DNA molecule. The critical torque τc is −7.9 ×10−21 J. The effective potential energy
diagram is shown in Figure 2b. Therefore, the mutual transformation between the different
conformations of DNA can be taken as the phase transition. Then, the chiral gauge potential
is the bridge between the local interaction of the DNA base pairs and global conformation.
Figure 2. (a) Schematic diagram of the magnetic tweezer experiment [ 37–39]. ( b) The effective
potential energy proﬁle.
The Landau theory is the basic theory for describing the phase transition. It introduces
symmetry breaking into the phase transition and expands the free energy density function
with the power series of the order parameters. The equilibrium stability of the structure can
be determined using the minimum of the free energy density function [40]. In the frame of
the Landau thoery, the free energy density relating to the conformation of the DNA can be
given as [38],

where k1 = 4B, and k1 + k2 = 4C. k1 and k2 are physical quantities relating to the DNA
bending and torsion, respectively. s is the arc length parameter along the DNA helix axis.
Ψ is the two-component order parameter that describes the conformation of the DNA. The
relationship between the two-component order parameter and the Euler angle is given as:
Ψ = (cos θ

where φ, θ and χ are the Euler angles. The ﬁrst part of Equation (4) describes the confor-

where dφ

ds represent the rotation degree of the DNA helix axis, the bending
degree of the DNA helix axis and its deviation degree from the plane perpendicular to the
helix axis, respectively. The ﬁrst term in Equation (7) is the curvature of the DNA helix.
The second term is the torsion of the DNA helix [26], which is τ = dφ

obtain the twisting number of DNA by integrating it: Tw = 1

length of the DNA. If we know the curvature and torsion of the helix, Equation (7) also
can be used to investigate the free energy of the nucleosomal DNA when it is decomposed
from the histone octamer.
Figure 3. Euler rotation of the DNA helix axis. Firstly, the DNA helix axis is rotated clockwise around
the z axis by angle φ. Then, the helix is rotated around y′by angle θ. Finally, the helix rotates around
the z′′ axis by angle χ. The value range of θ is (0, π).
Linear DNA is the major subject of in vitro experiments. However, DNA rarely exists
in a simple linear conﬁguration in vivo [42]. In eukaryotes, DNA wraps around the histone
octamer to form nucleosome, and via the process of loop extrusion, chromatin ﬁbers
composed of nucleosomes can be further folded into chromosome structures, mediated by
chromosomal structure maintenance complexes [7]. The loops formed during the process
of loop extrusion can be represented and modeled as closed circles [ 43,44]. In addition,
the closed circular DNA of prokaryotes also twists into superhelical structures [ 45–47].
The nucleosomal DNA can be modeled as closed circular DNA because it is locked by
the histone H1, the topological object is called a DNA knot. The topology of the DNA
knot follows White’s formula. In addition, the torus knots can be described by Hopﬁons,
Biomolecules 2023, 13, 1686 6 of 13
which are closed twisted baby Skyrmion strings. In Ref. [ 48], the two-component order
parameters relating to the torus knots are introduced as:
Ψ = (cos Re−iPϕ) sin ReiQΘ), (8)
where ϕ is the rotational angle of the base pairs in the toroidal direction. Θ is the rotational
angle in the poloidal direction. They are shown in Figure 4. P is the twisted number of the
knot in the toroidal direction. Q is the twisted number of the knot in the poloidal direction.
The Hopﬁons can be described using the Hopf charge, which is deﬁned as,
W = PQ, (9)
here, the Hopf charge is just the linking number of the nucleosomal DNA, that is, W = Lk.

Based on Equations (4) and (8), if the DNA knot can be expressed as a torus knot or a
Hopﬁon, we have the following relationship
θ = 2R
φ = Pϕ + QΘ
χ = Pϕ −QΘ.
(10)
These equations are just the mappings that build the relationships between the DNA knots
and torus knots. In the case of a nucleosome, the NCPs can be bended into the torus
under the map (10). Then, the DNA knot becomes the torus knot. In fact, we assume the
number P is just the writhing number Wr. R is the bending angle of the DNA helix axis
after the mapping. Based on the Equation (10), the value range of R is (0, π
2 ). As shown
in Figure 4, these angles are not real angles, but they relate to the Euler angles. This map
also gives us a bridge to ﬁnd the relationships between the linking number and Hopf

charge. Although the relations between the general knots and torus knots are not very
clear [48–50], Equation (10) provides us with a new perspective to explore the DNA knot.
We can substitute Equation (10) into Equation (7),

3. Results
3.1. The Free Energy of Nucleosomal DNA
Now, we apply the free energy to the nucleosomal DNA in the NCPs. Based on the
previous discussion, the linking number Lk of the nucleosomal DNA with 147 bp is Lk = 14.
The average bending angle of the nucleosomal DNA per unit arc length on the histone
octamer core is θ = 40◦. By recalling Lk = W and θ = 2R, we have W = 14 and R = 20◦
after mapping the nucleosomal DNA onto the toroidal domain wall. The schematic diagram
for the NCPs is given in Figure 5a. Since P and Q are integers, there are four possibilities
for their values: P = 1 and Q = 14; P = 2 and Q = 7; P = 7 and Q = 2; P = 14 and
Q = 1, respectively.
Let us assume that the change rates ofϕ and Θ are identical: m = 1 and n = 1. The free
energy proﬁles and the histogram of the nucleosomal DNA with P = 1, 2, 7, 14are shown
in Figure 5b. We ﬁnd that the free energy of the nucleosomal DNA has a minimum when
P = 2. According to general experimental data relating to nucleosomes R = 20◦, the free
energy of the nucleosomal DNA with P = 1.75 is very close to the minimum. This implies
the free energy of nucleosomal DNA may follow the minimum energy principle in order to
stay stable. The construction of the NCPs may not be randomly generated, but carefully
designed. The free energy proﬁles with different R values are plotted in Figure 5c. These
proﬁles show that the minimum of the free energy depends on the value of R. For example,
the minimum of the free energy is about 1071 ·bkBT at P = 2.1 when R = 22◦. The free
energy proﬁle is plotted as the blue line in Figure 5c. The minimum of the free energy is
about is 938 ·bkBT at P = 1.9 when R = 18◦. The free energy proﬁle is plotted as the black
line in Figure 5c. The minimum of the free energy also increases with R and decreases
when R decreases. We also ﬁnd the value of P corresponding to the minimum of the free
energy increases when R increases. We present a histogram that shows the minimums of
the free energy with different R values in Figure 5d. We also ﬁnd the differences between
the minimums with different R values are very small.

red circles refer to the free energy’s values when P takes an integer. (d) The histogram shows the
minimum of the free energy with different R values. The schematic diagram also devotes the values

3.2. The Free Energy of Nucleosomal DNA with Different Diameters of Histone Octamers
The diameter of the histone octamer may change in the processes of replication,
transcription and so on. These will lead to the changes in the parameters W and R. In the
following, we discussed how the parameters W and R affect the DNA’s free energy.
In order to explore how R affects the free energy of nucleosomal DNA, we set m = 1,
n = 1 and W = 14. In this case, the diameter of the histone octamer core is 7 nm, which
is used as a benchmark. We also consider the length and pitch of DNA are invariant. If
the eight histones are so loosely bound, the radius of the histone octamer increases. The
bending angle corresponding to the unit arc length of the nucleosomal DNA becomes
smaller. The turns of the nucleosomal DNA wrapping around the histone octamer core
will decrease. The result is Wr becomes smaller, as shown in Figure 6a. To an extreme
extent, the nucleosomal DNA barely bends anymore and becomes almost straight-stranded
when the eight histones are disassembled, as shown in Figure 6b. Conversely, if the eight
histones are more tightly bound, the radius of the histone octamer core decreases. This
leads to the nucleosomal DNA bending at a large angle. Then, the turns of the nucleosomal
DNA wrapping around the histone octamer core will increase, that is, Wr will become
larger. This is shown in Figure 6c. The free energy proﬁles of the nucleosomal DNA are
plotted in Figure 6d. It presents the minimum of the free energy increases as the angle R
increases. The value of P corresponding to the minimum of the free energy also increases.
This indicates that DNA needs more energy to wrap around the histone octamer core
tightly. In turn, the tightness of the binding of the eight histones also affects the free
energy of the nucleosomal DNA. We present the free energies at P = 2 and P = 1.75
when R = 5◦, 12◦, 20◦, 30◦in Figure 6e. We ﬁnd the differences between the free energies
are small, especially for R = 5◦, 12◦, 20◦. These results mean small changes in R have
little effect on the free energy of the nucleosomal DNA. These show the conformation of
nucleosomal DNA has some redundancy. That is, a small change in R slightly affects the
stability of the nucleosomal DNA.

free energy’s values whenP takes an integer. (e) Histogram of the free energy of DNA corresponding
to the different angles at P = 2, P = 1.75 when W = 14, m = 1, n = 1.
3.3. The Free Energy of Nucleosomal DNA with Different Linking Numbers
In this section, we discuss how the linking number Lk affects the free energy of
nucleosomal DNA. We setm = 1, n = 1, R = 20◦. Let us assume the diameter of the histone
octamer core and pitch of the nucleosomal DNA wrapped around the histone octamer are
constant. When the DNA length is 63 bp, the number of turns of the nucleosomal DNA
wrapping around the histone octamer core is 0.75. Then, its linking number is 6. A sketch
of its structure is shown in Figure 7a. The free energy proﬁle is plotted as the orange line in
Figure 7b. When the DNA length is 168 bp, the number of turns of the nucleosomal DNA
wrapping around the histone octamer core is 2. Then, its linking number is 16. The sketch
of its structure is shown in Figure 7c. The free energy proﬁle is plotted as the red line in
Figure 7b. When the DNA length is 189 bp, the number of turns of the nucleosomal DNA
wrapping around the histone octamer core is 2.25 and its linking number is 18. The sketch
of its structure is shown in Figure 7d. The free energy proﬁle is plotted as the black line in
Figure 7b.
Comparing the free energy proﬁles in Figure 7b, it can be found that the minimum of
the free energy becomes larger as the linking number increases. The P value corresponding
to the minimum free energy also increases. This is consistent with the fact that the longer
the nucleosomal DNA is, the more energy it has. The free energy of the nucleosomal DNA is
low when the nucleosomal DNA is too short. The number of turns of the nucleosomal DNA
wrapping around the histone octamer is even less than one. This makes such structure
unstable and meaningless, as shown in Figure 7a. When the nucleosomal DNA is too
long, its free energy becomes big. This leads the NCPs to be unstable. On the other hand,
the height of the histone octamer core should be less than 6 nm. The diameter of the
nucleosomal DNA is 2 nm and its superhelical pitch is 2.8 nm [33]. So, this means that the
number of the turns of the nucleosomal DNA wrapping around the histone octamer core is
not greater than 3. Therefore, the DNA cannot be too long. The sketch shown in Figure 7d
would not be possible in organism.

red circles represent the free energy’s values whenP takes integer. (c) Sketch of the NCPs for Lk = 16.
(d) Sketch of the NCPs for Lk = 18. ( e) Histogram of the free energy of DNA corresponding to
different Lk values when R = 20◦, m = 1, n = 1, P = 2, P = 1.75.
The histogram of the free energy of nucleosomal DNA with different W values is
presented at P = 2, P = 1.75 when Lk = 6, 14, 16, 18in Figure 7e. We ﬁnd the difference
between these free energies is small except for Lk = 18. That means the free energy of the
nucleosomal DNA only changes slightly as long as the length and conformation of the
nucleosomal DNA do not change dramatically. The NCPs can stay in a dynamic stable
state. This reveals that the nucleosomal DNA on the histone octamer has some redundancy,
which keeps its conformation stable.
4. Discussion
The parameters of nucleosomal DNA, such as the bending angle θ, the bending
elastic rigidity B and torsion elastic rigidity C, can be calculated and found from the
general experimental data. In this paper, we have θ = 20◦, B = 2.07 ×10−19 J ·nm and
C = 3.933 ×10−19 J ·nm. Some other parameters, such as the change rate of the toroidal
angel m and the change rate of the poloidal angle n on the torus, are not easy to calculate.
In general, we set m = n = 1. We ﬁnd there is a minimum in the free energy proﬁle
of the nucleosomal DNA under any conditions. The structure of the nucleosomal DNA
should be the most stable when its free energy takes the minimum according to the energy
minimum principle. In this model, the free energy of real nucleosomal DNA takes a
minimum at P = 2. We ﬁnd the free energy of the nucleosomal DNA with P = 1.75 is very
close to the minimum. Therefore, we believe the construction of NCPs is not randomly
generated, but has been carefully designed. The formation of NCPs may follow the energy
minimum principle.
Furthermore, it can be found that the changes in the free energy are very gentle near
the minimum when the parameters vary slightly based on Figures 5c, 6b and 7b. This
means that small perturbations have little effect on the structure and free energy of the
nucleosomal DNA. We infer the nucleosomal DNA structure should be in a dynamically
stable state near the minimum of free energy. When perturbation is removed, we think
that nucleosomal DNA should automatically return to a stable state. This indicates that
nucleosomal DNA has some redundancy. The ability of nucleosomes to serve as dynamic
platforms for connecting and integrating multiple biological processes may dependent

on their redundancy. When nucleosomal DNA is involved in biological processes, such
as transcription and replication, the nucleosomal DNA needs to be unwrapped from the
histone octamer core. If the degree of unwrapping is small, the unwrapped DNA can
be quickly rewrapped. However, when the external environment changes signiﬁcantly,
resulting in huge changes in the structural parameters, the corresponding free energy
will also increase dramatically. At this time, the structure of nucleosomal DNA may be
disrupted and it is difﬁcult to restore it to its original conﬁguration. These results are
consistent with the phenomena observed in the previous studies [ 17,19,51]. This also
may be one of the reasons why the lengths of nucleosomal DNA in different species are
different, but the number of turns wrapping around the histone octamer core is always
around 1.7. Moreover, we hypothesize that DNA also could fold in the same way without
the histone octamer because this is determined by the mechanical properties of the DNA.
However, the histone octamer is the skeleton that keeps the nucleosome more stable. We
also think that other proteins, such as bacterial Fis, HU and others, also can fold to form
complex geometrical conformations. These conformations are also determined by their
mechanical properties.
