Multiple theoretical models of dissociative experiences have been formulated over 
the last century. These theories are clinically useful; however, it remains unclear 
if common factors exist in various pathways leading to an onset of dissociations. 
In this paper we provide a framework for building an integrated, dynamical model 
of dissociative experiences. This framework combines a first-principles-based 
perspective with nonlinear dynamical systems, clinical, and neurobiological 
perspectives. We  propose that a substantial change in the parameter we  call 
“temporal depth” can be a common factor in dissociative episodes of any etiology, 
moreover, we consider such a change to have causal power. In the follow-up 
series of papers, we will provide empirical data supporting the collapse of temporal 
depth in various kinds of dissociative experiences, a computer simulation that 
would test this model’s computational components, and preliminary ideas for 
therapeutic applications.

There is no self in a given moment: the self is defined by persistence over time. 
(Mitchell, 2023)
1 Introduction
Dissociative disorders (DDs), including dissociative identity disorder (DID) and 
depersonalization derealization disorder (DPDR), are prevalent in clinical practice. 
Loewenstein (2018) summarized international epidemiological studies in North America, 
Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and reported that in clinical samples, including both 
inpatient and outpatient populations, the prevalence of DDs reached 46%. In a comprehensive 
review, Boyer et  al. (2022)  reported that the lifetime prevalence of DDs in the general 
population was estimated to be higher than that of bipolar disorder or obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD), in their 
third version of the guidelines for the treatment of dissociative disorders, reported that DDs 
significantly impair patients’ functioning and present considerable risk – 67 percent of the 
patients diagnosed with DDs reported a history of repeated suicide attempts (International 
Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2011).
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org
Dissociative disorders are difficult to diagnose. Individuals with 
DDs, on average, spend from 5 to 12.4 years in some form of mental 
health treatment before receiving an accurate diagnosis (Boyer et al., 
2022). Several reasons have been proposed to account for this, 
including the clinician’s difficulty in imagining this level of 
psychopathology, the patient’s lack of trust in disclosing awareness of 
their dissociative difficulties and the patient’s unawareness that they 
dissociate. When the diagnosis is reached, outpatient psychotherapy 
is typically recommended for DDs as the front-line treatment, while 
pharmacological treatments show marginal efficacy ( International 
Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2011).
Trauma-related etiological models of DDs appears to have 
stronger support among clinicians than alternative theories 
(International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 
2011). More specifically, prolonged elevation of stress accompanied by 
repeated traumatic experiences in circumstances where a person has 
no escape (e.g., chronic childhood abuse and neglect) are associated 
with dissociative conditions (reviewed in Lanius et al., 2018; see also 
Vonderlin et  al., 2018). Clinicians refer to these circumstances as 
complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD, see Herman, 2015), 
which has a different profile from one or several traumatic exposures, 
leading to the onset of post-traumatic symptoms (referred to as Acute 
PTSD). Indeed, approximately 90 percent of individuals with DID in 
the United States, Canada, and Europe experienced childhood abuse 
and neglect (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).
This article is the first one in a series of papers that present an 
integrated theoretical model of dissociative experiences. We hope in this 
series of papers to highlight one of the common factors that mediate an 
onset of dissociative symptoms in various etiological scenarios, such as 
psychological trauma, panic disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy, lesions in 
the brain, and the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or ketamine. 
We  suggest that despite the important differences in various causes 
leading to the onset of dissociative symptoms, there is likely a common 
pathway where various kinds of pathogenesis converge.
The latest International Society for the Study of Trauma and 
Dissociation (2011) recommendations for psychotherapy of patients 
with DDs suggest that “treatment should move the patient toward 
better integrated functioning whenever possible (p. 132). ” Our view 
is that by “better integrated functioning” they refer to the better 
integration of the patient’s Self. We see the Self as a process in time 
and a coherent linkage of the Self through time is related to the core 
concept of our paper, the “temporal depth, ” which represents how 
far into the future the agent can plan and how far from the past it 
can recall. A collapse of the temporal depth may lead an agent to 
living in the “here and now”1 accompanied by the inability to access 
knowledge of the past or plan for the future. We  propose that 
1 A collapse to zero (living in the “here and now”) and a collapse to infinity 
(being unable to differentiate immediate future from long-term future) are 
both the forms of temporal depth collapse that lead to dissociations. If one 
cannot distinguish planning for tomorrow from planning for 10 years from 
now, one cannot plan. Both states involve a collapse of distinctions between 
the different temporal scales relative to present time, or to current experience. 
In our paper, the mathematical term “collapse” will correspond to any transition 
from a single, well-defined, long-term coherent and continuous agent to a 
shorter, fragmented, discontinuous, or incoherent agent. Thus, a “collapse” 
restoring the patient’s temporal depth is a common prerequisite for 
the stability, coherence, and continuity of the Self.
An additional component of our model as applied to 
psychotherapy is that both integration and disintegration are necessary 
at different times during the therapeutic process. We suggest that for 
the patient who experiences persistent dissociative symptoms, some 
features of DID or DPDR become relatively stable. A shift from these 
maladaptive regimes toward a more integrated, coherent Self implies 
a de-stabilization of the maladaptive regime (technically, an attractor 
landscape) corresponding to DID or DPDR and subsequent 
stabilization of an alternative ‘healthy functioning’ regime. In other 
words, while the long-term therapy goal should be  the improved 
stability of the integrated, coherent Self, getting there may require a 
change, which is a destabilization of the maladaptive dynamics.
We find it useful to contextualize our proposal in the diverse literature 
on dissociative experiences that accumulated over the course of a century. 
Ludovic Dugas, who coined the term ‘depersonalization’ in 1898, was 
studying the psychopathology of “false memories, ” including déjà vu 
(Sierra, 2009). Thus, phenomenology, the patient’s subjective experiences, 
was the original method of inquiry. Subsequently, many theoretical 
models of depersonalization and derealization were developed, including 
theories implicating the sensory systems, memory, affect, etc. (see Sierra 
and Berrios, 1997 for review).
Some of the current theories of depersonalization, derealization, 
and dissociative amnesia (Deane et al., 2020; Ciaunica et al., 2022) 
employ a top-down approach, where these dissociative states were 
modeled based on first principles, such as the Free Energy Principle 
(FEP , see Parr et  al., 2022 for review). Other researchers chose a 
bottom-up approach, aiming to find the underlying mechanisms and 
structures of dissociative symptoms ( Murphy, 2023; Lanius et  al., 
2018). In addition, clinicians working for decades with patients 
suffering from chronic dissociations share valuable qualitative 
observations, which add the richness of the patient’s subjective data to 
the abstract theoretical models (Chefetz, 2015).
Such diversity of viewpoints is clearly appropriate for the level of 
complexity in dissociative experiences. However, one of the challenges 
related to this multitude of models is that the authors from various 
disciplines use different terminology and methods of research and no 
current theory seems to coherently integrate phenomenology, 
dynamics, neurobiology, and other relevant perspectives. 
Psychotherapists are often reluctant to read papers with differential 
equations, such as those routinely used in the FEP articles (e.g., 
Friston et al., 2023). Similarly, some academic psychologists are less 
familiar with the clinical setting. Clinicians are justifiably concerned 
when researchers who have no clinical experience opine on how to 
best help the patients in psychotherapy (Shedler, 2006). Researchers, 
on the other hand, justifiably state that qualitative clinical case reports 
are useful, but often not sufficient to formulate the causal models of 
the clinical phenomena; and such reports can be augmented with 
falsifiable hypotheses, rigorous testing, etc.
We think that all these viewpoints usefully complement each 
other. Clinicians are correct that the abstract models of dissociative 
experiences lose the essential qualia. Consider the experience of one 
can be from well-defined (single) to poorly defined (multiple or fragmented), 
or from coherent to incoherent.
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
of Chefetz’s (2015) patients: “ At one point I picked up the phone, was 
talking to my boss [while typing], and saw the words come out of my 
hands onto the computer screen, but they did not hit my brain and 
I  had no idea what was going on. (p.125)” Can these subjective 
experiences be captured in mathematics or neurobiology?
The abstract models of dissociative experiences necessarily coarse 
grain the subjective human experiences. Such models help us see 
patterns and make testable predictions.2 However, this process comes 
at the cost of losing some of the depth of phenomenology.
An additional issue leading to the possible 
miscommunications between various theorists and practitioners 
is the heterogeneity of dissociative experiences. As an example, 
some clinicians suggest that affective flattening is an essential 
characteristic feature of dissociative disorders. However, they do 
not mention that post-traumatic flashbacks, which are also a kind 
of dissociation, are often accompanied by intense feelings, such 
as helplessness, pain, or rage.
We acknowledge the heterogeneity, which stands in contrast to 
drawing the bright lines in the definitions of depersonalization, 
derealization, and dissociative amnesia – separating some of them as the 
“true kind” of dissociative experiences. In agreement with Chefetz (2015), 
we take an approach of seeing dissociative experiences as heterogeneous 
and gradual, ranging from common, benign dissociative experiences to 
more severe, maladaptive forms of dissociative symptoms in DID or DPDR.
We hope in this and following papers to provide a possible 
interface for the collaboration of various disciplines involved and offer 
a model that attempts to integrate these perspectives. This model will 
necessarily be described in broad strokes as a preliminary framework. 
We will start by describing how we view a coherent and continuous 
mental/subjective Self from an information-theoretic perspective, 
including the Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME, 
Levin, 2022) and the FEP ( Parr et al., 2022 ). We will then discuss 
dissociations from the dynamical systems perspective, as well as from 
contemporary neurobiological and clinical perspectives.
An important contribution of our model is to highlight the role of 
temporal depth collapse in dissociative experiences. A possible 
relationship between temporal depth and depersonalization has been 
previously suggested (Deane et al., 2020).3 Moreover, Friston (2018) 
wrote extensively on temporal depth being a necessary component 
underlying self-consciousness. In our paper, we would like to extend 
this hypothesis further, to a causal relationship. We suggest that a 
functional collapse in temporal depth leads to dissociative experiences, 
including depersonalization.
To clarify, we think that a collapse in a temporal depth can 
be an intermediate step in the chain of events leading to dissociative 
2 An example of a successful use of modeling in a biological system is Levin’s 
(2021) model of cancer. While a focus on just one aspect of cancer in that 
paper presents a simplification of complex cancer etiology, it allows to make 
testable predictions, and it is experimentally supported.
3 While Deane et al. (2020) suggests a possibility of a relationship between temporal 
depth and dissociations, we make a claim that a collapse of the temporal depth 
causes the onset of dissociative symptoms. We further suggest that temporal depth 
collapse can be conceptualized as a common pathway for the onset of dissociative 
symptoms in circumstances of variable etiology. Finally, we suggest that the focus 
on restoring temporal depth can be an effective strategy in therapeutic intervensions.
experiences; it is unlikely to be an ‘original’ or the only cause. For 
example, a problem with the functioning of the person’s episodic 
memory system can lead to the temporal depth collapse and 
dissociative experiences. We  claim, based on the theoretical 
considerations to be developed below, that a dissociative experience 
reliably follows a temporal depth collapse, and a collapse of a 
temporal depth will reliably lead to a dissociative experience. 
We  propose, in other words, that temporal depth collapse and 
dissociative experiences are highly correlated, with the former 
preceding and playing a causal role in the latter.
Formally testing the temporal depth collapse leading to an 
onset of a dissociative episode in humans would require an 
experiment. We have not identified non-invasive methods of 
temporarily and harmlessly reducing temporal depth in humans 
while keeping other relevant functions intact. In macaques, 
cryogenic deactivation technology has been used to temporarily 
deactivate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and other brain 
regions ( Chan et al., 2015 ). However, we do not have a reliable 
way of assessing dissociative experiences in macaques.
In the absence of the experimental design to prove or falsify 
our hypothesis for humans, we are left with the analysis of the 
literature where temporal depth collapse and dissociative 
experiences co-occur. These data are correlational and serve as 
an indirect illustration of our model’s main thesis. In the 
follow-up papers we will present: (a) the empirical data showing 
this correlation in patients experiencing various kinds of 
dissociative experiences; (b) an analysis of currently used 
psychotherapeutic measures that we think influence the changes 
in the patient’s temporal depth; (c) a computer simulation that 
would test our model’s computational components.
Subsequently, should the computer simulation results support our 
hypothesis, we are hopeful to conduct additional studies with human 
subjects evaluating a relationship between temporal depth collapse 
and dissociative experiences. Such studies have already been done 
with individuals exposed to THC in laboratory settings (Melges et al., 
1970; Mathew et al., 1993) and DPDR (Simeon et al., 2007). We hope 
to extend this work to an investigation of temporal depth variations 
in patients suffering from DDs before and after a comprehensive 
course of psychotherapy, such as psychotherapy incorporating Finding 
Solid Ground framework (Brand et al., 2022).
The measures used in these prior studies included a questionnaire 
called Temporal Integration Inventory (TII, Melges et  al., 1970) a 
cognitive test evaluating temporal integration called Goal-Directed 
Serial Alternation (GDSA, Melges et al., 1970), one of the standard 
questionnaires evaluating dissociative symptoms, called the 
Dissociative Experience Scale (DES, Bernstein and Putnam, 1986), 
and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.
We are open to a possibility that adding the measures of 
temporal integration/disintegration, such as TII and GDSA, to 
the evaluations of patients with DDs undergoing psychotherapy 
may lead to a more nuanced version of our hypothesis as applied 
to these cases, such as the hypothesis formulated by Simeon et al. 
(2007)  that the relationship between temporal depth and 
dissociative experiences is mediated by a parameter called 
“absorption. ” Absorption is defined as “the use of one’s full 
commitment of available perceptual, motoric, imaginative, and 
ideational resources to a unified representation of the attentional 
object” ( Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974 ). When absorption scores 
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
are sufficiently high, the changes in the person’s consciousness 
are such that he/she perceives nearly everything, including time, 
as a part of a “fantasy world. ” A person experiencing persistent 
dissociative symptoms and scoring high on absorption could 
perceive their past, their dreams, or television shows as reality. 4
In what follows, we  will describe the key concepts from the 
theoretical frameworks we appeal to in this paper, we will then use 
these theories to formulate an information-theoretic model of the Self 
experienced by an agent in health and pathology. These parts of the 
paper (Sections 2.1–3.3) are dense in computational and mathematical 
terminology. We provided a Glossary and illustrations for the key 
terms; however, this may be insufficient for the clinical audience less 
fluent with the computational frameworks. Reaching clinicians is 
highly important for us, as clinical efficacy is the primary goal of our 
efforts. Therefore, starting from Section 3.3 we included the clinical 
practice and neurobiological perspectives on dissociative symptoms 
and temporal depth, and we will provide less computationally dense 
materials in the subsequent papers.5
2 TAME and FEP as modeling 
frameworks
2.1 Technological approach to mind 
everywhere (TAME)
The emerging field of Diverse Intelligence seeks to develop 
rigorous frameworks for understanding and relating to unconventional 
minds (Baluška and Levin, 2016; Orive et al., 2019; Pio-Lopez, 2021). 
This ranges from biologically non-neurotypical humans to the 
impending plethora of altered, chimeric, and extended beings whose 
presence will explode outdated binary categories of orgainsm vs. 
machine (Clawson and Levin, 2022; Rouleau and Levin, 2023). One 
such framework is TAME (Levin, 2022), which is grounded in the 
biological principles governing the self-assembly of bodies and minds 
from cells during embryogenesis (Levin, 2019) and the fragmentation 
of emergent wholes by failure modes such as the morphogenetic 
dissociation disorder we call cancer (Levin, 2021).
The TAME framework is based on three foundational principles: (a) 
a commitment to gradualism; (b) an absence of privileged material 
substrates (material independence); and (c) a commitment to an empirical 
approach to research questions as compared to a philosophical debate in 
the absence of empirical data. The first principle suggests that there are no 
bright lines separating various organisms in terms of the complexity of 
4 In and of itself, without involuntary, persistent dissociative symptoms, high 
absorption may be beneficial in a highly demanding or even survival-critical 
situation (e.g., high-speed driving in traffic). We will discuss this point later in 
the paper when we describe voluntary versus involuntary dissociations.
5 We will present a model of a coherent and continuous Self (mental Self, 
e.g., Self experienced by an agent) in Section 3 of this paper, which will also 
include the concepts described elsewhere, e.g., subcomponents of the Self in 
Chapters 8 and 9 of Seth (2021), a concept of the Core Self in Chapter 11 in 
Panksepp and Biven (2012) , a discussion of temporal depth in Deane et al. 
(2020). Where our views deviate from these sources, we will articulate the 
differences as appropriate.
their minds; instead, there is a gradual accumulation of complexity and 
organization. The second principle suggests that minds are not exclusive 
to neuron-based systems, or computer hardware-based systems; there is 
no privileged material that is necessary for the specific kinds of a mind to 
operate. The third principle suggests that experimental data, rather than 
opinions or conventions, are the appropriate standard of deciding on how 
intelligent a system is and how much agency it has.
One of the key concepts of TAME for our paper is the cognitive 
light cone, which is schematically depicted below on Figure 1. This 
concept captures the scale of an agent’s ability to use the past 
experiences to inform its present actions and to plan into the future, 
as well as the scale of its spatial goals. Put differently, TAME light cone 
is a measure of the biggest goal that an agent can pursue in space and 
in time. As you can see in the diagram, a tick operates in its immediate 
spatial environment and has very limited planning ability or memory 
of the past. A dog has a larger TAME light cone – it can travel further 
and can recall and plan more. Humans can support huge cognitive 
light cones that span the globe and have a time horizon known to 
be longer than their possible life span.
The size of the TAME light cone on the vertical axis is related to the 
focal concept in our paper – temporal depth. Y ou can also see compound 
intelligences on Figure 1, including both a collective of cells - an organism 
and the collectives of animals, such as an ant colony. Under TAME, all 
intelligences are collective. An important feature of the TAME light cone 
concept with respect to the compound intelligences is emergence. An ant 
cannot build bridges, while an ant colony collectively can accomplish this; 
and a collective of cells can navigate a maze (Blackiston et al., 2021). What 
this implies is that the compound Self is not reducible to its components, 
a whole Self is greater than the sum of its parts, which is another way of 
saying that the compound Self is a non-linear system6 (see Rosas et al., 
2024 for a technical treatment of the notion of “emergence” implied here).
Levin’s (2021) proposed model of a possible etiological pathway 
to cancer as the result of breakdown in communications between the 
adjacent cells is, perhaps, one of the most relevant examples of TAME 
framework applied to the concept of dissociation. Specifically, the 
closing of the gap junctions (intercellular connections that allow 
passage of small molecules) of one cell leads to it perceiving the rest 
of the cells as “not me” or “the environment. ” This, in turn, leads to this 
newly isolated cell treating the environment as a food source; this cell 
also reproduces leading to metastasis.
The breakdown in the communications between cells effectively led 
to the fragmentation of the cell collective into two parts – the isolated cell, 
and the collective of cells without it. Should there be a closure of the gap 
junction in yet another cell in the remaining cell collective, that would in 
turn lead to further fragmentation into more entities. When one cell 
becomes informationally isolated from its neighbors, the previous cell 
collective’s cognitive light cone fragments into several smaller ones, 
leading to the temporal depth collapse. Therefore, the breakdown in 
communications between the components leads to both the spatial 
fragmentation and the loss of temporal continuity.
6 As nearly a tautology, non-linear systems are not additive. What this means 
is that a collection of components of a non-linear system added together will 
not produce the entire system. Nonlinear systems cannot be deconstructed 
into modules without a loss of functioning.
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
In the following section, we will show how the TAME cognitive light 
cone, its fragmentation and temporal depth collapse are equivalently 
described in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) framework.
2.2 Free energy principle
The free energy principle (FEP) was formulated by Karl 
Friston in the 2000s as a mathematical theory in neurobiology 
and extended thereafter to a general theory of living systems 
(Friston, 2013 ). One of the key ideas in FEP is that any system 
that persists will act to maintain its distinction from its 
environment. Stated more formally, Ramstead (2023)  summarized 
one of the primary FEP claims as follows: “The free energy 
principle (FEP) says that if the generative model (or dependence 
structure) of a random dynamical system contains a Markov 
blanket (a conceptual boundary between the inside and the 
outside), then it will look as if internal states track the statistics 
of external states across the boundary. ”
The Markov blanket is depicted on Figure 2. In a biological organism 
it is assumed to be composed of Active states and Sensory states.
To highlight what is pertinent for our paper, FEP suggests 
that a system that maintains its existence in the environment 
necessarily models this environment. This model generates 
predictions of inputs from the environment, so is termed a 
“generative model”; one can think of it as encoding the agent’s 
beliefs about how external states cause its sensory states. For 
example, if an agent senses warmth, it can infer probabilistically 
that the sun is shining on it. These models of the world are 
inferred from and hence adapted to the environment as 
it changes.
Some systems described in the classical FEP do not have 
Active States (e.g., a rock). In the presence of active states, the 
agent is also capable of model-driven action on the environment, 
and it does so in such a way as to introduce environmental 
changes in order to match the environment to the agent’s model 
(i.e., Active Inference: Parr et al., 2022 ). For example, a human 
has an internal belief that she can breathe; should she find herself 
immersed in water for more than a minute, she will attempt to get 
back to the surface to reduce the discrepancy between her model 
of being able to breathe air and the environment.
The generative models under FEP can have variable depth 
(see figure 12 in Friston et al., 2023 ). Agents with limited memory 
are only capable of modelling their immediate environment and 
live in the “here and now, ” while agents with sufficient memory 
and processing power are capable of planning actions into the 
future. The generative models capable of planning are referred to 
as “temporally deep generative models. ” The temporal depth 
introduced above can be formally described under the FEP as the 
length of the temporal horizon that is considered during 
planning, where planning entails counterfactually evaluating the 
consequences of future courses of action ( Friston, 2018 ).

3 A model of the subjective (mental) 
Self7
3.1 TAME and FEP perspectives
3.1.1 Material independent and belief-based
We see the Self as a component of a system’s generative model that 
can be implemented by systems of diverse material and structure. The Self 
is constructed dynamically from an organism’s – indeed, any system’s – 
continual efforts at making sense of both its external environment and its 
internal milieu. Therefore, our model of the Self is not inherently based 
on the physiology of the human body, including the physiology of the 
Central Nervous System (CNS). The CNS is just one of the environments 
where such models can be  implemented. As we  apply our model to 
mammals, including humans, we will describe the specific aspect of our 
model, the Core Self (see 3.1.2 below), which is embodied and evolved to 
help mammals adapt to their habitats and problem-solve in novel 
environments. While closely related to the body of a specific animal and 
its natural environment, the specific implementation of the Core Self can 
also be described in abstract FEP terms, e.g., in Solms (2021).
In addition, we see the organism as a system encoding beliefs 
(technically, probability distributions) that predict its own states and 
those of its world. The Self depends upon an organism’s ability to infer, 
i.e., on its generative model. The organism implements a generative 
model, some components of which are beliefs about the organism’s 
environment and other components of which are beliefs about the 
organism itself. We call the latter components the “self-model, ” as it is 
experienced by an agent, or the “Self. ”
7 We will refer to the mental/subjective Self as simply Self hereafter. In 
addition, by Self we will mean the whole Self, including all its components 
described in this section (e.g., the Core Self, the Autobiographical Self, etc.).
In the healthy state, the Self represents the organism as 
embedded in, receiving sensations from, and acting on its 
environment. This representation of embeddedness and 
connection can fail, corresponding, in this model, to the 
pathological state of derealization. In the healthy state, the self 
also represents the organism as an agent with particular sensory 
and action capabilities and a particular remembered past. This 
representation of agency and history can also fail, corresponding, 
in this model, to the pathology of depersonalization.
3.1.2 Hierarchy, composite system, boundaries
As defined above, the Self is a composite, nested, and embedded 
functional system (please see Compound Intelligences of Figure 1 as 
an illustration). We also consider the Self to be a system consisting of 
hierarchically structured beliefs/inferences, which effectively makes it 
a dynamic, hierarchical generative model (Parr et al., 2022).
The Self, taken in its entirety, is informationally separated from its 
external environment by a boundary, a Markov blanket which makes the 
Self conditionally independent from the non-Self (Parr et al., 2022, p.43). 
This boundary allows the Self to have a degree of separation and 
autonomy from its environment. The Self boundary is not material, like 
skin, but it is an informational boundary through which the “Self ” and 
the “not-Self, ” its environment, interact. To clarify, the Self boundary is the 
organism’s model of its biological boundary. We emphasize that the Self, 
as we have defined it above, is a model, and is distinct from the system – 
e.g. the organism – that constructs and implements it.8 The organism’s 
physiological body is not part of its Self, though the organism’s model of 
8 We do not imply philosophical dualism by this statement. We simply draw 
a distinction between an object and its representation or model. For example, 
an actual left foot is distinct from the representation of the left foot in the brain.
FIGURE 2
Structure of a Markov blanket as described by the FEP. Formally, a Markov blanket is a set of “boundary” states that separate the “internal” states of 
some system of interest – here, a brain – from the states of its environment. All interactions between the two must pass through, and hence 
be mediated by, the Markov blanket. Reprinted with permission from Ramstead (2023).

its body is (in general) part of its Self. The Self is, quite literally, a 
“construction of the mind. ”
This is an important point. Any Markov blanket is a boundary in 
state space, not in physical three-dimensional space. A Markov 
blanket exists within the causal network of systemic and environmental 
variables and their causal relationships. While some boundaries 
happen to be simultaneously informational and spatial (e.g., skin), the 
Self ’s Markov blanket is just informational.9 The Self, being a model, 
is an informational structure; hence its environment is also an 
informational structure. The Self ’s Markov blanket separates, and 
maintains the independence between, these informational structures.
Under FEP , the Markov blanket is what separates “the thing” from 
the “not-thing” (Parr et al., 2022). In order for “the thing” to persist in 
time as a unique entity, the boundary’s elements and processes must 
remain functional and satisfy the properties of a Markov blanket, i.e., 
it must maintain conditional statistical independence between the 
“thing” and its environment. The entity informationally demarcated 
by the Self ’s Markov blanket is the Self; the blanket also acts as the 
interface from the Self to its environment. The Self models its 
informational environment, it ‘senses’ it though the sensory states and 
‘acts upon’ it via the active states (Parr et al., 2022).
Various components of the Self are separated from each other by 
their own functional boundaries, also Markov blankets (see Parr et al., 
2022, p.43 for a description of nested Markov blankets). Collectively, 
all these boundaries play an important role in the stability of the Self 
and its various components.
As a hierarchical system, the Self has the “Core Self ” component 
at the informational center of the hierarchy, and other components 
represent more peripheral layers around the Core Self.10 In our model, 
the Core Self is the concept that was described by Panksepp and Biven 
(2012) in Chapter 11 of their book “The Archaeology of Mind: 
Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotions. ” In mammals, the 
essential characteristic of this Core Self is that it is affective. Panksepp 
and Biven postulated that this Core Self was nonreflexive (anoetic) 
and dominated by raw affective feelings, and constituted a part of the 
purely affective, Core form of consciousness ( Solms and 
Turnbull, 2018).
We take the Solms (2021) view on these raw affective experiences 
as “felt uncertainty, ” which is a FEP-based conceptualization. In Solms’ 
model certain organisms do not have affects, but rather inflexible 
innate reflexes, such as a reflex to approach food and to avoid danger. 
Affects present an evolutionary advantage to animals that have them. 
Affects allows an animal to “feel through” the novel problem while 
using a specific homeostatic mechanism as a guide.
For example, if an animal that had never experienced high heat 
before were to find itself in a hot place, it could use the internal feeling 
of the body temperature to guide its actions. The animal will feel better 
when moving closer to shade and worse when moving away from it. 
The further the animal’s body temperature is from the homeostatic 
settling point, the worse it feels. A return from the high body 
9 When we use the spatial terms below in this section, such as “center,” 
“periphery,” “within,” etc., we use them as metaphors.
10 The Core Self also contains subcomponents and is thus a composite 
system in and of itself, it is not a monolithic structure. For the sake of clarity, 
we will not be describing the internal architecture of the Core Self in this paper.
temperature to the settling point would be accompanied by a positive 
feeling of cooling off. When the body temperature returns to the 
settling point, the feeling of being hot disappears entirely. The system 
being at or near the settling point suggests that the biological need 
underlying this affect is met.
This affective mechanism allows an animal to problem solve in 
novel environments. An organism that has only innate reflexes and no 
affects is far less likely to survive in completely unexpected 
circumstances  – it would not have an inner “compass” to guide 
its actions.
A collection of these affective functions that are necessary for the 
animal’s survival constitutes the Core Self. Then, the set of predictions 
in the Core Self is that all the life-sustaining affects will be at or near 
their settling points. This state of balance where all biological needs 
are met corresponds to a minimum in the organism’s Variational Free 
Energy (VFE) – a biologically optimal state. An activation of one of 
the affects indicates a departure from the VFE minimum, which is a 
prediction error.11
Let us now illustrate this concept of the Core Self in 
neurobiological terms, making concrete some of the abstract terms in 
the informational model described above. Panksepp and Biven 
suggested that in mammals, the subcortical structures, including but 
not limited to the upper brain stem and the periaqueductal grey 
(PAG), mediated the functionating of the Core Self subsystem. 
Consequently, the Core Self is thought to be present in decorticated 
cats and hydranencephalic human children (Solms, 2019) – it does not 
require a functional neocortex.
The ‘higher levels’ of the brain’s structure in humans, including the 
neocortex mediate the higher levels of both consciousness and the 
Self – for example, our abilities to reflect on our own mental states and 
report them to others, referred to as an ‘extended consciousness’ 
(Solms and Turnbull, 2018 ). Additionally, the neocortex allows 
humans to have object representations. Then, at the level of the Core 
Self, we can experience a raw, primitive, wordless, but qualitatively 
distinct forms of affect, the nonverbal subjective experience: “I feel like 
this” (e.g., I feel hunger). Solms (2021) suggested that at the level of 
Core consciousness, without words or images, we can still differentiate 
a state of hunger from pain  – qualitatively and subjectively. To 
summarize, with the object representation absent, the agent can still 
experience a raw form of a specific affective distress and then attempt 
to execute the behaviors to alleviate this distress.
However, with the higher levels of consciousness present, we can 
bind an objectless feeling to an object, as Solms (2021) describes it: “I 
feel like this about that (p. 204). ” An example of such extension could 
be “I want an apple. ” Meta-observations about oneself also rely on 
object representations. Therefore, observations such as “I look pale” 
or “I am a pessimist” are various forms of meta-cognition, where the 
“I” is a recognized mental object being reflected on, described, and 
thought about.
Let us reiterate this important point, “I” is a meta-cognitive 
construct, an abstraction, it only exists at the higher levels of the Self 
(e.g., in Autobiographical Self). It is not used, nor is needed in the 
11 The VFE in this model is dimensional, each affect corresponds to a specific 
dimension of the VFE. A prediction error results in the organism’s action, which 
is an attempt to minimize the specific affective dimension of the VFE.
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
Core Self. The Core Self, as a system, has the capacity to detect the 
affective prediction errors and attempt to minimize the VFE through 
action without any “I. ” A meta-cognitive “I” is therefore an illusion in 
a sense of it not being a concrete object in the world; it is an abstract 
concept used in language and other forms of meta-cognitive 
processing (Metzinger, 2004; Seth, 2021; Graziano and Webb, 2015).
One of the reasons Solms and Turnbull (2018)  labeled the 
fundamental, elementary form of consciousness “Core” is because of 
an asymmetry  – the higher levels of consciousness cannot 
be functional without the Core, while the reverse is not true (Solms, 
2021). Solms illustrated this statement with an example from Fischer 
et al. (2016) that a two-cubic-millimeter size lesion in the parabrachial 
nucleus reliably induces a coma, while no lesion that size anywhere in 
the neocortex would cause a cessation of consciousness.
The same can be said about the Core Self with respect to other Self 
components. Peripheral Self components cannot function without the 
operational Core Self, which effectively creates a hierarchical structure. 
In addition, as stated in Section 3.2, the Core Self can change the 
regime of functioning in other Self components by inducing phase 
transitions. Anatomically, in mammals, this corresponds to the 
regions of the brain participating in the Core Self functionality 
influencing the states of the cortical and subcortical brain structures 
through generalized arousal. We agree with Solms (2021) that the 
regions in the upper brain stem, including the Reticular Activating 
System constitute the area upon which consciousness depends; it is 
the source of arousal and, therefore, of consciousness, without it, no 
conscious activity (including the Self) is possible.
At the more informationally peripheral levels of the hierarchy, the 
Self is a composite system containing (a) a Bodily Self (Seth, 2021), an 
Autobiographical Self, 12 a Social Self ( Seth, 2021 ), and other 
components;13 and in which (b) each Self component has its own 
boundary. The Bodily Self refers to a system (generative model) 
dynamically building inferences about our body, including the various 
representations and re-representations of the bodily components, 
interoceptive processing, etc. An Autobiographical Self is a system 
dynamically representing our life’s history. This system relies on both 
the contextualized event memory (episodic) and the generalized, 
factual memory (semantic) in humans. A Social Self is a system 
representing our inferences about how we are seen by others and how 
we present ourselves and act in the social environment. Each of these 
components is embedded into the whole Self and it also contains 
sub-components, creating a nested architecture, as depicted on 
Figure 1.
The non-Core components of the Self are interrelated and 
influence each other. However, each component can experience a level 
of dysfunction while the remaining components remain reasonably 
operational. For example, some level of dysregulation in the 
12 We chose the term Autobiographical Self for what Seth (2021) describes 
as the Narrative Self due to episodic (autobiographical) memories being present 
in rats in the absence of verbal narratives.
13 One of the reasons we do not list each one is that we attempt to describe 
the overall architecture, including the hierarchy. A second reason is that some 
of the peripheral components, such as Seth (2021) “Perspectival Self” are 
debatable as stable constructs. We disagree with Seth on the utility of describing 
first person or third person perspectives as specific Self components.
Autobiographical Self can be accompanied by an intact functioning of 
the Bodily Self and vice versa. Thus, a hierarchical, composite 
structure makes the Self more resilient. With that, a serious 
dysfunction in the Core Self would lead to a total depersonalization–a 
complete loss of all aspects of the Self.
If we  consider one of the Self ’s components–the 
Autobiographical Self, or the Bodily Self, then a coherent and 
continuous, experienced “I am me” also implies that the current 
instance of the “I” in that subsystem is recognized as matching the 
representation of “me” encoded in the subsystem-specific memory. 
Conversely, a prediction error in “I am  me” can be  seen as an 
element of depersonalization. While nearly all the low-level 
components of the underlying physiological architecture (e.g., cells) 
are replaced throughout the person’s lifetime, the continuity of “I 
am me” is maintained at the level of a belief system, i.e., at the level 
of the Self as a constructed model.
Each component of the Self has an overall, unified ‘identity. ’ For 
example, in a Bodily Self it would be ‘my body, ’ which is a belief close 
to the core of the predictive hierarchy–“my body is coherent, persistent 
in time and it is all mine. ” The ‘ownership’ is an important component 
of the bodily Self, and the ownership can also experience various 
forms of dysfunction. Additionally, due to the composite nature of 
each component, it will contain subcomponents, such as ‘my arm. ’ The 
prediction errors related to each subcomponent vary in precision, 
ranging from nonpathological experiences in the rubber hand illusion 
and escalating to the disturbances that can be  seen in 
somatoparaphrenia or body integrity disorder (BID). All these 
prediction errors are, among other things, forms of depersonalization. 
This phenomenon of ‘partial’ depersonalization can scale up to an out 
of body experience (OOB), where the entire body is seen separately as 
an object.
3.1.3 The Self is experienced as a monadic whole 
while being a form of a collective intelligence
According to TAME, all intelligences are collective, while the Self 
is subjectively experienced by humans as a monadic “whole. ” One 
aspect of this seeming contradiction could be  the difference in 
perspectives - the collective intelligence view is usually the perspective 
of an outside observer, while the monadic Self is the perspective from 
within. However, even from this internal perspective, it is not obvious 
how the coherence of the Self is established and maintained. In our 
model, the tentative answer to this question is multifactorial, while 
we realize that it is incomplete.14
Seth (2021) shared a viewpoint on a monadic Self as a form of a 
“delusion” in a sense that it exists only at the level of a subjective belief 
and not in objective (outside) reality. We agree. Specifically, as applied 
to humans, we believe that the higher levels of the Self, such as the 
Autobiographical Self, create an impression of a unified experience, 
but this is just the experience of the Autobiographical Self and not of 
the entire system. The Autobiographical Self ‘claims, ’ to itself and 
others, to be the entire Self, while it is not. Then, it is this meta system 
that is deluded because it “believes its own reports. ”
14 A thesis that collective intelligence participates in human mental 
functioning, particularly its unconscious aspects, has been proposed before, 
e.g., Sulis (1997).
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org
Stated differently, we suggest that the presence of a stable belief “I 
am whole” in the Autobiographical Self ’s generative model contributes 
to us feeling as a monadic Self. Thus, the subjectively perceived unity, 
the coherence of the Self is an inference.
A second component of the coherence of the Self is related to the 
informational scale of this phenomenon  – the macro scale, as 
compared to the micro scale of individual neurons or meso-scale of 
neuronal ensembles. As we move up in the scale of investigation of the 
brain-mind phenomena, we tend to see the aggregation and coarse-
graining of the data. For example, at the macro level of the scalp EEG 
we lose some data on the variability and noise happening at the micro-
level. To illustrate this idea, we can move between the rooms in the 
house, however, from the standpoint of an observer standing outside, 
we remain in the same house – there is perception of higher stability/
order at the higher scale of observation. This is another pathway of 
how the Self is experienced as monadic and coherent at the level of the 
self-conscious, metacognitive mind.
3.1.4 Continuity of the Self in time: the 
assessment of familiarity/novelty
Another quality of the Self is its continuity in time. Similarly to 
the coherence, we suggest that the continuity of the Self in time is an 
inference. Nearly as a tautology stemming from the definition of a 
Markov Blanket, the Self will remain “the same” (persist in time) while 
all the processes/communications across its Markov blanket 
remain functional.
An additional component of the continuity of the Self and its 
various components in time is the experience of familiarity, the 
recognition of the Self to be familiar, not novel. This experience of 
familiarity can be described as a match, e.g., “I am the same now as 
I have been in the past. ”
There is a long history of views on such calculations in 
neuroscience. As stated in Section 1, Dugas studied deja vu, which can 
be described as a temporary dysfunction of the ‘familiarity functional 
system, ’ where something novel is perceived as familiar, while jamais 
vu can be  seen as a dysfunction in another direction  – where 
something familiar is perceived as novel. We could therefore describe 
one aspect of depersonalization as being similar to jamais vu  – 
we perceive our body and mind as novel, unfamiliar.
Empirical data support the presence of the ‘familiarity functional 
systems’ as distinct from other kinds of memory systems; and a 
version of such familiarity assessment can be  present for various 
mental functions (see Y onelinas et al., 2022 for review). For example, 
Meyer and Rust (2018) studied the visual recognition in monkeys and 
have demonstrated that there were dedicated, distributed, dynamical 
brain-mind systems (‘visual recognition memory’) that contributed to 
the familiarity calculations; and these systems were distinct from other 
aspects of visual perception. In a different domain of functioning, 
Darby et al. (2016) suggested that the retrosplenial cortex mediated 
the calculation of familiarity/novelty as part of the Capgras delusion 
in human subjects.
It may seem that the familiarity assessment may appear to 
be similar to a binary on/off switch. However, Meyer and Rust (2018) 
have shown that the predictive inference framework can indeed 
be  used to perform such calculations and these calculations are 
probabilistic and not binary. Specifically, in Meyer and Rust’s view, a 
prediction error in expecting an object to be familiar constitutes the 
reaction of novelty; and such prediction errors can happen with 
variable degrees of precision, they are not all or nothing, even if they 
appear to us as such. The gradual nature of such calculations allows us 
to have the reactions such as: “you seem familiar, but I am not sure, 
did we meet somewhere before?”
To summarize, the familiarity/novelty aspect of 
depersonalization or derealization can be described by the FEP’s 
framework of Bayesian inferences, leading to the degree of 
familiarity being calculated as a continuous variable (Y onelinas et al., 
2022). The subjective impression of us dichotomously perceiving 
something as familiar versus novel can be seen as the coarse graining 
of such continuous calculations, similar to a categorical perception 
of having a fever, while the underlying body temperature calculations 
are continuous.
3.1.5 Representational capacity
The agent who infers must have a functional representational 
capacity for representing the world and itself (Da Costa et al., 2021) – 
a memory system. As noted earlier, the generative model of the Self 
and its components is hierarchical, or deep (Parr et al., 2022). This 
implies that the agent is capable of planning into the future, which, in 
turn, requires an ability to generate, store, and retrieve counterfactual 
data. When the representational capacity is completely impaired for 
any reason, the agent loses an ability to infer, leading to both severe 
depersonalization and derealization. A partial loss of representational 
capacity, e.g., in some form of amnesia, may lead to some loss of 
coherence or continuity in either the model of the inner milieu, the 
environment, or both.
3.1.6 Healthy and pathological temporal depth 
changes
Healthy individuals are able to temporarily expand or contract 
temporal depth voluntarily to some degree through attentional 
control. Temporal depth is expanded during long-term planning, and 
is contracted during attention-demanding tasks, e.g., during “flow” 
states where successful performance is generally not self-conscious. 
During voluntary collapses of the temporal depth, an individual may 
experience a healthy hyper-focused state, e.g., “losing oneself ” in a 
book, or in one’s lover’s eyes, or in meditation,
Involuntary collapses of temporal depth, however, are 
pathological, and may indicate a dysfunction in an underlying 
memory system. Should such memory dysfunction happen, an agent 
who had been capable of recalling the events of the remote past and 
planning far into the future would lose these abilities. The continuity 
of the Self, particularly the metacognitive Self, is partially or 
completely disrupted during such episodes, which is a feature of 
depersonalization. In these circumstances, the absorption experienced 
by these patients (as discussed in Section 1) may be an example of 
involuntary, pathological hyper-focused state.
It is important to highlight that some degree of depersonalization 
can be pursued voluntarily, e.g., in meditative practices (Deane et al., 
2020) that employ intense concentration to temporarily “suspend” the 
metacognitive Self, and that when pursued voluntarily, it is not 
pathological and may even be therapeutic. These experiences being 
voluntary is crucial, as a voluntary action or a voluntary accepted 
experience do not increase the Variational Free Energy in the way that 
an unexpected or involuntary experience does. Computationally, this 
is a key distinction separating such practices from involuntary 
experiences that may lead to the onset of post-traumatic conditions.
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org
3.1.7 Emergence and non-linearity
While being a composite, hierarchical system, the Self is not 
reducible to a set of its components. The functioning of the whole Self 
is not identical to the functioning of an Autobiographical Self added 
to Bodily Self and to other components of Selves – these components 
interact with each other, which creates emergent properties. The Self 
is therefore a dynamical, non-linear system.15 We explore this point in 
more details in Section 3.2.
3.1.8 A relationship between the Self and models 
of the outside world
As noted earlier, we have a generative model of the external world 
(the environment) and a generative model of our body and mind, the 
experienced components of which we call the Self. In some respects, 
the second one can be considered as operating at a higher level of the 
predictive hierarchy than the first one. For example, some 
subcomponents of our Self may include the inferences about how 
we infer about the world. An example could be an observation about 
one’s traits, such as “I am a pessimist” – this is an inference about how 
we model the world.
Several conclusions follow from this observation. One is that these 
‘meta’ parts of the Self tend to operate at the slower time scales than 
the environment model ( Parr et al., 2022 ). This ‘slowing down’ of 
temporal scales is the general trend when we move from the periphery 
to the center of the predictive hierarchy.
Second, the relationship between the generative model of the 
environment and of the internal milieu is indeed complex. One can 
imagine some modelling of the world being functional without any 
meta-inferences about how this process works–the sentience without 
an awareness of sentience (Frith, 2021). Indeed, while we are often 
aware of processing information about the world, e.g., via the feeling 
of mental effort, we are generally ignorant of how this processing 
works. And at other times, our observations at the meta-level can lead 
us to noticing an issue in our interactions with the outside world, such 
as “I am being distractible. ”
Together, the meta and the sub models contribute to the 
hierarchical depth of the generative model and there are many layers 
of the generative model’s hierarchy (e.g., the representations and 
re-representations of the Bodily Self, according to Craig, 2002).
3.1.9 Graduality
Each Self component has a gradual nature, the degrees of 
functioning, as opposed to a binary on/off switch for the entire 
component. What this implies is that depersonalization is a spectrum, 
and it is heterogenous; it is not a discrete, homogenous phenomenon. 
For example, some level of dysfunction in the Autobiographical or the 
Bodily Self can be considered as a degree of depersonalization.
However, the underlying causes of dissociative experiences do not 
have to be  gradual. An acute onset PTSD can lead to the patient 
developing dissociative symptoms abruptly and unexpectedly. 
Similarly, an episode of ketamine intoxication, or an epileptic seizure 
can abruptly result in dissociative experiences.
15 This outlook has been proposed before, e.g., Putnam (2016) and we agree 
with these authors about the non-linearity of the Self.
3.1.10 Model optimization
Under FEP , a specific optimization of the generative model takes 
place  – the accuracy is maximized while the complexity is 
minimized (Parr et al., 2022). What this means for the model of the 
environment and the Self, is that the size of the cognitive light cone 
described in the TAME framework does not need to exceed what is 
necessary for the adaptation of a specific agent to its environment. 
Under FEP , this means that the agent’s goals do not exceed the 
agent’s preferred states and the behaviors that contribute to visiting 
such states. From this perspective, there is a certain economy in 
modeling. A goldfish needs a larger cognitive light cone than a 
bacterium ( Levin, 2022 ). Humans are capable of having huge 
cognitive light cones, but they are not restricted to live permanently 
in a space of long-term plans, a state that would itself be pathological. 
Arguably, this allows humans to have the greatest adaptability to the 
most unusual circumstances for which we have no default (innate) 
strategies.
With that, most people do not operate in a regime of large light 
cones most of the time at every scale of the brain-mind functioning. 
For example, paying attention to some immediate task shrinks the 
cognitive light cone to the near present. One does not daydream while 
rock climbing, at least not for long. The light cone of an awake and 
healthy conscious mind may be adaptable to the task at hand. Having 
a tight temporal focus is not pathological and is sometimes necessary 
for survival.
3.2 Dynamical systems perspective on the 
health and pathology of the self
The generative models corresponding to each component of the 
Self operate in various regimes in health and pathology depending on 
the level of generalized arousal and other circumstances (Tolchinsky, 
2023). The system’s change from one regime to another can 
be described as a phase transition.
When a healthy human subject is awake, we can describe the state 
space of each Self subcomponent, such as an Autobiographical Self, as 
operating in a point attractor regime, corresponding to “I am me. ” The 
dissociative experiences in this regime can be mild and benign. The 
agent returns from these brief fluctuations to the equilibrium point of 
“I am  me. ” Put differently, if system is mildly disturbed from the 
equilibrium point, it will reliably return to it; and if it starts from an 
initial condition of a mild dissociation it will return to the equilibrium 
as well. Such slight deviations from the point attractor (the lowest 
plane of the attractor landscape) can be described as operating in the 
basin of the point attractor (see Figure 3 for an illustration). The basin 
consists of all initial conditions that lead to the state of equilibrium “I 
am me. ” In such an attractor landscape a dissociation cannot persist, 
it is only temporary and mild.
The lowest point of the point attractor corresponds to a minimum 
of the VFE. A point attractor regime is stable and without external 
interference of sufficient power, no change in this regime is expected. 
An acute psychological trauma is one of the examples of such 
interference, which we think can lead to a phase transition, a period 
of instability, possibly a chaotic regime of functioning. The repeated 
and lasting traumatization, such as in C-PTSD can also lead to the 
destabilization of a point attractor regime of the Self. Then, from a 
temporarily destabilized, possibly chaotic regime of functioning, the 
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org
attractor landscape can evolve to various new regimes of some 
stability, corresponding to the specific post-traumatic presentations.
One of these presentations is the onset of a disorder with chronic 
and persistent dissociative experiences such as DID or DPDR. As 
depersonalizations and derealizations become more intense and 
frequent, a new attractor/repellor landscape corresponding to these 
experiences evolves. The onset of DID or DPDR is therefore another 
phase transition, from a transiently chaotic regime to a landscape 
where relatively stable states corresponding to dissociations are 
formed. Thus, when a specific pathological condition “takes root, ” the 
system transitions to a multistable mode (Kelso, 2012) with multiple 
coexisting point attractors. For example, in DID, multiple point 
attractors may emerge corresponding to each of the alters. See Figure 4 
for an illustration.
In DID, when the patient is switching between the alters, we can 
see an itinerancy, which can be  described as a finite set of point 
attractors, each corresponding to a specific alter in a ‘fragmented’ 
Autobiographical Self that has lost its cohesion. The patient’s 
Autobiographical Self being in the state of alter X can be seen as the 
system moving to the basin of the point attractor “alter X. ” The repellor 
regions in the state space between the point attractors can display 
chaotic dynamics as expected for the boundary region between the 
two adjacent point attractors. Accordingly, the switch from one alter 
to another one is not clearly predictable.
Along with the disruption of cohesion of the Autobiographical 
Self with the onset of DID, the continuity of time is disrupted as well. 
The switch from alter X to alter Y disrupts the alter X’s time continuity. 
Then, effectively, each alter has its own temporary cognitive light cone 
that is smaller than the light cone of a coherent Self.
Considering the variability in DID, the exact landscape of 
attractors and repellors may vary depending on the patient’s 
circumstances and context. On Figure 4 you can see that the local 
minima of the VFE corresponding to each of the alters is surrounded 
by a global minimum of VFE corresponding to a coherent Self. This is 
one of the possible options. An alternative possibility, perhaps at a 
higher level of pathology, is that the VFE landscape has changed so 
much that the VFE in the minima of the decoherent Self are lower 
than VFE of coherent one. Such a condition can be seen as more stable 
in psychopathology and therefore, more “treatment resistant. ”
The attractor landscape corresponding to DID or DPDR may be a 
relatively stable regime, which is unlikely to change without some 
form of external interference of sufficient power. Psychotherapy can 
be such an intervention. In some circumstances, psychotherapy can 
be augmented with psychodelic treatment or neurostimulation, all of 
which are various forms of temporarily destabilizing the maladaptive 
attractor landscape. Then, in treatment, another phase transition can 
take place to a transiently unstable, possibly chaotic regime with a 
long-term goal of eventually arriving at a landscape corresponding to 
healthier functioning.16
Then, as recovery from DID or DPDR takes place in 
psychotherapy, the attractor landscape can change back to the single 
point attractor regime corresponding to a coherent Self, or at least to 
an attractor landscape that can be seen as somewhat more coherent–
with less local point attractors.
While the phase transition from health to DID is influenced by 
the external factors that are outside the patient’s control, such as an 
exposure to a single or multiple traumatic events, psychotherapy can 
be seen as a controlled, or guided phase transition.
We can describe the specific processes underlying such phase 
transitions as follows. The nested and embedded Self, containing the 
Core Self and peripheral Self components, corresponds to a hierarchy 
of coupled or interconnected attractors. Consistent with FEP , the 
attractors closer to the Core can be seen as operating at slower time 
scales. Friston and Kiebel (2009) have suggested that a hierarchical 
system of coupled attractors can be  used to describe the phase 
transitions, such as a slower attractor possibly controlling the phase 
transitions of a faster attractor. A similar idea called Orbital 
Decomposition has been proposed by Guastello et al. (1998) for the 
hierarchical dynamical systems where one chaotic attractor can 
be decomposed into a series of limit cycle attractors; then, an element 
of control can be seen in increasing the relative power of one of these 
limit cycle attractors.
16 The therapeutic interventions can only change the free energy landscape. 
It is not possible to go uphill in an existing, stable VFE landscape. Therefore, 
in therapeutic work, we may have a goal to erase the current local minima 
corresponding to the alters in DID or to shift the location of the global 
minimum.

Based on these ideas by Friston and Guastello, in our model, 
we propose that the attractor landscape corresponding to the Core Self 
is influencing the phase transitions of the peripheral Self ’s attractors, 
such as Autobiographical Self. As stated previously, the Core Self is 
inherently affective. One of the components of any affective state is 
generalized arousal. It has been proposed elsewhere that the changes 
in the generalized arousal level can lead to the phase transitions of the 
entire neocortex from a periodic to chaotic state and back (Tolchinsky, 
2023). Similarly, an acute psychological trauma can be described as an 
affective ‘storm, ’ starting from the Core Self increasing the level of 
generalized arousal, leading to higher energy states in the peripheral 
Self components, which, in turn, may result in the de-stabilization of 
the ‘healthy’ point attractor regime in the Autobiographical Self.
An onset of persistent dissociative symptoms in post-trauma can 
be  seen as an adaptation of the peripheral Self components (e.g., 
Autobiographical Self) into a lower-energy regime, where the affective 
numbness may take place. This corresponds to the Autobiographical 
Self “settling down” into a multistable attractor landscape 
corresponding to DID. Conversely, in an active phase of trauma 
psychotherapy, the patient is gradually able to tolerate affects to some 
degree and the Autobiographical Self is moving to a higher energy 
state, not in an abrupt episode of an affective storm, but in a more 
gradual fashion. This may be  sufficient to cause a controlled 
de-stabilization of a multistable DID attractor landscape into a 
temporarily chaotic state, while holding in focus a long-term goal of 
treatment - to lead the attractor landscape eventually to one 
corresponding to a coherent Autobiographical Self.
The dynamics described above will influence the temporal depth 
in the relevant Self components. For example, intact temporal depth 
is a prerequisite to maintaining the temporal continuity in the 
Autobiographical Self. Then, a transitional, chaotic phase will 
be  accompanied by a temporary collapse in the Autobiographical 
temporal depth. An onset of persistent dissociations, corresponding 
to a multistable attractor regime, will result in a fragmentation of the 
temporal depth. To summarize, some stability in the attractor 
landscape is necessary for the maintenance of a healthy temporal 
depth in each Self component. Conversely, the phase transitions in the 
attractor landscape and fragmentations, such as an onset of 
multistabilty will result in the temporal depth collapse.
In the following two sections we will supplement our theoretical 
model with the clinical practice-based and neurobiological viewpoints 
on dissociative symptoms and temporal depth.
3.3 Clinical practice perspective
Clinicians specializing in dissociations highlight the role of affect 
in dissociative disorders, more so than memory (Chefetz, 2024, 
personal communications). What they refer to specifically is the 
quality of “emotional flatness, ” sometimes described by patients as 
“emotional deadness, ” or “numbness. ”
This clinical perspective can be integrated with the theoretical 
models described above. Specifically, the emotional flattening 
corresponds to an issue with the communications between the Core 
Self and the peripheral Self ’s components via the Core Self ’s Markov 
Blanket. For example, the Autobiographical Self in this regime 
operates as if it is uninformed by the vital emotional information flows 
that originate in the Core Self due to the suppression of such 
information flowing from the Core to the Autobiographical Self across 
the boundary.
As stated earlier, the Core Self is affective. Each affective system in 
Panksepp’s framework is complex multi-tiered hierarchy with 
bottom-up and top-down communications (see Figure  2.3  in 
Panksepp and Biven, 2012). The emotional flattening corresponds to 
the predominance of the top-down communications and the 
downregulation of the bottom-up flows. One of the ways this may 
be achieved is the prefrontal cortex inhibiting the limbic structures, as 
described in Section 3.4 below. At the higher levels of consciousness, 
then, we perceive affects as less intense. In FEP terms this corresponds 
to the top-down lowering of precision associated with affective 
prediction error messages.
Furthermore, as noted in Section 3.3, the emotional flatness in 
DID or DPDR corresponds to the ‘settling down’ of the 
Autobiographical Self ’s attractor landscape to a multistable regime 
accompanied by a decrease in generalized arousal.
It is necessary to repeat here that emotional flatness represents 
only one kind of dissociative experience, perhaps a characteristic one 
for patients with DID or DPDR. A posttraumatic flashback, on the 
other hand, is accompanied by intense affective activation and it is also 
a form of dissociation.
Moving on from psychological trauma to other causal factors 
leading to dissociations, we  can consider an extreme example  - a 
complete, involuntary dissociation in humans under general 
anesthesia. In that state, we have nearly no functional memory beyond 
basic reflexes (breathing) and no options to choose from. The Self is 
absent when the individual neurons are dissociated by the anesthetic’s 
blockade of the bioelectrical connections (Peracchia, 1991; Wentlandt 
et al., 2006) – the individual cells are fine but the large network capable 
of grandiose thoughts and goals has temporarily disappeared.
A patient’s recovery from general anesthesia may present a 
temporarily chaotic regime, which can be seen as a phase transition 
that in most circumstances leads to the point attractor regime “I 
am  me” in each Self subcomponent  – with the same identity the 
person had prior to being anesthetized. However, in some cases, 
particularly with elderly patients undergoing long-lasting operations, 
the patient may experience postoperative delirium ( Rengel et  al., 
2018), dissociative amnesia ( Chang et  al., 2002 ), postoperative 
cognitive dysfunction (POCD, Kotekar et al., 2018). While the exact 
causes of these conditions are poorly understood, a review by Storrs 
(2014) suggests that the duration and dynamics of recovery from 
general anesthesia may be less predictable than was previously thought.
An additional clinical example of a severe dissociation is a seizure, 
where not only the Autobiographical “I am me” is disrupted, but also 
the Social Self and possibly other Self components. Similarly to general 
anesthesia, the necessary resources for the functioning of most, if not 
all Self models are not operational in this regime. At the level of the 
scalp EEG dynamics, during a seizure, the neocortex shifts from a 
chaotic regime in healthy functioning (gamma to high gamma 
rhythms) to a more orderly regime of slow, high amplitude waves 
(Tolchinsky, 2023).
Transitions in the sleep/wake cycle can also be seen as potentially 
leading to a regime change in the Self dynamics. Some theorists 
suggest that a labile sleep–wake cycle may lead to an intrusion of a 
dream-like regime into wakefulness, which may lead to dissociative 
symptoms, including depersonalization (van der Kloet et al., 2012). In 
addition, the researchers studying derealization report the patients 
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org
describing this state as being dream-like (van Heugten-van der Kloet 
and Lynn, 2020).
The process of waking up in the morning can also be seen as a 
phase transition in the Autobiographical Self, because the orientation 
to person, place, and time does not happen instantaneously as we wake 
up (Seth, 2021) and the continuity of the Autobiographical “I am me” 
does not persist in a linear form as we go through all the transitions 
in the sleep–wake cycle. Accordingly, individuals with a significant 
impairment in Autobiographical self, such as Clive Wearing, report 
their daytime experiences as a series of awakenings, as if they wake up 
again and again every few minutes (Seth, 2021).
Similarly, substances, such as ketamine can induce a state of 
consciousness where the Autobiographical or Bodily sense of “I 
am me” is disrupted, which implies going through a phase transition 
into a possibly chaotic regime. Notably, patients during the episodes 
of THC-induced dissociations were found to show features of 
temporal disintegration (Mathew et  al., 1993). Coull et  al. (2011) 
reported disrupted time perception in individuals taking ketamine.
To summarize, the level of consciousness, the regime of 
consciousness, pathological states, and all the underlying resources 
necessary for the successful operation of each Self component 
collectively influence the complex dynamics of the system. A point 
attractor regime “I am me” in an Autobiographical, Bodily, or other 
Self components may persist for some time in a healthy, awake human 
being and such continuity requires the specific state and level of 
consciousness, as well as the underlying resources, such as a certain 
level of generalized arousal and functional memory systems.
3.4 Neurobiological perspective
3.4.1 Corticolimbic inhibition hypothesis
One of the historically influential neurobiological hypotheses of 
dissociative disorders is the corticolimbic inhibition ( Sierra and 
Berrios, 1998). According to this model, DPDR is associated with a 
hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which results in the PFC 
exerting increased inhibition of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) 
and the limbic structures, including the amygdala.
Sierra and Berrios (1998)  hypothesized that the activation of 
the right dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) was accompanied by increased 
alertness while the reciprocal inhibition of the ACC by the right 
dlPFC was possibly responsible for the experiences of “mind 
emptiness” and “indifference to pain. ” They further hypothesized 
that the activation of left PFC regions was responsible for the 
increased inhibition of the amygdala, which, according to Sierra 
and Berrios, was responsible for the hypo-emotionality, 
dampened autonomic output experienced by the patients as the 
feelings of unreality or detachment.
Subsequent neuroimaging-based studies provided partial support 
of this hypothesis and suggested that this model would benefit from a 
revision, such as taking into account the dynamics and contextuality.
For example, Felmingham et al. (2008) who studied PTSD patients 
with dissociative and non-dissociative presentations via functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), reported that patients with 
dissociative PTSD showed the activation of the ventral PFC while 
consciously processing fear-evoking visual stimuli, but not in response 
to subliminally presented fear-evoking visual stimuli. Felmingham 
et al. (2008) reported that in response to the subliminally presented 
fear-evoking visual stimuli patients with dissociative PTSD showed 
the activation of bilateral amygdala, insula, and left thalamus.
More recently, Medford et al. (2016) used fMRI while presenting 
visually emotive stimuli to 14 patients with DPDR, as compared to 25 
healthy controls. Their results showed decreased activity in the 
amygdala and hypothalamus in the patient group, coupled with 
increased activity in the prefrontal regions. However, they did not find 
differences in the ACC. Additionally, they reported that emotional 
dampening in the clinical group was associated with reduced activity 
in the insula, while patients who experienced some improvement in 
treatment showed increased insula activity on the fMRI. Sierra and 
Berrios (1998)  did not mention the insula as part of their 
“corticolimbic” inhibition hypothesis.
Lanius et al. ’s (2018) paper can be considered as one of the possible 
revisions of the original corticolimbic inhibition hypothesis. They 
reviewed recent neuroimaging literature associated with a range of 
clinical conditions with dissociations – the dissociative subtype of 
PTSD (PTSD + DS), DID, and dissociations in borderline personality 
disorder (BDP). Their review supported one of the components of 
Sierra and Berrios’s (1998)  hypothesis–that the emotional 
dysregulation in patients experiencing a dissociative state can be due 
to excessive inhibition by the prefrontal regions of the limbic 
structures, including the amygdala. Lanius et al. referred to this regime 
as ‘overmodulation’ .
With that, they refined Sierra and Berrios’s hypothesis by 
describing the specific post-traumatic and dissociative regimes and 
states when the centromedial amygdala (CMA) and basolateral 
amygdala (BLA) were activated. They also expanded Sierra and 
Berrios’s (1998) model by including the functioning of the dorsolateral 
and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (dl-PAG and vl-PAG 
respectively), as well as thalamus  – making the network of brain 
regions involved more complex than the network described in the 
original Sierra and Berrios’s hypothesis.
As another change, Lanius et al. (2018) suggested that while the 
overmodulation state dominated in patients with PTSD+DS, these 
patients oscillated between the more prevalent overmodulation and 
less frequent ‘undermodulation’ regime (excessive activity of the 
amygdala and hypoactive PFC). In addition, Lanius and colleagues 
reported that the patients with DID showed varying patterns of 
activation in different states of functioning. When these patients were 
observed as in a state with access to the traumatic memories, they 
showed undermodulation accompanied by thalamic perfusion, as 
compared to the state of dissociative amnesia.
These observations add dynamics to the original cortico-limbic 
inhibition model and correspond to what we described in Section 3.3 - 
an itinerancy around the characteristic states in a disorder 
corresponding to the specific attractor/repellor landscape of 
this disorder.
3.4.2 Potential neurobiological correlates of 
temporal depth collapse
One of the pathways for a temporal depth collapse is dysfunction 
in various memory systems supporting temporal depth, including 
episodic memory, working memory, memories related to the 
functioning of the internal bodily systems (Craig, 2002), etc.
These memory systems can operate at different time scales – 
an Autobiographical Self that relies on episodic and semantic 
memory can operate on a scale from minutes to years, while 
Tolchinsky et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585315
Frontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org
working memory can operate on a scale from seconds to several 
minutes. Importantly, these memory systems, among their many 
functions, allow us to integrate experiences. For example, a 
sequence of episodic memories allows us to have a coherent 
autobiographical narrative - our personal history ( Mitchell, 
2023). A continuous functioning of our working memory 
supports thinking, in which individual thoughts consist of 
concepts sequenced together and stabilized for some time. 
We  then perceive the sequence of these thoughts as a “train 
of thought. ”
The brain networks mediating the functionality of these memory 
systems are distributed and complex and describing them in detail is 
beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is worth mentioning some 
key components that contribute to these systems.
For example, episodic memory encoding will become 
permanently dysfunctional with the bilateral damage of the 
hippocampus (Seth, 2021; Baddeley et al., 2020). Patients with such 
damage, including Clive Wearing (Seth, 2021) can be described as 
perpetually depersonalized - they do not have a continuous 
Autobiographical Self.
A temporary disruption of episodic memory encoding 
happens during an acute psychological trauma, where a 
significant elevation of cortisol leads to a temporary dysfunction 
of the hippocampus that is rich in cortisol receptors ( Solms and 
Turnbull, 2018 ). Consequently, the episodic memory of the 
traumatic event might not be not encoded reliably. Thus, an acute 
trauma may result in the discontinuity in the patient’s 
Autobiographical Self. A similar autobiographic discontinuity 
can be observed as a result of an epileptic seizure; however, not 
only episodic but also other memory systems would 
be discontinuous around the time of the seizure.
A complete dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the 
frontoparietal network would likely render the patient’s working 
memory dysfunctional (Baddeley et al., 2020). A patient experiencing 
this state may present as psychotic. It may be hard to assess the severity 
of the disruption in the coherence of their various Selves, as it would 
be  hard to interview them. The Bodily Self would likely 
be dysfunctional with damage to the anterior and posterior insula 
(Craig, 2002).
4 Summary
The Self in our model has a nested structure with embedded 
components and a deep generative model. Stated differently, it is 
an integrated, multi-layered dynamical system, whose complexity 
level exceeds that of its components. The size of the Self ’s 
cognitive light cone is one of the measures of its complexity – its 
temporal depth.
As mentioned in Section 1, the individuals who experienced 
prolonged, inescapable exposure to highly stressful environments, 
accompanied by repeated traumatic experiences, tend to develop 
dissociative disorders. In our model, we  can describe this 
environmental exposure as lasting stress beyond the agent’s ability to 
manage. Normal cognitive activity - memory access, planning, and 
redirection of attention under executive control - is disrupted in this 
regime, leading to a disruption of the experience of linear, integrated 
time. Such experience is bound to cause the Self ’s disintegration – its 
breakdown into a collection of components, each with a smaller 
cognitive light cone.
This process will, in our model, be accompanied by a collapse of 
the temporal depth. The landscape of the agent’s attractors and 
repellors changes then and the dissociative disorder “takes root. ” Then, 
a sustained effort in psychotherapy is required to help restore the Self ’s 
coherence and continuity – the depth of its generative model and its 
temporal depth.
In contrast to the inescapable, lasting, overwhelming stress, 
a single episode of drug use can lead to a temporary dissociation 
due to the transient disruption of the resources necessary to 
support the depth of the Self ’s generative model – its memory 
systems. For example, an episode of ketamine use may result in 
the patient’s working memory disruption, leading to a transient 
dissociation. We may also experience benign daily dissociations 
on the border of sleep and wakefulness or during meditation. 
These transient dissociations do not require sustained 
therapeutic interventions.
Lasting or temporary, severe or mild, dissociative experiences 
are accompanied by the collapse of the Self ’s temporal depth. In 
this paper, we  have shown from multiple perspectives that 
temporal depth collapse causes the onset of dissociations, 
regardless of their etiology.
In the follow-up papers, we will present empirical and clinical 
data in support of our model and discuss possible therapeutic 
implications of this model for patients suffering from 
dissociative disorders.

Glossary1
Generative model - Generative model is a probabilistic model, 
comprising a likelihood and prior beliefs that specifies how (sensory) 
consequences are generated by latent (i.e., external) causes, such as 
hidden states and model parameters
Inference - Inference is the optimization of beliefs by maximizing 
Bayesian model evidence or minimizing surprise. Approximate 
Bayesian inference corresponds to minimizing variational free energy
Active inference - Active inference is the minimization of variational 
free energy through approximate Bayesian inference and active 
sampling of (sensory) data. This active sampling itself induces 
posterior beliefs over action, under prior beliefs that action will 
minimize free energy in the future. This is equivalent to resolving 
uncertainty with epistemic, information-seeking behavior
Temporal depth - Temporal depth (of counterfactual policies) is the 
depth of temporal processing during planning as inference
Markov blanket - Markov blanket is the set of variables that mediate 
all (statistical) interactions between a system and its environment
Cognitive light cone size - Cognitive light cone size is the size or scale 
of goals any given system can pursue
(Variational) Free Energy - (Variational) Free Energy is a functional 
of sensory data and posterior beliefs. Free energy scores the surprise 
of (sensory) data, given posterior beliefs about how they were caused. 
1 These definitions are from Friston et al. (2015), Friston (2018), Levin (2022), 
Parr et  al. (2022) , Kelso (2012) , Tognoli and Kelso (2014) , and Vallacher 
et al. (2015).
This furnishes an approximation to Bayesian model evidence, aka 
marginal likelihood.
Interoceptive - Interoceptive is pertaining to internal 
(autonomic) states.
Composite system - Composite system is a system that consists of 
multiple components.
Embedded system - Embedded system is a system that is a part of a 
larger system. Embedded systems interact with their environments, so 
cannot be considered isolated.
Nested system - Nested system is a multilayered system with 
components that in turn contain subcomponents. This process may 
continue at various scales.
(Fixed) Point attractor - (Fixed) Point attractor is characterized by 
the state to which a system evolves over time and to which it returns 
after being perturbed.
Limit cycle attractor - Limit cycle attractor is a closed trajectory in 
the state space that corresponds to sustained oscillations without 
decay or growth.
Repellor - Repellor is an area in phase space from which nearby 
trajectories diverge over time. Unlike an attractor, a repellor is a highly 
unstable area of phase space.
Attractor landscape - Attractor landscape is a computational model 
describing a collection of attractors and repellors in phase space 
(metaphorically, a landscape of valleys and hills) which describes the 
dynamics of a complex system in a specific regime.
Multistability - Multistability is a system that has multiple coexisting 
attractors and in which noise is sufficiently strong to cause switching 
among stable states
