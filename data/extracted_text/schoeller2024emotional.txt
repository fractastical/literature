Abstract
Affective empathy, the ability to share and understand others’ emo-
tional states, is a fundamental aspect of social cognition. Recent evidence
suggests that interoceptive inference, the brain’s prediction and processing
of internal bodily signals, plays a key role in affective empathy. Building
on the active inference framework, we propose that emotional contagion
arises from shared interoceptive priors between individuals, shaped by
physiological synchrony during social interaction. We hypothesize that
precision-weighted interoceptive prediction errors update shared priors,
enabling the dynamic alignment of affective states and flexible switching
between defensive and affiliative modes of co-regulation. We discuss the pu-
tative neurobiological implementation of this model, focusing on the insula,
amygdala, and brainstem nuclei involved in interoception and allostatic
control. This theoretical account bridges neurobiology and phenomenology
through computational modeling, generating precise hypotheses for future
research on the mechanisms of emotional contagion.
1 Introduction
Emotional contagion, the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize
with others’ expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements, facilitates the
convergence of emotional states between individuals [18]. This phenomenon is
considered a precursor to empathy, the capacity to share and understand others’
affective experiences [12]. Accumulating evidence highlights the role of interocep-
tion, the sensing and processing of internal bodily signals, in empathy [16, 10].
While this perspective offers a new angle on empathy, the precise mechanisms by
which interoceptive processes and this shared aspect of consciousness support
emotional contagion and empathic attunement remain to be fully elucidated.

We propose a novel account of emotional contagion grounded in the active
inference framework [14, 26]. Active inference posits that the brain continuously
generates predictive models of the causes of sensory inputs, including interocep-
tive signals, and updates these models based on prediction errors. Extending this
notion, we suggest that emotional contagion arises from the dynamic alignment
of interoceptive predictions between individuals through precision-weighted pre-
diction error minimization. This process is facilitated by physiological synchrony
during social interaction, which provides a shared basis for interoceptive inference
and co-regulation of affective states.
This theoretical framework provides a neurobiological basis for understanding
common social phenomena, such as the colloquial observation that “vibe attracts
the tribe.” Our model suggests that this attraction and emotional alignment
can occur even without shared personal histories. The synchronization of in-
teroceptive states and the resulting shared emotional experiences can create a
sense of connection and belonging that transcends verbal communication. This
perspective offers insight into how people can form deep emotional connections
in diverse groups or situations where traditional forms of interaction are limited
(e.g., concerts, raves, etc.). By exploring these mechanisms, we aim to bridge the
gap between subjective experiences of emotional connection and the underlying
neurobiological processes. This approach not only enhances our understanding
of social cognition and group dynamics but also has potential implications for
fields ranging from clinical psychology to social technology design.
Our article is structured as follows. First, we briefly review the role of intero-
ception in emotion and empathy, highlighting the insula as a key neural substrate.
Next, we introduce the mathematical formalism of our active inference model,
focusing on the precision-weighting of interoceptive prediction errors in emotional
contagion. We then discuss the putative neurobiological implementation of this
model, implicating the insula, amygdala, and brainstem nuclei in interoceptive
inference and allostatic control. Finally, we consider the implications of our
account for understanding the co-regulation of affective states in social contexts,
ranging from shared fear to shared safety. We conclude by outlining testable
predictions and future research directions.
2 Interoception, Emotion, and Empathy
Interoception refers to the perception and integration of autonomic, hormonal,
visceral, and immunological signals that collectively describe the physiological
state of the body [10]. Interoceptive information is conveyed by dedicated neural
pathways, including the lamina I spinothalamocortical pathway and the vagus
nerve, which transmit signals from visceral organs, skin, and mucous membranes
to the brainstem, thalamus, and ultimately the insula and cingulate cortex [8].
The insula, particularly its anterior portion, is thought to integrate intero-
ceptive signals with contextual information to generate a unified representation
of the bodily self [11]. Meta-analyses consistently implicate the anterior in-
sula in interoceptive awareness and the subjective experience of emotions [29,
2
1]. Moreover, anterior insula activity correlates with individual differences in
interoceptive accuracy, as measured by heartbeat detection tasks [11].
Interoception also plays a crucial role in empathy, the ability to share and
understand others’ affective states. Empathy for pain, disgust, and touch is
associated with activation in the anterior insula, suggesting a common neural
substrate for first-hand and vicarious emotional experiences [28, 19]. Furthermore,
individuals with high interoceptive accuracy show greater empathic concern and
perspective-taking [16]. These findings support the notion that the anterior
insula underpins the interoceptive basis of affective empathy.
However, current theories of interoceptive inference in empathy [21] have not
fully explicated the mechanisms by which shared interoceptive representations
arise and update during social interaction. We propose that emotional contagion,
driven by physiological synchrony and precision-weighted interoceptive prediction
errors, enables the dynamic alignment of affective states between individuals. In
the next section, we formalize this idea using the mathematical framework of
active inference.
3 A Mathematical Model of Emotional Conta-
gion
Active inference is a theoretical framework that describes perception, action, and
learning as the minimization of variational free energy, an information-theoretic
quantity that bounds the surprise (negative log probability) of sensory inputs [13].
The key idea is that the brain embodies a generative model of the world, which
it uses to infer the hidden causes of sensory data by minimizing prediction
errors. Prediction errors are weighted by precision, the inverse variance of the
sensory inputs, which determines the relative influence of prior beliefs and sensory
evidence on posterior beliefs.
In the context of interoception, active inference posits that the brain generates
predictions about the expected interoceptive signals and compares them with
actual interoceptive inputs [26]. The resulting interoceptive prediction errors are
precision-weighted and used to update the brain’s generative model, refining its
predictions and inferring the causes of bodily sensations. Crucially, interoceptive
predictions are shaped by prior beliefs about the body’s expected physiological
states, which are constrained by allostatic setpoints and contextual factors.
We extend this framework to explain emotional contagion by considering
how interoceptive predictions and precision-weighting are modulated by social
interaction. Specifically, we propose that physiological synchrony between indi-
viduals induces shared interoceptive priors, which serve as a common basis for
interoceptive inference and emotional alignment. The precision of these shared
priors depends on the degree of physiological synchrony and the reliability of
social cues.
Mathematically, let µ denote the brain’s interoceptive predictions (means), σ
the associated uncertainty (variances), andω the precision-weighting of prediction
3
errors. For an individual i interacting with another individual j, the update
equation for interoceptive predictions can be written as:
µt+1
i = µt
i + ωt
ij(st
i − µt
i) (1)
where st
i represents the actual interoceptive inputs at time t, and ωt
ij is the
precision-weighting term that depends on the degree of physiological synchrony
between individuals i and j. The precision-weighting can be modeled as:
ωt
ij = 1
σt
i + σt
j − 2ρt
ij
q
σt
iσt
j
(2)
where ρt
ij is the correlation coefficient between the interoceptive signals of
individuals i and j at time t, capturing the degree of physiological synchrony. As
ρt
ij approaches 1 (perfect synchrony), the precision-weighting increases, giving
more influence to the shared interoceptive priors in updating predictions. Con-
versely, as ρt
ij approaches 0 (no synchrony), the precision-weighting decreases,
and individual-specific predictions dominate.
This model implies that emotional contagion arises from the precision-
weighted alignment of interoceptive predictions across individuals. When physio-
logical synchrony is high, shared interoceptive priors have a stronger influence on
individual predictions, promoting the convergence of affective states. Prediction
errors that violate these shared priors, such as unexpected changes in bodily
sensations or social context, are given higher weight and drive the updating of
interoceptive predictions, leading to a realignment of emotional experiences.
The resolution of these prediction errors involves updating the brain’s gener-
ative model to incorporate the new interoceptive information and re-establish
affective alignment with others. This may be accompanied by physiological
responses, such as increased breathing rate or heart rate, that reflect the al-
tered interoceptive predictions and the attempt to restore allostatic setpoints.
For example, if one individual begins to exhibit signs of stress, such as rapid
breathing, others may unconsciously mirror this breathing pattern due to shared
interoceptive priors and high precision weighting. This leads to a synchronization
of physiological states and a convergence of emotional experiences, effectively
spreading the feeling throughout the group.
4 Neurobiological Implementation in Insula-Based
Networks
How would this model be realized in the brain? The insula is a key region
supporting interoceptive inference and social processes [8]. Anatomically, the
insula receives afferent projections from viscerosensory cortices and is reciprocally
connected with anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal
cortices [9]. These regions form a network for integrating interoceptive and
exteroceptive signals to guide adaptive behavior.
4
We propose that anterior insula (AI) computes interoceptive prediction errors
by comparing prior expectations with incoming sensory input. Consistent with
this view, AI activation scales with the magnitude of interoceptive prediction
errors, both for basic physiological functions like respiration and for more complex
affective states [2]. Moreover, AI tracking of prediction errors is modulated by
the precision of interoceptive priors, as manipulated by contextual factors such
as threat or safety cues [5].
Posterior insula (PI), in contrast, may represent the interoceptive priors
themselves. PI activation has been linked to awareness of bodily states and
multisensory integration [3]. We hypothesize that PI encodes expected physiolog-
ical states based on past experience and current context, and that the precision
of these priors is modulated by factors such as physiological synchrony and
perceived social support.
The bidirectional connections between AI and PI may enable iterative up-
dating of interoceptive priors based on prediction errors, analogous to predictive
coding algorithms [4]. Specifically, we propose that AI signals are weighted
by their precision and passed back to PI, where they are used to adjust the
prior for the next iteration of the inference process. Over time, this leads to
the construction of generative models that can accurately predict the causes of
interoceptive signals.
Crucially, we suggest that these interoceptive computations are influenced by
socio-affective context via input from other regions in the empathy network, such
as anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices [27]. These regions may encode
high-level beliefs about the emotional states of self and others, which constrain
the interoceptive inference process. For example, a strong belief that a social
situation is threatening may increase the precision of fear-related interoceptive
priors, biasing inference towards detecting signs of danger in oneself and others.
To illustrate these ideas, consider the example of breathing-related affective
experiences during stress. We propose that the experience of heightened stress
arises from interoceptive prediction errors in respiratory pathways, which signal a
mismatch between expected and actual breathing patterns [22]. These prediction
errors may be computed in the anterior insula (AI), based on afferent input from
respiratory cortices and prior expectations from the posterior insula (PI). The
subjective feeling of stress reflects the attribution of emotional meaning to these
prediction errors, based on the social and experiential context. For example, an
increased breathing rate during a tense situation may be interpreted as a sign of
anxiety, whereas the same physiological change during physical exercise may be
perceived as normal.
Importantly, we hypothesize that the precision of respiratory priors depends
on the degree of physiological synchrony between individuals. In the context
of a shared emotional experience, such as a group facing a challenging task
together, synchronization of breathing patterns and other autonomic responses
may increase the precision of a common respiratory prior, leading to similar expe-
riences of stress or calmness across individuals. This alignment of interoceptive
inferences may contribute to the spread of stress within a group or, conversely, to
collective relaxation through practices like synchronized breathing in meditation
5
or team sports.
More generally, we propose that physiological synchrony can bias interoceptive
inferences towards shared affective states by increasing the precision of common
priors. This process may be especially relevant for priors related to social safety
and threat, which are critical for survival and well-being [23]. For example,
synchronous physiological responses in a nurturing caregiver-infant interaction
may increase the precision of priors for safety and comfort, promoting secure
attachment. In contrast, asynchronous or unpredictable responses in an abusive
interaction may increase the precision of priors for danger and unpredictability,
contributing to the development of anxiety and hypervigilance.
5 Covert/Overt Emotions and Technological Me-
diation
We suggested that the insula and its associated networks support affective
empathy by integrating interoceptive signals with socio-affective context to
generate shared emotion states. The precision-weighting of interoceptive priors
based on physiological synchrony may be a key mechanism underlying emotional
contagion and co-regulation. This framework generates testable predictions
about the neural computations involved in empathic processes, which can be
explored in future research.
Our model of emotional contagion based on interoceptive inference can be
extended to model emotional crowds and the role of technology in mediating the
spread of specific emotions. Emotions differ in the extent to which their under-
lying physiological changes are observable through behavioral cues [24]. This
observability affects the potential for contagion, as it determines the availability
of sensory evidence for inference and model-updating of interoceptive priors.
Emotions like anger and happiness are associated with overt changes in facial
expression and vocal prosody, making them highly contagious in face-to-face
interactions [17]. In contrast, emotions like guilt and contentment involve more
covert physiological changes, rendering them less susceptible to contagion through
direct observation. Technology (including language) can alter the landscape of
emotional contagion by making intimate signals public. Digital communication
platforms and physiological sensors provide new avenues for sharing internal
states and aligning interoceptive predictions [15]. This expands the range of
emotions that can be socially regulated, with important implications for online
communities and emotion-aware technologies. Think, for example, of the case
of autonomous sensory meridian responses (ASMR), only entering cultural
consciousness through its digital representation.
To illustrate these ideas, we can model the dynamics of collective emotions
using our interoceptive inference framework. Consider a crowd of N individuals
experiencing a shared emotional event. Let µt and Σt denote the mean and
covariance matrix of the crowd’s interoceptive priors at timet, and let st represent
the vector of individuals’ physiological states (e.g., heart rates).
6
The evolution of the shared priors can be modeled as:
µt+1 = µt + Kt(st − µt) (3)
Σt+1 = (I − Kt)Σt (4)
where Kt is the Kalman gain matrix that determines the update of the priors
based on prediction errors ( st − µt). The Kalman gain is given by:
Kt = Σt(Σt + Σϵ)−1 (5)
where Σϵ is the covariance matrix of sensory noise.
This model captures how the shared priors evolve over time as individuals
update their predictions based on sensory cues from others. The interplay
between physiological synchrony (coupling of st) and sensory precision ( Σϵ)
determines the speed and stability of emotional convergence.
Crucially, technology can modulate these parameters by providing new chan-
nels for sharing physiological states ( st) and by filtering or amplifying sensory
cues (Σϵ). For example, a social media platform that prioritizes the spread
of high-arousal content may effectively increase the precision of anger-related
sensory cues, leading to faster and more intense contagion of outrage.
By simulating the model under different scenarios and collecting empirical
data in mass gatherings, we can generate testable predictions about the dynamics
of collective emotions in natural and digital contexts. Beyond predicting crowd
evolution, this could inform strategies for promoting emotional resilience, miti-
gating the spread of harmful sentiments, and designing technologies that support
healthy social-emotional regulation. Moreover, in less anonymous environments,
trust may emerge as a gating mechanism for shared priors [7].
6 Clinical Implications and Future Directions
The model proposed here has important implications for understanding empathic
difficulties in clinical populations, particularly those with a history of chronic
trauma. Trauma exposure has been associated with disruptions in interoceptive
control, including heightened sensitivity to bodily signals and difficulty regulating
physiological arousal [25]. These disruptions may impair interoceptive accuracy
and emotional understanding by introducing noise into the inference process.
Specifically, we hypothesize that trauma-related alterations in insula function
and connectivity may lead to overweighting of interoceptive prediction errors
and underweighting of socio-affective context in the construction of interoceptive
priors. This may result in a reduced ability to differentiate between self- and
other-related affective states, as well as a bias towards interpreting bodily signals
as threatening. Such alterations in interoceptive inference may contribute to the
empathic deficits and interpersonal difficulties observed in conditions such as
post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder [20].
7
Future research could test these hypotheses by examining insula responses to
interoceptive stimuli in clinical and non-clinical populations, using tasks that
manipulate social context and physiological synchrony. For example, neuroimag-
ing studies could investigate whether trauma exposure is associated with reduced
precision-weighting of interoceptive priors in PI, and whether this reduction
predicts deficits in empathic accuracy. Pharmacological and neurostimulation
interventions that modulate insula activity could also be used to explore causal
relationships between interoceptive processing and empathy.
More broadly, the framework presented here highlights the importance of
considering interoceptive and socio-affective factors in the study of empathy and
social cognition. It suggests that interventions aimed at enhancing empathy
should target not only cognitive perspective-taking skills but also the capacity
for embodied simulation and physiological co-regulation. Practices that pro-
mote interoceptive awareness and control, such as mindfulness meditation and
biofeedback training, may be particularly useful in this regard [6].
In conclusion, this article presents a theoretical account of how interoceptive
inference supports affective empathy and emotional contagion. By bridging
computational models with clinical neuroscience, it offers a new perspective on
the mechanisms underlying empathic difficulties in trauma-related disorders.
The model generates testable predictions about the role of insula-based networks
in integrating interoceptive and socio-affective information to construct shared
emotion states. Future research in this area has the potential to inform the
development of novel interventions for enhancing empathy and social well-being.
