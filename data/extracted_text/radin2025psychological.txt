In the Department of Neuroscience in Clinical Neurological unit of our hospital, 
between 2020 and 2024, 58 adult patients were diagnosed with functional 
neurological disorder (FND). Out of these, 42 patients agreed to participate in a 
structured intervention consisting of 10 sessions of psychotherapy. This study aimed 
to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient cohort, 
examine their reported symptoms, and evaluate the effectiveness and adherence 
to the psychotherapy program. The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales 
(ANPS) were administered to assess the affective states of the patients, while the 
Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure (SWAP-200) was used to evaluate their 
main personality style. A central objective of the research was to explore patterns 
or correlations between self-reported data from the patients and the evaluations 
completed by their therapists. This comparison sought to identify any alignment 
or discrepancies in the perception of symptoms and therapeutic progress, as 
measured by both the ANPS and SWAP-200 scales. The study’s preliminary findings 
are reported to provide valuable insights into the impact of psychotherapeutic 
interventions for FND, including an understanding of the degree to which patient 
self-reports correspond with clinical assessments. These results will inform the 
optimization of treatment strategies and enhance patient outcomes by integrating 
patient feedback with clinical evaluations. The research contributes to the broader 
knowledge of FND management, emphasizing the importance of aligning patient 
and therapist perspectives in the therapeutic process.

Introduction
Functional neurological disorders (FND) represent an emerging pathological condition 
characterized by neurological symptoms that lack a clear organic cause, often manifesting as 
sensory-motor disturbances. Focusing on improving quality of life (QoL) has emerged as a 
critical goal in managing FND, aligning with integrative therapeutic approaches (Myers et al., 
2021). These disorders are indeed frequently associated with impairing conditions like chronic 
fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, posing significant challenges in understanding their 
aetiology and management ( Stone et  al., 2020). FNDs can cause significant distress and 
disability, representing a critical condition requiring prompt diagnosis and accurate follow-up 
to prevent acute recurrences and misdiagnosis (Ludwig et al., 2018; Lidstone et al., 2020). 
Emerging models suggest that FND may stem from abnormalities in Bayesian inference 
processes in the brain, where excessive precision is attributed to a priori predictions, disrupting 
sensory and attentional processing (Edwards et al., 2012). This Bayesian perspective provides

a framework for understanding the variability in symptoms, the 
complexities in diagnosis, and the challenges in treatment, situating 
FND within Friston’s predictive coding and “free energy principle” 
(Friston, 2010).
The “free energy principle” posits that the brain functions as an 
inference machine, continually updating its predictions to minimize 
surprise or prediction error ( Parr and Friston, 2019 ), thereby 
constructing a generative model of its environment. Dysregulations in 
this process can manifest FND symptoms, mainly when emotional 
conflicts drive an excessive focus on specific predictions, resulting in 
misinterpretations of bodily sensations (Solms and Friston, 2018). 
Understanding these processes requires examining the role of primary 
emotional systems, as Panksepp (Panksepp, 2010) identified, which 
include SEEKING, PLAY , CARE, LUST, FEAR, ANGER, and PANIC/
GRIEF . Dysfunctions in these systems, potentially involving 
alterations in dopaminergic and opioidergic pathways, may contribute 
to the sensory, motor, and emotional symptoms seen in FND 
(Panksepp and Watt, 2011).
Recent findings suggest that psychotherapy could be  a 
valuable tool to aid FND patients. For instance, Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) 
could offer medium-sized benefits for physical symptoms, mental 
health, and QoL. CBT targets maladaptive beliefs and avoidance 
behaviours, while PDT addresses emotional and interpersonal 
conflicts contributing to symptom maintenance ( Gutkin 
et al., 2020 ).
This study aims to explore the psycho-emotional structure of FND 
patients (who accepted a psychotherapeutic intervention) using the 
Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) and the Shedler-
Westen Assessment Procedure (SW AP-200).
The hypothesis is that therapy will improve patients’ ability to 
manage symptoms ( Sandler and Joffe, 1968 ; Fonagy, 2005) and 
enhance their understanding of triggers, with particular focus on the 
role of attentional dynamics in functional neurological disorder 
(Edwards et al., 2012). However, given the exploratory nature of the 
study and the lack of prior research, it is difficult to formulate precise 
hypotheses regarding the ANPS results.
The study’s limitations include the absence of a control group and 
the small, heterogeneous sample, which may affect the generalizability 
of the findings.
Materials and methods
The study was conducted at Cattinara Hospital, a tertiary care 
center located in Trieste, Italy, which includes a specialized 
Neurological Clinic offering comprehensive diagnostic and 
therapeutic services for a wide range of neurological disorders.
Patients were initially enrolled from the Emergency Department 
of Cattinara Hospital after presenting with acute neurological 
symptoms from January 1st 2018 to December 31th 2023. Following 
initial stabilization and assessment, they were referred to the 
Neurological Clinic for further evaluation. For 58 out of 128 patients 
the diagnosis was confirmed. For these 58 patients, clinical and 
demographic characteristics were collected ( Table  1). Before their 
involvement in the study, informed consent was obtained from all 
participants, and ethical considerations were strictly adhered to 
throughout the research process. The study sample consists of 42 
patients who accepted a psychotherapeutic intervention out of the 
initial 58 individual diagnosed with FND.
Among the 42 patients, seven dropped out before completing 
the therapy sessions (16.7%). Additionally, there was missing data 
for the assessments, with four patients (9.5%) not completing the 
Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) and four patients 
(9.5%) missing the SW AP-200 assessment because of a lack of 
information emerged during the psychotherapy sessions. The 
psychological support provided was based on two theoretical 
cornerstones: the fundamental importance of the meaning of the 
symptom, i.e., the intimate connection between affective activation 
and adaptive reactions ( Solms and Friston, 2018 ; Solms, 2021) and 
Kernberg’s Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) approach 
(Kernberg and Caligor, 2005 ; Kernberg, 1984 ) which focuses on 
understanding and resolving unconscious conflicts by exploring the 
transference relationship—the dynamic between the patient and 
therapist as a reflection of the patient’s internalized relationships and 
emotional struggles. The intervention was delivered in 10 weekly 
sessions of 1 h each. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four 
psychotherapists, all with a psychoanalytic orientation. 
Randomization ensured an unbiased distribution of participant 
characteristics, minimizing confounding factors and enabling the 
assessment of both the overall intervention effectiveness and 
potential therapist-specific effects.
Twenty-seven total patients successfully completed the clinical 
trial, including the testing part. To assess the psychological dimensions 
of FND and the possible impact of the treatment, we employed the 
Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) and the Shedler-
Westen Assessment Procedure (SW AP-200). These tools were 
specifically chosen for their complementary strengths in evaluating 
emotional dysregulation and personality constructs that are 
hypothesized to underlie FND symptomatology.
The ANPS (Davis et al., 2003) was selected based on the theoretical 
framework proposed by Panksepp, to provide insights into potential 
affective imbalances that may contribute to the manifestation of 
FND symptoms.
The SW AP-200 (Westen and Shedler, 2007), on the other hand, 
offers a unique advantage as it is completed by therapists rather than 
the patients themselves. This feature allows for an independent, 
expert-driven assessment of a broad range of personality traits and 
disorders (The Pandas Development Team, 2023). Moreover, it enables 
the identification of consistent personality characteristics that may 
either correlate with the ANPS findings or emerge as common themes 
across therapist observations.
By integrating data from both tools, we  aimed to achieve a 
nuanced understanding of the emotional and personality dimensions 
of FND, exploring potential interrelations and validating therapist-
perceived patterns with empirical measures of affective systems.
After collecting ANPS result in the three phases (T0, T1, T2) 
we compared T0 results against Italian normative data. However, our 
sample consists of mostly females (23 females and 4 males), leading to 
possible distortions. As such, we performed a Welch’s t-test on the 
female-only sample who had completed the ANPS test prior to the 
start of the interviews (T0), to assess whether significant differences 
existed between our female patient group and the female normative 
data (Pascazio et  al., 2015). This statistical test was chosen for its 
robustness in handling unequal sample sizes and variances. For the 
subsequent analysis, both males and females will be considered.

Afterwards, a repeated measures ANOV A was conducted 
considering time as the factor within subjects using Jamovi software 
(Jamovi Project, 2022) to evaluate changes in the ANPS scores over 
time (N = 27). The ANPS was administered at three distinct time 
points: Baseline (before the initiation of therapy), Midpoint (at the end 
of the psychotherapy sessions), and Follow-up (2 months after the 
end). The assumption of sphericity was tested using Mauchly’s test to 
ensure the validity of the ANOV A results. The sphericity test was 
non-significant (W = 0.844 p = 0.120), indicating that the assumption 
of sphericity was met. As such, no correction for degrees of freedom 
was necessary.
In addition to the ANPS score analysis, correlation coefficients 
were calculated to explore the relationships between the PD-T 
SW AP-200 profiles and the ANPS variables, while to explore the 
relationships between the Q-T SW AP-200 factors and the ANPS 
variables. Q-T (Quantitative Trait) measures the severity of personality 
pathology on a spectrum, representing the overall maladaptive 
functioning level across domains of personality traits.
PD-T (Personality Disorder Types) Classifies personality 
characteristics into specific personality disorder prototypes, aligning 
patients with empirically derived personality styles and disorders, 
such as borderline, narcissistic, or obsessive-compulsive types.

To assess the normality of the distribution for each of the 30 
variables in the dataset about ANPS and SW AP-200, the Shapiro–Wilk 
test was conducted revealing that 25 of the 30 variables in the dataset 
were normally distributed, as evidenced by p-values greater than 0.05. 
However, five variables exhibited p-values below the 0.05 threshold, 
indicating that these variables do not follow a normal distribution. 
Specifically: PD-T Narcissistic (p-value: 0.033), Q-T Antisocial (p-
value: 0.042), Q-T Narcissistic (p-value: 0.002), Q-T Depressive high 
function (p-value: 0.034), Q-T Hostile (p-value: 0.009). These findings 
suggest that these five variables significantly deviate from normality, 
which may influence the statistical methods used in subsequent 
analyses. Given that, we have chosen Pearson’s correlation for the 
variables that conform to normal distribution. For the pairings where 
one of the variables did not follow a normal distribution, we used 
instead Spearman’s correlation.
We used Spearman’s correlation (the explanation about this 
choice is in the result section) the SW AP-200, which provides a 
detailed assessment of personality traits and potential psychiatric 
disorders, was analysed to determine how these profiles 
correlated with the emotional systems measured by the 
ANPS. These correlations were calculated using Python, with the 
pandas and numpy libraries used for data manipulation, and the 
seaborn library employed for visualization ( The Pandas 
Development Team, 2023 ).
The results of these statistical analyses were interpreted with a 
focus on clinical relevance, emphasizing how changes in ANPS scores 
over time and the correlations between SW AP-200 profiles and ANPS 
variables might inform the understanding and treatment of FND. The 
effect size calculations were reported alongside 95% confidence 
intervals to provide context for the magnitude of the observed effects 
(Figure 1).
Results
Table 1 summarizes clinical and demographic characteristics of all 
the 58 patients that were considered for the study. Three diagnostic 
groups were identified: Stroke Mimic (N = 18), Movement Disorders 
(N = 29), and Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES, N = 11). The 
first group includes patients with symptoms that mimic a stroke, such 
as hemiparesis and language disturbances (Caruso et al., 2024). The 
second group refers to patients showing motor impairments such as 
tremors and dystonia (Serranová et al., 2023). The third one pertains 
to patients presenting a wide range of symptoms mimicking epileptic 
seizures (Bompaire et al., 2021). The participants’ mean age (calculated 
as the age each patient had at the first access to the ER for functional 
symptoms) varied slightly among the groups, with the Stroke Mimic 
group having an average onset age of 51.8 years (SD = 15.8), while the 
Movement Disorders and PNES groups had average ages of 49.4 
(SD = 15.4) and 43.1 years (SD = 16.0) respectively. Education levels 
were slightly higher in the PNES group ( M = 14.03, SD = 2.16) 
compared to the Stroke Mimic (M = 11.83, SD = 2.01) and Movement 
Disorders (M = 13.14, SD = 3.51) groups. Most participants across all 
groups accepted psychological support, with the highest proportion in 
the Stroke Mimic group (77.8%).
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders varied across the groups, 
with Anxiety being the most common in the Movement Disorders 
group (45.8%), followed by the Stroke Mimic (29.2%) and PNES 
FIGURE 1

(25.0%) groups. Panic attacks were reported most frequently in the 
Movement Disorders group (47.1%). Depression and Acute Stress 
were more evenly distributed, with slight variations among the 
groups. Cardiovascular conditions were more common in the Stroke 
Mimic group (59.1%), while the Movement Disorders group had a 
higher prevalence of neurological and surgical interventions. In the 
context of Neurological Examination Signs Motor disturbances/
deficits were reported equally in the Stroke Mimic and Movement 
Disorders groups (46.2% each), while sensory disturbances were 
more common in the Movement Disorders group (55.6%). 
Involuntary movements were exclusively reported in the Movement 
Disorders group (100%), and cognitive/consciousness disturbances 
were evenly split between the Stroke Mimic and PNES groups. 
Overall, 72.4% of the total sample accepted psychological support, 
reflecting a relatively high acceptance rate across all diagnostic 
categories. Notably, there were only six dropouts from the therapy 
sessions, and unfortunately, one participant passed away during the 
study (Table 2).
The bar chart in Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of reported 
functional symptoms among the patient cohort, highlighting the most 
prevalent symptoms associated with functional neurological disorders. 
Vertigo (Dizziness/Balance Disturbance) is the most reported 
symptom, affecting 43.1% of the cohort with a chi-square value of 44.78 
(p < 0.001), significantly more frequent than expected.
Cutaneous Paresthesia is the second most common symptom, 
representing 32.8% of the population, and with a chi-square value of 
19.76 ( p < 0.001). Generalized Fatigue/Weakness (Asthenia) is 
reported by 15 patients, which is 25.9% of the cohort 
(chi-square = 8.69, p = 0.0032).
The Welsh test for the FEAR factor (one-tailed p  = 0.04) 
demonstrates statistical significance at the 5% level, indicating that 
patients with functional neurological disorders have significantly higher 
mean fear scores than the female normative population ( Table  3; 
Giacolini et al., 2017). This result could have some implications for 
managing and treating such patients, emphasizing the potential need 
for a specific focus on fear management in therapies and support 
strategies (Figure 3).
The repeated measures ANOV A revealed a significant effect of 
time on SANDNESS scores [ F(2,52) p = 0.009). This indicates a 
statistically significant decrease in Sadness scores across the three-
time points (W = 0.844 p = 0.120).
The matrix correlation between ANPS variables and PD-T factors 
(Figure 4) present the following significant correlations between the 
two scale:
 1. SEEKING and PD-T Avoidant (Pearson r = −0.39 p ≤ 0.05):
 o There is a significant negative correlation between seeking 
behaviours (SEEKING) and avoidant personality traits (PD-T 
Avoidant) suggesting that individuals who score higher in 
seeking behaviours are less likely to exhibit avoidant traits.
 2. FEAR and PD-T Avoidant (r = 0.49 p ≤ 0.01):
 o A significant positive correlation was found between fear 
(FEAR) and avoidant personality traits (PD-T Avoidant). 
Individuals with higher fear scores tend to have stronger 
avoidant traits, which aligns with the avoidance of anxiety-
inducing situations.
 3. FEAR and PD-T Dependent (r = 0.56 p ≤ 0.01):
 o There is a strong positive correlation between fear (FEAR) and 
dependent personality traits (PD-T Dependent), indicating 
that individuals with higher fear levels may also exhibit 
stronger dependency traits, relying on others for support.
 4. SADNESS PD-T Paranoid (r = −0.46 p ≤ 0.05):
 o A significant negative correlation between sadness (SADNESS) 
and paranoid traits (PD-T Paranoid) suggests that individuals 
with higher levels of sadness may also display higher levels of 
suspicion and distrust.
 5. SADNESS and PD-T Antisocial (r = −0.40 p ≤ 0.05):
 o There is a significant negative correlation between sadness 
(SADNESS) and antisocial traits (PD-T Antisocial). This 
relationship might indicate that sadness could be related to 
tendencies towards antisocial behaviors.
 6. SADNESS PD-T Narcissistic (r = −0.40 p ≤ 0.05):
 o A significant correlation between sadness (SADNESS) and 
narcissistic traits (PD-T Narcissistic) may suggest a complex 
relationship where feelings of sadness coexist with 
narcissistic tendencies, potentially due to underlying self-
esteem issues.
 7. LUST PD-T Schizoid (r = −0.43 p ≤ 0.05):

 o A significant negative correlation between lust (LUST) and 
schizoid traits (PD-T Schizoid) indicates that individuals with 
higher levels of sexual desire may be less likely to exhibit the 
emotional coldness and detachment characteristic of 
schizoid personality.
 8. LUST PD-T Avoidant (Pearson r = −0.48 p = 0.01):
 o There is a significant correlation between lust (LUST) and 
avoidant traits (PD-T Avoidant), suggesting that individuals 
with higher levels of sexual desire might also show tendencies 
to avoid social situations, possibly due to fear of rejection.
In the matching between ANPS variables and Q-T factors 
(Figure 5) the analysis identified several significant correlations:
 1. SEEKING vs. PLAY: (r = 0.63 p ≤ 0.01).
 o Higher seeking behaviour is strongly associated with 
higher playfulness.
 2. SEEKING vs. LUST: (r = 0.61 p ≤ 0.01).
 o A strong positive correlation indicates that seeking behaviour 
is associated with higher levels of lust.
 3. PLAY vs. CARE: (r = 0.44 p ≤ 0.01).
 o There is a moderate positive relationship between playfulness 
and caring behaviour.
 4. FEAR vs. SADNESS: (r = 0.67 p ≤ 0.01).
 o Individuals with higher levels of fear also tend to experience 
higher levels of sadness.
 5. FEAR_0 vs. Q-T Avoidant: (r = 0.44 p ≤ 0.03).
 o Fear is positively correlated with avoidant traits.
 6. FEAR_0 vs. Q-T Hostile: (r = −0.38 p = 0.05).
 o Higher fear levels are associated with lower hostility traits.
 7. Q-T Obsessive vs. Q-T Hostile: (r = −0.43 p ≤ 0.05).

Discussion
The results of our study provide an insight into the 
demographic, clinical, and neurological characteristics of FND 
patients. The high acceptance rate of psychological support across 
all groups is encouraging, suggesting that patients are open to 
integrative approaches that combine neurological and 
psychological care. This is particularly relevant given the complex 
interplay between psychological factors and functional 
neurological disorders ( Table 4).
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders varied among the groups, 
with Anxiety being most common in the Movement Disorders group, 
which aligns with previous literature indicating a strong link between 
anxiety and movement disorders (Pascazio et al., 2015). Panic attacks 
were also more frequently reported in this group, further emphasizing 
the need for comprehensive mental health assessments in patients 
presenting with movement-related symptoms.
The findings highlight significant emotional alterations, 
particularly in the FEAR and PANIC systems, which are 
neurobiological mechanisms essential for survival (Panksepp, 2010; 
Panksepp, 2011a; Panksepp, 1998). The FEAR system relates to 
protecting personal integrity, while the PANIC system reflects the 
need for proximity and connection. These systems are linked to 
chronic anxiety, separation anxiety, and fear ( Panksepp, 2005a ; 
Panksepp, 2005b; Panksepp, 2010; Panksepp, 2011a; Panksepp, 2011b).
Patients in our study demonstrated withdrawal from daily 
activities due to physical and psychological symptoms, including 
anxiety and irritability. The tests revealed abnormal activation of these 
systems, particularly in correlation with Narcissistic, Avoidant, and 
Dependent traits. These patients, focused on self-esteem and

self-efficacy, simultaneously experience deep anxiety over losing 
significant others, underlining a conflict between autonomy and 
attachment. Notably, the PANIC system’s activation decreased after 
psychotherapy, reflecting positive changes in attachment dynamics.
Trust issues and fear of abandonment, manifested through defence 
mechanisms like projection and idealization ( Clarkin et  al., 1999; 
Sandler, 1960), also emerged, confirming earlier findings about patients 
with functional neurological disorders. Our psychotherapeutic 
approach, grounded in Transference Focused Psychotherapy (Clarkin 
et  al., 1999 ), facilitated the analysis of patients’ internal object 
representations, highlighting how physical symptoms might serve as a 
maladaptive response to separation anxiety, seeking care from 
significant others. This aligns with earlier research (Stone et al., 2020; 
Edwards, 2021; Bennett et al., 2021).
These results suggest that symptoms in FND patients may stem 
from unresolved emotional conflicts, where bodily sensations become 
misinterpreted as signals of distress during crises. This emotional 
distress, when chronic, is deeply embedded in neural networks, as 
described in earlier studies ( Solms and Friston, 2018 ; Stone et al., 
2020), making early diagnosis and intervention crucial. 
Neurobiological changes in the limbic-motor axis of FND patients, 
related to emotion and movement management, further support this 
hypothesis (Aybek et al., 2015; Aybek et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2021).
Emotional factors should be  considered primary indicators of 
underlying psychological suffering in FND patients, shaped by complex 
genetic, family, and environmental factors (Aybek et al., 2015; Davis 
and Panksepp, 2011; Espay et al., 2018 ). Recognizing these signals 
could lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment strategies.
The significant reduction in SADNESS scores after treatment, 
as shown by repeated measures ANOV A, highlights the 
intervention’s success in reducing anxiety linked to separation 
and loss. This improvement is likely due to the support of a 
professional sensitive to FNDs, who addresses the patient’s 
intense emotions of frustration and worry. Overall patients report 
an improvement in the symptomatology of functional symptoms 
through psychotherapy. However, it is important to note that 
these aspects are qualitative and have not been tested nor 
measured. Nonetheless, since ANPS is a self-reported test, the 
FIGURE 4

decrease in SADNESS might be  correlated to symptoms’ 
improvements. Further studies with bigger randomized  
samples and longer trials are needed to clarify this possibility as 
well as to compare with current wider studies ( Goldstein 
et al., 2020 ).
The correlations identified between ANPS and PD-T factors, as 
well as between ANPS and Q-T factors, provide essential insights into 
the psychological profiles of the patients. The significant correlations 
between FEAR and PD-T Avoidant, as well as between SADNESS and 
various PD-T traits, suggest that these emotional states are closely 
linked with specific personality characteristics. These findings could 
have important implications for developing targeted interventions that 
address functional neurological disorders’ emotional and 
personality dimensions.
Our study highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of 
functional neurological disorders, emphasizing the importance 
of a holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment that integrates 
both neurological and psychological care. Future research should 
build on these findings by incorporating larger sample sizes, 
control groups, and longitudinal designs to further elucidate the

relationships between clinical, psychological, and neurological 
factors in these conditions.
Highlights and limitation
The current study’s sample size of 58 subjects needs to be revised 
to reliably perform multinomial logistic regression analyses with the 
numerous predictive variables we considered. Given the complexity 
of the model and the multiple categories within the dependent 
variable, a larger sample is necessary to achieve stable and 
interpretable results.
Furthermore, the correlation analysis could be  utterly refined 
considering FND subcategories (PNES, movement disorder, stroke 
mimic). Again, sample size did not allow this possibility, which shall 
be explored in further studies.
The dual use of Spearman and Pearson correlations in these 
analyses provided a balanced perspective. Spearman’s method was 
essential for capturing non-linear, monotonic relationships, especially 
in the context of psychological traits, while Pearson’s correlation 
offered precise insights into linear associations. Together, they allowed 
for a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships 
between ANPS, PD-T, and Q-T factors, with each method addressing 
the limitations of the other. This combined approach ensures that the 
analysis captures a broad spectrum of potential relationships, 
enhancing the robustness of the findings.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the repeated measures ANOV A provides 
strong evidence that the psychological intervention significantly 
reduced SADNESS levels over time, with the effect persisting 
beyond the immediate conclusion of the treatment. The 
underlying assumptions were adequately met, reinforcing the 
validity of these findings. These results contribute valuable 
insights into the longitudinal effectiveness of psychological 
therapies for emotional distress.
The findings from the correlation analyses between ANPS, PD-T, 
and Q-T factors, which derive from SW AP-200, provide important 
insights into the psychological profiles of these patients. However, 
these results must be discussed critically within the specific context of 
FND to understand their implications fully.
These findings emphasize the importance of a holistic 
approach to treatment that addresses both the psychological and 
neurological components of FND. However, the specific nature 
of this patient group means that these results should 
be  interpreted with caution when considering broader 
applications. Further research is needed to explore how these 
findings might inform treatment strategies, improve FND 
patients’ outcomes, and determine whether similar patterns are 
observed in other clinical populations.
