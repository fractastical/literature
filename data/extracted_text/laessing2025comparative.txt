Abstract
Pavlovian “approach or avoid” impulses are critical behavioral biases that, in excess, are
linked to multiple psychiatric conditions. To investigate how such biases contribute to
suicidal thoughts and behaviors, we analyzed data from two clinical populations
completing an aversive Go/NoGo task. This task disentangles motor action (Go or
NoGo) from outcome valence (escape from, or avoidance of, an aversive stimulus),
enabling the isolation of Pavlovian biases from instrumental learning processes.
We compared multiple computational models that had previously been proposed to
explain Pavlovian tendencies, including reinforcement learning, active inference, and
drift diffusion–based approaches. We employed a hierarchical Bayesian inference
procedure that treats model identity as a random factor at the individual level, allowing
an unbiased determination of which mechanisms most accurately captured participants’
behavior. Across both datasets, models featuring Pavlovian context biases plus a
value-decay mechanism best accounted for performance. By contrast, policy-based
Pavlovian models and more complex approaches, such as those integrating working
memory or active inference, were supported by fewer study participants.
These findings suggest that reflexive biases exert a persistent influence on
decision-making, and that value decay plays a critical role in shaping behavior over time.
Our results demonstrate the importance of systematically comparing and accounting for
relevant cognitive processes to explain observed task behaviors. Understanding the
factors contributing to task performance may help clarify how Pavlovian tendencies
relate to psychopathology, including, in our case, elevated suicide risk. Finally, we
illustrate how a complete hierarchical model selection framework can be applied to
identify the most plausible mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases, offering a robust
approach for advancing our understanding of task behaviors and establishing clinical
utility in future studies.

Author summary
Automatic “approach or avoid” reactions shape behavior, particularly in stressful or
negative situations. In this study, we explored how these reflex-like tendencies might
contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Two clinical groups completed a
computerized task measuring responses to unpleasant sounds. Participants made either
active responses (pressing a button to stop a sound) or passive responses (refraining
from pressing to avoid starting a sound), allowing us to examine the interplay of
automatic impulses and learning from past experiences.
Our analysis showed that behavior was best explained by a model combining stable
“approach or avoid” impulses with a forgetting process that reduced reliance on past
experiences over time. More complex models involving strategies or memory-based
control were less effective.
These findings suggest that individuals with suicidal tendencies may rely on
persistent reflex-like behaviors and over-index recent outcomes, compromising their
ability to learn in uncertain environmental conditions. Understanding these cognitive
processes provides insights into why some individuals feel trapped in harmful patterns
of thought and behavior. Our work highlights how identifying shared traits in clinical
populations using model-based methods can inform targeted mental health interventions
and improve our understanding of cognitive functioning across disorders.
Introduction
A Pavlovian system of control orchestrates default, reflexive approach and avoidance
behaviors in response to predictions of reward and punishment (Dickinson, 1980;
Mackintosh, 1983). It is complemented by an instrumental system which learns,
typically more slowly, to perform actions contingent on their outcomes. The integration
of these control systems is crucial for achieving adaptive behavior, striking a balance
between faster, reflexive responses and the flexibility afforded by learned actions (N. D.
Daw et al., 2005).
While the default actions provided by the Pavlovian system have likely been
evolutionarily advantageous, problems ensue when Pavlovian behaviors are inconsistent
with instrumental requirements [1–3]. Indeed, excess influence of Pavlovian biases have
been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to,
PTSD [4], mood and anxiety disorders [5], addiction disorders [6] and suicidality [7].
The transdiagnostic prevalence of maladaptive Pavlovian tendencies underscores the
importance of understanding the mechanisms that underlie them. Computational
psychiatry employs reward/punishment tasks - such as the orthogonalized Go/NoGo
task [8,9] - that disentangle reflexive Pavlovian biases from other cognitive processes,
providing a window into these mechanisms. However, with just a couple of notable
exceptions [7,10], such Go/NoGo tasks have been applied in a monetary context, even
though, for many psychiatric conditions, negative contingencies involving avoidance of,
or escape from, a primary aversive stimulus, would be more obviously relevant. Here, we
sought to use suicidality [7] as a critical test case for elucidating Pavlovian-instrumental
competition.
In computational psychiatry, it is conventional to proceed by comparing the fit and
the inferred parameter values of computational models that incorporate and
differentiate separate possible mechanisms. Although the orthogonalized Go/NoGo task
primarily reflects Pavlovian tendencies, other facets such as valence, reward/punishment
stimuli, task length, and reversals—can interact with model-free and model-based
learning systems in the context of instrumental learning, working memory, and other
competing processes [11,12]. Thus, here, we perform a systematic, head-to-head,

comparison not only within, but also between, the two main modelling frameworks that
have been suggested: reinforcement learning (e.g., [9–11,13,14] and active
inference [15,16]. We do this using behavioral data from two clinical populations with
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Our analysis reveals how task performance can
be understood through distinct cognitive mechanisms, offering valuable insights, while
also surfacing inherent limitations in the data and methodologies.
Assessing Pavlovian tendencies in suicidality
Suicidality is a complex phenomenon with a highly heterogeneous clinical expression
and poorly understood cognitive and neurobiological risk factors. Although it is
traditionally defined as a uniform concept, the presentation of suicidal ideation and
behaviours varies across psychopathologies, biological predispositions, and psychosocial
contexts (see [17] for an overview), leading to an array of associated cognitive deficits.
Thus, in recent years, stratification approaches have been used to identify subgroups of
suicidality based on personality traits, clinical comorbidities, and temporal
patterns. [17–21]. However, small sample sizes, inconsistent definitions and findings, and
limited clinical data collection have hindered the development of a consensus on
meaningful subgroup identification.
One promising approach stems from the observation that STB is associated with
deficits in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. These deficits include impairments in
active-escape behaviors in aversive contexts [10], probabilistic reversal learning [22], and
value-based decision-making [23]. Such impairments appear to vary in severity across
subgroups and may reflect an increased influence of Pavlovian over instrumental control,
particularly in negatively valenced social contexts [24]. Earlier studies have explored
this by quantifying and modelling performance biases in tasks in which Pavlovian and
instrumental contingencies are congruent vs incongruent [10,23].
In this study, we adopt an empirical model-driven approach to investigate STB and
the potential heterogeneity of associated behavior. We analyze and model behavior in
negatively valenced orthogonalized Go/NoGo tasks [7,9,10] and compare computational
models of learning and decision-making mechanisms that can generate Pavlovian biases
using an empirical hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, based on the method
outlined in [25]. This framework treats model identity as a random effect at the
individual level in the model fitting process, enabling unbiased assessment of
computational mechanisms at both individual and group levels. By leveraging this
robust statistical approach, we provide detailed insights into the cognitive processes
associated with STB.
Materials and Methods
To examine the cognitive mechanisms underlying STB, we analyzed two datasets
involving aversive Go/NoGo tasks designed to measure reflexive and learned responses
to negative stimuli (Figure 1). These complementary datasets allowed us to apply
computational modeling and hierarchical Bayesian inference to identify the mechanisms
driving observed behaviors and evaluate hypotheses about Pavlovian biases in
decision-making.

two datasets collected in distinct populations. The aversive Go/NoGo design employed
in each population differed in design and length. *Abbreviations: MDD- major

Participants
Dataset I
Participants were drawn from a clinical study aimed at identifying suicidal
subgroups based on behavioral, psychological, and genomic factors. We analyzed an
early subsample of this study. Participants were re-contacted from IMPACT
(Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetic Assessment and Clinical Treatment), an
ongoing provincially funded pharmacogenetics study [26]. The cohort included adult
participants with existing diagnoses of anxiety, depression, psychosis, pain, ADHD,
bipolar disorder, tic disorders, or sleep disorders. Participants received $60 for
completing the study assessments, including the Go/NoGo task. Of the 57 participants
who completed the task, 50 (72% female, mean age: 39.6 ±12.4) were included after
exclusion based on outlier performance measures. (see SI)
The study included a comprehensive assessment battery. Suicidal behavior was
characterized using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSR-S, [27]), and
additional self-report scales evaluated depression, hopelessness, and anxiety. Of the
analyzed participants, 27 had experienced suicidal ideation (SI), and 23 had attempted
suicide (SA), with 3 participants reporting recent SA. The online Go/NoGo task
included 300 trials, and behavioral outcomes such as choice and reaction time were
recorded.
Dataset II
This dataset was reanalyzed from a study by [10], who recruited 158 veterans from
Boston-area treatment centers. Of these, 127 participants were psychiatric inpatients,
and 31 were outpatients. The original study published data from 129 participants after
excluding the first participants due to a change in the task presentation. After applying
exclusion criteria consistent with Dataset I, 114 participants (28% female, mean age:
40.6±13.5) were included in our analysis: 40 with a history of SI , 35 with a history of
SA, and 39 with a history of psychiatric conditions other than STB. Participants
completed an in-person aversive Go/NoGo task with 160 trials. Behavioral outcomes,
including choice and reaction time, were recorded. Psychological assessments included,
among others, the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) [28] for

validity, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; [29]) for depressive
symptoms, the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; [30]) and the UPPS Impulsive Behavior
Scale (UPPS; [31]). Further details about the dataset and assessments can be found in
the original publication [10].
Ethics Statement
The IMPACT study (Dataset I) was approved by the Centre for Addiction and Mental
Health Research Ethics Board - approval: 021/2016-03. All participants provided
written informed consent to participate in this study.
Dataset II was reanalyzed from a previous study, approved by the VA Boston
Healthcare System (Institutional Review Board [IRB] 2773) and Harvard University
(IRB 13-1390) IRBs. Further details can be found in the original publication [10].
Cognitive Task
The study employs orthogonal Go/NoGo tasks to assess Pavlovian tendencies in the
context of suicidality. The Go/No-Go task is a widely used paradigm in behavioural
psychology to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases in
decision-making [9,32–34]. These tasks require participants to learn to perform or
withhold actions (Go or NoGo) in response to specific cues to optimize outcomes, with
auditory and visual feedback provided based on their responses. Participants’ primary
goal was to maximize neutral feedback (silence) by selecting the appropriate response to
each cue. The tasks include both escape and avoid conditions: in the escape condition,
participants terminate an aversive stimulus, while in the avoid condition, they prevent
its onset. Four fractal image cues were used, each corresponding to one of four
conditions: Go-to-Escape, Go-to-Avoid, NoGo-to-Escape, and NoGo-to-Avoid.
Feedback contingencies were probabilistic, with optimal responses resulting in silence
80% of the time, the remaining 20% resulting in the aversive stimulus. Suboptimal
responses reversed these probabilities.
Two versions of the Go/NoGo task were utilized, differing in the number of trials,
feedback stimuli, and task structure.
In Dataset I, the task comprised 300 trials, with a mid-task cue-action-outcome
reversal after 150 trials to increase complexity. Aversive feedback consisted of white
noise. Participants adjusted headphone volume to an unpleasant but tolerable level.
Subjective experience probes, including task difficulty and controllability, were included.
Trial types were chosen uniformly at random, with each being presented approximately
75 times, albeit slightly unevenly due to the reversal (e.g., NGA:67, GA:79, NGE:78,
GE:76).
In Dataset II, the task included 160 trials with no cue-action-outcome reversal.
Neutral feedback was silence, while aversive feedback consisted of a scraping sound at
80–85 dB. Feedback duration was standardized to align trial lengths across conditions.
Each cue appeared in 40 trials in permuted order.
Data Analyses
Behavioural Data
Behavioural data were initially analysed using both model-agnostic metrics and simple
model-based heuristics (Win-Stay and Lose-Switch strategies). We computed accuracy
(ratio of trials with correct responses to all trials) on the overall task, as well as for each
of the four cue types, and before and after the reversal for dataset I. A behavioural Go
bias was defined as the difference in accuracy for Go trials (GA and GE) relative to

NoGo trials (NGA and NGE). Similarly, a Go-to-Escape bias was calculated as the
accuracy difference between Go and NoGo trials in the Escape condition, while a
NoGo-to-Avoid bias was the accuracy ratio between NoGo and Go trials in the Avoid
condition.
Modelling Pavlovian Biases (Model Space)
We built and tested a range of computational models that are commonly applied to the
Go/NoGo task. The models formalize and combine aspects of learning and Pavlovian
mechanisms in distinct ways, offering insights into the variability observed in behaviour.
The nomenclature used in the following sections is modular. If a mechanism is not
used in the model, we indicated its absence with the *-symbol 2. The nomenclature is
as follows:

Fig 2. Overview of the full model space for both datasets.Models are
categorized based on the model family (Reinforcement Learning -RL, Kalman filter-K or

desired outcome,dm is the belief decay threshold,pGo is a prior preference for the
Go-policy and T is the action-selection precision (details can be found in [16].
Below, we introduce in further detail the modeling mechanisms considered in this
work.
Model Families: Reinforcement Learning and Active Inference
We evaluated models from two primary families: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
Active Inference (AI). These families capture different facets of decision-making:
I. Active Inference (A):AI agents minimize surprise by aligning predicted
outcomes with prior preferences, performing inference to optimize behaviour
rather than directly maximizing reward.
II. Reinforcement Learning (R & K):Model-free RL agents maximize reward by
learning state-action values and selecting actions based on accumulated
experience.
Mechanisms embedded in both families address Pavlovian biases, learning strategies,
reward sensitivity, action selection, and recency effects.
Active Inference Models
Developed by Karvelis & Diaconescu [16], the Active Inference Suicide Model
(AωG∗∗) parametrizes hopelessness and Active Escape biases in suicidal populations.

Pavlovian tendencies are framed as a fixed policy which exists alongside instrumental
Go/NoGo action policies. The Pavlovian policy shapes expectations, influencing
state-action selection to align with prior beliefs.
The model is parametrized as follows. Parameter ‘c’ encodes the prior dis-preference
for states. Here, we assume equal preference against all states with an aversive sound
compared to ‘neutral’ states, reducing the parameter to a single fitted value. zE and zA
represent the belief that Pavlovian actions (Go-to-escape and NoGo-to-avoid) lead to
preferred outcome states. Pavlovian policies are fixed over trials for this model. dm is a
belief decay threshold which defines the threshold, above which state action prediction
errors (SAPEs) lead to significant belief decay in instrumental policies. The model
dynamically adjusts learning rates through state-action-prediction errors (SAPEs).
Learning extends to counterfactual updates and world-model adjustments via
state-transition matrices.
Action probabilities are computed using a SoftMax function, reflecting the likelihood
that an action results in the expected outcome. αprec is the temperature parameter
defining the slope of the SoftMax function for action selection. We made slight
adjustments to the original AωG∗∗ model to accommodate the aversively balanced
orthogonal Go/NoGo task by incorporating a prior preference for Go policies pGo, to
accommodate the general action biases observed in participants. For the computational
details of the model, we refer the interested reader to the original publication [16].
Reinforcement Learning Models
Most RL models considered were based on the Rescorla-Wagner or delta-rule
framework [35], which is known for its simplicity and efficiency in modelling associative
learning. The model maintains state-action values, or Q- values, which are updated
based on the reward r and learning rate lr after each trial:
Qt (at, st) = Qt−1 (at, st) + lr (rt − Qt−1 (at, st)) (1)
Following extensive previous work on versions of the orthogonal Go-NoGo task and
models [7,9,10,32], we consider modelling mechanisms which specifically capture
Pavlovian tendencies, the influence of working memory and different learning and choice
mechanisms, as well as their interplay.
1. Pavlovian Tendencies:
Pavlovian tendencies may contribute to value formation in two major ways:
I. Pavlovian Context Parameters:Pavlovian tendencies can be
modelled as fixed biases that persist throughout the task [15,36]. As
instrumental learning progresses and state-action values grow, the
influence of these biases gradually diminishes.
Biases are added to the computed Q-values to form a final state-action
value W for action taking:
s = Escape, a = Go :
Wt (a, s) = Qt (a, s) + bGE (2)
s = Avoid, a = NoGo :
Wt (a, s) = Qt (a, s) +bNGA (3)
II. Pavlovian Policies:Here, the inherent strength of the Pavlovian
tendencies is proportional to the values of the states concerned and so
remains malleable during the task. The way these Pavlovian policies
are combined with instrumental preferences can either be with a fixed

contribution ω or a variable contribution based on the posterior
likelihood of the environment being uncontrollable (i.e. Pavlovian),
adapting to task conditions over time [13]. Our models assumed equal
learning rates for Pavlovian and instrumental policies, consistent with
prior research suggesting overlap in their underlying mechanisms [12].
Pavlovian Policies are modelled as arising from action-independent
state-values V that are learned as:
Vt (st) = Vt−1 ( st) + lr (rt – Vt−1 ( st)) (4)
Instrumental and Pavlovian policies are combined with a mixing
parameter ω to obtain a final state-action propensity W for
action-taking:
Wt (GO, st) = Qt (GO, st) + ωV t (st) (5)
Wt (NOGO, st) = Qt (NOGO, st) (6)
III. Pavlovian Evidence Bias: Based on models of the evidence
accumulation that leads an agent to take a decision, Pavlovian
tendencies can be embedded as biased starting points in the
accumulation process [7,10]. Reinforcement Learning-Drift Diffusion
models (RL-DDM; [37,38]) extend classical RL models by capturing
the translation of state-action values into motor responses.
Decision-making is represented as a noisy evidence accumulation
process [38] that allows the modelling of reaction time. Introducing
Pavlovian biased starting points into the evidence accumulation
process biases the decision-making process. Overcoming it requires
strong instrumental values, reinforcing Pavlovian-congruent actions in
the early stages of the task.
While RL-DDM models typically capture both choice and reaction
time data, simplified versions were employed here to model choice data
exclusively. This required reducing the parameter space to ensure
parameter recoverability. The simplified RL-DDM models employed
here (Rα∗∗∗ and Rα∗ρ∗) translate action values into drift velocity v
v = Q(s, GO) − Q(s, NOGO) (7)
This drift velocity is then fed into the Drift Diffusion model, where the
probability for a Go/NoGo action is defined as the probability of
reaching the Go/NoGo limit first, given the velocity and starting point.
The starting points zA for avoid conditions and zE for escape
conditions are defined as
zA = a(1 − wA), zE = a(1 − wE) (8)
where a is the boundary separation between the NoGo and Go choice
boundaries and wA and wE are the (normalized) avoid and escape
biases.
The probability of the first passage time at the upper choice boundary
c is calculated according to [39].

, where s is a scaling factor set to 1 for modelling.
In this model of Pavlovian tendencies, the bias shapes the SoftMax
decision function through a combination of shift along the x-axis and
adjustment of the slope (see Figure S1 for further details).
Mechanically, this means that stronger Pavlovian biases increase the
threshold and decrease the sensitivity for Pavlovian-incongruent
instrumental values to significantly influence action taking. Conversely,
Pavlovian context bias parameters only effect the threshold by shifting
the SoftMax function along the x-axis, but not the sensitivity,
proposing a clearer separation between the effects of Pavlovian and
instrumental learning systems on action-taking. (see SI 7.2.1 for
illustrative examples)
2. Global Action (Go) Bias
A Go-bias parameter captures global, context-independent tendencies towards action
taking, operationalized here as Go responses. For RL models, a bias parameter b is
added to the action weights of Go responses. For most models considered here, a
separate Go bias parameter is not recoverable given the studied datasets. We only
included the parameter for models in which it was recoverable (ICC >.4 for all
parameters), here the RL-policy, RνG∗∗ and RωG∗∗ models.
3. Learning Mechanisms:
To account for potential differences in reinforcement sensitivity in different
environmental contexts, we introduce separate values ρA/E for Avoid and Escape
conditions. The new update equations are:
s = Escape :
Qt (at, st) = Qt−1 (at, st) + α (ρErt − Qt−1 (at, st)) (10)
Vt ( st) = Vt−1 (st) + α (ρErt − Vt−1 ( st)) (11)
s = Avoid :
Qt (at, st) = Qt−1 (at, st) + α (ρA rt − Qt−1 (at, st)) (12)
Vt ( st) = Vt−1 (st) + α (ρArt − Vt−1 ( st)) (13)
The AωG∗∗ model boasts a dynamic learning rate based on state-prediction errors.
By contrast, Rescorla-Wagner models typically employ fixed learning rates. To create a
dynamic learning rate in our RL models, we consider a simple Kalman filter ( Kb∗∗∗),
presenting a Bayesian generalization of Rescorla-Wagner [40–42]. In this model, the
agent tracks a posterior distribution instead of a point estimate of the outcome, utilizing
the uncertainty to dynamically adjust its learning rate to the environmental volatility.
The Kalman gain replaces the learning rate α in the Rescorla-Wagner model.
Importantly, the Kalman gain is stimulus-specific and changes dynamically with each
trial n:
kn =
 
Σn + τ2I

xn
xTn (Σn + τ2I) xn + σ2r
(14)
, where Σn is the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution over the
stimulus-action value, τ is the diffusion variance and σ is the prior variance.

4. Choice Mechanism:
The translation of action values into choice probabilities is based on a simple
SoftMax function for all models, except the RL-DDM models ( Ra∗∗∗ and Rα∗ρ∗), which
has its own modified SoftMax function (see equ. 8).
In the simple SoftMax functions, decision noise was modelled by tuning the function
using either a temperature parameter T (used in AbG∗∗) or its inverse, β = 1
T
p(at, st ) = exp (β W (at, st)) /
X
a′
exp (β W (a′, st)) (15)
In some of the proposed models, the role of the inverse temperature parameter is
taken by the reward sensitivity (ρ) parameter. This introduces a condition-dependent
sensitivity to action-value differences. In models with reward sensitivity, we additionally
considered a lapse parameter ξ, allowing the model to account for value-to-choice
translation errors and random action lapses. This lapse parameters acts as irreducible
noise.
p(at, st) = ξ exp (W (at, st)) /

exp (W (a′, st)) + (1 − ξ)/2 (16)
Parametrization choices for all models have been vetted for parameter recoverability
(see SI 7.5.2).
5. Mnemonic Mechanisms (Rb∗∗f and Rb∗∗m):
Finally, we consider different mnemonic mechanisms, one proposing uniform
forgetting and one with perfect learning, which increases emphasis on the last feedback
obtained. The Rb∗∗f model uses a decay parameter to represent the forgetting of action
values over time. The Rb∗∗m model [11] integrates a working memory with fixed
capacity. The working memory system is designed as a Q-learning system with learning
rate 1 and a decay factor, capturing degrading memory over time.
These models address task characteristics where inter-trial intervals vary, allowing
value decay or memory-driven retention of cue-action mappings over time.
The model space explored here is not exhaustive in terms of general learning
mechanisms that may influence task behaviour. We did however explore
state-independent learning [43,44] but did not find evidence justifying the extension of
our already large model space for this learning mechanism, as the overall model fit was
worse than for state-action learning models. Initially, we also considered a second AI
model [15], which incorporates Pavlovian influences as prior policy preferences with a
working memory component. However, adapting this model for the Go/NoGo task
resulted in poor fitting performance. As such, this model was excluded from further
analysis.
Empirical hierarchical Bayesian inference
Hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) is a robust statistical framework that
concurrently fits and compares models across individuals and groups [25]. HBI treats
model identity as a random effect and uses an expectation-maximization-based iterative
estimation approach to update group priors and individual parameter fits. This
approach accounts for individual variability while identifying shared group-level
patterns in a way that avoids untoward group biases. This makes it particularly suited
to provide a nuanced understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms in
heterogeneous populations, such as those with STB, and is specifically relevant in fields
such as psychology and neuroscience, where understanding the interplay between

individual differences and group dynamics is essential for developing effective
interventions and treatments. For instance, in studies involving psychiatric disorders,
HBI can help identify and model subsets of individuals corresponding to disease
subgroups. This ability to model heterogeneity not only enhances the accuracy of
predictions but also aids in the identification of specific factors that contribute to
individual differences in behaviour and cognition.
Fig 3. Schematic of the 3 hierarchical levels of the empirical HBI fitting
procedure. At the highest level, the procedure iteratively estimates the model identity
for a subject, given current group priors and individual model fits. Model identity is
updated as a Dirichlet distribution, which acts as the conjugate prior for the multinomial
model, where the model space is given byM = {m1, m2 . . . mK}. C(α0) is the
normalizing constant for the Dirichlet distribution. At the second level, group priors,
with µ(k)as group mean for model k andT(k)− as inverse group variance matrix, are
updated based on the responsibility-weighted individual maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
parameter estimates (with h(k)
n being the MAP parameters for subject n, fitted by model
k, and Σ(k)
n being the posterior variance of parameters for subject n, fitted by model k,
and R(k) = P
n r(k)
n ). Model probabilities are given byR = {r(k=1:K)
n=1:N } for each model k
and individual n, based on relative Bayesian model evidence ρ(k)
n . At the lowest level,
individual parametersh(k)
n are estimated, given the updated responsibility-weighted group
prior.
The original HBI procedure was based on a mean-field approximation with fixed
priors. We adapted it to use an empirical variational Bayesian fitting approach with flat
priors, equally leveraging individual maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) parameter estimates
at the individual level. Both empirical variational Bayesian modeling and mean-field
variational Bayes are prominent methods in Bayesian inference, each offering distinct
advantages. By deploying flat group priors, the empirical approach lets the data fully
shape the posterior distributions, which can improve model performance in data-limited
settings and mitigate the need for precisely defined priors [45,46]. In contrast,
mean-field variational Bayes optimization relies on fixed group priors and approximates
the posterior distribution by assuming independence among latent variables, thereby
simplifying computations but potentially introducing biases if this independence
assumption does not hold [47,48]. While we did not perform formal testing beyond the

limited experimental scope here, the adapted empirical HBI (eHBI) procedure showed
improved convergence performance for the specific model spaces and datasets tested in
this work. These results may be specific to our work and may not generalize to other
model spaces and datasets without further investigation.
The final eHBI procedure is depicted in Fig. 2 and combines the original unbiased
extended hierarchical fitting from [25] with the improved convergence properties of
empirical Bayesian optimization. The main adjustment lies in the second level, where
we replaced the Bayesian estimate of group parameters, using a Gaussian-Gamma
distribution as prior, with a simpler, empirical estimate of group parameters.
Model selection procedure
As noted, the eHBI procedure realizes model selection and subgroup analyses which can
help identify distinct cognitive mechanisms and variations in parameter ranges across
populations. In this study, we focused on model selection to determine which Pavlovian
mechanisms best explain behaviours in the Go/NoGo task. The process involved
multiple steps to identify candidate models, narrow the model space, and evaluate the
winning models.
First, potential mechanisms to model Pavlovian biases in the Go/NoGo paradigm
were identified. This step involved reviewing existing literature to select relevant model
families and aligning the models with the behavioural hypotheses under examination.
Insights from preliminary behavioural data analyses were also considered to ensure the
chosen models capture key cognitive processes. (see ).
Next, the selected models were individually, and non-hierarchically, fit to the data
using minimally informative priors. This step helps verify whether the mechanisms
underlying each model are supported by the observed behaviours of individuals in the
population. Models that show little evidence of explanatory power were eliminated at
this stage, which further justifies the use of an uninformative prior for model identity.
Model responsibilities were computed based on the individual fit quality, as captured by
the likelihood,
rk =
PN
n=1 p (xn|hk,n)
PK
k=1
PN
n=1 (p (xn|hk,n))
(17)
where hk,n are the fitted parameters for the kth model and nth subject.
No penalty for the number of parameters was applied at this pre-selection step. The
goal was to obtain an initial assessment of the plausibility of proposed mechanisms, not
to select between models to identify the most parsimonious mechanism capturing the
highest amount of variance. Assuming a reasonable selection of models with the similar
numbers of parameters, this pre-selection analysis helped to eliminate implausible
candidate models.
Parameter recovery was performed for each model in the full model space, based on
individually fitted posterior distributions. For this purpose, we generated parameters for
one synthetic individual from the posterior distributions of each fitted participant.
Parameter recovery was based on individually fitted models. This naturally accounts for
the between-subjects covariance between parameters, ensuring that parameter recovery
is tested in relevant parameter ranges. The quality of recovery was assessed in terms of
intraclass correlation (ICC).
Following this, the empirical HBI fitting procedure was applied to assess the overall
population fit and determine the winning model. The model and exceedance
probabilities were calculated to evaluate whether a single model could explain the
behaviour of the entire population or if different models would be required for
subgroups exhibiting distinct strategies or cognitive processes. Depending on the results

and the specific research question, either the eHBI-fitted model would be used directly
for subgroup or individual-level analyses, or the entire population would be refitted with
the winning model to enable population-level inference and phenotyping.
Model recovery was performed for the selected model subspace. Data was simulated
with each model, based on the group posteriors obtained by hierarchically fitting the
model to the according dataset. We then ran the eHBI procedure with the full subspace
on the simulated data to examine whether the procedure would recover the generative
model.
Finally, further subgroup analyses may be conducted to explore emerging patterns
within the population. These subgroups may reflect different problem-solving strategies
captured by distinct models or variations in cognitive function levels represented by the
same model with different parameter values. Such analyses can provide deeper insights
into cognitive phenotypes within the studied population.
Results
We analysed choice data from two distinct populations, who performed different
versions of the orthogonalized aversive Go/NoGo task with primary auditory feedback.
For each dataset, we first identified candidate models based on previous literature
(section 4.3.2). We then refined the model space for the empirical Hierarchical Bayesian
Inference (eHBI) procedure by assessing the evidence supporting the prevalence of each
mechanism to individuals within the population (section 5.2). The eHBI procedure was
subsequently applied to investigate how Pavlovian mechanisms shaped behaviours
across groups of participants (section 5.3).
Post-hoc analyses of the winning model(s), alongside correlational analyses between
computational mechanisms and behavioural metrics, provided deeper insights into the
strengths and limitations of the models within the context of the populations and
cognitive task. Additionally, model and parameter recovery analyses, as well as face
validity checks, were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings (see
supplementary materials).
Model-agnostic analyses of datasets I and II
A preliminary model-agnostic analysis was conducted to examine choice behaviour and
performance patterns across both datasets (Figure 3). This analysis focused on assessing
accuracy for each cue type and evaluating performance trends over trials. For Dataset I,
we also investigated the effects of cue-action-outcome reversals on task performance.

Fig 4. Accuracy of performance on the tasks.The left panels (A.I-E.I)
correspond to dataset I. (A.I-C.I) Overall accuracy and accuracy before and after

accuracy was higher for Go than NoGo cues during both conditions. (D.I-E.I) average
accuracy per trial (dots; the lines show the result of spline smoothing, separately applied
before and after the reversal). Accuracy initially increases across conditions, and we
observe a clear decline immediately after the cue-outcome reversal, followed by noisy
learning. The right panels (A.II-C.II) correspond to dataset II. (A.II) Overall accuracy,
split by condition. An effect of response-by-condition can be seen where accuracy is

result of spline smoothing). Accuracy increases across conditions over time and plateaus
towards the second half of the task. Error bars represent standard error of the mean and
shaded areas indicate a 95% confidence interval.
In Dataset I, participants achieved an average accuracy of 68.2% (SD = 10.7%). An
ANOVA with accuracy as the dependent variable and condition (Escape vs. Avoid),
response type (Go vs. NoGo), and reversal phase (before vs. after) as factors revealed
significant main effects of response type and reversal (p=9.7e-15 and p = 2.7e-13,
respectively). Accuracy was higher for Go responses and before the reversal phase.
Additionally, significant interaction effects were observed between response type and
condition (p = .039), suggesting that task performance was modulated by task context.
Performance biases in Dataset I displayed high variability. The Go-to-Escape bias (GE)
was .206 (SD = .205), while the NoGo-to-Avoid bias (NGA) was -.107 (SD = .221).
Although a dominant Go bias was present at the population level across conditions, a
significantly lower Go bias was observed in the Avoid condition (p = .004). This
indicates the presence of a Pavlovian Inhibitory Avoidance bias in addition to a more
pronounced overall active Go-Bias in this dataset.
For Dataset II (Millner et al., 2019), following exclusion criteria, the average
accuracy was higher, reaching 76.4% (SD = 15.3%). ANOVA results indicated a
significant main effect of response type on accuracy (p = 4.4e-11). The
condition-by-response interaction did not reach statistical significance (p =.07).
Participants demonstrated better performance for Go-to-Escape cues compared to
NoGo-to-Escape cues, while the opposite trend was observed for the Avoid condition.
The Go-to-Escape bias of .197 (SD = .257) was similar to Dataset I, while the
NoGo-to-Avoid bias of .056 (SD = .266) was more pronounced. As in Dataset I,
substantial variability in performance biases was noted across participants.
The observed differences in accuracy between datasets likely reflect differences in
task complexity, with Dataset I’s reversal phase contributing to lower overall
performance. The high Go-to-Escape bias is consistent across both datasets, suggesting
that negatively valenced Go-NoGo tasks with primary feedback capture Pavlovian

active-escape response reproducibly. The divergence in NoGo-to-Avoid biases between
the datasets highlights a less pronounced and potentially less consistent effect of
inhibitory avoidance. While Pavlovian tendencies have previously been associated with
suicidality, most literature has focused on active escape or decreased inhibitory biases
(Dombrovski & Hallquist, 2021; Interian et al., 2020; Millner et al., 2019; Myers et al.,
2023). The discrepancy in findings underscores the need for further investigation into
the mechanisms underlying inhibitory control in aversive contexts.
Model Space Pre-Selection Results
To initialize our model-based analyses, we systematically narrowed the model space to
retain only those with significant evidence of capturing relevant mechanisms in the
population. This process involved evaluating the average individual fits for each model
across both datasets (Figure 5).
Fig 5. Relative individual model responsibilities.Relative Model responsibilities
associated with the full model space individually fitted to each individual in the full
population for dataset I (A) and II (B), respectively. A total of 12 different models was
fitted to each individual, using non-informative priors. The relative responsibilities were
averaged across individuals to obtain a mean relative responsibility of each model for the
studied populations. Dashed lines indicate the cut-off for each population to consider a
model in the reduced model subspace. Thresholds were chosen empirically and adjusted
to create a model space where the least prominent model would have a residual
exceedance probability below .01. This approach was chosen to ensure a minimally biased
fitting procedure, in which all models with the potential to explain a marked amount of
behavioural variance were included.
For Dataset I, two models – Rb∗∗f and Rb∗∗m – emerged as dominant, with fit
correlations of r = .34 and r = .36, representing the best fit for 18 and 19 participants,
respectively (Figure 4). Additionally, the Rα∗ρ∗ model with reward sensitivity and the
Kb∗∗∗ filter with its uncertainty-adjusted learning rate surpassed the initial threshold of
r > .05, warranting their inclusion in the final model space. A simple RL model with
reward sensitivity was also incorporated after adjusting the threshold to t = .03. The
threshold was adjusted after the initial empirical results to create a model space in
which the least prevalent model would have a residual exceedance probability below .01,
ensuring high confidence in the completeness of the subspace. Models incorporating
Pavlovian policies, whether Active Inference, or simpler reinforcement learning (RL)
policies, showed minimal evidence of applicability.
In Dataset II, model fits exhibited greater variability, with a broader range of
candidate models capable of capturing the behavioural patterns. Consistent with
Dataset I, evidence for policy-based RL models was minimal. However, RL models

incorporating Pavlovian context biases met the threshold of t = .05 and emerged as
potential candidates, except for the simplest versions with only general Go or Pavlovian
bias parameters. Due to the more distributed responsibility among models, the default
threshold was maintained. In addition, the evidence bias models received significant
support. These models feature Pavlovian evidence bias parameters, which are very hard
to overcome on the timescale of the task. Additionally, the Active Inference Suicide
model (AωG∗∗) showed strong support at the individual level for this population,
representing the only model with Pavlovian tendencies encoded as polices with
substantial evidence of relevance.
The differences in model selectivity between datasets may stem from variations in
task design. Dataset I, comprising 300 trials, included a cue-outcome reversal,
introducing a secondary learning phase that enriched the choice data. This additional
complexity likely facilitated model selection by generating distinct learning and
relearning windows for each participant. Greater task complexity appears to have
enhanced the ability to differentiate between competing models, providing a more
comprehensive evaluation of underlying mechanisms.
Evaluating Model Fit at the Population and Individual Levels
This individual within-participant view of model performance 5 is important, as
population-level assessments can hide individual differences. 6 provides insight into
models' ability to predict observed behavioural choices across the population. While
relative model responsibility identifies which models best explain individual
performance, absolute model fit measures how well a model predicts choice probability
across all individuals.
Fig 6. Absolute fit of individually fitted models.Absolute fit of individually
fitted models for dataset I (A) and II (B). The average probability per choice for each
participant (y-axis) is indicated for each model (x-axis). Boxplots indicate the median,
25th and 75th percentile of the population fit.
In Dataset I, while relative model responsibilities indicated high model selectivity (
in favour of Rb∗∗f and Rb∗∗m), absolute model fit on the population level showed
increased fit quality only for Rb∗∗f , with all other models exhibiting similar absolute fit,
but with high within-model variance.
In Dataset II, absolute fit probabilities were higher overall but showed greater
variability within and across models (Figure 6B). Four models, Rb∗∗f , Rb∗∗m, Rα∗∗∗
and Kb∗∗∗ had the highest average absolute fit quality with no clear winner. The large
within-model variance of absolute fit (e.g. AωG∗∗ model in Figure 6B) highlights the
importance of assessing model fit at the individual level. Across both datasets,
individual level evaluations provided more nuanced insights for model selectivity for
individual performance. The support for models above the responsibility threshold in
each dataset reflects their superior fit quality compared to other models within

individuals.
Each selected model underwent parameter recovery testing and face validity checks
to ensure reliable performance within the relevant parameter ranges based on individual
fits (see Section 5.4 ).
Replicating Behavioral Patterns with the Best-Fitting Models
Finally, we examined the ability of the best performing models to replicate average
choice probability by trial. In Dataset I, RL models with Pavlovian context biases and
additional mnemonic mechanisms stood out. The addition of the forgetting factor
allowed the model to fit response probability spikes following unexpected feedback more
accurately than the Rb∗∗∗ model, which lacks mnemonic mechanisms (Figure 7). The
working memory model, while capturing broader patterns, lacked this same sensitivity
to recent feedback and overshot the average probability in Go-conditions (Figure 7). A
similar pattern emerged in Dataset II (Figure 8). Additionally, the Active Inference
model garnered significant support at the individual level. Compared to the
best-performing RL model with forgetting, the AI model showed slightly reduced
accuracy in tracking dips in average population performance throughout the task. The
value decay mechanism of the AωG∗∗ model, based on state-action-prediction-errors, was
less sensitive to unexpected feedback compared to the RL model. (Examples of
individual trajectories for the best and worst fitting models can be found in Figure S4
and S5)

In simulations, the AωG∗∗ model clearly outperformed the Rb∗∗f model in replicating
accuracy and Lose-Switch behaviours ( AωG∗∗: Lose-Switch-ICC = .837, Acc-ICC =
.973; Rb∗∗f : Lose-Switch-ICC = .7, Acc-ICC = .923), indicating a strong ability to
capture some key behavioural traits (see Table S8).
Model Comparison Results
eHBI
The empirical Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (eHBI) procedure was applied to the
selected model subspaces for each dataset to analyse responsibility distributions and
identify the winning models (Figure 9).

Fig
9. eHBI model comparison results for dataset I and II.(A) and (B) show
the responsibility distribution for the entire population across the respective model
subspaces. For dataset I, model responsibilities indicate both theRb∗∗f with r = .54 and
the Rb∗∗m model with r = .22 explain the data very well, followed by theRb∗ρ∗ model
with r = .16, For dataset II, again, theRb∗∗f model has the highest responsibility with a
prevalence of r = .46, followed by the simpleRα∗∗∗ model with r = 24. The remaining
models have low prevalence across subjects. (C) and (D) show the exceedance
probabilities for each model for dataset I and II, respectively. Results are consistent
across both datasets, indicating the RL model with Pavloviancontext bias parameters
and a forgetting parameter clearly outperforms the competing candidate models on the
population level.
For Dataset I, the Rb∗∗f model with Pavlovian context biases emerged as the winning
model. Consistent with individual-fit evidence, this model accounted for the largest
share of model responsibility across participants, with r = .52 and an exceedance
probability of pe > .99 at the population level. The Rb∗∗f model significantly
outperformed other candidate models in the subspace. The Rb∗∗m model was the
second most prevalent, capturing less than half the responsibility (r = .24) and best
describing only 8 out of 50 participants. Together, these results confirm the importance
of accounting for forgetting mechanisms. This opens possibilities to explore the effects
of such mechanisms on behaviour further, as previous work has suggested impaired WM
capacity in these populations (Richard-Devantoy et al., 2015; Zetsche et al., 2018).
Similarly, the Rb∗∗f model dominated Dataset II, with an accumulated responsibility
of r = .49 and an exceedance probability of pe = .98. The second highest-scoring
model was the simplified Rα∗∗∗ model, which accounted for r = .22 of the responsibility.
The responsibility distributions derived from the eHBI model selection deviated
notably from the individual pre-selection assessments. Two primary factors contribute
to this shift.
First, the eHBI procedure incorporates a parameter penalty term in the model
August

evidence, which was excluded during the initial pre-selection. Models with greater
parameter complexity must explain a substantial portion of the remaining data
variability to achieve higher responsibility scores. This accounts for the reduced
prevalence of the Rb∗∗m model in the eHBI selection compared to individual-level
pre-selection. The Rb∗∗f model explains similar behavioural effects through a forgetting
mechanism [11] but requires one fewer degree of freedom than the Rb∗∗m model. The
design of the task is not optimized to capture working memory processes (as in [11],
making the differential treatment of forgetting and working memory unjustified in this
context. A similar trend was observed in Dataset II, where the Rα∗∗∗ model with
reward sensitivity initially scored higher at the individual level but was penalized during
eHBI selection due to increased parameter complexity.
Second, the hierarchical fitting in the eHBI procedure evaluates the population, as
well as the individual, fit. Fitted group priors impose soft constraints on individual fits,
penalizing model fits with parameters deviating from the group prior by reducing their
model evidence. If the behavioural patterns of a population are not well captured
within a constrained parameter range, a model may exhibit low prevalence at the
population level despite demonstrating strong individual fits under uninformative priors.
The AωG∗∗ model for Dataset II exemplifies this phenomenon, as it achieved high
individual model evidence but exhibited lower prevalence in hierarchical model selection
(see Table S4).
These findings underscore the importance of considering both individual and
hierarchical model assessments in behavioural model fitting, as differences in model
complexity and parameter variance can significantly impact the selection process and
subsequent interpretations.
Post-Hoc
To further investigate differences and limitations among the candidate models, we
explored how each model captured key behavioral measures, spanning both model-free
performance biases and model-based indicators of learning strategy.
In Dataset I, we observed a pronounced Go-bias that persisted across Avoid and
Escape conditions (Figure 10). Participants displayed relatively high Lose-Switch
behaviours (relative to dataset II), suggesting heightened sensitivity to negative
feedback. Apart from a notable decrease in accuracy, the raw behavioral data did not
reveal significant immediate effects of cue-outcome reversal, indicating a general
difficulty in re-learning cue-action associations during the second half of the task.

meaning participants display a weak Go bias during Avoid conditions. The only measure
with a significant difference before and after reversal is accuracy, with a significant
decrease in the second half of the task.
Next, we assessed model differences by grouping participants according to their
winning model ( maxk(pk(m))) within the eHBI procedure (Figure 11, p-values can be
found in Table S5). Models that best fit fewer than four individuals, such as the Kb∗∗∗
filter and Rα∗∗∗ with reward sensitivity, were excluded from subsequent subgroup
analyses to ensure sufficient inferential power.

Within the Rb∗∗f group, there was substantial variance across most model-agnostic
behavioural measures. Although this group showed a decrease in inhibitory avoid bias
relative to the Rb∗ρ∗ model (p = .049,) and a decrease in Lose-Switch strategy compared
to the Rb∗ρ∗ model (p = .048, F DRcuttoff = 4.4e-4), as well as an increase in the
Win-Stay strategy, these effects did not survive correction. In contrast, the Rb∗∗m group
exhibited significantly higher Lose-Switch behaviour compared to the Rb∗∗f group (p =
1.6e-5) and showed a trend toward significance relative to the Rb∗ρ∗ group (p = .001).
Despite the limitations imposed by very small sample sizes, certain behavioral traits
nonetheless appeared to be better explained by specific models. The Rb∗∗f model, for

example, captured individuals across a wide range of accuracies and revealed a
significant effect of the reversal on performance accuracy (Fig.10). This group showed
adaptive learning strategies aligned with the probabilistic feedback structure,
accounting for some of the highest performers in the dataset. The forgetting mechanism
of the Rb∗∗f model may help explain task performance by gradually reducing the
influence of older information on action selection over time. This hypothesis is
supported by the model’s ability to replicate performance accuracy, particularly before
the reversal, as well as Win-Stay patterns (see S, Tab.S10). Given the task design,
which involved up to 20 trials between cue repetitions, these findings suggest that
explicitly modeling value decay (as in Rb∗∗f ) is crucial for accurately capturing
performance during long inter-trial intervals.
The Rb∗∗m model, on the other hand, predominantly captured participants who
exhibited increased Lose-Switch behaviour. This model tracks action values using both
working memory and instrumental learning systems, placing strong emphasis on the
most recent trial outcome. As a result, it demonstrates a high capacity to reproduce
Lose-Switch and Win-Stay patterns (Table S8). However, the reliance on perfect recall
of recent feedback also introduces volatility in action-value estimates, potentially
contributing to lower overall accuracy in a probabilistic task such as Go/NoGo. A
significant negative correlation between the working memory contribution ( ρWM ) and
accuracy following unexpected feedback (R = -.619, p = .042) supports this
interpretation.
Dataset IIshowed large variability in performance biases, with minimal Go-bias
and Pavlovian performance biases in Avoid and Escape conditions (Figure 12). Overall,
participants displayed low Lose-Switch and high Win-Stay behavior, consistent with
relatively strong task performance. As in Dataset I, any subgroups with fewer than four
individuals were excluded from the analyses.

Compared to the Rb∗∗f , Rb∗∗m, and Rα∗∗∗ models, the Rb∗ρ∗ model captured a
subgroup characterised by significantly lower Go-bias, increased Active Escape, and
enhanced Inhibitory Avoid Bias (Figure 13, p-values can be found in Table S6).
Differences in learning strategies and accuracy across subgroups were less consistent.

The Rb∗∗f and Rb∗∗m models captured overlapping behavioural profiles, with the
primary point of differentiation being the increased Lose-Switch behaviour in the Rb∗∗m
group (p = 0.003). This finding parallels results from Dataset I, where the Rb∗∗m model
excelled at explaining heightened Lose-Switch behaviour, a pattern attributed to the
working memory system’s perfect recall of the most recent trial.
The Rα∗∗∗ model, representing the third-largest subgroup, was marked by low
variance in model-agnostic behavioral measures. Individuals in this subgroup showed

minimal performance biases, significantly lower Lose-Switch and Win-Stay behaviour
than the other large-model subgroups ( Rb∗ρ∗, Rb∗∗f and Rb∗∗m), and higher overall
accuracy. This subgroup thus represents high-performing individuals with few biases,
whose behavior is sufficiently captured by a reduced-parameter model. By contrast,
lower-performing participants were better described by models incorporating Pavlovian
context biases or additional flexibility, such as forgetting mechanisms or reward
sensitivity adjustments.
Overall, these analyses suggest that different computational models capture distinct
behavioural profiles within the population, shedding light on potential mechanisms
underlying performance variability in aversive Go/NoGo tasks. Notably, in both
datasets, models featuring forgetting or working memory mechanisms best explained
subgroups with stronger Lose-Switch behaviors. Their ability to replicate these learning
strategies (Table S8), illustrates how the models’ parametrization, accounting for
recency effects, improves fit for individuals whose behavior is particularly influenced by
recent outcomes.
Model Recovery and Face Validity
The winning models for Datasets I and II reproduced behavioral variables with high
fidelity, as indicated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values above 0.7 (Figure
14; Table S8 ). In contrast, non-winning models showed greater variability, with ICC
values dipping as low as 0.29 for the Lose-Switch strategy. Because the Lose-Switch
pattern was not explicitly targeted by the model fitting, its lower reproducibility was
unsurprising. Overall, these findings point to moderate parameter recovery across
models but highlight notable differences in how effectively they capture and reproduce
key behavioral features. To ensure the interpretability of these analyses, we conducted
model recovery and parameter recovery assessments, as well as face validity checks.

dataset, the behavioural measures for active-escape and inhibitory-avoid biases and
lose-switch and win-stay metrics computed on generated behaviour is plotted against the
computed behavioural metrics on the observed data.
A model recovery analysis was performed for the subspaces for both datasets (Figure
S8). For Dataset I, the true generative model overwhelmingly dominated in every
instance with a median probability of 100% and the lowest probability being 99.3%.
The same was true for Dataset II, in which the true generative model dominated with a
median probability of 88.6%, except for the Kb∗∗∗ model. Data generated by the Kb∗∗∗
model was best fitted by the Rα∗∗∗ model with one fewer parameter, indicating that the

complexity of the Kalman filter was not capturing sufficient variability of the data to
justify the additional degree of freedom. This is in line with the results of the eHBI
procedure for Dataset II, in which the Rα∗∗∗ had significantly stronger support.
Next, we performed parameter recovery for each model in the full model space.
Except for the uncertainty parameter σ in the Kalman filter, all parameters had ICC
values >.4, indicating moderate to good recovery (Table S7). The median ICC across all
models was ICC m = .89 (median absolute deviation or MAD = .05) for Dataset I and
ICC m = .84 (MAD = .09) for Dataset II.
To assess the face validity of each individual model, we generated synthetic data for
each individual based on parameters from the hierarchically fitted model, and
comparing the replication of various behavioral measures -Pavlovian biases (Active
Escape, Inhibitory Avoid), learning strategies (Win-Stay, Lose-Switch), and choice
accuracy. In both datasets, models in the selected subspaces generally reproduced these
measures well, with the notable exception of Lose-Switch behaviour in models that
included context-dependent reward sensitivity ( ρ), which exhibited poor reproducibility.
This result underscores the need for caution when using these particular models to
study behaviors in greater detail. In contrast, models excluded by eHBI showed mixed
face validity, suggesting limitations in their ability to capture the observed behaviors in
these populations. (Table S8)
Overall, the parameter and model recovery analyses performed well across tested
models, but the face validity results highlight that certain model-agnostic behavioral
measures—particularly Lose-Switch—are not adequately captured by many models.
These findings underscore the need for careful and nuanced interpretation, especially
when drawing conclusions about specific learning strategies from model-based analyses.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance in
negatively valenced Go/NoGo tasks among individuals with suicidal thoughts and
behaviors (STB). By adapting and applying the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI)
procedure [25], we aimed to identify which models best captured Pavlovian and
instrumental learning processes in two separate datasets featuring aversive primary
feedback. Throughout our analyses, we focused on potential Pavlovian biases and the
role of learning mechanisms such as value decay (forgetting) and policy-based
adaptations.
Key Findings
Dataset Iwas characterized by a persistent Go-bias throughout the task, even
though we hypothesized that the heightened environmental volatility and potential
reversal-learning deficits in suicidal populations [22] would elevate Pavlovian biases
following a contingency reversal on trial 151. Our initial hypothesis was that
contingency reversal would primarily impact instrumental learning, as instrumental
associations are action-dependent and require updating based on new evidence.
Conversely, Pavlovian associations, being action-independent, should remain unaffected
by the reversal. However, this was not observed. Instead, the reversal procedure
(affecting both cue-action associations and auditory feedback) simultaneously challenged
both learning systems. Prior research suggests that reversal learning deficits may not be
specific to a single learning system [49]. If both systems were similarly impaired
following the reversal, the Pavlovian system could not compensate for deficits in
instrumental learning, explaining the absence of increased Pavlovian biases post-reversal.
Model comparison using the eHBI procedure indicated a clear prevalence of the
Rb∗∗f model, which incorporates static Pavlovian bias parameters with a decay
parameter for learned values, capturing forgetting over time. No evidence of

policy-based Pavlovian mechanisms was found. These results suggest that Pavlovian
biases do not require significant associative learning before being evident in behavioural
responses. The feedback structure, emphasizing primary aversive stimuli, may
inherently activate Pavlovian associations, reducing the need for learned associations.
Additionally, in this version of the Go/NoGo task, the presence of the aversive sound
indicates the context (Avoid or Escape) to the participant right away, minimizing the
requirements for associative learning [7,36]. The additional complexity introduced by a
value decay parameter was justified by their superior explanatory power relative to
simpler, bias-only models, particularly in the task context involving prolonged inter-trial
intervals and probabilistic feedback.
In contrast, Dataset IIshowed stronger Active-Escape tendencies and weaker
Inhibitory-Avoid biases, diverging from the dominant Go-bias observed in Dataset I.
Similar trends were observed, with Rb∗∗f emerging as the winning model and minimal
evidence supporting policy-based models. Unlike Dataset I, the AωG∗∗ model gained
substantial support during individual model comparison. However, complexity penalties
within the hierarchical Bayesian framework limited this model’s overall support,
emphasizing the necessity of balancing complexity with explanatory precision.
An important methodological distinction between the two datasets is the number of
trials and the presence of a reversal in Dataset I. Dataset I, with 300 trials and a critical
reversal point, provided a rich source of behavioral variability, resulting in more
pronounced model selectivity. By contrast, Dataset II included only 160 trials, limiting
the ability to distinguish among competing models.
The results of this study align with, and extend, prior research investigating
Pavlovian tendencies in Go/NoGo tasks. Early work by Guitart-Masip et. al [9]
proposed modeling Pavlovian tendencies in the now common reward/punishment
version of the Go/NoGo task with secondary feedback as learnable policies but did not
explore alternative mechanisms, such as static biases. Adams et. al compared policy-
and bias-based RL models, including versions with forgetting and reward sensitivity, as
well as an Active Inference model, in a traditional secondary-feedback Go/NoGo task in
healthy controls [15]. They found that a context bias RL model with reward sensitivity
best explained behavior of most of the population, while adding a forgetting parameter
did not improve fit. Importantly, in their study, the Pavlovian bias parameters were
assumed to be of equal size across reward and punishment conditions and forgetting was
only tested for the best-performing RL model (with reward sensitivity) and did not
improve the fit further. Notably the only Pavlovian context bias model they tested
performed best in model comparison, resonating with the robust evidence of context
biases we identified under aversive primary feedback.
Additionally, research by Swart et al. [36] emphasized the influence of stable biases
when the cue indicates the task condition, and [7,10] demonstrated how aversive
primary feedback can elicit immediate Pavlovian reactions. Our results align with these
studies: static Pavlovian biases seem to manifest quickly once the aversive context is
evident, without requiring extensive associative learning.
Applications of the eHBI Procedure
The eHBI procedure is particularly valuable for model selection in datasets with
heterogeneous population characteristics and unclear cognitive parametrization. Each
model and its mechanisms bring specific assumptions and implications about Pavlovian
and instrumental learning systems and how these mechanisms influence observed
behaviors. By treating model identity as a random factor during fitting, the eHBI
procedure facilitates unbiased comparisons and supports subgroup analyses. Such
analyses are invaluable when different segments of a population rely on distinct
mechanisms, as different models can be used to parametrize each segment accurately.
While we did not observe significant model heterogeneity in the studied populations,

previous work on larger datasets with different model prevalences has shown the
importance of this [15,43].
Alternatively, when a population relies on the same cognitive strategy but exhibits
varying functionality levels, subgrouping analyses can cluster individuals into distinct
parameter ranges. This data-driven approach holds promise for sample stratification
and diagnostic purposes. For example, clustering may reveal phenotypic subgroups,
enabling targeted interventions or more nuanced clinical assessments [43].
Limitations and Future Directions
While our hypothesis-driven approach clarified the cognitive processes underpinning
performance in these suicidal populations, it was inherently limited by the set of
proposed models. To uncover more nuanced or previously unrecognized mechanisms,
exploratory computational methods, such as the Disentangled Recurrent Neural
Networks (DisRNNs; [50]; see also [51]), which autonomously discover interpretable
cognitive structures directly from behavioral data, can be employed. Unlike our
constrained method, DisRNN employs neural network architectures with
disentanglement and information bottlenecks, allowing for the discovery of latent
cognitive processes beyond initial assumptions. Integrating such exploratory methods
alongside structured hypothesis-driven modelling could uncover subtle or novel cognitive
phenotypes, enhancing clinical subtyping and informing targeted interventions in
suicidal populations.
Several further limitations must be acknowledged. The relatively small sample sizes,
particularly in Dataset I, and differences in task design (e.g., auditory feedback, task
length, presence of reversal) limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally,
heterogeneity in demographic factors, psychiatric diagnoses, and medication use further
complicate direct comparisons between datasets and are limited to populations with
symptoms of suicidality. These factors interact in complex ways to shape Pavlovian and
instrumental learning, contributing to variability in responses to reinforcement and
aversive stimuli. Psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders and PTSD, for
instance, have been linked to heightened sensitivity to aversive stimuli, which can
impede the extinction of conditioned responses [52]. Additionally, the co-occurrence of
depression and PTSD may further dis-regulate learning mechanisms, perpetuating
maladaptive behavioral patterns [53]. The current work focused purely on identifying
cognitive mechanisms based on behavioural data, meaning the exploration of clinical
validity and utility were beyond scope. Future work will address this gap, investigating
the connection between computational parameters and clinical features within tested
populations. Similarly, developmental and age-related factors also play a crucial role in
shaping learning behavior. While younger individuals tend to exhibit greater
adaptability in learning new associations, older adults may experience difficulties in
unlearning previously learned behaviors due to cognitive decline [54].
Building on these complexities, stratifying participants by demographic,
psychological, and medical characteristics can bolster model interpretability and
enhance the precision of computational analyses. Future studies should address these
limitations by systematically testing task variations in controlled, diverse populations to
establish correlations between task-induced behaviors and well-constrained model
parameters. Such work could improve task design, refine model selection and optimize
parameter recovery.
Finally, this study focused exclusively on binary choice data, excluding reaction time,
a continuous variable that could offer deeper cognitive and behavioral insights.
Incorporating reaction time data in future model analyses may enhance understanding
of underlying decision-making processes.
Overall, our study underscores the utility of the eHBI procedure for uncovering the
cognitive mechanisms underlying behavioural variability in psychopathologies. Future

work integrating more nuanced task designs and multimodal data could further advance
the understanding of Pavlovian biases and their role in mental health disorders.
In conclusion, our study supports the centrality of stable Pavlovian biases and
forgetting mechanisms in decision-making in suicidal populations. Further integration of
exploratory computational methodologies, such as DisRNN, alongside structured
approaches and subgrouping analyses could deepen cognitive insights.
