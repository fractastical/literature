Abstract
In decision-making, choices impact the present and cascade into future decisions,
highlighting the importance of confidence when making a decision. Here, we
investigated the meta-network level neural correlates of this confidence by estimating
the instantaneous changes in precision in selecting actions and comparing them with
brain state trajectories. To confirm the relationship between behavioral and neural
signals, we leveraged inter-subject correlation to determine how similar the group-shared
components of time-series of precision-triggered meta-network occurrences are across
participants and how this similarity changes during decision-making. We found that
policy precision is a proper behavioral signal to explain the meta-network level neural
dynamics. It positively correlated with the default mode network (DMN)-dominant
state, the occurrence of which is mutually exclusive with the dorsal attentional network-
(DAN) and frontoparietal network (FPN)-dominant state, the activation of which is
speculated to be associated with a highly uncertain state and arises from increased
integration between the DAN, FPN, and DMN. Therefore, supporting the novel
perspective that the DMN may reflect internal beliefs, these findings indicate that their
integration promotes the DAN and FPN to exert attention to decrease uncertainty.
Introduction 1
In everyday life, we make various decisions, ranging from trivial to pivotal. In most 2
cases, a decision does not conclude with itself but extends to the subsequent state that3

engenders another decision. In these cases, both the decision made and the level of 4
certainty regarding that decision play critical roles in knowledge formation. The 5
confidence at the time of making a decision influences the agent’s reaction to the 6
outcome and their future decisions in the subsequent state. TheBayesian brain 7
theory posits that the brain’s primary role is “inference,” asserting that perception 8
occurs through Bayesian inference of belief about the environmental state (s in Fig. 1b)9
based onprior belief and sensory inputs (D and o in Fig. 1b). How much each 10
information influences the inferredposterior belief is determined by theprecision of 11
each information. 12
The active inference framework, unifying the theory of action and perception, 13
attempts to elucidate a series of decision-making by minimizing a unified objective 14
function, free energy. This framework treats action selection as an inference problem15
as well. Therefore, not only the belief about states but also the belief aboutpolicies 16
are inferred, and the precision of this belief was suggested [16]. With this framework17
(Fig. 1b), the agent infers both its current state (sn) and optimal policies (π) based on 18
the probability of both outcomes in each context (A) and transitions (B) depending on19
the policy. Given its prior preferences over outcomes (C), the expected free energy (G)20
of each policy is determined based on how closely the expected future outcomes align to21
preferred outcomes by following each policy, which is weighted by the precision over the22
policies (γ), indicating how confident the agent is that these policies will minimize G (for23
the details of the G calculation, please see SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods) [15].24
Precision over the policies has been suggested to be encoded by dopamine [1,18,39];25
however, the exact computational role of dopamine remains controversial [4,19,21,38].26
This controversy is attributed to two main reasons: first, dopaminergic neurons project27
to the whole brain, and the brain operates through highly complex and interconnected28
networks. Therefore, observing local and regional activation is insufficient, and 29
understanding its pathways and subsequent effects through connectivity is 30
crucial [2,41,42]. Second, anycomputational modelof a biological signal remains 31
hypothetical by nature [11,14]. We argue that if a newly proposed signal can explain32
network-level dynamics in the context of a series of decision-making, it could at least33
validate the role of the signal in the neural process. This should precede further detailed34
studies on the hypothetical behavioral signals. 35
To achieve this, we first obtained network-level dynamics by estimatingdynamic 36
functional connectivitybased on graph structures from functional magnetic 37
resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured during decision-making tasks. Second, we 38
selected a very simpletwo-armed bandit taskfor the behavioral experiment. The 39
reason for selecting this task was to ensure that signals, such as the precision of prior40
belief (hereafter referred to as ”prediction precision”) andprediction error, which are 41
not the focus of this study, could be updated following the same trajectory across 42
participants, allowing us to isolate the precision of policies (hereafter referred to as 43
”policy precision (γ)”). If there are three or more options available, the prediction 44
precision of the selected option increases due to the selection, whereas the precision of45
the unselected options remains unchanged. Consequently, the trajectories of prediction46
precision across trials vary according to the agent’s choices. However, when there are47
only two options, the outcome of one simultaneously reveals the outcome of the other,48
making the trajectory of prediction precision across trials identical regardless of the 49
choice outcome (dbISC in Fig. 1f). 50
Allowing only the policy precision signal variation is to apply the ISC method (for51
the details of this approach, please see SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods) [20]. 52
This method can avoid the requirement for a predetermined response model and 53
increase the signal-to-noise ratio from the behavior signal. Therefore, it is adequate for54
validating the influence of unsettled signals [28]. In an earlier study, ISC was utilized to55

Figure 1. General flow of the experiment for investigating the association of dynamic
changes of both brain state and policy precision.a, Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging and behavioral datasets acquired during performing the two-armed bandit
task, preprocessed time-series from 147 brain regions, including brainstem nuclei, were
extracted. Additionally, behavioral parameters in the active inference framework (b:
Graphical representations of state estimation and policy selection (adapted from Fig. 5 of
Smith et al., 2022)) were estimated (s = states, o = observations, A = likelihood mapping
between states and outcomes, D = initial state priors, B = transition between states,
C = prior preferences of outcomes, G = expected free energy, E = prior over policies).
c, Using the Graphical Laplacian Mixed Model (GLMM), meta-network level brain
states and their occurrence probability time-series were estimated. We hypothesized that
shared, ct(t), and idiosyncratic, id(t), components are included in the state-level time-
series and a region-level time-series.d, Both policy precision and state prediction error
in each trial were calculated, and both were convolved with the hemodynamic response
function. e, f,By calculating the inter-subject correlation (ISC) of time-series over the
sliding window, neuronal (e) and behavioral (f) dynamic inter-subject correlation (dISC)
were determined, respectively. The dISC of state prediction error (SPE) is 1, indicating
the shared component across subjects, whereas the dISC of policy precision signals
varies in trials (suggesting its correspondence to the subject’s idiosyncratic response
during performing decision-making task (f).g, As the ISC of policy precision suddenly
drops in a certain period (indicated by an arrow) and the correlation of idiosyncratic
response is too high to be ignored (r = 0.45 - 0.96: Fig. 4a), the ISC of neural signals
can be approximated by adding the amount of related idiosyncratic response scaled by
its correlation. It can extend into the time-series equation with the dISC time-series to
perform a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis. A GLM comparing the dISC of both
neural and behavioral signals, policy precision-associated brain states were investigated.

pinpoint the neural correlates of common components in neural responses to naturalistic56
stimuli, such as movie clips. This synchronization of high-level brain functions is based57
on the premise that these neural responses are linear combinations of shared elements.58
These elements include common experimental stimuli, individual-specific idiosyncratic 59
responses triggered by the stimuli, which align with behavioral signals, and inherent60
noise. This method assumed that the idiosyncratic response and noise are not 61
correlated across subjects. They were averaged out by calculating correlations so that62
the ISC value reflects the amount of neural activity related to the shared responses.63
However, when the inter-correlation of idiosyncratic responses across subjects is 64
considerable, the ISC value should consider that the amount of idiosyncratic response is65
related as much as the ISC (equation in Fig. 1g). 66
The only interesting signal (policy precision) is included in idiosyncratic responses67
by making the non-interesting behavioral signal the same across participants. The 68
behavioral signals are estimated from the behavioral data by fitting the active inference69
model. Subsequently, they are convolved with hemodynamic response function (HRF)70
for comparison with neural signals (Fig. 1d). The dynamics of ISC (dISC) can also be71
calculated using a brief sliding window with the time-series of both neural and 72
behavioral signals [23] so that the generalized linear model (GLM) comparing the ISC of73
the neural and behavioral signals can be applied. In other words, we took an alternative74
approach, assuming that the changes in the ISC of neural activity recruiting high-level75
brain function would align with changes in the ISC of the behavioral model signals, such76
as policy precision that is supposed to represent the brain function during a 77
decision-making task (Fig. 1g). 78
After determining that the policy precision was a significant signal modulating the79
dynamics of brain states, we investigated the correlations between policy precision 80
and occurrence probability of each state with a typical GLM. Next, to determine the81
underlying cause of those correlations of the policy precision signal, we calculated the82
edge connectivity at each time point throughphase coherence[6]. Using this, we 83
calculated the graph metrics of integration and recruitment [3] to determine the 84
correlation of connectivity patterns at levels lower than those of the meta-network. 85

The two-armed bandit task involved two parts: whether participants gained or avoided90
losing upon winning and whether they avoided gaining or losing the reward upon 91
making an incorrect choice (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, there were two choices, with one92
having a 70% likelihood of winning and the other having 30%. Each part consisted of 4093
trials, totaling 80 trials per participant. Participants had to infer the choice with a 94
better chance of winning over time to maximize the accumulated reward. Therefore, the95
probability of a better choice was the hidden state value inferred by the agents during96
the task, and prediction precision corresponded to the predictive state value. A value97
far from 0.5 reflected more precise predictive precision, and vice versa. The trajectories98
in Fig. 2b and 2c shows the average state value, with the shaded areas indicating the99
standard deviation across participants. Although there are some variances, the general100
trajectories closely follow the average line. 101
State prediction error (SPE) signals can be positive or negative based on trial 102
outcomes. With the better choice having a 70% likelihood of winning, the NPE signals103
are expected in 12 trials (40× 0.3) of each task part, whereas the PPE signals occur in104

Figure 2. Sequence of the experimental task and state value trajectory and the
behavioral signals simulated as neural firing and the time-series of each signal convolved
with the hemodynamic response function.a, The task begins with gazing at the centered
cross for a random duration ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 s; subsequently, the meaningful
experimental stimulus is presented. The “cue” indicates the presentation of two options
of figures, and it lasts for 1.5 s during which the participant must choose one. After 1.5
s, the results of the choice are presented as monetary reward or loss. We defined this
presentation result as “feedback”, which lasts for 1.0 s. The images of each choice are
shown as meaningless black-and-white pictures and different sets of images are shown
during each part of the task. Selection should be done in 1.5 s during which the cue
images are presented on the screen.b-c, The trajectory of the average inferred state
value indicates that the probability of one choice option is better than the other in each
trial. The initial values start from 0.5 as there is no information about which option is
better. The green dots indicate the observation of each trial after selection (choosing the
better option will give win = 1, lose = 0). The differences between the green dot and
the blue line of each trial indicate the state prediction error of that trial. d, Example of

the remaining 28 trials. This can be misconstrued as an NPE signal only arising from105
losses. However, in this task, the prediction error was the difference between the 106
observed probability (always 0 or 1) of one choice being better and the inferred 107
probability updated through the trials. It is not about winning or losing but rather108
about selecting the better option, which may lead to either outcome. When selecting109
the better option and losing, or vice versa, the outcome is 0. Conversely, when selecting110
the better option and winning, or vice versa, the outcome is 1 (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the111
prediction error signal’s sign is determined by task settings rather than the individual112
choice outcomes. Hence, the feedback of each trial can be categorized based on the113
outcomes (which vary across participants) and the sign of the prediction errors (which is114
consistent across participants). Naturally, trials generating NPE signals often coincide115
with wins, whereas those generating PPE signals are common. However, a large number116
of participants experienced losses in trials associated with NPE (SI Appendix, Figures117
S1 and Tables S1). Although winning or losing and the sign of the prediction error118
signals did not perfectly align, this discrepancy was more noticeable during the first 10119
trials (Fig. 5a) 120
In contrast, the policy precision signals varied across participants based on their trial121
outcome and performance. The detailed precision updating process is explained in the122
Methods section. Briefly, the agents calculated the expected free energy (EFE,G) of 123
each policy on the trialt, and the precision (γ) corresponded to the reliability of the 124
agent in a preferred state if they follow the calculatedG. The initial value ofγ was 125

calculated from the inverse of fixed prior value ofβ ( 1
β0
) [40]. Thus, the probability that 126
the agent will choose each policyπ0 will be 127
π0 ← σ(−γG), (1)
As precision weights the EFE to determine the probability of choosing each policy, after128
choosing, the results of trialt are given as either win or lose, and the variational free129
energy of each policy (F) over that observation is calculated. Subsequently, the 130
probability of choosing each policy after a subsequent observation is 131
π ← σ(−F − γG), (2)
and the error of the agent’s EFE (Gerror) is 132
Gerror ← (π − π0) · (−G). (3)
The above equation reflects the level of (dis)agreement between EFE (Gand π0) and 133
the variational free energy of the observation (F and π) [40]. Thus, theβ whose inverse 134

Therefore, policy precision reflects the reliability of the EFE based on new 136

Four representative brain states and their dynamics 139
The graph Laplacian mixture model (GLMM) identifies meta-networks representing 140
intra- and inter-network interactions. The GLMM learns the graph structure of the141
states by estimating the Laplacian matrices and captures the dynamics of brain states142
that are consistent with the timing of various task paradigms in the HCP 143
dataset [24,34]. Four key states were estimated and they are depicted in Fig. 3. Using144
the mean activation patterns, we grouped the regions as a priori resting-state networks145
(RSNs) [43] for each state (Fig. 3a-d). State 1 was positively correlated with activation146
of the visual (VIS) and somatomotor (SOM) networks, dorsal attention network (DAN),147
and ventral attention network (VAN) and negatively correlated with the default mode148
network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN). State 2 was positively correlated149
with the DMN and negatively correlated with state 1’s network. State 3 was positively150
correlated with the DAN and FPN, whereas it was negatively correlated with the DMN151
and SOM network. State 4 shows generally low activations of all networks except for152
the limbic (LIM) network and an anterior-to-posterior gradient. 153
To examine subcortical activation patterns, we conducted an analysis of variance154
(ANOVA) comparing the average activation of each subcortical region across states (SI155
Appendix, Tables S2). States 2 and 3 showed opposite patterns: state 2 showed higher156
hippocampus and hypothalamus activation than did state 3 (Fig. 3i-l). State 3 showed157
higher activations in the anterior thalamus and caudate nucleus than did other states.158
Regarding dopamine regions, only the regions in the left hemisphere, including the SNc,159
VTA, and habenula, showed significant differences across states, with higher activation160
in states 2 and 3 than in states 1 and 4. Conversely, the right part of the internal161

segment of the globus pallidus showed significant differences, with higher activation in162
states 1 and 4 than in states 2 and 3. Fig. 4c displays the average time courses of each163
state, which we refer to as the original time-series to differentiate it from the dISC.164
State 1 accounted for the highest proportion (SI Appendix, Figures S2a), whereas the165
other states appeared fairly evenly throughout the task. The occurrence probability of166
state 3 increased during the early stages and in the middle of the task. Furthermore,167
according to the dISC time-series, the ISC of state 3 changed similarly to that of state 2,168
indicating that the increase in state 3 is accompanied by a decrease in state 2. 169
Brain state dynamics explained by the policy precision signal 170
By comparing the dISC time-series of policy precision and occurrence probability of each171
brain state, we determined whether the inter-subject variability in the policy precision172
signal can explain the variability in the dynamics of the brain state. Higher dISC values173
indicate that the occurrence probabilities of the brain state are similar to that of others174
during that window, and both similarly low and high activation patterns are possible.175
Therefore, if the dISC of the policy precision signal has a significant positive correlation176
to the dISC of state occurrences, then we can consider the policy precision as an 177
essential signal that modulates the changes in the neural states. The direction of this178
modulation can be confirmed by the result of the original time-series. Therefore, we179
conducted a GLM analysis using dISC and original time-series with Equations [5] and180
[6] respectively. Analysis of the original time-series was conducted with the 181
HRF-convolved signals [17] of the following task stimulus variables as regressors: cue182
visual stimulus (CVS), feedback visual stimulus of win (FVSw), feedback visual 183
stimulus of lose (FVSl), action selection (AS). Given the nature of the occurrence of184

(6)
Subsequently, a secondary analysis was employed, through a non-parametric 187
one-sample test comparing beta coefficients with those of a null distribution generated188
from 1,000 randomly shifted time-series. All states dynamics were related to the policy189
precision signal changes (Fig. 4d) and its effects were positive on states 1 and 2 (p-value190
= 0.002,< 0.0001, respectively) and negative on state 3 (p-value< 0.0001) (Fig. 4e), 191
suggesting the involvement of state 3 when policy precision is low (SI Appendix, Tables192
S3). 193
State 3 is inversely associated with policy precision with 194
uncertain feedback 195
The occurrence probability of state 3 was high when policy precision was low. More196
specifically, we investigated the dynamics of state 3 at the feedback presentation, the197
outcome of which, win or lose, will determine the ensuing policy precision signal. This198
inverse relation between state 3 and policy precision is attributable to the increase of199
state 3 with uncertain feedback, irrespective of simply the outcome or sign of the 200
prediction error. 201
Although we used the FVS separated by the win or lose outcome in Equation [6] and202
found a positive correlation between state 3 and both types of FVS (SI Appendix, 203
Tables S3), FVS can also be categorized by the sign of the SPE signal, as the prediction204
error signal is assumed to align with the timing of the feedback presentations. 205
Therefore, to determine whether the effect of the feedback on state occurrences depends206
on the outcome or prediction error, we categorized trials into four feedback types based207
on the prediction error’s sign [P or N in Equation [7]] and outcome [W or L in Equation208
[7]] and conducted a GLM analysis. Next, a two-way ANOVA, including two factors of209
outcome and sign of the prediction error using beta coefficients of each type of feedback,210
was conducted. 211

(7)
The interaction between the prediction error and outcome significantly affected the212
occurrences of all states (SI Appendix, Tables S5). In post-hoc analysis, the occurrence213
of state 3 was greater in PL and NW than in PW and NL (SI Appendix, Tables S5).214
Based on these results, we speculated that state 3 is more likely to occur in cases where215
the signs of the outcome and prediction error are opposite (PL and NW) rather than 216
simply being due to the sign of an outcome or prediction error. Therefore, we 217
categorized the feedback type as “congruent” when a winning outcome was achieved in218
the PPE trial or a losing outcome in the NPE trial and as “incongruent” when a losing219
outcome was achieved in the PPE trial or a winning outcome in the NPE trial. As220
mentioned, incongruent outcomes are less frequent than congruent (SI Appendix, Tables221
S1). Then, what makes the incongruency correlated with the occurrence of state 3? As222
shown in Figure 5a, most of the incongruent outcomes occur during the early phase of223
the tasks when the agent is not confident regarding which choice is better. In the 224
middle of the task, such as trials 16 and 24 of the loss task and trials 23, 37, and 39 of225
the reward task, approximately 24% of the participants were wrong as they changed the226
choice based on the results from the few trials before, including consecutive NPE results227
(SI Appendix, Figures S1). Even for participants who won in those trials, consecutive228

results that were against their belief regarding the better choice must have caused 229
uncertainty; however, the degree was lesser than for those who changed their choice.230
Therefore, we defined “uncertain” feedback for the previous trial of trials that caused231
more than 20% of participants to change their choice (incongruent outcome) and 232
“certain” feedback for the remaining trials. After the first 10 trials, trials 15 and 23 were233
included in the uncertain feedback for the loss task and trials 22, 36, and 38 for the234
reward task. We conducted a GLM analysis with Equation [8] and the same 235
non-parametric one-sample test, and the result showed that both certain and uncertain236
feedback were positively correlated with state 3 (p-value = 0.003,< 0.0001, 237
respectively) (SI Appendix, Tables S6). 238

We conducted a paired t-test comparing beta coefficient values of certain and uncertain239
feedback, and the beta coefficient of uncertain feedback was significantly greater than240
that of certain feedback (p-value = 0.0002). 241
We then calculated the average policy precision value across trials after both types of242
feedback, and found that it was significantly higher after certain feedback than after243
uncertain feedback (Fig. 5b). We also estimated the variance of state prediction using244
the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter model [25], where the first level variance represents the245
inverse of prediction precision. Subsequently, we calculated the average variance across246
trials of each feedback type and found that it was significantly lower in certain feedback247
than in uncertain feedback (Fig. 5c). 248

As a result of the state-level analysis, we found that state 3 was related to uncertainty251

correlated with state 2. To determine how state 3 is activated by uncertainty, we 255

examined the connectivity changes between regions modulated by uncertain feedback256
that caused the incongruent results. First, we examined the connectivity characteristics257
by calculating integration and recruitment among seven RSNs using adjacency matrices258
estimated by GLMM (Fig. 6a). Integration corresponds to the interconnectivity 259
between different network systems, whereas recruitment reflects the intraconnectivity of260
each network [3]. In state 3, integrations, including either the FPN or LIM network,261
were the highest (upward arrows in Fig. 6a), whereas the recruitments of all networks262
were the lowest (downward arrows in Fig. 6a). As the adjacency matrices estimated263
from GLMM were not continuous values with time, the connectivity values were 264
calculated using the leading eigenvector of the BOLD phase coherence matrices [6] for265
by performing GLM analysis. The integration and recruitment of each RSNs were 266
calculated using connectivity matrices to reduce the dimensions. We performed a GLM267
analysis with Equation [9] to investigate the effect of both types of feedback. 268

Discussion 269
The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: First, policy precision is an270
important signal to explain the meta-network level changes in the brain. Second, the271
uncertainty of prediction (prediction precision) increases the integration between the272
DMN and the other networks, including the DAN and FPN, which may relate to 273
occurrences of state 3, where the DAN and FPN are dominant. Lastly, when 274
participants change their action selections by observations that are against their belief275
states, integration between the DMN and VAN increases. Subsequently, integrations276
between the VAN and LIM network as well as the DAN and SOM network increase and277
the recruitment of the FPN decreases until the changed action is taken. 278
The dISC time-series of the occurrence probability of state 3 was higher when the 279
occurrence probability of state 3 increased. The original time-series analysis showed 280
that, when there was insufficient evidence (at the beginning of each task) or feedback281
that did not meet expectations (causing incongruent outcome in the subsequent trial by282
changing one’s choice), that is, uncertain feedback, state 3 was primarily active. In state283
3, the DAN and FPN are predominantly activated, and these networks are involved in284
executive function and goal-oriented, cognitively demanding tasks [26, 46]. Based on our285
results, we speculate that the core functions of the DAN and FPN are related to 286
exerting attentional efforts in an uncertain state where precision cannot be sufficiently287
high. To determine how state 3 is activated according to uncertainty, we investigated288
the connectivity between brain regions that is supposed to lead to the activation of289
meta-network states. Most of the integration, including the DMN, was higher with 290
uncertain than with certain feedback. 291
In addition, state 2, where the DMN was dominantly activated, and integrations, 292
including the FPN, especially with the DMN, were the lowest, was significantly 293
positively correlated with the policy precision signal. Although the DMN is generally294
regarded as a resting network activated during rest, mind-wandering, and self-referential295
tasks [9,10,32], enhanced suggestions explaining the function of the DMN focusing on296
intrinsic information rather than just resting or doing nothing, have been 297
raised [5,30,33]. It has been suggested that the DMN detects the associative relevance298
of internal and external stimuli and enables value coding [35]. From this viewpoint, an299
alternative proposal argues that understanding the self-referential function of the DMN300
entails linking it to the choice of the best actions within the environmental context,301
necessitating recursive exploration. [22]. Following this suggestion, there is a concept302

outlining how the DMN functions at elevated levels of inferential hierarchy, which 303
diminishes the free energy associated with lower levels [7]. In addition to the DMN, the304
hippocampus was activated in state 2 (Fig. 3j). Recent studies examining the function305
of the hippocampus focusing on the internal model [27,45] support the notion that the306
role of DMN is linked to the internal model. Presentation of cue also showed positive307
correlations with this state, although the significance was lower than that for policy308
precision. This result suggests that when a cue is provided, activating state 2 309
corresponds to making a suitable choice based on one’s accumulated internal beliefs. In310
other words, the correlation between policy precision and state 2 is related to how much311
the participant’s actions in making choices are based on their internal beliefs. As 312
uncertainty rose from the outcome of the previous trial, leading to the activation of state313
3, this hindered the activation of state 2. Additionally, it resulted in reduced policy314
precision, which could create a stronger positive correlation between policy precision315
and the probability of state 2, while also establishing a negative correlation with state 3.316
Previous studies have focused on the anti-correlated relationship between the FPN and317
DMN; their interplay has recently received attention [8]. Our findings support both318
aspects: the former by the anti-correlations of states 2 and 3, alternating according to319
the uncertainty, and the latter by the determining that the increasing integration 320
between the DMN, FPN, and DAN in response to uncertain feedback and the 321
integration of DMN with other networks in state 3 was highest, despite the low 322
activation level. Based on this interaction, our results support the hypothesis that 323
information transmission from the DMN, where internal information is processed, is 324
required for the proper functioning of the DAN and FPN. 325
The roles of the VAN and DAN in attention processes have been well investigated.326
Goal-directed, sustained attention is associated with the DAN, whereas transient 327
attention to salient or surprising stimuli is linked to the VAN [36]. Additionally, 328
inhibitory connections from the DAN to the VAN have been studied in relation to329
suppressing responses to meaningless or low-information stimuli, which is crucial for330
maintaining sustained attention [49]. The DAN is thus associated with more internally331
directed cognitive processes, whereas the VAN is linked to externally directed cognitive332
functions [50]. The higher integration between the VAN and both the DMN and LIM333
network in the case of changing choice by the external stimuli contradicting one’s beliefs334
is consistent with these previous findings. This suggests that heightened immediate 335
attention to external stimuli results in choices that oppose internal goals. Although this336
might cause the wrong choice, as seen herein, these integrations may facilitate flexible337
decision-making in unstable situations, thereby reducing the rigidity of learning 338
processes and required integration that normally increases in uncertain feedback. 339
Although the simplicity of the experimental task is a limitation of the current study, it340
was an essential element for using the ISC method to identify policy precision as a341
suitable behavioral signal, which is the core objective of this study. However, this study342
confirmed that the policy precision signal is a validated signal, and based on this, future343
studies investigating policy precision can be developed to include more complex 344
behavioral tasks, such as those with three or more choices or added volatility. In 345
addition, we used GLMM to obtain representative brain states; various methods are346
available to estimate brain state, such as the hidden Markov model [47]. In the current347
study, we selected the GLMM because it is suitable for extracting graph structures from348
the task-fMRI data. However, different methods can be applied to estimate brain state349
dynamics depending on the research objectives in further studies. 350

Participants 352
Fifty-four volunteers participated in this study (15 female and 39 male; mean [standard353
deviation] age was 22.4 [3.2] years; all individuals were right-handed and had no history354
of psychiatric or neurological disorders). All participants provided written informed 355
consent for participating in all the procedures and data usage before the start of the356
study. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board357
at KAIST and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed 358
consent was obtained from all study participants. 359
fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis 360
All participants underwent MRI using a 3.0-T MRI scanner (Siemens Verio Syngo).361
Both T1-weighted (T1w; echo time [TE] = 2.02 ms, repetition time [TR] = 2400 ms,362
field of view (FOV) = 224× 224 mm, and 0.7 mm iso-voxel) and T2-weighted (T2w;363
TE = 330 ms, TR = 2200 ms, FOV = 224× 224 mm, and 0.7 mm iso-voxel) structural364
images were acquired. A total of 240 echo-planar imaging scans of BOLD responses365
(multiband factor = 4, TE = 32 ms, TR = 1.5 s, flip angle = 50°, FOV = 225× 221 366
mm, matrix size = 110× 107, 2.0 mm iso-voxel with no gap, 64 slices, phase encoding367
= anterior to posterior) were performed using a 32-channel head coil. Field map images368
(TR = 731 ms, TE: 4.92 ms and 7.38 ms, flip angle = 90°) were also acquired to correct369
distorted images. In every trial, the participants performed the experimental task with370
both hands and pressed an MRI-compatible button to indicate their decision. In the371
pretraining session, prior to the first scan, the participants were acquainted with the372
apparatus and tasks were performed during scanning. The sequences executed during373
this pretraining session were not encountered later in the experiment. For details about374
the fMRI data preprocessing, please see SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods. 375
After preprocessing, we acquired the averaged region of interest (ROI) time-series376
extracted from the regions from the Schaefer Atlas [37], including 100 regions covering377
the cortex, and the Melbourne Subcortex Atlas [44] covering the subcortex. In addition,378
to include other subcortical regions related to important neurotransmitters, including379
dopamine and norepinephrine, we added some regions from the CIT168 atlas [29] and380
Harvard Ascending Arousal Network Atlas [13] to obtain signals from a total of 147381
ROIs (SI Appendix, Tables S9). 382
To investigate the dynamic changes in different levels of neural interactions, we 383
obtained neural signals at the network and edge levels. At the edge level, we used phase384
coherence to calculate the connectivity between two regions. This method is adept at385
capturing temporally delayed relationships and exhibits high sensitivity in detecting 386
ultraslow oscillatory processes that underlie the formation of RSNs, a phenomenon 387
corroborated by recent experimental and computational research [12,31]. In our study,388
we used a recently developed data-driven approach named Leading Eigenvector 389
Dynamics Analysis that can reduce the dimensionality by considering only the relative390
phase of BOLD signals and capturing instantaneous phase-locking (PL) patterns [6,48].391
However, in this study, we did not employ k-means clustering to identify representative392
states based on the leading eigenvector. Instead, we used the outer product of the 393
leading eigenvectors of the PL patterns to reconstruct the connectivity patterns at each394
time point. K-means clustering was not used as it does not consider the graph-based395
connectivity of brain structures that generate signals when distinguishing clusters. 396
Therefore, to extract the representation of the overall brain state corresponding to397
network-level interactions, we employed the GLMM, an approach that involves directly398
estimating the graph structure that generates the signals, which serves as an alternative399

to k-means clustering for capturing the representation of the entire brain state [34].400
This method extracts the representative network states described in three aspects, two401
of which represent the whole population and one of which could be interpreted as 402
subject-specific. The former is the mean activation pattern of each node and the graph403
Laplacians of the connectivity patterns (Fig. 3e-h, SI Appendix, Figures S3), whereas404
the latter is the probability of each state being assigned to each time point. Using the405
probabilities of each state, we calculated dynamic functional connectivity metrics, 406
including the fractional occupancy, dwell time, and transition probability of each 407
participant (SI Appendix, Figures S2). 408
