What kind of neuroscience does psychoanalysis require? At his time, Freud in his “Project 
for a Scientific Psychology” searched for a model of the brain that could relate to incorporate 
the psyche’s topography and dynamic. Current neuropsychoanalysis builds on specific 
functions as investigated in Affective and Cognitive (and Social) Neuroscience including 
embodied approaches. The brain’s various functions are often converged with prediction 
as operationalized in predictive coding (PC) and free energy principle (FEP) which, recently, 
have been conceived as core for a “New Project for Scientific Psychology.” We propose 
to search for a yet more comprehensive and holistic neuroscience that focuses primarily 
on its topography and dynamic analogous to Freud’s model of the psyche. This leads us 
to what we describe as “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” that focuses on the spatial 
topography and temporal dynamic of the brain’s neural activity including how they shape 
affective, cognitive, and social functions including PC and FEP (first part). That is illustrated 
by the temporally and spatially nested neural hierarchy of the self in the brain’s neural 
activity (second and third part). This sets the ground for developing our proposed “Project 
for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience,” which complements and extends both Freud’s and 
Solms’ projects (fourth part) and also carries major practical implications as it lays the 
ground for a novel form of neuroscientifically informed psychotherapy, namely, 
“Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy.” In conclusion, “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” provides 
an intimate link of brain and psyche by showing topography and dynamic as their shared 
features, that is, “common currency.”

“Every attempt to discover a localization of mental processes … has miscarried completely. 
The same fate would await any theory that attempted to recognize the anatomical position 
of the system (consciousness) – as being in the cortex, and to localize the unconscious processes 
in the subcortical parts of the brain. There is a hiatus which at present cannot be filled, nor 
is it one of the tasks of psychology to fill it. Our psychical topography has for the present 
nothing to do with anatomy. ” ~ Freud, 1915.

INTRODUCTION
How can we link psychoanalysis to neuroscience? Freud himself 
tried to connect psychoanalysis and neuroscience in his early 
writing “Project of a Scientific Psychology” (1895). However, 
in the following, he  gave up on such project focusing mainly 
on the development of psychoanalysis. These efforts flare up 
again our time including various clusters of recent neuroscientific 
research ( Boeker, 2018 ). One cluster is the “ embodied brain 
hypothesis” that conceives cognitive and affective functions of 
the brain to be  closely linked to the body and its interoceptive 
functions. This has led to concepts like “embodied remembering,” 
“embodied unconscious, ” “ embodied memories, ” “ embodied 
feelings,” and “embodied testimony” (Edelman, 1987, 1989, 1992; 
Northoff, 2011, 2012a; Leuzinger-Bohleber, 2018; Mucci, 2019).
Y et another cluster of neuroscientific research is the dynamic 
neuropsychology by AR. Luria that, through Solms’ clinical-
anatomical localization approach to psychodynamic features, 
provides one link of brain and psyche. Moreover, in addition 
to Cognitive Neuroscience, the development of Affective 
Neuroscience by especially Jaak Panksepp (1998)  represents 
another cluster where primary and secondary emotions are 
linked to primary and secondary processes ( Panksepp and 
Biven, 2012 ; Solms, 2015 ). Finally, yet another more recent 
cluster is developed by Mark Solms when he  aims to link the 
free energy and predictive coding approach by Karl Friston 
to psychoanalysis: He  considers the biologically and physically 
defined concepts of free energy and predictive coding to reflect 
what Freud referred to as mental or psychical energy ( Solms 
and Friston, 2018; Solms, 2020, 2021). That, according to Solms, 
provides the key connection of brain and psyche as core feature 
of a “New Project for a Scientific Psychology” (Solms, 2020, 2021).
Despite all progress, neuroscientific approaches adhere to 
a scientific psychology that, as traditionally conceived, is based 
on specific functions and the third-person perspective. Just as 
the psyche in psychology, the brain is conceived in terms of 
specific functions showing extrinsic contents, affective, cognitive, 
or social: these are localized in particular regions of the brain, 
remain the same over time and are investigated by probing 
the brain’s task-related activity. As in the case of the psyche 
in psychology, this amounts largely to a non-energetic, mostly 
static, content-based, and third-person-based view of the brain.
Psychoanalysis, in both its original inception and current 
manifestations, contends such view of the psyche as presupposed 
in psychology. Instead, the psyche is conceived as highly 
energetic (like cathexis) rather than non-energetic, it is 
continuously changing, and thus, dynamic rather than static 
exhibits a structure or organization that shapes its contents 
and aims for a first- or second- rather than third-person-based 
view of the psyche (e.g., Northoff et  al., 2007; Schilbach, 2010 ; 
Przyrembel et  al., 2012 ; Longo and Tsakiris, 2013 ). This leaves 
a gap, a “gap of contingency” ( see below ), when compared to 
the current view of the brain in neuroscience. The energetic, 
dynamic, structural/organizational, and first/s-person features 
of the psyche in psychoanalysis are related to a brain that is 
non-energetic, static, content-based, and third-person-based. 
Such mismatch between the models of psyche (in psychoanalysis) 
and brain (in affective, cognitive, and social neuroscience) 
renders impossible to take into view their intimate connection, 
that is, how neural activity transforms into psychic activity. 
Our view of brain-psyche is consequently blocked by a gap 
with their connection remaining contingent (rather than necessary 
a posteriori ; Northoff, 2018 ) – we  will therefore speak later 
of a “gap of contingency. ” (see the dotted lines and black lines 
in Figure  1 and the black arrow in Figure  2 as below).
How can we  close the “gap of contingency” between brain 
and psyche? One way is to take into view the brain in terms 
that are analogous to the model of the psyche in psychoanalysis. 
Specifically, one may want to conceive the brain in terms of 
its energy, dynamic, structure/topography, and first/s-person 
perspective. Brain and psyche can then be conceived in analogous 
terms with the ultimate hope that these features are shared 
by brain and psyche as their “common currency” ( Northoff  
et  al., 2020a ). Importantly, that should close the current “gap 
of contingency” between brain and psyche allowing for their 
tighter connection (i.e., necessary a posteriori ; Northoff, 2018) 
as searched for by both Freud and Solms in their respective 
projects for a scientific psychology.
The goal of our paper is to develop the kind of neuroscience 
that is necessary to intimately connect brain and psyche in 
order to complete Freud’s “Project for a Scientific Psychology” 
(1895). Rather than relying on the characterization of the brain 
as in current Cognitive and Affective and Social Neuroscience, 
we  propose taking an alternative view, one that focuses on 
the brain’s energy, dynamic, structure, and conceives it in first/
second-person perspective. Specifically, we  aim to develop a 
more comprehensive and holistic model of the brain in terms 
of its intrinsic temporal dynamic and spatial topography – this 
requires “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” (Northoff et al., 2020a,b; 
first part ). That approach will be  illustrated empirically by the 
example of the self featured by its topography ( second part ) 
and dynamic ( third part ) in brain and psyche.
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience carries major theoretical 
implications for the “Project for a Scientific Psychology” by both 
Freud (1895) and Solms (2020). Additionally, it carries major 
practical implications as it lays the ground for a novel form of 
neuroscientifically informed psychotherapy, namely “Spatiotemporal 
Psychotherapy” (fourth part). We  conclude that “Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” provides a strong candidate for complementing 
Freud’s unfinished “Project for a Scientific Psychology” (1895) 
including its most recent version of a “(New) Project for a Scientific 
Psychology” by Mark Solms (2020, 2021). We  therefore speak of 
a “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience. ”
PART I: PSYCHOANALYSIS AND 
NEUROSCIENCE – VIEWS OF PSYCHE 
AND BRAIN
Psyche in Psychoanalysis – Dynamic, 
Topographic, and Spatiotemporal
One of Freud’s key observations was that the psyche is dynamic, 
that is, it changes over time with the changes following a 
Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
certain pattern that establish a particular structure or 
organization. The emphasis on the dynamics of the psyche 
is well reflected in his notion of mental or psychic energy, 
that is, cathexis, that fuels drives, libido, instinct, and the 
dynamic unconscious where cathexis remains unconstrained. 
This mental energy is key in structuring and organizing the 
psyche in a dynamic way. That is reflected in his first 
topographical model of the unconscious-conscious as well as 
in his second topographical model of the three-fold relation 
of Id, Ego, and Super-ego.
Freud aimed to decipher a deeper and more fundamental 
layer of the psyche beneath its functions and contents when 
focusing on its dynamic and topography. How, though, can 
we describe dynamic and topography of the psyche independent 
and prior of their functions and contents? Freud himself 
emphasizes the spatial and temporal features of the psyche 
– we  may require a spatiotemporal approach complementing 
the affective and/or cognitive approach to the psyche. This is 
well reflected in the following quote by Freud himself.
“ Accordingly, we  will picture the mental apparatus as a 
compound instrument, to the components of which we  will give 
the name of ‘agencies’, or (for the sake of greater clarity) ‘systems’. 
It is to be  anticipated, in the next place, that these systems 
may perhaps stand in a regular spatial relation to one another, 
in the same kind of way in which the various systems of lenses 
in a telescope are arranged behind one another. Strictly speaking, 
there is no need for the hypothesis that the psychical systems 
are actually arranged in a spatial order. It would be  sufficient 
if a fixed order were established by the fact that in a given 
psychical process the excitation passes through the systems in a 
particular temporal sequence. In other processes the sequence 
may perhaps be a different one; that is a possibility that we shall 
leave open. For the sake of brevity we  will in future speak of 
the components of the apparatus as ‘ ψ-systems’” ( Freud 1900 , 
p.  535; bolds by us ).
Psyche in Psychology – Static, Modular, 
and Non-spatiotemporal
The conception of the psyche in psychoanalysis by dynamic, 
topography, and spatiotemporal features stands in contrast to 
the view of the static view of the psyche. The psyche is often 
FIGURE 1 |  Different models of the psyche in psychoanalysis (upper) and the brain in current neuroscience (lower) with red dotted lines indicating insufficient 
contingent connection, that is, “gap of contingency.”
Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
conceived as collection of functions in terms of modules that 
are merely added together, standing side-by-side in parallel. 
For instance, different memory systems (like working memory, 
semantic, and episodic memory) and distinct emotions or form 
of attention are distinguished from each other operating more 
or less independently or in a modular way. Accordingly, there 
is no assumption of an overall psychic structure, that is, 
topography encompassing all functions in an organized whole.
Moreover, the various psychological functions are considered 
to be  stable and non-changing thus being static – the dynamic 
beneath the functions is thus often neglected. Together, this 
amounts to a view of the psyche in psychology in terms of 
functions and their contents while their underlying spatial and 
temporal features are neglected. This stands in contrast to the 
view of the psyche in psychoanalysis where spatial and temporal 
features are assumed to shape and constitute the psyche (see above).
Finally, there is also a methodological difference between 
psychoanalysis and psychology regarding first/second vs. 
third-person perspective. Psychoanalysis requires first/second 
person reports with subjective experience for understanding 
the dynamic manifestations of psychic energy as well as 
the structure of conscious-unconscious and Id–Ego–Super-Ego, 
that is, their topography. That stands in contrast to psychology. 
Here, the focus is on objective observation in third-person 
perspective as to eclipse and exclude any traces of subjective 
first/second perspective. Even stronger, first/second person 
experience is often criticized as non-scientific in conventional 
psychology that focuses strictly on third-person perspective 
to acquire data. Hence, the dynamic vs. static approach to 
the psyche stand in opposition and are exclusive on 
methodological grounds. This makes urgent a more 
cohomprensive and holistic approach.
View of the Brain in Cognitive, Affective, 
and Social Neuroscience – Static, Regional 
Modular, and Non-spatiotemporal
Neuroscience and its different branches like cognitive, affective, 
social, and cultural (just to name a few) are developed largely 
as extension of the respective branches in psychology. This 
means that the static, modular, non-spatial and non-temporal, 
and third-person-based view of the psyche is more or less 
transferred to the brain itself.
Particular cognitive or affective functions are associated with 
specific brain regions whose neural activity, as related to these 
functions, is conceived non-changing, that is, static, and modular, 
that is, localized in specific brain regions (like the localization of 
primary and secondary emotions in distinct subcortical and cortical 
regions; Panksepp, 1998). The brain itself and its neural activity 
are consequently conceived as static, modular, non-spatiotemporal, 
and third-person-based. This view of the brain, although necessary 
for the discover of brain-related functions and contents, predominates 
in current Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (and related 
branches like Social and Cultural Neuroscience) and lacks of a 
more holistic and comprehensive approach.
The primacy of functions and contents goes along with a 
focus on task-related activity that measures the impact of the 
former on the brain’s neural activity. Analogously to the functions 
themselves, task-related activity is then also considered in a 
static and regional modular way independent of potentially 
underlying spatial and temporal features. Taken together, 
Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (and their various siblings) 
considers the brain and its task-related activity in more or 
less the same terms as the psyche is viewed in psychology.
Given such analogy in their characterization, the brain and 
their task-related activity are supposed to account for the psyche 
FIGURE 2 |  Views of psyche and brain in psychology, psychoanalysis, and different forms of neuroscience. Arrows indicate the combination of the models of the 
psyche in Psychology and Psychoanalysis with the model of brain as in Cognitive/Affective Neuroscience (green arrow, black arrow) as well as of psychoanalysis

brain (in Coginitive/Affective Neurosscience).

thus bridging the gap between neuroscience and psychology 
(see green arrow in Figure  2). In contrast, such view of the 
brain does not bridge the gap to the view of the psyche in 
psychoanalysis as that is dynamic, topographic, and 
spatiotemporal rather than static, modular, and 
non-spatiotemporal (see black arrow with red bars in Figure 2).
“Common Currency” – Temporal Dynamic 
and Spatial Topography Are Shared by 
Brain and Psyche
How can Cognitive, Social, and Affective Neuroscience account 
for the psychodynamic view of the psyche? The various clusters 
of their connection pointed out in the introduction cannot 
but suffer from a fundamental discrepancy between brain and 
psyche. They all aim to connect a static, regional modular, 
and non-spatiotemporal brain, featured by its extrinsic task-
related activity, with a dynamic, topographic, and spatiotemporal 
psyche characterized by its intrinsic spontaneity. The only way 
to remedy this discrepancy is to view the brain in a way that 
is analogous to the psyche in psychoanalysis. The brain and 
its neural activity may thus need to be  conceived as dynamic, 
topographic, and spatiotemporal – this is the aim of what 
recently has been introduced as “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” 
(Northoff et  al., 2020a ,b).
One key feature of the brain is its spontaneous activity 
that refers to the absence of specific tasks or stimuli as it can 
be  measured during the resting state ( Logothetis et  al., 2009 ; 
Raichle, 2009 , 2010; Northoff, 2012b , 2014a,b, 2018). The 
spontaneous activity can be  characterized topographically by 
various interacting networks like default-mode network, salience 
network, and central executive network, whose relationships 
seem to be  modulated by the brain’s global activity, that is, 
global signal topography ( Tanabe et  al., 2020 ; Zhang et  al., 
2020; Scalabrini et  al., 2020a ). While on the temporal side, 
the brain’s spontaneous activity is characterized by fluctuations 
or oscillations in various frequency ranges ( see below for details) 
that, together, provide a certain temporal dynamic structure 
(Buzsaki, 2006 ; He, 2014 ; Scalabrini et  al., 2017 ; Northoff, 
2018; Scalabrini et  al., 2019 ).
The spontaneous activity itself has recently been associated 
with various internally oriented cognitive functions like mind-
wandering ( Smallwood and Schooler, 2015 ; Christoff et  al., 
2016; Northoff, 2018), mental time travel or episodic simulation 
(Schacter et al., 2012; Northoff, 2017), autobiographical memory, 
and self-referential processing ( Northoff et  al., 2006 ; Northoff, 
2016). Hence, the spatial topography of the spontaneous activity 
may itself be related to different forms of cognition ( Smallwood 
et  al., 2021 ; Y eshurun et  al., 2021). This leaves open how the 
spontaneous activity mediates such cognitive (and also affective 
and social) functions during both resting state and task-related 
activity, though. Addressing this question is key in providing 
an intimate connection of brain and cognition/emotion, that 
is, of neural and psychological activity and hence of brain 
and psyche.
We postulate that, in order to provide such intimate 
connection, brain and psyche must share some features, a 
“common currency” ( Northoff et  al., 2020a ,b). Freud’s 
topography and dynamic of the psyche entails a spatial and 
temporal view of the psyche: the temporal and spatial 
organization and structure of the psyche shapes its contents 
and functions. Relying on Freud and our spatiotemporal 
characterization of the brain’s spontaneous activity, we  now 
propose that spatial topography and temporal dynamic are 
shared by both neural and psychical activity. What Freud 
described as mental topography and dynamic of the psyche 
characterizes also, in more or less analogous ways, the brain’s 
neural activity including both spontaneous and task-related 
activity. Spatial topography and temporal dynamic are thus 
shared as “common currency” of brain and psyche ( Northoff  
et  al., 2020a ,b).
View of the Brain in Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience – Dynamic, Topographic, 
and Spatiotemporal
We are now ready to determine what we  recently introduced 
as “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” ( Northoff et  al., 2020a ,b). 
As explicated above, Cognitive, Affective, Social and Cultural 
Neuroscience largely view the brain as static, regional modular, 
and non-spatiotemporal. This contrasts with Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience that conceives the brain’s neural activity (including 
both spontaneous and task-related activity) largely in dynamic, 
topographic, and spatiotemporal terms.
Rather than on the neural activity of affective, cognitive, 
etc. functions and contents themselves, the focus in 
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience is on the spatial topography and 
temporal dynamic of their neural activity during both internally 
and externally oriented cognition. Spatiotemporal Neuroscience 
thus conceives both the brain’s neural activity and the psyche’s 
mental activity primarily in spatial topographic and temporal 
dynamic terms: It focuses on the brain’s spatial and temporal 
features that constitute its dynamic and topography, and how 
they, in turn, shape cognitive, affective, and social brain 
function including their respective contents. This makes it 
clear that Spatiotemporal Neuroscience neither stands 
contradictory to nor is exclusive with Affective, Cognitive, 
and Social Neuroscience. Instead, the former integrates and 
embeds the letter in a broader more comprehensive spatial 
and temporal context, that is, topography and dynamic (see 
Figure  3).
The same also applies to predictive coding and free energy. 
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience provides the spatial topographic 
and temporal dynamic context within which predictive coding 
and free energy operate; they provide what has been called 
“deep temporal model” ( Kiebel et  al., 2008 ; Friston et  al., 
2017) or “temporal thickness” ( Seth, 2015 ). Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience focuses primarily on the dynamic and 
topographical features that for instance characterize free 
energy (Friston et al., 2015), that indeed has been demonstrated 
to be  scale-free and operates at multiple nested spatial scale 
and timescale. The same applies to the link of first and 
third person. Spatiotemporal Neuroscience takes into 
consideration first-person experience of mental features and 
Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
links them to third-person observation about the brain – 
this link is made possible through spatiotemporal features 
being shared by both first and third person as their “common 
currency. ” This shall now be  demonstrated by the example 
of self whose topography ( second part ) and dynamic ( third) 
in both its psyche and brain are discussed in the next 
two parts.
PART II: SPATIAL TOPOGRAPHY – 
NESTEDNESS AS “COMMON 
CURRENCY” OF SELF AND BRAIN
Topography of the Brain – Spatial Layers 
and Nested Hierarchy
Topography refers to a particular spatial organization or structure 
of brain and psyche. One key feature of their topography is 
hierarchies. Hierarchies have been postulated in both 
neuroscience and psychoanalysis. They may thus offer insight 
into the intimate connection of, for instance, brain and self. 
The English neurologist Hughling Jackson early on proposed 
a three-layer hierarchy of the brain with lower, middle, and 
higher centers that were assumed to be associated with different 
regions and psychological functions (see Wiest, 2012  for an 
overview). More recently, MacLean (1990) and Panksepp (1998, 
2012) conceived the brain’s subcortical–cortical organization 
in terms of a radial-concentric pattern and associated its different 
layers different levels of emotions (like primary, secondary, 
and tertiary emotions). Panksepp (1998)  and Damasio (2010)  
associated such hierarchy of the brain with different concepts 
of self, like bodily self, autobiographical self, and extended 
self. A more radial-concentric approach to the brain is the 
three-layer anatomical model of the brain as proposed by 
Feinberg and Northoff ( Northoff et  al., 2011 ). We  will see 
that, together with the recent data, this supports the idea of 
a spatially nested hierarchy of self based on the brain’s radial-
concentric organization.
A clearly hierarchical organization of self (which we  here 
use in a broader sense) which embeds and contains the concept 
of ego has also been proposed in psychoanalysis by Freud. 
Strachey (1961) and Kernberg (1984) noted how Freud preserved 
the German Ich – Ego as a mental structure and psychic agency 
but also as the subjective experiential self in all his writing. 
In synthesis, Strachey and Kernberg propose that Freud never 
dissociated the Ich – Ego  from the experiencing self. Moreover, 
Freud suggested the Id to be the lowest level of the topography 
of the psyche that remains essentially unconscious but 
nevertheless strongly influences the upper levels of the Ego 
and the Super-ego.
FIGURE 3 |  Spatiotemporal Neuroscience – from brain dynamic and topography to brain function.

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
Together, this amounts to a nested hierarchy of self where 
the lower layer somewhat re-surfaces within the next upper 
layer and so forth (see also Wiest, 2012 ). While Freud’s rigid 
three-layer partition was criticized later by others, the multi-
facedness of self with its sense of subjectivity permeating 
across bodily, affective, and cognitive layers remains a key 
feature in both neuroscience and psychoanalysis. We  will 
demonstrate that the model of a nested hierarchy of self is 
strongly supported by recent neuroscience in both its spatial 
and temporal aspects – therefore, we  characterize the neural 
(and psychological) hierarchy of self by spatial and 
temporal nestedness.
From the Brain’s Topography to the Self – 
Three Input Layers (Interoceptive, Extero-
Proprioceptive, Mental)
A recent large-scale meta-analysis in healthy subjects by Qin 
et al. (2020)  investigated and analyzed different imaging studies 
that focused on different aspects of self, inner body 
(interoceptive), outer body (extero-proprioceptive), and the own 
cognitive or mental states. They observed different regions to 
be  associated with each of the three layers; at the same time, 
there was regional overlap as the regions of the lower layer 
were included within the next upper layer ( see below for details). 
Together, this amounts to a spatial multi-layered nested 
hierarchical model of self ( Qin et  al., 2020 ) including (1) 
interoceptive self (2) extero-proprioceptive self, and (3) mental 
self ( Figure  4).
The interoceptive self, that is, how the brain processes and 
perceive the body’s inner organs and their input, was investigated 
through fMRI task studies that measured interoceptive awareness 
of the own body including cardiorespiratory awareness, urogenital, 
and gastrointestinal awareness. That was complemented by 
extero-proprioceptive self fMRI studies focusing on external 
bodily inputs like facial or proprioceptive inputs connected to 
the self. Finally, they also included the “typical” more cognitive 
mental self fMRI studies employing trait adjectives or other 
stimuli where subjects have to become aware of their own 
self as distinct from others.
Based on the interoceptive studies, there is a most basic 
or lower layer of self, an interoceptive self that is related to 
regions that mostly process interoceptive stimuli from the 
own body, that is, bilateral insula, dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex, thalamus, and parahippocampus thus including mainly 
regions of the salience network ( Menon, 2011 ; Qin et  al., 
2020). The fact that these regions were shared among the 
different kinds of interoceptive awareness, that is, 
cardiorespiratory, urogenital, and gastrointestinal, suggests that 
these regions are key in integrating different interoceptive 
inputs of the various organs of the inner body ( Craig, 2003 , 
2010). One can thus speak of an “interoceptive or vegetative 
self ” ( Babo-Rebelo et  al., 2016 , 2019), “ bodily self ” ( Tsakiris, 
2017), “ proto-self” ( Damasio, 2010 ), or “ SELF” ( Panksepp, 
1998) as most basic and fundamental layer of self. Following 
particularly Panksepp (1998) , the SELF provides a complex 
network infrastructure where all basic emotional operating 
systems converge on primitive brain regions such as the 
thalamus and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). This network 
is similar across all mammalian species and represents the 
interoceptive and thus affective foundation of SELF and 
necessary for the construction of higher levels of self ( Northoff  
and Panksepp, 2008 ). This is in line with the interoceptive 
level of self-processing proposed by Qin et  al. (2020)  that 
is considered the ground level of the hierarchy.
The next or middle layer of self includes what Qin et  al. 
(2020) describe as proprioceptive or exteroceptive self; the 
fMRI studies focusing on external bodily-related inputs like 
facial or proprioceptive inputs yielded regions like bilateral 
insula, interior frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, temporo-parietal 
junction (TPJ), and medial prefrontal cortex. As these regions 
process inputs from different sensory modalities, they may 
be  key in not only integrating extero- and proprioceptive 
modalities but also different exteroceptive sensory modalities, 
that is, cross-modal integration. Despite their differences, these 
regions share the processing of proprioceptive inputs related 
to the own body – one can thus speak of a “ proprio- or 
extero-ceptive self, or embodied self ” (Panksepp, 1998; Gallagher, 
2005; Damasio, 2010 ; Tsakiris, 2017 ).
Finally, the most upper layer of self ( Qin et  al., 2020 ) is 
based on fMRI studies that yielded typical DMN midline 
regions like medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate 
cortex as well as the regions included in the second level, 
most notably bilateral TPJ, and first level, bilateral insula and 
thalamus. These regions seem to be  recruited when on needs 
represent one’s own self in mental states – one can therefore 
also speak of a “mental or cognitive self ”  ( Qin et  al., 2020 ) 
or “ extended self ” ( Damasio, 2010 ).
Together, these findings suggest what Qin et  al. (2020)  
describe as “nested hierarchy of self ”: Regions of the lower 
level were included in the next higher level where they were 
complemented by additional regions and so forth. For instance, 
bilateral insula was present on the most basic level, that is, 
the interoceptive self and resurfaced (in completely independent 
imaging studies) again in both second, that is, proprio-
exteroceptive, and third, that is, mental self, levels. The same 
hold true for the bilateral TPJ that first showed in the 
intermediate layer of the proprioceptive self and re-resurfaced 
again in the third level of the mental self. Accordingly, each 
of the hierarchical levels of self recruits both overlapping 
and separate regions compared to other levels amounting to 
spatial nestedness with a spatially nested hierarchy of self 
(Figure  4).
Spatial Topography of Self – Tripartite 
Structure of Ego Vs. Different Input Layers 
of Self
The constitution of the nested hierarchy of self by the brain 
provides close connection to psychoanalysis. We  here refrain 
from associating the spatial topographical findings of the brain 
with the tripartite psychodynamic topography proposed by 
Freud (since it might be  rather too speculative and unprecise; 
see Figure  5). Instead, we  pursue another more empirical path 
Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
where the empirical data are converged with a more relational 
model of self.
We have seen that all three layers of self, interoceptive, 
proprio-exteroceptive, and cognitive mental, are based on the 
respective inputs from the inner body, the outer body, and 
the cognitive (and ultimately neuronal) input from within the 
brain itself. The self, operationalized as a whole subjective 
experience at different nested levels and different from the 
ego described by Freud, is here operationalized in terms of 
its input processing, that is, how it processes and relates to 
the distinct types of inputs, that is, interoceptive, proprio-
exteroceptive, and cognitive mental.
Importantly, the self is here no longer conceived conceived 
as an isolated entity that “resides” inside the inner regions 
and structures of brain, body, and mind. Instead, the self is 
constituted by processes that reach beyond the boundaries of 
brain, body, and mind to the external world by taking on 
different degrees of expansion, that is, self-expansion ( Northoff, 
2016; Scalabrini et  al., 2018 ).
First, the self is constituted by integrating the different 
interoceptive inputs from within the inner body – the 
interoceptive self. Second, these processes expand beyond 
the inner body by reaching out to the outer body, the 
proprio- or exteroceptive self. Third, these processes extend 
beyond the outer body to the brain and its cognitive input 
– this is the mental or cognitive self. While targeting distinct 
inputs, these processes constitute a sense of self that reaches 
beyond the boundaries of brain, body, and environment: 
They, as we  will lay out below, constitute a virtual three-
dimensional spatial structure that integrates brain, body, and 
environment by nesting them within each other, that is, 
spatial nestedness.
Topography of Brain and Psyche – Spatial 
Nestedness as “Common Currency” of 
Brain and Self
We take the self as paradigmatic instance about the relation 
of brain and psyche. Specifically, we  demonstrate how the 
topography of the brain constitutes a particular spatial structure 
or organization across all of its regions/networks. This suggests 
the importance of spatial topography for the brain at a deeper 
and more fundamental layer, that we  intend as a deeper 
organizational and structuring principle, beyond its single 
regions/networks with their respective cognitive, affective, and 
social functions.
Even more relevant, we  could demonstrate how the brain’s 
topographic organization of spatial nestedness is related to 
correspondingly nested layers of self. This supports, albeit 
tentatively, the assumption that spatial topography, that is, 
spatial nestedness is shared as “common currency” by both 
brain and self and, more generally, by brain and psyche.
FIGURE 4 |  Nested hierarchy of self in the brain with different regional layers of brain activity (black boxes on the left and upper middle) nesting in their regions 
within each other (brown, green and blue boxes on the right) resulting in a corresponding nestedness of different layers of self (brown, green, and blue circles in the 
middle).

Freud and psychoanalysis target a deeper layer of the mind. 
Rather than focusing on the conscious at the surface, they 
venture into the unconscious depth of our psyche. The view 
of the brain in terms of topography (and dynamic) now allows 
to take into view a corresponding depth layer within the brain 
itself. Rather than on specific functions with their affective, 
cognitive, or social contents (either conscious or unconscious), 
the focus is here on topography (and dynamic), something 
that eludes even our unconscious let alone our consciousness – 
it is the non-conscious brain that yields our unconscious psyche.
We see here that such most fundamental or depth layer of 
the brain is key in providing the structure or organization of 
the basic layers of the psyche like the spatial nestedness 
constituting the hierarchy of self. We  consequently speak of 
a “Basis model of self-specificity” (BMSS) which, in a nutshell, 
states that self-specificity permeates all layers of input processing 
including interoceptive, exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and 
cognitive/mental ( Northoff, 2016 ).
The Qin et  al. (2020)  study illustrates that such basic or 
fundamental sense of self with ( Scalabrini et al., 2021 ) its  
different layers is featured by a particular topographic 
organization, that is, spatial nestedness as shared by both brain 
and self as their “common currency” ( Northoff et  al., 2020b ). 
Such more basic and fundamental view of the role of self 
aligns more or less well with the various psychodynamic 
conceptions departing from an intra-psychic vantage point (e.g., 
Freud) and moving further to a more interpsychic or relational 
point of view of self as proposed by Kohut, Winnicott, Stern, 
Bromberg, Fonagy, Solms, and Panksepp and Biven (and many 
others; see Northoff, 2011 ; Scalabrini et  al., 2018 ; as well as 
Spagnolo and Northoff, 2021  for details).
PART III: TEMPORAL DYNAMIC – 
SCALE-FREENESS AS “COMMON 
CURRENCY” OF BRAIN AND SELF
“The brain might be a transformer station, in which the relatively 
infinite tension or intensity of the psyche proper is transformed 
into perceptible frequencies or “extensions. ”  ~ Carl Jung, Letters 
Vol. II, Pages 43–47.
Dynamic of the Brain –Operation Across 
Different Timescales in a Scale-Free Way
The brain’s spontaneous neural activity can be  characterized 
by different frequencies ranging from infraslow (0.01–0.1 Hz), 
over slow (0.1 – 1hz), fast (1 – 40 Hz) to ultrafast (40-180 Hz; 
Buzsaki, 2006 ). Power is strongest in the infraslow range and 
decreases across the slow, fast, and ultrafast ranges following 
a power law distribution ( He et  al., 2010 ; He, 2014 ; Huang 
et al., 2016). Together, the different frequencies and their distinct 
degrees of power constitute a complex temporal structure in 
the brain’s spontaneous activity which, in large parts, can 
be  featured by the balance between infraslow, slow, and 
faster frequencies.
The relationship between these frequencies is maintained 
across different temporal scales and can therefore 
be characterized by what is described as “scale-free dynamics” 
(Linkenkaer-Hansen et  al., 2001 ; He et  al., 2010 ; He, 2014 ). 
Roughly, scale-free activity describes the fractal (i.e., self-
similar) organization and thus temporal nestedness in the 
relationship between power and the different frequency 
ranges: the longer and more powerful slower frequencies 
FIGURE 5 |  The model of self that embeds and contains the topographical model of Id-Ego-Superego conceptualized by Freud.

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
nest and contain the shorter and less powerful faster 
frequencies – this amounts to long-range temporal correlation 
(LRTC) which operates across different time scales or 
frequencies ( Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001 ; He et al., 2010 ; 
He, 2014 ; Northoff and Huang, 2017 ; see Figures  6A ,B).
The LRTC makes it possible to assess the degree to which 
past neuronal patterns exert their influence on future dynamics, 
thus accounting for LRTC ( Linkenkaer-Hansen et  al., 2001 ; 
Northoff and Huang, 2017 ). That amounts to a form of 
memory that is here defined not by specific contents that 
are encoded, stored, and recalled or retrieved. Instead, 
memory refers here to the structure, the temporal structure 
of the neural activity across distinct time points. One could 
thus speak of temporal memory or dynamic memory, that 
is, process- and structure-based memory, as distinct from 
the more content-based cognitive memory in the traditional 
sense ( Hasson et  al., 2015 ; Northoff, 2017 ). Accordingly, 
LRTC and henceforth scale-free activity provide not only 
temporal stability through their correlation of different 
timescales, that is, temporal continuity, but also temporal 
memory, that is, temporal stability, through connecting past, 
future, and present timepoint ( Figure  6A ).
The Scale-Free Self – The Brain’s LRTC 
Shape the Self
Is the self related to the LRTC of the brain’s neural activity? 
Recent studies have shown that the brain’s scale-free activity, 
as measured with either Power Law Exponent (PLE) or Detrended 
Fluctuation Analysis, is related to mental features such as the 
self ( Huang et  al., 2016 ; Scalabrini et  al., 2017 , 2019; W o l ff 
et  al., 2019 ). Together, these studies show that the degree of 
resting state PLE directly predicts: (1) the degree of self-
consciousness (Huang et  al., 2016 ; Wolff et  al., 2019) (2) task-
related activity during self-specific stimuli ( Scalabrini et  al., 
2019), and (3) the degree of temporal integration on a 
psychological level of self-specificity ( Kolvoort et  al., 2020 ).
Let us describe the findings in more detail. Huang et  al. 
(2016) and Wolff et  al. (2019)  recorded resting state activity 
in fMRI and EEG of the brain, that is, a task-free condition 
without any external demands. They calculated the degree of 
the brain’s PLE in both fMRI and EEG. The same subjects 
also underwent psychological investigation of their self with 
the self-consciousness scale. Both studies found the same 
relationship of brain PLE and self-consciousness: The higher 
the PLE, that is, the more the slow-fast power balance is

nestedness (lower part). (B) The temporal self – From the brain’s scale-free activity with its temporal nestedness to the self in infraslow frequencies of fMRI (upper 
right/Huang et al., 2016) and faster frequencies of EEG (lower right, Wolff et al., 2019).

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
shifted toward the slow pole, the higher the degree of the 
subject’s private self-consciousness (see Figure  6B).
Importantly, these findings hold only for the PLE as index 
of slow-fast balance but not for either the slow or fast frequencies 
alone. Finally, it shall be  mentioned that this concerns a wide 
range of frequency range, from very slow (0.01 to 0.1 Hz), as 
covered by fMRI (Huang et al., 2016), to faster ones as measured 
in EEG (1-80 Hz) ( Wolff et  al., 2019 ). This means that it is 
the degree slow-fast integration, that is, their degree of scale-
freeness, that is related to the sense of self. The self is thus 
intrinsically scale-free as it connects and links different timescales 
short/fast and long/slow. Such cross-scale self exhibits both 
temporal continuity and discontinuity and nests them within 
each other in a scale-free way: temporal continuity, as mediated 
by the more powerful slower frequencies, nests and contains 
temporal discontinuity, as related to the less powerful 
faster frequencies.
Dynamic of Brain and Psyche – Scale-
Freeness as “Common Currency” of Brain 
and Self
Is such self-specificity of the brain’s internal resting state activity 
also carried over to external task demands during self-specific 
tasks? This was studied in fMRI by Scalabrini et  al. (2017 , 
2019). He measured both rest and task during the active touch 
toward an animate (another person) and non-animate 
(mannequin hand) targets. They observed that the degree of 
PLE in the resting state predicted the degree to which subjects 
could differentiate in their task-related activity between animate 
and non-animate targets. Given that rest and task states occur 
and are measured at distinct points in time, this strongly 
suggest a memory effect: The temporal or dynamic memory 
of the resting state is carried over to the task state as otherwise 
the latter could not be  modulated by the former. Given that 
such temporal memory effect in terms of rest-task modulation 
was related to the self-non-self differentiation, one would 
strongly assume it to be  self-specific.
How does such self-specific temporal memory of the resting 
state affect the task states? This was addressed by Kolvoort 
et  al. (2020)  in an EEG study on self. They measured resting 
state in EEG and conducted a psychological self-task where 
subjects were required to associate self- and non-self-specific 
stimuli across different time delays (from 200 ms to 1,400 ms). 
They demonstrate that the self-specific effects in terms of 
accuracy was preserved across all temporal delays with 
intersubject variation. That, in turn, was related to the resting 
state PLE: the higher the resting state PLE, that is, the stronger 
the slower frequencies relative to the faster ones, the stronger 
the self-specific effect was preserved across the different time 
delays on the psychological level. This suggests that temporal 
integration of different timescales as indexed by temporal 
memory may be  key in mediating the co-occurrence temporal 
stability and flexibility of the self.
Together, these findings suggest that the self is intrinsically 
dynamic in that it integrates and combines temporal continuity 
and discontinuity across different timescales, that is, in a 
scale-free way. The data show that the brain’s degree of scale-
freeness is key in mediating the self which, psychologically, 
is manifest in the link of temporal continuity and discontinuity. 
Since temporal discontinuity and continuity concern different 
timescales, that is, fast and slow, one can also speak of scale-
freeness on the psychological level of self (which remains to 
be  demonstrated empirically, though).
More generally, scale-freeness may be  shared by both brain 
and self as their “common currency. ” This points to the 
importance of (1) conceiving the brain in terms of dynamic, 
that is, scale-freeness of neural activity and (2) taking into 
view the corresponding manifestation of dynamic in organizing 
the psyche in a temporal way, that is, the scale-freeness of 
self. Accordingly, the example of self strongly encourages the 
utility and validity of Spatiotemporal Neuroscience for providing 
the intimate (and necessary) connection of brain and psyche 
through topography and dynamic.
PART IV: “PROJECT FOR A 
SPATIOTEMPORAL NEUROSCIENCE” – 
EXTENDING FREUD AND SOLMS
“Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” – Complementing and 
Extending Freud
After having provided empirical support for Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience, we are now ready to provide an answer to Freud’s 
original quest for an intimate link of psyche and brain as 
developed in his “Project for a Scientific Psychology. ” Following 
Freud’s view of the psyche, Spatiotemporal Neuroscience considers 
the brain’s neural activity as topographic, dynamic, and essentially 
spatiotemporal. Hence, spatial topographic and temporal dynamic 
features provide the features that are shared by the brain’s 
neural activity and the psyche’s psychodynamic features, their 
“common currency” ( Figure  7).
Taken in a nutshell, Spatiotemporal Neuroscience provides 
the missing link of brain and psyche which remained elusive 
to Freud at his time. We  therefore speak of the need for a 
“Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience. ” What do we mean 
by “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” and how does 
it stand in relation to Freud’s original “Project for a 
Scientific Psychology”?
The “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” aims 
to develop the kind of neuroscience that, by establishing 
a temporal dynamic and spatial topographic view of the 
brain and its various functions, allows for their intimate 
connection with the psyche’s psychodynamic features (see 
orange arrow in Figure  2 ). This complements and extends 
Freud’s original Project which, due to the lack of 
neuroscientific research at its time, could not conceive the 
dynamic and topography of the brain. Accordingly, the 
“Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” provides Freud 
with the kind of neuroscience that allows him to intimately 
link his view of the psyche to the brain and thus to 
complement his original project.

“Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” II – Empirical Convergence 
With Solms’ “(New) Project for a Scientific 
Psychology”
How does our “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” 
stand in relation to the recently proposed “(New) Project 
for a Scientific Psychology” by Mark Solms ( Solms, 2020 )? 
Mark Solms recently proposed a “New Scientific Psychology” 
(Solms, 2020 , 2021) where he casts Freud’s original “Scientific 
Psychology” in the terms of free energy and predictive 
coding. He uses the physical-biological framework of affective 
neuroscience (AF , Panksepp, 1998 ), free energy principle 
(FEP) and predictive coding (PC) to account for 
psychodynamic concepts like memory, primary and secondary 
processes, cathexis, dreams, and the ego as basic structure 
or organization. Following Freud’s “Scientific Psychology, ” 
he  uses the original text as template for reformulating it 
in terms of Friston’s FEP coupled with the Affective 
Neuroscience by Panksepp, relying particularly on what 
Panksepp call the primal “SELF” where the role of the PAG 
and the brain stem is central for both “the terminus of 
every affect circuit and the genesis of every newly felt affect”  
(Solms, 2020 , p.10).
How does Solms’ Project of a “New scientific Psychology” 
stand in relation to the here proposed “Project for a 
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience”? First and foremost, both are 
not exclusive but compatible. There is plenty of convergence 
between Panksepp’s AN, Friston’s FEP coupled with PC on 
the one hand and the spatiotemporal approach to the brain 
in terms of Spatiotemporal Neuroscience. His “(New) Project 
for a Scientific Psychology” thus converges with our “Project 
for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience. ”
Prediction and free energy are driven by a deeper layer of 
the brain’s temporal dynamics, that is, deep temporal models 
(Kiebel et  al., 2008 ; Friston et  al., 2017 ). Deeper layer is not 
here understood in terms of time and space scales but in 
terms of a deeper organizational and structuring principle that 
holds across all other subsequent layers as well as across all 
time–space scales. Spatiotemporal neuroscience may thus provide 
the temporal (and spatial topographic) underpinnings driving 
PC as we see in the case of the self. The same holds analogously 
in the case of FEP that has been demonstrated to be  scale-
free and that operated at multiple and nested spatial scale 
and timescale (Friston et al., 2015): These represent the intrinsic 
temporal dynamic and spatial topographical features of FEP . 
In other words, the spatiotemporal, that is, dynamic and 
topographic configurations in the matching of brain and 
environment are key in mediating the degree of free energy, 
that is, FEP . Accordingly, both FEP and PC may be  driven, 
on a holistic and more fundamental level, by dynamic and 
topography. Spatiotemporal Neuroscience thus provides a deeper 
more holistic and comprehensive empirical layer of the brain 
that can integrate and make us better understand how the 
brain can yield PC and FEP . In this context, we  tried to 
explicate a deeper layer in FEP and PC that drives and organizes 
both but is not yet by itself explicated as such. A similar 
relation can be  found between Spatiotemporal Neuroscience 
and Panksepp’s AN. Also in this case, Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience provides the dynamic and the topography that 
organize and structure the generation of affects and feelings.

Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
Again our approach is not exclusive but rather holistic and 
comprehensive in its’ own purpose to provides the topographical 
and dynamic ground on which the different functions and 
manifestation of the brain and psyche are generated. Hence, 
our “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” empirically 
converges with and complements Solms’ “(New) Project for a 
Scientific Psychology. ”
“Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” III – Conceptual Extension 
of Solms’ “(New) Project for a Scientific 
Psychology”
Do we  need both FEP/PC and Spatiotemporal Neuroscience? 
Or is one sufficient to explain the psyche? FEP/PC explain 
and mathematically formulate brilliantly the physical-biological 
features of the brain as both FEP and PC strongly borrow 
from physics and biology. However, that leaves open in both 
FEP/PC and Solms how the brain’s states are connected to 
and, ultimately, can transform into psychical or mental states. 
Let us highlight this point.
We are encountering theoretical and empirical questions 
in our aim to intimately connect brain and psyche: what 
provides the necessary condition or intrinsic feature of the 
transition and connection from brain to psyche? Why and 
how does the brain’s neural activity transform into psychic 
activity with its various functions (affective, social, cognitive, 
etc.) shaped by PC/FEP? Necessary connection (as theoretical 
concept) and transformation (as empirical concept) mean 
here that if the neuronal state appears in a particular way, 
it cannot avoid being associated with or entailing the presence 
of a particular psychical or mental state. We  are thus 
encountering a “gap of contingency” between brain and 
psyche something that, in the specific instance of 
consciousness, has also described as “hard problem” in 
philosophy ( Chalmers, 1996 ).
How can we  close the “gap of contingency” between brain 
and psyche? This is the moment where Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience, together with the assumption of “common 
currency, ” comes in. Brain and psyche share spatial topographic 
and temporal dynamic features as their “common currency” 
which underlie and shape PC and FEP and subsequently the 
respective affective and cognitive functions. This, as detailed 
in Northoff (2018), provides an intrinsic or necessary a posteriori 
connection of brain and psyche. The “gap of contingency” can 
consequently be  closed and, even stronger, be  resolved by 
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience through its assumption of spatial 
topography and temporal dynamic providing the “common 
currency” of brain and psyche.
This carries major implications for the relationship of our 
“Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” to Solms’ “(New) 
Project for a Scientific Psychology. ” By providing analogous 
views of brain and psyche in terms of topography, dynamic, 
and spatiotemporality, the “Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” bridges and resolves the “gap of contingency” 
of brain and psyche. Since the “gap of contingency” is still 
present in Friston’s concepts of FEP and PC, Solms’ “(New) 
Project for a Scientific Psychology” cannot avoid this gap either 
(Figure  8).
This is the moment where the “(New) Project for a Scientific 
Psychology” may want to turn to our “Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience”: the latter’s focus on the brain’s topography and 
dynamic providing the shared feature or “common currency” 
with the psyche can close the “gap of contingency” in Solms’ 
“(New) Project for a Scientific Psychology. ” Taken in this sense, 
the “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” conceptually 
extends the “(New) Project for a Scientific Psychology” by 
providing a more intimate, that is, necessary a posteriori  
(Northoff, 2018 ) connection of brain and psyche ( Figure  9).
Closing the “gap of contingency” of brain and psyche is 
not only of theoretical-conceptual importance but also in a 
very practical sense. The “Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” allows us to develop a novel form of 
psychodynamic psychotherapy, namely, Spatiotemporal 
Psychotherapy. Although it remains to be fully explicated, we at 
least want to provide some initial hints about such temporally 
and spatially based psychotherapy.
Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy I – Spatial 
and Temporal Integration of Self Through 
the Therapist
What is the goal of psychotherapy? In our neuroscientifically 
informed view, the goal of psychotherapy is (1) to reverse 
maladaptive topographic-dynamic re-organization of brain and 
(2) to establish a more adaptive and stable spatiotemporal 
nestedness of brain and self thereby re-establishing a proper 
nested hierarchy of self. This process, in accordance with 
contemporary psychoanalysis, might serve to re-establish the 
subjective sense of integrity, coherence, and continuity of self 
over time and space, similar to what has been described by 
Philip Bromberg: “health is the ability to stand in the spaces 
between realities without losing any of them – the capacity 
to feel like one self while being many” ( Bromberg, 1996, p. 166).
Psychotherapeutically, this means that we  may need to 
operates at the subjects’ level of perception (or experience) of 
time, i.e., dynamics, and space, i.e., topography as the building 
blocks of individuals self-states (and ultimately their brain’s 
temporal dynamic and spatial topographic structure) to remedy 
and heal their discrepancies, discontinuities, dis-integrity of 
the sense of self. In this context, we  explicitly refer to 
contemporary psychoanalysis of self and relatedness (i.e., object 
relations) leaving beyond classical concept of psychoanalysis, 
such as drives, conflicts, and defense mechanisms. Our target 
is here to focus on the sense of self and its intrinsic features. 
Our aim is to neuroscientifically inform psychotherapy and 
expand our knowledge on the self and its intrinsic features 
at neuro-psychodynamic level. At the current stage, our model 
here does not aim to change or provides new therapeutic 
techniques; nevertheless, spatiotemporal psychotherapy provides 
a more comprehensive and neuroscientific informed framework 
that might be  useful for therapists.
For instance, the therapist may need to operate at building 
blocks of consciousness and unconscious processing through 
Northoff and Scalabrini Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 14 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 717402
spatial topographic and temporal dynamic means: the therapist 
needs to connect (virtually or symbolically) her/his larger 
(spatial topographic and temporal dynamic) scales of her/his 
own exteroceptive and/or mental self to the more restricted 
of his client’s interoceptive self. Pragmatically, this means that 
operating in the dual relational field, the therapist must operate 
in the transferential-contertransferential matrix using the 
“common currency” of time and space as the cardinal points 
to note and work through  the moments of rupture of the 
sense of self and its intrinsic features.
This analytical dance in the transitional space and time 
of the real and the virtual relationship between the two 
subjects made by continuous “ruptures and repairs” provides 
the client with the opportunity to integrate and nest her/
his own more restricted spatiotemporal scales of her/his 
interoceptive self in a virtual, that is, interpersonal way 
into the larger ones of her/his therapist. That, in turn, will 
allow the client to process the traumatic input relationships 
in a non-threatening and non-disrupting way for her/his 
own self without becoming fragmented and loosing the 
access to one’s interoceptive self. The traumatic input 
relationships associated with the own interoceptive self are 
now integrated and nested virtually (or symbolically) within 
the therapists’ larger spatiotemporal scales (of the therapist’s 
exteroceptive and mental self).
Accordingly, the therapeutic aim here is to spatially and 
temporally re-integrate the different layers of self: that serves 
the purpose to connect the different layers of self such that 
they can become conscious together rather than being split 
off and isolated into the dynamic unconscious (as in dissociation). 
Dissociation here operates in terms of lack of integration 
between the different layers of the self and seems to be mediated 
by the lack of connectivity (thus integrative function) in the 
right anterior insula with the rest of the brain at different 
spatiotemporal scales ( Scalabrini et  al., 2020b ) accompanied 
by the loss of first-person perspective. Consequently, healing 
the self means to re-establish the sense of self-continuity beyond 
the dissociation of its trauma. This is possible by re-stablishing 
and/or re-organizing the topography and dynamic of the nested 
hierarchy of both self and its brain through spatial and temporal 
means – this amounts to what we  here describe as 
“Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy. ”

Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy II – Timing, 
Spatialness, Dynamic, and Shared Time–
Space
What is Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy? Spatiotemporal 
psychotherapy consists in modulating the individual’s subjectively 
perceived (consciously and unconsciously) time-scale and space-
scale on both neural and psychological levels. This process 
calls into account the role of the therapist that here works at 
the edges of different affectives and self-states characterized 
by their respective time-scale and space-scale. The primary 
purpose of the therapist is to reach and integrate their clients’ 
dissociated spatiotemporal layers of self with their respective 
affects and thoughts (this is consistent with the work on different 
traumatic levels that has been clinically described by Mucci, 
2013, 2018; Mucci and Scalabrini, 2021 ).
The primary means of such spatiotemporal psychotherapy 
are thus spatial and temporal in both intra-personal experience/
perception and interpersonal transference. This targets the most 
basic and fundamental layers of existence ( Scalabrini et  al., 
2020c), the spatiotemporal coordinates that tie together different 
people like therapist and client while, at the same time, being 
most vulnerable to traumatic events and influences. Importantly, 
the main therapeutic direction of client-therapist interaction 
is from their shared inter-personal space and time to the intra-
personal experiences/perceptions of the client (and those of 
the therapist).
How does Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy work? For 
instance, the therapist may provide more stable, regular, 
and continuous mixture of slow and fast timescales trying 
to be  “sufficiently” aligned with the patient in the analytic 
dance. This process aim to regularize, stabilize, and make 
the temporal dynamic flow of the client’s neural and psychic 
activity more continuous. While at the same time, this will 
allow integrating temporal discontinuity and change as related 
to traumata. This, as we  hypothesize, should complement 
and mirror the client’s self-state increasing these subjects’ 
arousal level modulating their affect and emotion as well 
as their thought dynamic ( Rostami et  al., 2021 ). Hence, 
timing, spatialness, and temporal dynamic within the 
interaction of client and therapist will be  key in such 
psychotherapeutic regulatory approach.
A psychotherapy that is interpersonally attuned in time and 
aligned in space might provide a more comprehensive, basic, 
and extensive operating field that also embed and contains 
affective, social, cognitive functions within a larger more 
comprehensive context. Here, we suggest the therapists to work 
using these spatiotemporal coordinates beyond the contents 
and the narratives of the patients. The shared time and space 
between therapist and client might here be seen as an operating 
commonly shared interpersonal spatiotemporal field, which 
makes possible the re-organization and transformation of the 
client’s intra-personal nested hierarchy of self through its

spatiotemporal manifestation within her/his brain (See Spagnolo 
and Northoff, 2021 ).
In case of very severe psychiatric patients, one could also 
complement such temporo-spatial psychotherapy by brain-based 
intervention operating on the basis of the brain’s spatiotemporal 
features. For instance, transcranial magnetic stimulation may, 
if stimulating in the “right” frequency, can foster and facilitate 
slow-fast temporal integration on the neuronal level of, for 
instance, the default-mode network (DMN) in order to help 
the client to remit from dissociating her/his own mental self 
and to enlarge its spatial and temporal scales beyond those 
related to its “traumatic shrinking. ” That, in turn, provides the 
ground for the more virtual or symbolic work with the therapist 
to re-order, re-integrate, and re-nest the client’s mental self 
within her/his own intero- and exteroceptive self ( Figure  10).
CONCLUSION – “PROJECT FOR A 
SPATIOTEMPORAL NEUROSCIENCE”
Mismatch of Brain and Psyche – Adapting 
the Model of Brain
Freud searched for the scientific basis of the psyche in the 
brain. He  deemed his “Project for a Scientific Psychology” a 
failure, though, as he  was not able to intimately the psyche’s 
topography, dynamic, and spatiotemporal features to 
corresponding features in the brain. Having more insight in 
our times, current neuropsychoanalysis aims to trace the psyche’s 
topography, dynamic, and spatiotemporality to the brain’s affective 
and cognitive (and social and cultural) functions including 
their predictive coding and free energy. However, we  argue 
that, despite all progress, such approach does not yet fully 
complete the Freudian’ quest: It does not provide the kind of 
intimate, that is, necessary connection of brain and psyche 
that allows closing their “gap of contingency” which Freud 
deemed necessary to complete his project.
Specifically, the current neuropsychoanalytic approach suffers 
from a mismatch in its presupposed models of brain and 
psyche. Following Freud and others, the psyche is characterized 
by dynamic, topography, and spatiotemporality. That is related 
to a model of the brain in Cognitive, Social and Affective 
Neuroscience where the brain is conceived as static (rather 
than dynamic), modular (rather than topographic), and 
non-spatiotemporal (rather than spatiotemporal). This amounts 
to a mismatch between the models of psyche and brain, though. 
That, in turn, prevents us from taking into view the intimate 
or necessary brain-psyche connection one requires to properly 
complete Freud’s “Project for a Scientific Psychology. ”
How can we  adapt our model of brain to the model of 
psyche Freud and others envision in psychoanalysis? For that, 
we have to take into view the brain’s intrinsic spatial topography 
FIGURE 10 |  Visual representation of spatiotemporal psychotherapy.

and temporal dynamics. This leads us to Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience ( Northoff et  al., 2020a ,b). Unlike its cognitive, 
affective, and social siblings, Spatiotemporal Neuroscience 
conceives the brain’s neural activity primarily in terms of 
topography, dynamic, and spatiotemporality which, in turn, 
structure and organize various functions including their predictive 
coding and free energy. Accordingly, conceiving brain and 
psyche in analogous ways, Spatiotemporal Neuroscience allows 
to take into view their intimate or necessary connection through 
shared features (“common currency”), that is, topography, 
dynamic, and spatiotemporality.
“Project for a Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience” – Complementing Freud 
and Solms
The introduction of such spatiotemporal model of the brain 
by Spatiotemporal neuroscience carries major implications for 
neuropsychoanalysis. Freud characterized the psyche by dynamic, 
topography, and spatiotemporality but was missing a 
corresponding model of the brain – his “Project for a Scientific 
Psychology” was thus doomed to failure. In a more recent 
brave attempt, Mark Solms aims to provide the missing pieces 
by proposing a “(New) Project for a Scientific Psychology” 
(Solms, 2020 , 2021). By reverting to predictive coding and 
free energy, he  provides some of the missing pieces of the 
puzzle but nevertheless leaves open the intimate or necessary 
connection of brain and psyche as he  still relies largely on 
(the model of the brain provided by) Affective, Cognitive, and 
Social Neuroscience.
This is the moment where our proposed “Project for a 
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” comes in. Spatiotemporal 
Neuroscience provides a model of the brain that is more or 
less analogous to Freud’s view of the psyche. That, in turn, 
makes it possible to take into view topography, dynamic, and 
spatiotemporality as the shared features of brain and psyche, 
their “common currency” ( Northoff et al., 2020a ,b). This closes 
the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical gap between brain 
and psyche, the “gap of contingency, ” which both Freud and 
Solms did not overcome.
In conclusion, the “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” 
complements Freud’s “Project for a Scientific Psychology” on 
theoretical grounds. At the same time, it converges empirically 
with and extends conceptually beyond Solms’ “(New) Project 
for a Scientific Psychology. ” While practically, the “Project for 
a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” lays the groundwork for a 
novel form of neuroscientific informed psychotherapy, namely 
Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy.
