Intersubjectivity refers to one person’s awareness in relation to another
person’s awareness. It is key to well-being and human development. From
infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the
ﬂourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we ﬁrst describe
intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-
child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference
model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity.
We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying
problems of deﬁcient relational benevolence, misattributing another person’s
intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one’s own actions
on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate
stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person’s active inference
engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid
(mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we brieﬂy describe relevant
neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects
of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress.
Using the active inference dyadic model, we identiﬁed critical interventional

strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding
system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review,
we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions
published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict
their efﬁcacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-
guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can
effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate
the problems of deﬁcient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-
mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identiﬁed
in the literature. Finally, inspired by Arya Nagarjuna’s Buddhist Madhyamaka
Philosophy, we described abstract expressions of Dependent Origination as a
relational worldview to reﬂect on the normality, impairment, and rehabilitation
of intersubjectivity.

Introduction
The world is not an aggregation of things, but rather a
symphony of relationships between many participants that
are altered by the interaction.
(Weber, 2017, p. 29)
An emerging view of evolution suggests that evolution of
living systems is about survival-of-the-ﬁtted—those entities that
resist entropic destruction—rather than survival-of-the-ﬁttest—
the entities with the greatest reproductive success (Cohen and
Marron, 2020). That is, survival requires a living entity to be
integrated within biological and material networks to convert
entropic disorganization into organization amid universal
properties of energy, entropy, and interactions (Schrodinger,
2012; Friston, 2013; Ramstead et al., 2018). All biological
substances, from a molecule to an organism, become what they
are by interacting with something else in the environments
(Gilbert et al., 2015) and they are impermanent as they
become something diﬀerent after each and every interaction
with other objects (Weber, 2017). In short, living organisms
are impermanent, inter-dependent, self-organizing systems in a
universe of energy, entropy, and interactions.
As living systems are more appropriately considered
as symbionts in symbiosis, as opposed to independent
“individuals” existing in and of itself (Gilbert et al., 2012),
human beings are no exception. The dyadic interactions
between mother and infant constitute a prime example of
inter dependence. Indeed, bidirectional moment-to-moment
interactions between the symbionts, e.g., a mother and an
infant, have long been recognized as important for infant
development by developmental psychologists, e.g., (Bowlby,
1969; Stern, 1971; Sander, 1977; Tronick et al., 1978; Beebe
and Lachmann, 1998). Recently, a systematic review has parsed
the literature on mother-infant interactions in terms of nine
dyadic concepts, namely, Mutuality, Reciprocity, Attunement,
Contingency, Coordination, Matching, Mirroring, Reparation,
and Synchrony (Provenzi et al., 2018), which will be described
later. While these dyadic concepts are known to exert multiple
eﬀects on the developments of IQ, conduct, secure attachment,
and stress regulation (Provenzi et al., 2018), they are not
yet integrated in a formal theoretical framework (such as an
active inference framework to be described in this paper),
despite the well-known emphasis of dyadic interactions in many
developmental theories, e.g., (Stern, 1971; Sander, 1977; Tronick
et al., 1978; Beebe and Lachmann, 1998). Partly due to the lack
of such integration, very little is known about the eﬀects of
engaging in dyadic interactions on maternal health and well-
being, as acknowledged by Provenzi et al. (2018).
In this paper, we aim to address the gaps between these
concepts in parent-child relations and a formal dyadic model
that can provide heuristics for therapeutic interventions to
promote the wellbeing of mother-child dyad. First, we postulate
that intersubjectivity is a hallmark of quality dyadic interactions.
Second, we introduce an active inference framework, namely,
Free Energy Principle (FEP), to describe a person in a weakly
coupled state and then propose our own dyadic active inference
model to model dyadic interactions in a strongly coupled
state, such that the causal link between intersubjectivity and
maternal wellbeing (speciﬁcally, the reduction of parenting
stress) is established. Third, we describe how maternal

intersubjectivity can be impaired by problems of deﬁcient
relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing,
with brain-based evidence for our theory. Fourth, to further
corroborate our theory, we present a theory-driven literature
review, using a coding system derived from our dyadic model
to code recent clinically studied parenting interventions that
measured parenting stress index (PSI; Abidin, 1995) as one
of the outcome variables. Fifth, we integrate our work with
the literature of dyadic concepts, using the meta-analytical
review by Provenzi et al. (2018). Finally, inspired by Buddhist
Madhyamaka Philosophy, championed by Arya Nagarjuna (ca
150ñ250 CE), we describe a relational worldview in terms of an
abstract expression of Dependent Origination. By applying this
abstract expression of Dependent Origination to the domains
of physics, awareness, intersubjectivity, and active inference, we
wish to elucidate a profound relation between intersubjectivity
and wellbeing, i.e., intersubjectivity is anti-stress.
Intersubjectivity is a hallmark of
quality dyadic interactions and
wellbeing
The acid test of every epistemology is, when all is said and
done, the intersubjective relationship.
(Fuchs, 2017, p. 27)
Intersubjectivity—the relation between subjects—has been
a key concept in phenomenology (Zahavi, 2018). When
referring speciﬁcally to the awareness of others’ awareness ,
intersubjectivity is synonymous to some deﬁnitions of empathy
in psychology (Preston and Hofelich, 2012; Zahavi and
Overgaard, 2013). The wellbeing of the child can be inﬂuenced
by the mother-child dyadic interactions, and the quality of
these dyadic interactions is directly related to the capacity
of maternal intersubjectivity (Leerkes et al., 2009), which
is also known as parental sensitivity (Ainsworth et al.,
1978; Bernard et al., 2013), parental empathic attunement
(Rowe and MacIsaac, 2004), parental reﬂective functioning
(Fonagy et al., 1991; Slade, 2005), and parental embodied
mentalizing (Shai and Belsky, 2011). Poor quality in parent-
child interactions can cause chronic stress in children and
consequently resulting in multiple physical and mental health
problems that surface later in life (Shonkoﬀ et al., 2012). Not
surprisingly, the capacity of maternal intersubjectivity is also
related to maternal wellbeing. The capacity of intersubjectivity
can be compromised in mothers suﬀering from interpersonal
aggression (Dayton et al., 2016) and depressive mood disorders
(Bernard et al., 2018), leaving these mothers at risk for excessive
parenting stress, as parenting stress is inversely associated with
parental intersubjectivity (Shai et al., 2017). Impaired parental
intersubjectivity can adversely aﬀect the bonding with the
spouse as well (Naki´c Radoö, 2021). Fortunately, the impairment
of maternal intersubjectivity can be reversed. For example,
we reported that a parenting intervention that increased the
capacity of maternal intersubjectivity can reduce parenting
stress with concomitant changes in the maternal brain regions
that are known to mediate intersubjectivity (Ho et al., 2020).
The development of intersubjectivity in infants has been
studied empirically since 1970’s. Among the pioneers, Colwyn
Trevarthen and colleagues postulated the theory of “innate
intersubjectivity” to account for the ontogeny of the active
“self-and-other” awareness, stating that “ the infant is born
with awareness speciﬁcally receptive to subjective states in other
persons, ” and that a human being “grows in active engagement
with an environment of human factors ñ organic at ﬁrst, then
psychological or inter-mental .” (Trevarthen, 1974; Trevarthen
and Aitken, 2001). Trevarthen and Aitken (2001) suggested
that intersubjectivity is as innate as intrinsic motive formations
(IMFs) underlying three types of engagements with the world:
(1) a “self-unity” that is innate and maintained by organismic
self-organizing processes (IMFs) that regulate the physiological
functions of the body to maintain a person’s self; (2) an agency
that is developed to possess anticipatory control over the eﬀects
of actions and perceptions of objects in the environments; and
(3) an inter-mental awareness (awareness of others’ purposes)
that is developed through communications with other persons
and dynamic interactive adjustments to others’ behaviors.
Toward a dyadic model for
intersubjectivity
Since infancy, we live our lives alternating between a
weakly coupled state, in which we are not interacting with the
environments, and a strongly coupled state, in which we are
intimately interacting with others, e.g., moments of parent-
infant interactions. In the science of complexity, the weakly
coupled and strongly coupled states instantiate diﬀerent phases
of a complex system. In general, phase transitions produce
discontinuity in the thermodynamic free energy of a complex
system, such that a simple behavior in one phase may give rise
to tremendous complexity in the other phase (Cocchi et al.,
2017). Though the body of literature in complex systems is huge,
here we only focus on the use of active inference framework to
heuristically model a person in two phases separately—a weakly
coupled state and a strongly coupled states—as follows.
An active inference model in a weakly
coupled state
The active inference framework is based on the premises
that (1) perception and action of a person self-organize to

minimize a quantity known as variational free energy and that
(2) action selection, planning, and decision-making can be
optimized by minimizing expected free energy, which quantiﬁes
the variational free energy of various actions based on expected
future outcomes (Smith et al., 2022). Infants are born with self-
unity that serves as a seed (ground zero) within innate complex
self-organizing processes, as if they are objective perceivers and
actors that are diﬀerentiated from other entities (Rochat, 2019).
Such innate self-unity can serve as a seed (prior) in the active
inference framework (Friston, 2018).
According to FEP , a living organism is a self-organizing
system that maintains its characteristic phenotypic states
and avoids surprising deviations from these expected states
by generative processes that are self-organizing and self-
evidencing. As the physical, biological processes of an organism
embody its “best guess” about its environments, on average and
over time the organism tends be attracted to a limited number
of attractor states in the space of all possible states, with low
entropy or spread in the probability density over the space
of possible states, i.e., low variational free energy. Variational
free energy is a measure of the upper bound of surprise or
prediction error—the diﬀerence between the organism’s “best
guess” beliefs about what caused its sensory states and what it
observes (Friston, 2013; Ramstead et al., 2020; Friston et al.,
2022).
Free energy principle adopts the notion of Markov
blankets to deﬁne the boundary of the living system and its
environments—which are partitioned as internal (systemic)
states and external (environmental) states, respectively. The
Markov blanket itself can be partitioned into active and sensory
states, which can be diﬀerentiated as follows: active states are
not inﬂuenced by external states, and sensory states are not
inﬂuenced by internal states (Friston, 2013; Ramstead et al.,
2018, 2020). The internal states and its Markov blanket together
constitute an active inference engine that actively self-organizes
to stay in the most probable expected states, i.e., the living
system’s characteristic phenotypes.
Here we brieﬂy describe the concept of Markov blanket as
prescribed in FEP (Parr et al., 2022). Technically, a Markov
blanket (b) is deﬁned as follows:
p(µ,x|b) = p(µ
⏐⏐b)p(x
⏐⏐ b)
This says that, statistically speaking, if b is known, then
a variable µ is conditionally independent of a variable x. In
other words, if knowing the values of x and µ both depends
on the condition of knowing the value of b, then knowing x
would give us no additional information about µ. To identify
a Markov blanket in a system with conditional dependence,
one can follow a rule that the blanket for a given variable
comprises its parents (the variables it depends on), its children
(the variables that depend on it) and, in some settings, the other
parents of its children.
The FEP leverages the principle of minimizing variational
free energy—the upper bound of surprise or prediction errors—
to optimize the prior beliefs in the active inference engine.
There are two ways to minimize variational free energy,
i.e., perceptual inference and active inference. In perceptual
inference, agents strive to update their prior beliefs, while
in active inference agents change their environment (or their
sampling of information from the environment) by selecting
a plan or policy in a set of prior beliefs that would yield
the least expected free energy (Peters et al., 2017). Notably,
in FEP , the variational free energy is more of a function of
beliefs and expectations in the internal states rather than a
function of the environments hidden from the internal states
(Ramstead et al., 2020). In such processes, internal and active
states’ dynamics are a function of, and only of, a variational
free energy bound on surprise, and the belief optimization is
implicitly done in the minimization of variational and expected
free energy (Friston et al., 2022).
The notion of active inference emphasizes that actions solicit
a sensory outcome that informs approximate posterior beliefs
about external states of the world. Such generative process in
FEP renders a living organism to be participatory, or enactive in
soliciting and therefore co-creating its perception of the external
states, which is very diﬀerent from a representationalist process
by which external states generate sensory states exclusively
(Friston et al., 2022). Heuristically, one may consider that an
active inference engine is actively self-evidencing what the world
should be (known as an enactive account), rather than passively
learning to represent what the world seems to be (known
as a representationalist account)—a distinction that has been
elaborated in the literature (Ramstead et al., 2020). How this
distinction is related to the diﬀerences in two incompatible
worldviews will be clariﬁed later.
Inspired by FEP (Friston, 2013), we suggest that a person can
be formally modeled as an active inference engine in a multi-
level network consisting of four nodes, namely nodes of sensory
states (S), active states (A), internal states (I), and external states
or events (E). This network is partitioned into an external state
(E) and an active inference engine that consists of the nodes
(S) and (A) at a lower level and node (I) at a higher level. See
Figure 1. The internal state (I) can be conceived as an innate
prior—a set of “best guess” beliefs that may guide the active
inference engine’s action planning and selection. When an event
in the external states (E) interacts with a person, it can only
aﬀect internal states (I) indirectly through its interaction with
the Markov blanket nodes (A) and (S), such that (E) aﬀerently
causes (S) to change and (A) eﬀerently causes (E) to change;
On the other hand, the nodes (S) and (A) at the lower level
interact with the person’s prior beliefs in internal states (I) at
the higher level, such that (S) causes (I) to change and (I)
causes (A) to change.
In this model, nodes (A) and (S) are the Markov blanket
of the node (E), because (A) is a parent of (E)—because (E)

FIGURE 1
An active inference and its environments (external states): In an
active inference model, an adaptive person functions as an
active inference engine—consisting of nodes (A), (S), and (I; solid
circles). In a hierarchical network, (S) represents the person’s
afferent sensory state and (A) represents the person’s efferent
active state, both at a lower level, and (I) represents the person’s
prior beliefs at a higher level. Node (E) represents environmental
events as external states (dashed circle). The bidirectional
arrowed line between (A) and (S) indicates the notion of active
inference, that actions solicit a sensory outcome that informs
approximate posterior beliefs in the internal states (I) about the
external states (E). This is done by minimizing variational free
energy—the upper bound of surprise or prediction errors of the
active inference. Nodes (E) and (I) do not have direct effects on
one another, as they are separated by nodes (A) and (S) that
serve as Markov blanket. Nodes (I) and (E) are statistically
independent of each other given the Markov blanket, nodes (A)
and (S). That is, the nodes (I) and (E) maintain a conditional
independence of each other in the model, such that if the values
of the Markov blanket nodes (S and A) are known, then knowing
the internal states (I) does not provide any additional information
about the external states (E), and vice versa. This conditional
independence may give rise to the appearance of duality
between the subject (the active inference engine) and the object
(the external states) and is therefore considered a hallmark of a
weakly coupled state of the active inference engine.
depends on (A)—and (S) is a child of (E)—because (S) depends
on (E). In contrary, node (I) is not the Markov blanket of (E)
because (I) is neither a parent or child of (E), nor another
parent of (E)’s child, (S). In this system, nodes (I) and (E) are
conditionally independent of each other, under the condition of
knowing the Markov blanket nodes (A) and (S). Conditioned on
the Markov blanket, i.e., sensory states (S) and active states (A),
the prior beliefs activated in internal states do not provide any
additional information about the external state, (E), due to the
conditional independence between nodes (I) and (E), as follows,
p(I ∩E|b) = p
(
I|b
)
p
(
E|b
)
wherein b refers to Markov
blanket nodes (S)and (A)
Due to the conditional independence between nodes (I) and
(E), the active inference engine and its external states are in a
weakly coupled (conditionally independent) state, giving rise to
the apparent duality between subject (the observer) and object
(the observed), because knowing the former does not provide
any information about the latter, and vice versa.
A dyadic active inference model in a
strongly coupled state
We need a dyadic model of two agents that are strongly
coupled to model intersubjectivity that arises from subject-
subject interactions. Just like ice and water are two phases of
the same H2O molecules that behave distinctly (solid and liquid,
respectively), the same active inference engine can behave very
diﬀerently between the phases of weakly coupled and strongly
coupled states—while an active inference engine maintains
conditional independence between its internal and external
states in a weakly coupled state, such conditional independence
is diminished in a strongly coupled state, when its external states
are no longer a unitary node (E), but rather another active
inference engine, such that one engine’s active states (A) serve as
a parent of the other engine’s sensory states (S), and vice versa.
In the most strongly coupled state, one person’s active states
will become total environmental inputs for the other person’s
sensory states, and vice versa.
Assuming this strongly coupled state in parent-child
relationship, we have published a dyadic model to account for
the inverse relationship between stress and intersubjectivity (Ho
et al., 2020), wherein we studied how parental intersubjectivity
is embodied and enacted in the brain. In this dyadic active
inference model, when two active engines (two persons, say
mother as Person 1 and child as Person 2) are strongly coupled,
such that mother’s active state (A M) causes child’s sensory
state (SC) and child’s active state (AC) causes mother’s sensory
state (S M), one’s A and S become progressively similar to the
other’s (A) and (S), respectively, over time, and prior beliefs in
their internal states (Is) are hence attuned. Under such strong
coupling, the two persons are actively inferring the other’s
intentions in their prior beliefs hidden behind the sensory
and active states and the variational free energy in the dyad
is yoked as well. Thus, the strong coupling state mandates
that one person’s prior beliefs about the other’s prior beliefs
cannot reach the minimal variational free energy unless the
other’s prior beliefs of the one’s prior beliefs also reach the
minimal variational free energy—In other words, a higher level
of intersubjectivity is attained if and only if the variational free
energy in this strongly coupled state is minimized collectively.
See Figure 2.
The root of the impairment of
intersubjectivity
The dyadic model of intersubjectivity that we proposed
can explain why a child naturally wants to be mirrored and
loved by the parent and will feel abandoned by an insensitive
parent who neglects or dismisses this natural desire. Indeed, the
relational benevolence—love and warmth for another person’s

Active inference model in a strongly coupled state: When two
persons (mother as Person 1 and child as Person 2) are strongly
coupled, one person’s active states become the total
environmental inputs for the other person’s sensory states, and
vice versa. In this dyadic model, the strong coupling between
the two persons is formed when their nodes (As) and (Ss) are
coupled, wherein (A1) causes (S2) and (A2) causes (S1). Due to
the strong coupling, the variational free energy in Persons 1 and
2 are also coupled and thus the prior beliefs in their internal
states (I1 and I2) are optimized collectively. The two large,
dashed circles indicate that there are no longer any unitary
nodes (E) in the dyadic model, as the external states are now
served by the multi-level network of the other person’s active
inference engine.
sake—in dyadic interactions has begun to be recognized to play
a critical role in wellbeing (Maté, 2012). Unfortunately, not all
parents are equal in their capacity of relational benevolence and
intersubjectivity.
But how come one can hold on to an invalid prior belief for
so long, despite the excessive stress that renders his or her life
miserable?
Evidently, it is possible for humans to hold on to
an outdated, invalid (mis)belief to the extent of becoming
pathological, which is equivalent to keeping an overweighted
prior in one’s active inference engine (Carhart-Harris and
Friston, 2019). If a person fails to update or replace an outdated
invalid belief, it may result in excessive variational free energy,
and hence excessive stress (Peters et al., 2017; Goekoop and de
Kleijn, 2021).
The misery of obsessively holding on to an invalid
prior belief may be impossible for artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
programs—which can be considered as non-human inference
engines (Friston et al., 2022)—because AI programs’ prior
can be updated or replaced anew millions of times a day,
without any stress or misery, such that they perform superbly,
sometimes even outperform human champions, without any
human assistance in games like chess, shougi, or go (Silver et al.,
2017a,b).
We have postulated, in contrast to the AI programs, people
suﬀer needlessly when they have invalid beliefs that do not
reﬂect the reality, because invalid beliefs can cause human active
inference engines to malfunction (Ho and Nakamura, 2017; Ho
et al., 2021). The rehabilitation of impaired intersubjectivity
is central to Indo-Tibetan Buddhist practices (Wallace, 2001).
Informed by the central doctrines of Buddhism (Tenzin Gyatso,
1997, 2009), we speciﬁcally postulated (Ho et al., 2021) that
the invalid beliefs that can cause the malfunctioning of active
inference engines are called conceptual thoughts ( Vikalpas
in Sanskrit) that are laden with a non-relational view that
there is a constant unchanging entity that is not changed by
interactions and that an entity’s ultimate nature is identical to
something observable (i.e., realism); and these invalid beliefs can
be proliferated and embodied through processes called mental
fabrication or superimposition (Prapañca in Sanskrit; Asanga,
2016).
In other words, we postulated that when a normal active
inference engine is inﬂicted with non-relational prior beliefs
(Vikalpas) in its internal states, which are invalid because they
do not reﬂect the reality that all phenomena are products of
subject-by-object interactions, the process of mental fabrication
(Prapañca) will impair the active inference engine by holding
on to invalid beliefs in the internal states, node (I), despite its
failure to minimize variational free energy. We will discuss these
Buddhist notions in the context of relational worldview to be
presented later.
In accordance with our postulation, we have theorized
a dyadic model to explain the inverse relationship between
parenting stress and maternal intersubjectivity and identiﬁed
key brain regions that may mediate this relationship using a
pre- and post-test design with the evidence-based “Mom Power”
parenting intervention (Ho et al., 2020). In that report, we
have identiﬁed three inter-related relational issues that may be
addressed by dyadic interventions to reduce stress in dyadic
interactions, namely, the problems of (1) deﬁcient relational
benevolence due to invalid beliefs, (2) under-coupling, and (3)
over-mentalizing, as follows:

1. Deﬁcient relational benevolence: Invalid beliefs prevents
the awareness of relational benevolence, e.g., maternal
empathic love and warmth toward the child’s internal
states in the current context. When two persons (e.g.,
mother and child) are strongly coupled ( Amother ≈Schild
and Achild ≈Smother), the variational free energy are
minimized collectively if, and only if , the prediction
error in one person is minimized without increasing the
other’s. Therefore, mother can achieve intersubjectivity
by minimizing her variational free energy through
communicative interactions with child, wherein mother’s
prior belief would approximate child’s prior beliefs
(Imo ther ≈Ichild). We have postulated that invalid beliefs
(Vikalpas) will obscure the awareness of interdependence,
and hence may diminish the awareness of relational
benevolence and of the prior beliefs of each person’s active
inference engine (Ho et al., 2021).
2. Problem of under-coupling: Under-coupling increases
variational free energy. As depicted in Figure 3 , when
Person 1 engages Person 2’s overt behaviors only, Person
1 may reduce Person 2, who serves as Person 1’s external
states, to a unitary object without its own inner states such
as feelings and prior beliefs. Thus Person 1 would fail to
achieve intersubjectivity and ﬁnd it diﬃcult to reduce stress
in either party. For example, when mother neglects to see
that her harsh reactions cause the child to feel negatively
and only focuses on how to change child’s behaviors,
mother would fail to recognize child’s attempts to reduce
child’s own variational free energy and therefore mother’s
variational free energy during dyadic interactions would
increase. Being ignored or rejected, child’s stress (excessive
variational free energy) would increase, which would, in
return, increase mother’s stress.
3. Problem of over-mentalizing : Over-mentalizing can
perpetuate impairments of intersubjectivity and exacerbate
dyadic stress. When there is a disagreement or conﬂict
between two persons, dyadic stress may increase if person
1 becomes defensive against person 2, as if person 2
were an enemy, and therefore misattributing person 2’s
disagreeing behaviors to malice or character ﬂaw, i.e., over-
mentalizing. For example, mother may over-mentalize
child’s behaviors as “he does not respect me.” When
mother’s over-mentalizing explains away child’s actual
prior belief, she will not even recognize her own ignorance
of child’s feelings and prior beliefs. Thus, when stress
potentiates mother’s over-mentalizing, child’s disagreeing
behaviors would only conﬁrm mother’s preconceived
existing biases against child, perpetuating the impairment
of intersubjectivity in a vicious cycle. As described later,
conceptual thoughts are responsible for the problem of
over-mentalizing. As depicted in Figure 3, Imaginary E 1
(in a dashed circle) denotes Person 1’s conceptual thoughts
that may result in Person 1’s over-mentalization of Person
FIGURE 3
Under-coupling and over-mentalizing problems ensue in a
dyadic system when Person 1 discards Person 2’s active
inference engine and instead reduces Person 2 to an imaginary
concept, namely Imaginary E1, as if it were a node E in a weakly
coupled state, as denoted in the dashed circle in the center.
Such imaginary E1 is therefore responsible for Person 1’s
over-mentalization of Person 2. The dashed curve between
Person 1 and Person 2 indicates the under-coupling, when
Person 1 tends to ignore Person 2’s attempts to minimize
variational free energy and instead treat Person 2 as an object in
Person 1’s conceptual thoughts. The dashed arrows to and from
Imaginary E1 indicate the lack of actual generative processes to
minimize variational free energy in this pathological state.
2. The dashed curve between Person 1 and Person 2
indicates the under-coupling, when Person 1 tends to
ignore Person 2’s attempts to minimize variational free
energy and instead treat Person 2 as an imaginary object in
Person 1’s conceptual thoughts. The dashed arrows to and
from Imaginary E 1 indicate the lack of actual generative
processes to minimize variational free energy in this
pathological state.
A brain model for intersubjectivity
as a therapeutic target of
parenting intervention
There is now preliminary neuroimaging support for
brain networks that may mediate the eﬀects of a parenting
intervention on maternal intersubjectivity (Ho et al., 2021). In
this study, we assigned mothers to “Mom Power” intervention
or a control condition and all of them underwent a child face

mirroring task (CFMT), at pre-treatment and post-treatment
(Ho et al., 2020). The CFMT was designed to elicit maternal
intersubjectivity-dependent responses to their own children
or unknown other’s children by asking the participants to
imitate children’s emotional facial expressions or a control
condition (simply observe without imitating), because voluntary
imitation of others’ facial expressions is key to the development
of intersubjectivity (Meltzoﬀ and Moore, 1977). The results
showed that the within-subject changes in parenting stress
were positively associated with the concurrent changes in the
diﬀerential responses during prediction error-related (positive
vs. negative valence) contrast in the imitating (mirroring) own
child’s faces vs. its control condition in the periaqueductal
gray (PAG), a subcortical region related to ﬁght-or-ﬂight
defensive motivation, and, conversely, negatively associated
with those in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc),
two subcortical regions related to social reward motivation.
Moreover, the within-subject changes in parenting stress were
positively associated with the functional connectivity between
the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and PAG, and,
conversely, negatively associated with concurrent changes in
the functional connectivity between dmPFC and NAc, during
the imitating (mirroring) own child’s faces vs. its control
condition. Connectivity with the dmPFC may be interpreted
in relation to at least two functions: (1) social mirroring
behaviors and (2) representing the signiﬁcant other (Ho and
Nakamura, 2017). The parenting intervention eﬀects on stress
reduction were partially mediated by diﬀerential changes in
subcortical functional connectivity in maternal brain regions of
NAc and PAG, which have also, respectively, been associated
with maternal care vs. defense, respectively, (Numan, 2007;
Swain et al., 2018). Notably, brain regions underlying surprise
or deviation from expectation largely overlap with these
subcortical motivational neurocircuits, including the amygdala,
NAc, and PAG (Swain and Ho, 2017). Additionally, this model
has been important in the interpretation of the diﬀerential
eﬀects of opioids on the maternal brain, which include disrupted
connectivity between NAc and PAG (Swain and Ho, 2021).
The provisional success in identifying a brain model to
support the dyadic active inference model encouraged us to
conduct the following theory-guided analysis of published
intervention studies.
A theory-guided quantitative
analysis of parenting intervention
studies in the literature
When the rose is gone and the garden faded
you will no longer hear the nightingale’s song.
The Beloved is all; the lover just a veil.
The Beloved is living; the lover a dead thing.
If love withholds its strengthening care,
the lover is left like a bird without care,
the lover is left like a bird without wings.
How will I be awake and aware
if the light of the Beloved is absent?
Love wills that this Word be brought forth.
Jalaluddin Rumi (Mathnawi I, 23ñ31)
Using Rumi’s poem as a metaphor, when primary caregivers
are somehow laden with the problems of deﬁcient relational
benevolence, under-coupling, or over-mentalizing , the “garden”
in which a child can thrive is faded, and the child is
like a bird without wings. As described above, we postulate
that parenting stress will mostly result from dysfunction of
interaction processes associated with the three relational issues
that we deduced based on the dyadic active inference model of
intersubjectivity.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that a parenting intervention
should eﬀectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is
designed to address these three issues by promoting relational
benevolence and by training the skills to mitigate the under-
coupling and over-mentalizing problems in parents. To test
this hypothesis, we conducted a theory-guided quantitative
analysis of recently published studies of parenting intervention
by developing a coding system to parse parenting interventions
published between year 2016 and 2020 and examined whether
results based on the coding were associated with the eﬀects of
parenting interventions, as compared to a control or baseline
condition, on PSI, one of the most common measures of
parenting stress (Abidin, 1995).
Methods of the theory-guided
quantitative analysis
We used PubMed database to search for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) reported in English in the last 5 years
prior to January 14, 2021, using the following keywords:
“Parenting intervention, ” “RCT” or “randomized controlled
trial, ” and “PSI.” We found 52 studies that met inclusion criteria
and screened out 17 of them due to the following reasons:
(1) the lack of PSI total score as an outcome variable, (2)
the absence of comparisons between a intervention condition
and a control/baseline condition, or (3) the presence of a
medical condition, e.g., traumatic brain injury in the child,
that may originate from and/or result in complications in
the social environments beyond the parent-child dyads. The
list of the ﬁnal 35 studies reviewed and the coding results
for each study are presented in Table 1. These studies were

Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
coded by two authors SSH and MG (hereafter Raters 1
and 2, respectively) independently, according to the following
binary coding scheme.
1. To meet Component 1 (promotion of relational
benevolence through enhancing awareness of the child’s
internal states and the importance of love and warmth
in dyadic interactions), a treatment (Tx) should have
ALL of the following: 1. Speciﬁc own child in question;
2. Education on child’s social developmental needs,
including the development of secure attachment in the
child’s prior beliefs, which are only made possible through
dyadic interactions; and 3. Emphasize the importance
of the caregiver’s positive stance, e.g., warmth, love,
sensitivity, etc.
2. To meet Component 2 (intervention to reduce under-
coupling), a Tx should have ALL of the following: 1. Asking
the parent to realistically observe the child’s behaviors, with
suﬃcient consistency with what another observer would
agree, i.e., valid observation; 2. Education of behavioral
techniques contingent on actual feedback from the child’s
response during parent-child interactions.
3. To meet Component 3 (intervention to reduce over-
mentalizing), a Tx should have ALL of the following: 1.
Skill training on how to observe one’s thoughts and feelings
with non-judgmental stance, without necessarily reacting
to thoughts and feelings, e.g., mindfulness; 2. Education on
how one’s moods and beliefs may negatively inﬂuence one’s
projection/mentalizing of others and may increase distress
tolerance when parents are in negative moods, e.g., feeling
frustration.
The Components 1ñ3 in the coding scheme corresponded
to the three components of the dyadic active inference model,
which we developed and presented above to address the
problems of (1) deﬁcient relational benevolence, (2) under-
coupling, and (3) over-mentalizing , respectively. Notably, the
major distinction between Component 1 and other Components
is that Component 1 serves as a mindset, a frame centered in the
dyad, not a single person, with an emphasis on unconditional
positive regards, e.g., love and warmth, of the relation, while
Components 2 and 3 are more speciﬁcally contingent upon
speciﬁc situations and skill oriented. The major distinction
between Components 2 and 3 is that Component 2 should
be focused on child-oriented observations with a data-driven
approach, not inward observations of parents’ internal working
model of the child. Conversely, Component 3 should be focused
on parental inward-observations of parental thoughts and
emotions when they are used to mentalize the child.
The outcome variable, the Tx eﬀect on PSI, was coded
according to the following rule: If there was a statistical
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in PSI (total score) between the
intervention (Tx) and Control groups, as a signiﬁcant Group
main eﬀect or a Time-by-Group interaction eﬀect, or a within-
subject diﬀerence from a baseline, such that the PSI total score
was lower in the Tx than the control condition, then the Tx
eﬀects of PSI was coded as “1” (positive eﬀect), otherwise as “0”
(negative eﬀect).
Results of the theory-guided
quantitative analysis
Inter-rater reliability
The coding of Components 1ñ3 showed superb inter-
rater reliability between the two raters. For Component 1,
Rater 1 coded 23 studies as “1” and 12 studies as “0.” The
two raters’ coding were identical for all 35 studies, except
one study (#20), which Rater 1 and 2 coded as “0” and
“1, ” respectively. The inter-rater reliability for Component 1
was very high (measurement of agreement kappa = 0.935,
asymptotic standard error = 0.064, approximate T = 5.545,
with approximate signiﬁcance, p <0.001). For Component 2,
Rater 1 coded 26 studies as “1” and 9 studies as “0.” The two
raters’ coding were identical for all 35 studies, except one study
(#20), which Rater 1 and 2 coded as “0” and “1, ” respectively.
The inter-rater reliability for Component 2 was very high
(measurement of agreement kappa = 0.922, asymptotic standard
error = 0.076, approximate T = 5.473, with approximate
signiﬁcance, p < 0.001). For Component 3, both Rater 1 and
2 coded 23 studies as “1” and 12 studies as “0.” The two raters’
coding were identical for all 35 studies. The inter-rater reliability
for Component 3 was perfect (measurement of agreement
kappa = 1.00, asymptotic standard error = 0.00, approximate
T = 5.916, with approximate signiﬁcance, p = 0.000). The
inter-rater reliabilities for all Components were high, providing
evidence for the reliability of coding of three Components for
35 studies. The two raters discussed the diﬀerences in coding
and reached ﬁnal agreements to use Rater 1’s coding in the
following analyses.
Associations between the coding of Tx effects
on parenting stress index and components 1–3
The non-parametric correlations (Kendall’s Tau-B and
p-values) between the variables (the coding of intervention
eﬀects on PSI and Components 1ñ3) are summarized in
Table 2 . These results suggested that all three Components
were signiﬁcantly correlated with the intervention (Tx) eﬀects
on PSI total; Components 1 and 2 were highly correlated
with each other; and Component 3 were not correlated
with other Components, thus relatively distinct from either
Component 1 or 2.
The associations between each of the three Components
and the coding of the outcome variable were independently
tested using the directional association test, Sommer’s d.
The results showed that each of the three Components
can predict the Tx eﬀect on PSI: For Component 1,

the directional association, treating Component 1 as

For Component 2, the directional association, treating

For Component 3, the directional association, treating

The cross tabulations of the outcome variable (Tx eﬀect
on PSI) and each of the Components are summarized
in Table 3 . The inclusion of each Component in a
particular intervention was found to be associated with
the reduction of parenting stress. This supports the
importance of each Component in interventions for
parenting stress.
Additionally, to test the additive eﬀects of Components
1, 2, and 3 on the outcome variable (Tx eﬀect on PSI), we
computed the sum of coding for each study (which yields
a possible total value of 0, 1, 2, or 3). The directional
association, treating the sum of coding as independent
variable and PSI as dependent variable, was signiﬁcant
(Sommer’s d = 0.591, standard error = 0.064, T = 7.698,
p < 0.001). The cross tabulations of the outcome variable
(positive or negative Tx eﬀect on PSI) and the sum of
coding are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 4 . The
more Components the interventions had, the more likely
parenting stress was attenuated in the reviewed studies. This
supports the importance of including all three Components
to maximize potential eﬃcacy of the interventions for
parenting stress.

Relative contributions of three components to
the Tx effects on parenting stress index
To explore relative contributions of three Components to
the Tx eﬀects on PSI, we examined the variance of the outcome
variable (Tx eﬀect on PSI) explained by the three Components,
by performing logistic regression tests with diﬀerent methods,
namely enter, forward, and backward. In the enter model, all
three Components were entered simultaneously as predictors,
and they totally explained 79.8% of the total variance of the
Tx eﬀect on PSI, with 75% accuracy in predicting negative Tx
eﬀects (9 out of 12) and 95.7% accuracy predicting positive
Tx eﬀects (22 out of 23). In the forward model, Component 3
was selected to be the ﬁrst single predictor that predicted the
outcome the most, which explained 44.8% of the total variance,
and subsequently Component 1 was added to the model, which
additionally explained another 32.0% of the total variance,
resulting in 76.8% of variance explained by Components 1 and
3. In the backward model, all three Components were initially
included and subsequently Component 2 was removed from the
model as its removal only reduced the total variance explained
from 79.8 to 76.8%. Taken together, Components 1 and 3 were
two relatively distinct predictors that explained 44.8 and 32%
variances of the Tx eﬀect on PSI, respectively, while Component
2 showed little added value in explaining the variance, which
perhaps was due to its collinearity with Component 1. Together
with correlation data presented in Table 2, these analyses based
on logistic regression support the particular importance of
Components 1 and 3 for developing eﬀective parenting stress
interventions in the future.
Summary of the theory-guided quantitative
analysis
The theory-guided quantitative analysis of clinical studies
of parenting interventions demonstrated the following points:
(1) Evaluating parenting interventions on the basis of the three
identiﬁed components motivated by the dyadic active inference
model turned out to be useful and yielded consistent results
in gaging the success or the failure of parenting interventions,
and (2) the review’s ﬁndings seem to suggest the importance
of including three identiﬁed therapeutic components to be
implemented in the development of parenting interventions.
Integrating our work with the
literature on mother-infant dyadic
interactions
To relate our work to the literature of developmental
psychology succinctly, here we integrate the work that we
presented above with the dyadic concepts that were identiﬁed
in a systematic review of 82 unique studies on mother-infant
dyadic processes, namely, Mutuality, Reciprocity, Attunement,
Contingency, Coordination, Matching, Mirroring, Reparation,
and Synchrony (Provenzi et al., 2018). While the authors of
Provenzi et al. (2018) provided a theoretical description of
the relationships among these dyadic concepts, they did not
explicitly describe a formal model of a dyad in a strongly
coupled state. We believe our work can complement the work
of Provenzi et al. (2018), as discussed below.
In Table 5, Provenzi et al.’s theoretical deﬁnitions of the
concepts of dyadic processes are listed in the second column; the
relevance of these concepts to our dyadic model is described in
the third column; the intervention components in our coding
system that are likely to be involved in each of these dyadic
concepts are listed in the fourth column.
The ﬁrst two of the nine dyadic concepts identiﬁed in
Provenzi et al. (2018) are Mutuality and Reciprocity, which
are seen as overarching concepts underlying dyadic processes.
In terms of our dyadic model, we consider Mutuality—
mutual contribution of the interactive partners—as a concept
to emphasize the strongly coupled state, as opposed to a weakly
coupled state, between two persons. We consider Reciprocity—
reciprocal inﬂuence between interactive partners—as a concept
to emphasize the bi-directional cause and eﬀect of the (A), (S),
and (I) nodes of the dyadic active inference engine. Further,
Provenzi et al. (2018) described two dynamic cycles emerging
from their computer-aided text analysis, quoted in paragraphs
below. ∗∗
“First, the ability to share intentions (i.e., attunement)—
rather than simple behaviors or actions within the dyad—
emerged as a more complex mutual engagement between
the mother and the infant which is built upon low-level
contingent engagement (i.e., contingency and coordination).
From this perspective, mirroring should be considered as
a speciﬁc way of being together, which might only appear

Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
when the mother is able to understand the behavioral and
inner states of the infant in order to provide an exaggerated
version of the observed and inferred infants’ socio-emotional
state. When eﬀective mirroring occurs, greater levels of
contingency might be reached by the dyad, so that mother
and infant constitute a dynamic system characterized by
a behavioral-psychological self-organized and homeostatic
cycle”(Provenzi et al., 2018).
Apparently, the above description of the ﬁrst cycle—
which involves attunement, contingency, coordination, and
mirroring—is compatible with our description of the dyadic
active inference engines that are strongly coupled—that is, by
virtue of the coupling between the two engines’ nodes (As) and
(Ss) at the lower level, which result in the mirroring of the two
agents, the attunement between the two engines’ (I) nodes are
achieved at the higher level.
“Second, a second cycle of matched and un-matched
behavioral states within the dyad appeared to be regulated
by dyadic reparation. Repeated matching emerged as the
pre-condition for synchrony, which, in turn, contributed to
heightened matching states. In other words, repeated in-
moment matching states contribute to lagged moment-by-
moment synchrony in time, so that reiterated interactive
exchanges between mothers and infants grow in complexity
in a reciprocal way” (Provenzi et al., 2018).
Similarly, the above description of the second cycle—
matching and the reparation of an unmatched state—is
consistent with the process of perceptual and active inferences
to update the prior beliefs such that the variational and expected
free energy can be minimized eventually.
“In sum,. coordination (of behaviors) and attunement (of
intentions) might be considered as two critical nodes which
allow the mother-infant dyad to move from behavioral forms
of involvement (i.e., contingency, matching) to more complex
psychological and inner-state forms of dyadic engagement
(i.e., attunement, synchrony)”(Provenzi et al., 2018).
In sum, the above description of coordination at the
behavioral level and attunement at the intentional level is
consistent with the two levels of an active inference engine,
the behavioral coupling between the dyad’s nodes (As) and
(Ss) in the lower level and the approximation of the dyad’s
prior beliefs in nodes (Is) in the higher level, respectively, (see
Figure 1).
In the fourth column of Table 5 , we list the dyadic
concepts’ relevance to the coding system of the interventions
that we presented above. The intervention Components
1 and 2 aim to rehabilitate or promote the functioning
that is largely relevant to the higher level, node (I), and
lower level, nodes (A) and (S) of the active inference
engines in a strongly coupled state, and both Components
are similar to the concepts involved in the attunement of
intentions and coordination of behaviors in Provenzi et al’s
terms, respectively. However, none of the dyadic concepts
identiﬁed in Provenzi et al. (2018) would seem relevant to
Component 3 (intervention to reduce over-mentalizing)
in our coding system. This is because Component 3 is
not within the scope of the work undertaken by Provenzi
et al. (2018) and, rather, it is by and large a therapeutic
inner work on one’s awareness of self and other’s inner
thoughts, feelings, and intentions to rectify the problem
of over-mentalizing. To dig deeper in this issue, in the
following sections, we turn to Buddhist Philosophy of
Mind (which is synonymous to awareness in the present
context) to discuss the relational worldview that may
help explain the root cause of invalid beliefs, its resulting
excessive dyadic stress and unnecessary suﬀering, and
the innate capacity of awareness to be free from invalid
beliefs and suﬀering.
In short, by proposing the causal relationship among
deﬁcient relational benevolence due to invalid beliefs,
under-coupling, and over-mentalizing that would result
in excessive stress and impaired intersubjectivity, we
believe that our work complemented Provenzi et al.’s
comprehensive review work by addressing the following
issues: (a) how dyadic interactions can inﬂuence maternal
wellbeing, which is acknowledged by Provenzi et al. (2018)
as lacking in the current literature, (b) how the dyadic active
inference model and hence the quality of dyadic interactions
can be compromised, and (c) how to most eﬀectively
intervene therapeutically to counteract with compromised
intersubjectivity, which is corroborated in our theory-guided
quantitative analysis of the literature on parenting interventions
and parenting stress.
Understanding intersubjectivity
and active inference in a relational
worldview
While we have postulated that the hallmark of quality
dyadic processes is intersubjectivity, how is intersubjectivity—
the awareness of self and others—even possible in the
ﬁrst place? The answer depend on the “worldviews”—
ontological and epistemological assumptions implicitly
or explicitly used to understand any phenomena in this
world—that are brought into the studies of awareness
(mind) and/or metaphysics (mind-body relation; Avramides,
2020). While a worldview may not be easily falsiﬁable,
not all worldviews garner scientiﬁc evidence equally. To
make any science fruitful, the worldview that a scientiﬁc
community adopts should be as consistent with the
most fundamental nature of reality as possible. In this

Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
section, we discuss how a relational worldview supported
by Physics and Buddhist Philosophy can enrich our
understanding of the nature of active inference, awareness, and
intersubjectivity.
Toward an abstract expression of
relational worldview according to
physics and Buddhist Philosophy
As already described in the beginning, living organisms
are impermanently, inter-dependently self-organizing
through ceaseless interactions with their environments.
It is emphasized in FEP that living organisms as active
inference engines are self-evidencing in its environments
by using their own actions to solicit their sensory inputs
from the world. In a way, active inference is consistent
with the notion of participatory universe —the outcome of
measuring a quantum system depends on the apparatus
chosen to perform the act of measuring—coined by
John A. Wheeler, one of the greatest Physicists and
Philosophers in our time.
Most physicists would agree that, ontologically, the universe
is fundamentally relational, and, epistemologically, to be
observable is to be interactable in physics (Rovelli, 2021).
In the standard model of physics, fundamental particles
are nothing but products of interactions of even more
fundamental quantum ﬁelds (Peskin and Schroeder, 1995).
The relational nature of the participatory universe has been
rigorously demonstrated many times in a family of so-called
delayed-choice experiments . This kind of experiments aims
to demonstrate the dual nature of a quantum system, e.g.,
a single photon that can behave either like a particle or
like a wave. In this kind of experiments, whether a single
photon behaves particle-like or wave-like depends on whether
a particle detector or wave detector is chosen to measure
the photon’s behavior. Because the act of choosing either
one of the detectors to observe the single photon occurred
after the very photon has completed its behavior, this kind
of experiments are thus called “delayed-choice.” After decades
of rigorous delayed-choice experiments, most physicists would
agree that:
“...no elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a
registered phenomenon...some registered phenomena do not
have a meaning unless they are put in relationship with other
registered phenomena” (Ma et al., 2016).
The notion of participatory universe suggests that all
information is relationally dependent upon the existence
of observations or observers whereas the existence of
observations or observers is relationally dependent upon
the ingredients of the universe. The observer here may be
a living system, which is modeled as an active inference
engine, or simply a quantum-system measuring apparatus
that solicits and thus co-creates the outcomes of observing
an incoming event.
To summarize the relational worldview underlying active
inference and participatory universe, we resort to the notion of
“Dependent Origination” that can be abstractly expressed in the
following equation:
Eﬀect = Cause ×Condition (1)
Colloquially, Eq. 1 should read “Eﬀect is an interactive product
of Cause by Condition.”
Both Cause and Condition are factors participating in an
interaction that produces Eﬀect. Among these factors, some
are called “Cause, ” if they maintain certain systemic continuity
with the “Eﬀect”; others are called “Condition, ” if they lack
apparent systemic continuity in relation to either Cause or
Eﬀect. The term systemic continuity is used here to refer to the
relation between Cause and Eﬀect—that they are continuous but
successive phenotypes of the same system.
For example, fruit is an interactive product of its seed
and other factors such as soil, bacteria, water, sunlight,
farmer, etc. In this case, the fruit is Eﬀect, the seed is
Cause, and other factors are Conditions. There is systemic
continuity between the seed (Cause) and fruit (Eﬀect) because
the seed and fruit belong to the same system deﬁned by
the same genes that they carry (systemic), but they never
co-exist simultaneously in the temporal succession of seed
and fruit (continuity). In contrast, while the other factors
(soil, bacteria, water, sunlight, farmer, etc.) are necessary
to produce the fruit, they are designated as Conditions
because they lack the systemic continuity with either the
seed or the fruit.
The interactive product, designated by the sign “×” in Eq. 1,
renders Eq. 1 as a non-linear formula. Mathematically, the non-
linearity mandates that Eﬀect is neither a linear transformation
of Cause, nor Condition, nor a linear combination thereof.
Interestingly, Eq. 1 can serve as a mathematical expression of
the ultimate nature of reality, namely “Emptiness, ” that has been
established by Arya Nagarjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka
School of Buddhist Philosophy, in the following reasoning:
“Neither from itself,
Nor from another,
Nor from both,
Nor without a cause,
Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.” (Nagarjuna, 1995)
Ch. 1 V. 1
Arya Nagarjuna’s reasoning on Emptiness can be translated
in terms of Eq. 1, as follows:
“Neither from self ” means that the Eﬀect is not a linear
transformation of its Cause—, e.g., although the fruit and seed
carry the same genes, the fruit is not identical to the seed or a
scaled-up version of the seed.
Frontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org
fpsyg-13-806755 July 25, 2022 Time: 17:37 # 16
Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
“Nor from other” means that the Eﬀect is not a linear
transformation of its Condition—, e.g., the fruit is not identical
to soil, bacteria, water, sunlight, farmer, etc., that do not even
share the same genes with the fruit.
“Nor from both” means that the Eﬀect is not a linear
combination of the Cause and Condition—, e.g., the fruit is not
just the sum of the seed, soil, bacteria, water, sunlight, farmer,
etc. that do not have any interactions among them.
“Nor without a cause” means that the Eﬀect is not something
other than an interactive product of Cause by Condition—,
e.g., the fruit does not come to exist without being the eﬀect
of the interactions among the seed, soil, bacteria, water, and
other conditions.
“Does anything whatever, anywhere arise” means that
nothing can be observed without following the ultimate nature
of the participatory universe.
In short, Eq. 1 is not only an abstract expression of
“Dependent Origination, ” but also an axiomatic translation
of Arya Nagarjuna’s reasoning on “Emptiness.” The resulting
functional equivalence between “Emptiness” and “Dependent
Origination” is eloquently reﬂected in the pith of Buddhist
wisdom, as Je Tsongkhapa (1357ñ1419) stated in his masterpiece
“In Praise of Dependent Origination” (Lobsang Gyatso and
Woodhouse, 2011) that:
“When one sees Emptiness in terms of the meaning of
dependent origination, then being devoid of intrinsic existence
and possessing valid functions do not contradict.”
—Je Tsongkhapa, translated by Geshe Thupten Jinpa.
The consistency between the Buddhist wisdom and John
A. Wheeler’s notion of participatory universe becomes evident
when we summarize experimental evidence demonstrated in
those delayed-choice experiments (Ma et al., 2016) as a special
case of Eq. 1, that Eﬀect of measuring a quantum system
(e.g., a single photon) is an interactive product of Cause by
Condition—wherein Cause is the to-be-measured single photon
and Condition is the apparatus used to detect the photon’s
particle-like or wave-like behavior. When Conditions favor the
single photon’s wave-like or particle-like behavior, the photon
will appear to behave like a wave or a particle, respectively, after
it interacts with Conditions.
Altogether, the relational worldview in the current context
speciﬁcally refers to the notion that Eﬀect is as an interactive
product of Cause by Condition, which can be equivalent to the
notions of Dependent Origination and the ultimate nature of
reality, Emptiness, in Buddhist Philosophy as well as the notion
of Participatory Universe in Physics.
In the following sections, we will use similar abstract
expressions to describe how intersubjectivity and active
inference framework can be understood as additional special
cases of this relational worldview.
Understanding intersubjectivity in the
relational worldview
The acid test of every epistemology is, when all is said and
done, the intersubjective relationship.
(Fuchs, 2017, p. 27)
Intersubjectivity—the awareness of self and other’s
intentions and feelings—is relational, because the eﬀect of
awareness in intersubjectivity depends on the interactive
coupling between the participants. Here we apply the abstract
expression of Dependent Origination to the nature of awareness
and intersubjectivity.
According to the Buddhist science of mind, the nature of
awareness is fundamentally relational, described as follows:
“The nature of cognition is stated to be awareness, and
the nature of consciousness is said to be clear (or luminous)
and aware. ‘Clear’ here expresses the essential nature of
consciousness, and ‘aware’ expresses its function. ‘Clear’ also
indicates: (1) that consciousness is beyond the nature of matter,
which is characterized as tangible and obstructive, so it is clear
in nature; (2) that just as reﬂections appear in a mirror, any
internal or external object whatsoever—good or bad, pleasant
or unpleasant—can appear in consciousness, so consciousness is
luminous in that it illuminates objects; and (3) that the essential
nature of consciousness is not contaminated by the stains of
mental aﬄictions such as attachment, so its nature is clear or
luminous.” (Tenzin Gyatso, 2020, p. 41).
The relational nature of the awareness is often likened to a
clear lampshade or mirror metaphorically, as discussed in our
previous work (Ho et al., 2021). In the former, a clear lampshade
is colorless (clear) and any object that the mind perceives is like a
light bulb in the clear lampshade, which can color the lampshade
with its light, e.g., the lampshade’s color becomes blue when a
light bulb emits blue light. However, just as the light bulb can
never stain the lampshade, the object perceived by the mind can
never stain the mind. Thus, the mind (lampshade) returns to its
colorless clarity as soon as the object (light bulb) is turned oﬀ.
In the latter, awareness is also likened to a mirror, as it reﬂects
the object in front of the mirror, but the mirror is not the object
nor the image in the mirror. In other words, the image in the
mirror is an interactive product of the mirror and the object in
front of the mirror.
Here we describe the mirror-like nature of the awareness
in terms of the abstract expression of Dependent Origination.

TABLE 5 The relevance of present work to the literature of dyadic process as summarized in Provenzi et al. (2018).
Dyadic
concepts
The concepts’ deﬁnition provided
in Provenzi et al. (2018)
The concepts’ relevance to the
dyadic active inference model in
our work
The concepts’ relevance to the
coding system of interventions
Mutuality Mutual contribution of the interactive
partners, which might not be equal in terms of
frequency and intensity of the behaviors of the
two partners.
The necessity of using a dyadic model to
describe and understand person-person
interactions in a strongly coupled state.
Component 1 (promotion of symbiotic
benevolence)
Reciprocity Reciprocal inﬂuence between interactive
partners.
The interaction at the level of nodes S and A
between two partners at one moment will
produce an eﬀect on each person’s internal
model at the level of node M at the next
moment after the interaction.
Component 1 (promotion of symbiotic
benevolence)
Attunement Sharing of actions and intentions which
includes maternal identiﬁcation of infant’s
inner feelings/states and infant’s
comprehension that the mother is referring to
his own original state.
Attunement is very similar to intersubjectivity.
As the internal modal (node M) of one partner
is closely related to intentions that cause
actions (node A) and feelings (node S) of the
other partner subsequently causes internal
model (node M), attunement is achieved when
the mother’s M of infant is consistent with the
infant’s M of his or her own nodes S and A.
Component 1 (promotion of symbiotic
benevolence)
Contingency Reciprocal adjustment of trans-modal aﬀective
and behavioral signals within a
micro-temporal window that leads to infants’
learning and regulation skills and interactive
patterns.
Contingency reﬂects the operational working
of an active inference engine in which one’s
internal model is optimized. The learning
occurs after encountering surprisal and using
perceptual inferences to minimize variational
free energy. Skills are acquired after using
active inference to minimize expected free
energy.
Component 2 (intervention to reduce
under-coupling)
Coordination Bidirectional rhythmic exchanges
characterized by speciﬁc timing and turn
taking which facilitates the reciprocal
prediction of future behavioral states.
Coordination is similar to the contingency in a
strongly coupled state, wherein two persons
take turn to observe, mirror, and respond to
one another, creating rhythmic
time-contingent dynamic relationships.
Components 2 (intervention to reduce
under-coupling)
Matching Simultaneous exhibition of the same aﬀective
and/or behavioral state by the mother and the
infant.
Matching occurs in a strongly coupled state,
wherein one person’s node A causes the other’s
node S and vice versa. Because both persons’
behavioral states (node A ’s) are similar, their
aﬀective states (nodes S’s) are also similar.
Matching is like simultaneous mirroring that
may be more automatic or spontaneous than
intentional mirroring, below.
Components 2 (intervention to reduce
under-coupling)
Mirroring Exaggerated/marked reﬂection of trans-modal
child behaviors by the mother through
imitation of aﬀective quality reproduction in a
temporally contingent way.
Mirroring is a special form of matching when
matching may be more deliberately or
intentionally performed than simultaneous
matching. Mirroring can happen
bidirectionally.
Components 2 (intervention to reduce
under-coupling)
Reparation Dyadic process in which unmatched dyadic
states are transformed in matched dyadic
states producing an opportunity to learn
interactive strategies and to achieve better
stress and emotion regulation.
Reparation is the minimization of dyadic stress
by using the surprisal or prediction errors in a
dyadic interaction to update the internal
model(s) to minimize the surprisal in the next
interaction. Because stress is proportional to
the surprise, the reduction of surprise can
reduce stress.
Components 1 (promotion of symbiotic
benevolence) and 2 (intervention to
reduce under-coupling)
Synchrony Degree of congruence between trans-modal
behaviors of two partners which is lagged in
time and which promotes infants’ learning of
emotional regulation skills and the emergence
of expectations on interactive repertoires.
Synchrony indexed by any observable
indicators may reﬂect the degree of
intersubjectivity as conceptualized in our
dyadic model.
Components 1 (promotion of symbiotic
benevolence) and 2 (intervention to
reduce under-coupling)
For an object, A, let a subject’s awareness of A be “A-ness, ”
which is called the “qualia” of perceiving A. As Eﬀect is an
interactive product of Cause by Condition, “A-ness” is an
interactive product of subject (Cause) and objects (Conditions),
which include the object A and other environmental conditions,
e.g., the subject’s visual system and other physical environments.
Note that the subject, not the object A, is designated as Cause
because the qualia as Eﬀect is a subjective experience that has the
Frontiers in Psychology 17 frontiersin.org
fpsyg-13-806755 July 25, 2022 Time: 17:37 # 18
Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
systemic continuity with the subjectivity of the subject, whereas
the object A does not have such systemic continuity. Therefore,
in the realm of awareness, Eq. 1 can be re-expressed as follows:
Eﬀect[Qualia “A−ness"] = Cause[Subject]×Condition[Object A]
(2a)
Using the mirror metaphor of the mind, the qualia “A-ness”
is like the image in the mirror (Eﬀect), the subject’s mind is like
the mirror (Cause), and the object A is like an object placed in
front of a mirror (Condition).
In parallel, the object A should be changed after the
subject-object interaction too. There should be a counterpart to
Eﬀect[Qualia], which can be re-expressed as follows:
Eﬀect[Object A′] = Cause[Object A]×Condition[Subject] (2b)
wherein Eﬀect [ObjectA′] denotes the post-interaction object A,
with the object A as its Cause and the subjects of awareness and
environmental objects (e.g., the brain system and lights in the
room) as its Conditions. Due to the subject x object interaction,
such Eﬀect[ObjectA′]is eﬀectively infusing the object with certain
“mental energy” in a process called “cathexis.” We will further
discuss the concept of cathexis in the context of active inference
framework below.
As the Ubuntu proverb says, “I am because you are, ” there is
no independent subject “I” that can be designated without also
simultaneously designating the objects of “other” in relation to
the “I.” The intersubjective awareness is a relational awareness of
self and other. Trevarthen made a distinction between primary
and secondary intersubjectivity (Trevarthen and Aitken, 2001).
The former refers to “an infant’s active and immediately
responsive conscious appreciation of the adult’s communicative
intentions” and the latter refers to “the integration in the
new form of cooperative person-person-object awareness” that
combines object awareness (e.g., doing with things) and person
awareness (e.g., communicating with persons).
The primary intersubjectivity is considered innate and
mainly characterized by embodied, aﬀective, and intuitive
forms of relationships , preceding communications mediated
by symbolic and verbal processes (Trevarthen and Aitken,
2001). A key attribute underlying primary intersubjectivity is
spontaneous mimicry or voluntary imitation of others’ facial
expressions or manual gestures. Infants show spontaneous
facial mimicry soon after birth (Meltzoﬀ and Moore, 1977).
When primary intersubjectivity is successfully executed and
maintained, it leads to establishing the sense of safety and
assurance that everything is all right at that moment.
Secondary intersubjectivity, which emerges around
9 months of age, incorporates objects into the motherñ
infant interactions, forming a person-person-object triadic
relationship (Trevarthen and Hubley, 1978). Jointly attending
to an object of shared interest is seen as a critical step toward
a mutual incorporation of the other’s perspective into shared
experiences. The emergence of secondary intersubjectivity
points to a major developmental milestone where shared joint
activities between mother and infant can create a signiﬁcantly
more advanced level of interactive intersubjectivity that can
support the development of higher cognitive capacity for
language, reﬂection, and perspective-taking.
Here we focus on how to understand primary
intersubjectivity in terms of the abstract expression of the
relational worldview. Let Eqs 2a, 2b be applied to dyadic
processes wherein two subjects, Person 1 (P1) and Person 2
(P2), are strongly coupled in their person-person interactions.
For Person 1,
Eﬀect[“P1×P2−ness" in P1] = Cause[P1]×Condition[P1 ×P2]
(3a)
For Person 2,
Eﬀect[“P2×P1−ness" in P2] = Cause[P2]×Condition[P2×P1]
(3b)
The notations, Eﬀects, on the left side of the equations
are: Eﬀect [“P1 ×P2 −ness′′ in P1 ] denotes P1’s qualia about
P1 × P2 dyadic interactions, i.e., “P1 × P2-ness, ” and
Eﬀect[“P2 × P1 −ness′′in P2 ] denotes P2’s qualia about P2 ×P1
dyadic interactions, i.e., “P2 ×P1-ness.” The notations on
the right side of the equations are: Cause [P1] or Cause [P2]
denotes P1 or P2’s mirror-like awareness as the subjects;
Condition[P1 × P2 ] or Condition [P2 × P1 ] refers to the
conditions that interact with the mirror-like awareness, which
can be any objects or behaviors of the dyadic system, e.g., the
dyad’s brains, bodies, verbal or physical behaviors, during the
dyadic interactions.
As mentioned above, the Buddhist notion of mirror-like
awareness suggests that “the essential nature of consciousness
is not contaminated by the stains of mental aﬄictions
such as attachment, so its nature is clear or luminous.”
(Tenzin Gyatso, 2020, p. 41). Eqs 3a, 3b do not guarantee
that all qualia of “P1 ×P2-ness, ” or “P2 ×P1-ness, ” are
equal in its level of intersubjectivity. Instead, the capacity
of P1 or P2’s intersubjectivity (Eﬀect [“P1 × P2 −ness′′in P1 ] or
Eﬀect[“P2 × P1 −ness′′in P2 ]) depends on the quality of the
conditions (Condition [P1 × P2 ] or Condition [P2 × P1 ]) that
one’s mirror-like awareness (Cause[P1] or Cause [P2]) interacts
with. In other words, Eqs 3a, 3b can be applied to any
level of intersubjectivity, whether it is an optimal level of
intersubjectivity (as depicted in Figure 2) or a sub-optimal level
of impaired intersubjectivity (as depicted in Figure 3).
Understanding active inference
framework in the relational worldview
The relational worldview—Eﬀect is an interactive product
of Cause by Condition—can be applied to understand the active
inference framework. In the active inference framework, actions
in active inference co-create the perceptions with the incoming

event, which is analogous to the facts that actions of measuring
co-create the eﬀects of the measurement of the quantum systems
in delayed-choice experiments in Physics. When a person or
agent is modeled as an active inference engine, the engine
serves as the subject that interacts with an object in the external
world. As an example, here we apply the abstract expression of
Dependent Origination to the active inference process in the
four-node network (Figure 1).
Let nodes (A), (S), and (I) of an active inference engine be
the Cause and node (E) in the external state be objects or events
be the Condition that interacts with the Cause in Eq. 1. Now we
have a pair of expressions as follows:
For the eﬀect on the active inference engine,
Eﬀect[nodes (A′),(S′),(I′)] = Cause[nodes (A),(S),(I)]
×Condition[node (E)] (4a)
wherein Eﬀect [nodes(A′),(S′),(I′)] designates the active inference
engine after the Cause by Condition interaction, which involves
iterations of perceptual and active inferences to optimize the
prior beliefs to minimize the variational free energy in FEP.
The systemic continuity between the Cause and Eﬀect in Eq 4a
is consistent with the notion that active inference engines are
self-evidencing (Friston, 2018; Friston et al., 2022).
For the eﬀect on the external state,
Eﬀect[node (E′)] = Cause[node (E)]×Condition[nodes (A),(S),(I)]
(4b)
wherein Eﬀect [node (E′)] designates the external state after
the Cause by Condition interaction. Notably, the subject-by-
object interaction eﬀect on the object is denotated as the
“cathexis” here, because it potentially entangles the object with
certain orientation or propensity of the subject. For example,
Edward Tolmen construed the process of cathexis as the learned
tendency to associate certain objects with certain drives, which
is one of the major determinants of choice behaviors, e.g., why
meat lovers tend to satisfy their hunger with meat (positive
cathexis) rather than non-meat products (negative cathexis;
Tolman, 1945).
In the neuroscience literature, the cathexis eﬀect is usually
conceptualized in terms of the construct of incentive value—
a positive or negative cathexis of an object is construed as a
positive or negative incentive value of the object, respectively,
(Dickinson and Balleine, 1994; Balleine and Dickinson, 1998).
For example, a rat has tasted a very salty liquid solution and then
does not consume the same solution anymore. In this case, the
very salty solution has a negative incentive value for the rat.
The question is, after the negative incentive value of the
solution has been established, what would the rat do when it is
put in a salt-deprived state and then encounters the same salty
solution again? This is the question ingeniously answered in an
animal study, which showed that when the rat re-encountered
the very salty solution after being put in a salt-deprived state
surgically, it immediately ran toward and consumed the very
salty solution appetitively (Robinson and Berridge, 2013).
As explained above, the non-linearity in those abstract
expressions of Dependent Origination, including Eq. 4b,
mandates the following three rules mathematically: The eﬀect
of Cause-by-Condition interaction, node (E’), is not identical
to (1) any linear transformation of node (E), (2) nor a linear
transformation of nodes (A), (S), (I), and (3) nor a linear
combination of all four nodes. Hence, the incentive value of
an object, post-cathexis, is not a property of the object, nor
an internal representation encoded in the subject, nor a linear
combination of the external object and internal representation.
The above axiomatic reasoning based on the non-linearity
of Eq. 4b is corroborated by the experiments conducted by
Robinson and Berridge (2013). As their study demonstrated an
instant ﬂip of the incentive value of the salty solution, from
something negative to something positive, without any new
learning, it is strongly suggested the following: The incentive
value is not a property of the object, because the salty solution
is not manipulated at all in their study. Nor the incentive
value is encoded as the subject’s internal representation. The
reason for this refutation is that, had this notion been true,
the rat would have avoided the salty solution even when it was
salt-deprived after surgery, because (a) presumably the internal
representation of the salty solution in the brain was not altered
by the experimental manipulations and (b) the rat did not have
any new learning trials to encode a new internal representation
of the solution’s incentive value in the novel salt-deprived state,
as a representationalist account of the cathexis of incentive value
would predict (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998).
This experimental refutation of the representationalist
account of the cathexis of incentive value is potentially relevant
to the refutation of the representationalist account of active
inference, as noted in the FEP literature (Ramstead et al.,
2020). The refutation of the representationalist accounts in the
domains of incentive value and active inference speaks to the
incompatibility between the relational worldview and realist
worldview, to be further discussed below.
The incompatibility between the
relational worldview and realist
worldview
As we abstractly denoted the relational worldview as the
notion of Dependent Origination—Eﬀect is an interactive
product of Cause and Condition, a realist worldview presents
a stark contrast. Realism can be deﬁned as follows:
“In general, where the distinctive objects of a subject-matter
are a, b, c, and so on, and the distinctive properties are F-ness,
G-ness, H-ness and so on, realism about that subject matter
will typically take the form of a claim like the following:
Frontiers in Psychology 19 frontiersin.org
fpsyg-13-806755 July 25, 2022 Time: 17:37 # 20
Ho et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.806755
a, b, and c and so on exist, and the fact that they exist and
have properties such as F-ness, G-ness, and H-ness is (apart
from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort sometimes
encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone’s beliefs,
linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on.” (Miller,
2021)
In other words, the realism assumes a non-participatory
universe wherein an object’s ultimate real ontology (a, b, c and
so on ) is identical to its properties ( F-ness, G-ness, H-ness and
so on ) that can be observed and ascertained, independent of
the subject/observer/apparatus involved in the observation. In
an abstract expression, a realist worldview can be expressed as
follows:
Existence[a,b,c and so on]
= Observable[F−ness,G−ness,H−ness and so on ] (5)
The incompatibility between the realist and relational
worldviews is clearly evident in preceding discussions oﬀered
here. First, in contrast to the non-linearity in the abstract
expression of relational worldview (Eqs 1ñ4), Eq. 5 is a
linear function. Second, in contrast to Eqs 1ñ4, the subject
or the apparatus used to make observation plays no roles
at all in Eq. 5.
This incompatibility may point to the innate possibility
of the cessation of suﬀering, i.e., healing. We postulated in
Ho et al. (2021) that an invalid belief—the belief that self
or other is ﬁxed and unchanged after any person-to-person
interactions—is the root cause of entrapping one’s awareness
in an unhealthy state characterized by rigidity and inﬂexibility.
The consequence of invalid beliefs in one’s awareness is that one
will misattribute the cause of his or her subjective experiences
(qualia) to the object itself, rather than the interactive product
of his or her active inference engine by the object. In this
misattribution, one judges the value of the object based on
one’s own qualia (“this object makes me feel good/bad”),
which one misbelieves to be identical to the object’s ultimate
existence (“this object is good/bad in and of itself ”), such
that one would believe that he or she can only have or not
have the object, rather than participate both in the creation
of the qualia and in the unfolding of how the object appears
to be in accordance with the ultimate nature of the reality,
Dependent Origination.
In fact, invalid beliefs are deeply embedded in the realist
worldview or beliefs. In Buddhism, such realist beliefs are
called conceptual thoughts (Vikalpas), and the substantial bases
underlying these realist beliefs are called mental fabrication or
superimposition ( Prapañca). In the root text of Madhyamaka
Philosophy, Arya Nagarjuna provided the diagnosis and
treatment for cyclic suﬀering caused by Vikalpa and Prapañca,
stating:
“Action and misery having ceased, there is nirvana.
Action and misery come from conceptual thought.
This comes from mental fabrication.
Fabrication ceases through emptiness.” (Nagarjuna,
1995) Ch. 18, V. 5
We have discussed the types of conceptual thoughts and
levels of mental fabrication, as well as how these processes
adversely inﬂuence the active inference processes of the brain
in thinking about compassion elsewhere (Ho et al., 2021).
According to Buddhism, suﬀering is rooted in invalid beliefs
and the cessation of suﬀering is guaranteed because all views
laden with invalid beliefs are incompatible with the ultimate
nature of reality (Tenzin Gyatso, 1997, 2009). Arya Nagarjuna’s
prescription of cessation of suﬀering, as quoted above, can
be paraphrased as follows: since the ultimate nature of
reality—whether it is called Emptiness, Dependent Origination,
or Participatory Universe in the context of the relational
worldview—is incompatible with the realist worldview that can
result in suﬀering, the cessation of suﬀering is always possible
through the realization of the ultimate nature of reality by living
in this participatory universe in the absence of invalid beliefs in
one’s awareness and active inference engines.
Among the initial steps toward this goal, what we hoped
to clarify through the abstract expressions presented above is
the critical importance of cultivation of an inward, reﬂective
contemplation, including being aware of one’s own prior
beliefs in his or her internal states, the diﬀerence between
the relational and realist worldviews underlying his or her
prior beliefs, and the incompatibility between the realist
worldview and the relational worldview concerning the nature
of reality. Promoting such awareness is primarily an educational,
contemplative work on changing beliefs and behaviors that are
thought to hinder healthy dyadic interactions. By applying the
abstract expressions and formal dyadic model to the study of the
parenting interventions as an example domain, we indeed found
that the cultivation of inward contemplation (i.e., Component
3 in the coding system) played a critical role in the eﬃcacy of
parenting interventions for reducing stress.
Conclusion
There is nothing more practical than a good theory.
—Lewin (1952, p. 169)
There is nothing as eﬀective as the interdependence between
theory, research, and practice.

In this hypothesis and theory paper, our work is
presented with interdependence among the aspects of
theory, research, and practice related to intersubjectivity.
To recapitulate, these interdependent aspects include
(1) intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic
processes; (2) a framework of active inference engine
in weakly coupled and strongly coupled states; (3) how
intersubjectivity can be impaired by deﬁcient relational
benevolence due to invalid beliefs, under-coupling, and
over-mentalizing; (4) a theory-driven literature analysis
to evaluate our hypotheses designed to determine the
extent to which parenting interventions were eﬀective in
reducing parenting stress on the basis of our dyadic model;
(5) how our work can be integrated with the literature
of developmental dyadic processes; and (6) a series of
abstract expressions/notations to elucidate the relational
worldview as supported in multiple scientiﬁc domains, how
the relational worldview diﬀers from the realist worldview,
and the importance of the awareness of such distinction in
relieving oneself from suﬀering according to Madhyamaka
Philosophy.
First, we used a well-established framework, namely
Free-Energy Principle, to provisionally construe a dyadic
active inference model of intersubjectivity. Speciﬁcally, two
persons, as active inference engines, are strongly coupled
when one person’s action causes the other’s feeling and vice
versa. In a strongly coupled dyadic system, variational free
energy will be collectively minimized in a state of high-level
intersubjectivity. The literature has suggested that stress can
be deﬁned as excessive variational free energy that threatens a
person’s self-centered beliefs. Thus, the dyadic active inference
model predicts that a high level of intersubjectivity in a
strongly coupled dyad will lead to minimize variational
free energy and stress, while a low level of intersubjectivity
in an under-coupled dyad will lead to engender excessive
variational free energy and stress. Using child and mother
as a focal example of person-to-person interactions in our
investigation of intersubjectivity, our provisional work has
led to identify three inter-related components to predict
the compromised levels of intersubjectivity and increased
stress, and we suggested three relational components and
underlying brain networks that can serve as potential
treatment targets for parenting interventions to reduce
parenting stress.
Second, the results from quantitative evaluation of reviewed
studies suggest that (1) the presence of any one of the three
components was associated with success of parenting stress
interventions and (2) the more components were included in
an intervention, the more likely it was eﬀective in reducing
parenting stress. Pragmatically speaking, future intervention
programs designed to attenuate parenting stress, regardless of
any speciﬁc clinical therapeutic orientation, should consider the
implementation of the three components to reduce parenting
stress by enhancing the level of intersubjectivity in parent-
child dyads.
Third, we integrated our work with decades of research
in developmental psychology by comparing our work with the
dyadic concepts identiﬁed in a recent systematic comprehensive
review of dyadic processes (Provenzi et al., 2018). The
compatibility between our dyadic model and the conceptual
framework provided in Provenzi et al. (2018), along with
the success in the theory-driven literature analysis in clinical
studies, strongly supported the usefulness of our dyadic model
in advancing the study of dyadic interactive process for future
clinical application.
Fourth, using abstract expressions of Dependent
Origination—Eﬀect is an interactive product of Cause by
Condition—in multiple domains, we explored the normality,
impairment, and rehabilitation of intersubjectivity through the
lens of the relational worldview.
In short, we presented an overarching framework grounded
in the relational worldview for understanding the nature of
reality. Articulating the relational worldview as eﬀectively as
possible may be the key to unlock the Team Human’s potentials
to overcome human-made problems. While we desperately
need to rebuild a viable Team Human to respond to multiple
planetary challenges (wars, violence, climate change, poverty,
erosion of trust, collapse of democracy, etc.), we suggest that
the rehabilitation of intersubjectivity should take a center
stage in our collective eﬀort to mitigate harms that are
caused by humans.
