NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Abstract:
Natural language syntax yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured
expressions. We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord
with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling
and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic
communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations
responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed
principles of economy in language design—such as “minimal search” criteria from
theoretical syntax—adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory
power to the FEP—with respect to higher language functions—and offers linguistics a
grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-
geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel–Ziv
compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic
workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization.
This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing–
Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the
normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence
from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient
syntactic computation within active inference.

Implementational models of language must be plausible from the perspective of
neuroanatomy (Embick & Poeppel 2015), but they must also be plausible from the
perspective of how biophysical systems behave. We will argue that the structuring
influence of the free-energy principle (FEP) can be detected in language, not only via
narrative (Bouizegarene et al. 2020), interpersonal dialogue (Friston et al. 2020),
cooperative/intentional communication (Vasil et al. 2020) and speech segmentation
(Friston et al. 2021), but also at the more fundamental level of what linguists consider
to be basic phrase-level computations (Berwick & Stabler 2019, Chomsky 1949, 1951,
1956, 1959, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c).
Natural language syntax yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured
expressions. We argue that many historical insights into syntax are consistent with the
FEP—providing a novel perspective under which the principles governing syntax are
not limited to language, but rather reflect domain-general processes. This is consistent
with a strain within theoretical linguistics that explores how syntactic computation may
adhere to “general principles that may well fall within extra-biological natural law,
particularly considerations of minimal computation” (Chomsky 2011: 263), such that
certain linguistic theories might be engaging with general properties of organic
systems (Chomsky 2004, 2014). Here, we consider the idea that many aspects of
natural language syntax may be special cases of a variational principle of least free-
energy. To this end, we examine whether a complexity measure relevant to
formulations of free-energy—namely, Kolmogorov complexity (Hutter 2006, MacKay
1995, Wallace & Dowe 1999)—relates to legal syntactic processes.
While the FEP has a substantial explanatory scope, across a large range of
cognitive systems, it can also be seen as a method or principle of least action for multi-

disciplinary research (Ramstead et al. 2021), in much the same way that the notion of
economy is typically entertained in linguistics as a programmatic notion (Chomsky
1995). The FEP itself has been argued to be more of a conceptual-mathematical
model for self-organizing systems (for some, it is a “generic” model; Barandiaran &
Chemero 2009), or a guiding framework (Colombo & Wright 2021). Thus, when we
argue that natural language syntax “complies” with the FEP, this is not to imply that
the FEP necessarily bears any specific, direct predictions for linguistic behaviour.
Rather, it motivates the construction of conceptual arguments for how some property
of organic systems might be seen as realizing the FEP.
We begin by summarising the FEP, and describe how syntactic principles are
consistent with it. We consider how the FEP is a variational principle of “least action”,
such as those that describe systems with conserved quantities (Coopersmith 2017).
We then review key observations from linguistics that speak to the structuring
influence of computational efficiency, involving “least effort” and “minimal search”
restrictions (Bošković & Lasnik 2007, Gallego & Martin 2018, Larson 2015), viewing
language as a product of an individual’s mind/brain, following the standard ‘I-language’
(Chomsky 1986, 2000) perspective in generative linguistics (i.e., ‘internal’, ‘individual’,
‘intensional’). After modeling the complexity of postulated minimal search
procedures—versus their ungrammatical alternatives across a small but
representative number of exemplar cases—we propose a unifying principle for how
the goals of the FEP might be realised during the derivation of syntactic structures,
which we term Turing–Chomsky Compression. We conclude by highlighting directions
for future work.

1. Active Inference and the Free-Energy Principle
Before we evaluate any work pertaining to linguistic behaviour, this section introduces
key elements of the FEP that motivate its application to language.
1.1. The Free-Energy Principle
The FEP has a long history in theoretical neuroscience (see Friston 2010 for a review).
It states that any adaptive change in the brain will minimise free-energy, either over
evolutionary time or immediate, perceptual time (Ramstead et al. 2018). Free-energy
is an information-theoretic quantity and is a function of sensory data and brain states:
in brief, it is the upper bound on the ‘surprise’—or surprisal (Tribus 1961)—of sensory
data, given predictions that are based on an internal model of how those data were
generated. The difference between free-energy and surprise is the difference
(specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between probabilistic representations
encoded by the brain and the true conditional distribution of the causes of sensory
input. This is evident in the following equation, which specifies variational free energy
o
(F) as the negative log probability of observations ( ) under a generative model (i.e.,
‘surprise’) plus the Kullback–Leibler divergence (D ) between the approximate
KL
posterior distribution and the true posterior distribution (where Q indicates posterior
s
beliefs, indicates the states in the generative model, and P indicates the probability
under the internal model):
F = −lnP(o)+ D [Q(s)|| P(s|o)]
KL (Eq. 1)
5
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Unlike surprise itself, variational free energy can be evaluated (for a detailed
explanation, see Friston, FitzGerald et al. 2017). Under simplifying assumptions, free-
energy can be considered as the amount of prediction error; for a mathematical
comparison, see Friston, Parr et al. (2017). Minimising free energy minimises surprise,
and is equivalent to maximising the evidence for the internal model of how sensory
data were generated. By minimising free-energy, the brain is essentially performing
approximate Bayesian inference. By reformulating variational free energy—in a way
that is mathematically equivalent; see Penny et al. (2004), Winn & Bishop (2005)—we
see that free-energy can be considered as a trade-off between accuracy and
complexity, whereby the best internal model is the one that accurately describes the
data in the simplest manner (where E indicates the expected value, and the other
Q
variables are the same as those defined above):
F = E [lnQ(s)−lnP(o|s)−lnP(s)]
Q
= E [lnQ(s)−lnP(s|o)−lnP(o)]
Q
= D [Q(s)|| P(s|o)]−lnP(o)

relative entropy log evidence
= D [Q(s)|| P(s)]−E [lnP(o|s)]
KL  Q
complexity accuracy (Eq. 2)
Because the relative entropy can never be less than zero, the variational free energy
provides an upper bound on negative log evidence: equivalently, the negative free
energy provides a lower bound on log evidence; known as an evidence lower bound
(ELBO) in machine learning (Winn & Bishop 2005). The final equality shows a
complementary decomposition of variational free energy into accuracy and
complexity. In effect, it reflects the degree of belief updating afforded by some new
sensory data; in other words, how much some new evidence causes one to “change
6
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
one’s mind”. A good generative model—with the right kind of priors—will minimise the
need for extensive belief updating and thereby minimise complexity.
The complexity part of variational free energy will become important later, when
we will be evaluating the complexity of syntactic processes using a measure derived
both in spirit and mathematical heritage from the foundations of the FEP. To present
some initial details about this, consider how complexity also appears in treatments of
universal computation (Hutter 2006) and in the guise of minimum message or
description lengths (Wallace & Dowe 1999). Indeed, in machine learning, variational
free energy minimisation has been cast as minimising complexity—or maximising
efficiency in this setting (MacKay 1995). One sees that same theme emerge in
predictive coding—and related—formulations of free energy minimisation, where the
underlying theme is to compress representations (Schmidhuber 2010), thereby
maximising their efficiency (Barlow 1961, Linsker 1990, Rao & Ballard 1999). We will
return to these topics below when we begin to formalise features of natural language
syntax.
Lastly, the FEP can also be considered from the perspective of a Markov
blanket (see Kirchhoff et al. 2018, Palacios et al. 2020, Parr et al. 2020 for detailed
explanation), which instantiates a statistical boundary between internal states and
external states. In other words, internal (e.g., in the brain) and external (e.g., in the
external world) states are conditionally independent: they can only influence one
another through blanket states. The blanket states can be partitioned into sensory
states and active states. External states affect internal states only through sensory
states, while internal states affect external states only through active states. The
implicit circular causality is formally identical to the perception-action cycle (Fuster
7
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
2004). Under previous accounts (Friston, FitzGerald et al. 2017), the brain can
minimise free-energy either through perception or action. The former refers to
optimising (i.e., using approximate Bayesian inference to invert) its probabilistic
generative model that specifies how hidden states cause sensory data; in other words,
inferring the cause of sensory consequences by minimising variational free energy.
The latter refers to initiating actions to sample data that are predicted by its model—
which we turn to next.
1.2. Active Inference
The enactive component of active inference rests on the assumption that action is
biased to realize preferred outcomes. Beliefs about which actions are best to pursue
rely on predictions about future outcomes, and the probability of pursuing any
particular outcome is given by the expected free energy of that action. Expected free
energy (G) can be expressed as the combination of extrinsic and epistemic value
(Friston, Parr et al. 2017), where π is a series of actions (i.e., the policy) being pursued,
τ is the current time point, and the other variables are the same as those defined
above:
G(π) = ∑ G(π,τ)
τ
G(π,τ) = E [lnQ(s |π)−lnQ(s |o ,π)−lnP(o )]
Q τ τ τ τ

(negative) epistemic value extrinsic value
(Eq. 3)
8
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Extrinsic value is the expected evidence for the internal model under a particular
course of action, whereas epistemic value is the expected information gain: in other
words, the extent a series of actions reduces uncertainty.
Notice that the expected versions of relative entropy and log evidence in the
free energy (Eq. 2) now become intrinsic and extrinsic value respectively (Eq. 3). As
such, selecting an action to minimise expected free energy reduces expected surprise
(i.e., uncertainty) in virtue of maximising the information gain while—at the same
time—maximising the expected log evidence; namely, actively self-evidencing (Hohwy
2016, 2020). When applied to a variety of topics in cognitive neuroscience, active
inference has been shown to predict human behaviour and neuronal responses; e.g.,
Brown et al. (2013), Friston, Lin et al. (2017), Friston, Rosch et al. (2017), Parr and
Friston (2017, 2019), Smith et al. (2019).
As will soon become clear, we will be using these observations concerning
complexity to motivate a specific application of these ideas to natural language syntax,
utilizing a measurement of algorithmic complexity that shares a mathematical heritage
with the FEP, as outlined here.
1.3. Belief Updating
Belief updating refers to a process by which free energy is minimised. By specifying a
process theory that explains neuronal responses during perception and action,
neuronal dynamics have previously been cast as a gradient flow on free energy
(known as variational free energy in physics, introduced in Feynman 1972; see Hinton
& Zemel 1994); we refer the reader to Friston, FitzGerald et al. (2017) for a treatment
9
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
of neuronal message passing and belief propagation. That is to say, any neural
process can be formulated as a minimisation of the same quantity used in approximate
Bayesian inference (Andrews 2021, Hohwy 2016). We provide an example of the
computational architecture implied by this formulation of belief updating in the brain
(Fig. 1). This illustrative example is based upon a discrete state space generative
model, where the equations describe the solutions to Bayesian belief updating of
expectations pertaining to hidden states, policies, policy precision and parameters.
In short, the brain seeks to minimise free energy, which is mathematically
equivalent to maximising model evidence. This view of neuronal responses can be
conceived with respect to Hamilton’s principle of least action, whereby action is the
path integral of free energy.

Figure 1: Schematic overview of belief updates for active inference under discrete
Markovian models. The left panel lists the belief updating equations, associating various
updates with action, perception, policy selection, precision and learning. The left panel assigns
the variables (sufficient statistics or expectations) that are updated to various brain areas. This
attribution serves to illustrate a rough functional anatomy—implied by the form of the belief
updates. In this simplified scheme, we have assigned observed outcomes to visual
representations in the occipital cortex and updates to hidden states to the hippocampal
formation. The evaluation of policies, in terms of their (expected) free energy, has been placed
in the ventral prefrontal cortex. Expectations about policies per se and the precision of these
beliefs have been attributed to striatal and ventral tegmental areas to indicate a putative role
for dopamine in encoding precision. Finally, beliefs about policies are used to create Bayesian
model averages over future states, which are fulfilled by action. The red arrows denote
message passing. In brief, the parameters of the generative model correspond to matrices or
arrays encoding the likelihood A, prior state transitions B, and initial hidden states D. F
corresponds to the free energy of each policy and G corresponds to the expected free energy,
which is weighted by a precision or softmax parameter γ that is usually attributed to
dopaminergic neurotransmission. See Friston, FitzGerald et al. (2017) for further explanation
of the equations and variables.
1.4. Previous Applications
Applying active inference to language relies on finding the right sort of generative
model, and many different structures and forms of generative model are possible. Most
relevant to the current application, deep temporal models accommodate a nesting of
states that unfold at different temporal scales. Since language output is inherently
temporal, this leads to the question of how to map hierarchical structures onto serial
outputs (Epstein et al. 1998), and models that are deep in time allow us to deconstruct
associated nested structures.
Recently, a deep temporal model for communication was developed based on
a simulated conversation between two synthetic subjects, showing that certain
11
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
behavioural and neurophysiological correlates of communication arise under
variational message passing (Friston et al. 2020). The model incorporates various
levels that operate at different temporal scales. At the lowest level, it specifies
mappings among syntactic units that, when combined with particular semantic beliefs,
predict individual words. At a higher level (i.e., longer temporal scales), the model
contains beliefs about the context it is in, which specifies the syntactic structure at the
level below. This model is congruent with core assumptions from linguistics concerning
the generative nature of language. Specifically, elementary syntactic units provide
belief structures that are used to reduce uncertainty about the world, through rapid
and reflexive categorization of events, objects and their relations. Then, sentential
representations can be thought of as structures designed (partially) to consolidate and
appropriately frame experiences, and to contextualise and anticipate future
experiences. The range of parseable syntactic structures available to comprehenders
provides alternate hypotheses that afford parsimonious explanations for sensory data
and, as such, preclude overfitting (Sengupta & Friston 2018). If the complexities of
linguistic stimuli can be efficiently mapped to a small series of regular syntactic
formats, this contributes to the brain’s goal of restricting itself to a limited number of
states. Intuitively, knowing that you can only have said this or that greatly simplifies
the inference problem, rendering exchanges between like-minded artefacts more
efficient and economic.
Before moving forward, we stress here that we will be working within the
framework of theoretical linguistics (which deals with derivational stages of word-by-
word, element-wise operations that underlie sentences), and not a framework such as
corpus linguistics (which deals with the output of the generative/derivational process).
12
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Questions we raise here therefore cannot be addressed by consulting large corpora,
but instead require investigation of incremental computational steps that ultimately
appear to be responsible for the complex forms of human language behavior studied
by sociolinguistics, corpus linguistics, and historical linguistics. Relatedly, embracing
the traditional distinction between competence and performance, our focus will be on
the former (the mental formatting and generation of linguistic structure), and not on the
range of complex cognitive processes that enter into the use of language in a specific
context. The FEP has many implications for the study of language, and we focus here
on a very narrow, specific topic of derivational syntactic complexity (language
knowledge, as opposed to language use). Whether or not free energy is minimized
across corpora, or across paragraphs from clippings of newspaper columns, or across
the world’s languages, is an open topic—but here we will focus on the computational
system of human language.
2. Computational Principles and Syntactic Hierarchies
2.1. A System of Discrete Infinity
How can the FEP contribute to our understanding of syntactic computation? Most
immediately, it provides fundamental constraints on the physical realisation of a
computational system. Consider first the three principles in classical recursive function
theory which allow functions to compose (Kleene 1952): substitution; primitive
recursion; and minimisation. These are all designed in a way that one might think of
as computationally efficient: they reuse the output of earlier computations. Substitution
replaces the argument of a function with another function (possibly the original one);
13
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
primitive recursion defines a new function on the basis of a recursive call to itself,
bottoming out in a previously defined function (Lobina 2017); minimisation (also
termed ‘bounded search’) produces the output of a function with the smallest number
of steps (see also Piantadosi 2021, for whom human thought is essentially like Church
encoding). More broadly, we note that free energy minimization—by construction—
entails Bayesian inference, which in turn is a computational process, and so the FEP
entails computationalism (Korbak 2021) and at least a type of (basic) computational
architecture for language we assume here (but see Kirchhoff & Robertson 2018).
Examining some core principles of recursion, natural language clearly exhibits
minimisation, while binary branching of structures (Radford 2016) limits redundant
computation, reducing the range of possible computations. Even limitations on short-
term memory have been hypothesized to contribute to the efficiency of memory search
(MacGregor 1987).
Syntax involves the construction of binary-branching hierarchically organized
sets via the operation MERGE, taking objects from the lexicon or objects already part
of the workspace. For example, given the set {X, Y}, we can either select a new lexical
object and MERGE it, to form {Z, {X, Y}}, or we can select an existing object and
MERGE it to the same workspace, to form {X, {X, Y}}1. MERGE serves a similar role
to an elementary function, as in the theory of computability (e.g., the zero function, the
1 There are recent debates concerning whether merging new lexical objects is more
computationally demanding (since it requires searching the lexicon) than merging lexical
objects that are already in the workspace. This may motivate a Move-over-Merge bias
(reversing the Merge-over-Move assumption from the early minimalism of the 1990s),
however we leave this issue to one side.
14
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
identity function), in that it is meant to be non-decomposable. Putting many subsidiary
technical details aside, these sets are then ‘labeled’ and given a syntactic identity, or
a ‘head’ (Frampton & Gutmann 1999, Murphy 2015a, Murphy, Woolnough et al. 2022),
based on which element is most structurally prominent and easiest to search for (i.e.,
Z in the structure {Z, {X, Y}})2. For example, ‘the old man’ is a Determiner Phrase (DP),
and has the distributional properties of a DP, since ‘the’ is equivalent to Z, and ‘old
man’ equivalent to {X, Y}. Labeling takes place when conceptual systems access the
structures generated by syntax. This occurs at distinct derivational punctuations based
on the configuration and subcategorization demands of the lexical items involved (e.g.,
in many instances subjects seem to be featurally richer than objects, and provide the
relevant feature for the label; Longobardi 2008). For example, in the case of head-
complement structures this is done immediately after MERGE (Bošković 2016).
MERGE can also derive some set-theoretic properties of linguistic relations, such as
membership, dominate and term-of, as well as the derived relation of c-command
(=sister of) which is relevant for interpreting hierarchical relations between linguistic
elements (Haegeman 1994)3. These also appear to be the simplest possible formal
relations entertained, potentially indexing a feature of organic computation that
adheres closely to criteria of simplicity (Chomsky 2022).
2 There is increasing evidence that only elements in the workspace that have been
labeled can be subject to movement (Bošković 2021).
3 Note that there are also numerous cases in which principles previously seen as purely
syntactic have been re-framed as, for example, phonological in nature (e.g., string adjacency;
Bobaljik 2002; see also Richards 2016, Samuels 2011).
15
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
One might also think of MERGE as physical information coarse-graining (i.e.,
the removal of superfluous degrees of freedom in order to describe a given physical
system at a different scale), with the core process of syntax being information
renormalization according to different timescales. For instance, MERGE can be
framed as a probability tensor implementing coarse-graining, akin to a probabilistic
context-free grammar (Gallego & Orús 2022). The model proposed in Gallego and
Orús (2022: 20) assumes that language is “the cheapest non-trivial computational
system”, exhibiting a high degree of efficiency with respect to its MERGE-based
coarse-graining.
Natural language syntax exhibits discrete units which lead to a discreteness-
continuity duality (the boundary between syntactic categories can be non-distinct)4.
Syntax is driven by closeness of computation (syntactic objects X and Y form a distinct
syntactic object, {X, Y}). Its objects are bounded (a fixed list, e.g., N, V, Adj, Adv, P,
C, T, n, v, Asp, Cl, Neg, Q, Det) and their hierarchical ordering is based on a specific
functional sequence such as C-T-v-V (e.g., C is always higher than V; Starke 2004)
which imposes direct restrictions on combinatorics (Adger & Svenonius 2011). These
objects can be combined in cycles (Frampton & Gutmann 1999), which can be
4 In active inference, the use of discrete—as opposed to continuous—states in
generative models is an enormously potent way of minimising complexity. For example, if it is
sufficient to carve the world (i.e., the causes of my sensations) into a small number of hidden
states, one can minimise the complexity of belief updating by not redundantly representing all
the fine-grained structure within any one state. Similarly, factorisation plays a key role in
structuring our hypotheses or expectations that provide the best explanation for sensations.
Perhaps the clearest example here is the carving of a sensory world into what and where. This
means one does not have to represent the location of every possible object in one’s visual
cortical hierarchy, just where an object is and what an object is—and then integrate these
representations to explain visual input (Ungerleider & Haxby 1994).
16
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
extended to form non-local dependencies. As we will discuss, these properties are
guided by principles of minimal search (an optimal tree-search procedure, informed by
notions from computer science; Aycock 2020, Ke 2019, Roberts 2019) and least effort
(Larson 2015), fulfilling the imperatives of active inference to construct meaningful
representations as efficiently as possible (Bouizegarene et al. 2020), contributing to
surprise minimisation.
2.2. Compositionality
Recently, certain efficiency principles at the conceptual interface (where syntax
interfaces with general conceptualization) have been proposed (Pietroski 2018), such
that the ‘instructions’ that language provides for the brain to build specific meanings
are interpreted with notable simplicity. Leaving more technical details aside, this is
ultimately achieved (in Pietroski’s model) through M-join (e.g., F(_) + G(_) → F^G(_),
which combines monadic concepts, like red + boat) and D-join (e.g., D(_,_) + M(_) →
Ǝ[D(_,_)^M(_)], which merges dyadic concepts with monadic concepts, deriving the
meaning of X verb(ed) Y). Hence, natural language permits limited dyadicity as a very
minimal departure from the most elementary monadic combinatorial system. Human
language is marginally more expressive (in its conceptual interpretations) than a first-
order language (i.e., one set, and one embedding), but the interpretation system is the
least complex needed to express dyadicity and permit relations between sets. As with
models of syntax invoking a simple process of binary set-formation to derive recursion,
by restricting the number of computational procedures able to generate semantic
structures, this model (and others like it; Heim & Kratzer 1998) restricts in highly
predictable ways the possible range of outputs. This model also assumes that there
17
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
are ‘fetchable’ concepts that language can use for compositionality, and non-fetchable
concepts. For instance, language seems to make considerable use of certain
contentful concepts (e.g., evidentiality) but not others (e.g., colour, worry/sollicitativity)
(Adger 2019, Peterson 2016).
Consider also how, in neo-Davidsonian event semantics, conjunction is limited
to predicates of certain semantic types (Schein 1993, Pietroski 2005). Certain
semantic rules of composition, in (1b), have been claimed to arise directly from more
elementary syntactic computations (Pietroski 2018) which adhere to principles of
efficient computation.
(1) a. Dutch shot Micah quickly.
b. Ǝe[Agent(e, Dutch) & Theme(e, Micah) & shot(e) & quickly(e)]
In this connection, it has further been observed that language acts as an
artificial context which helps “constrain what representations are recruited and what
impact they have on reasoning and inference” (Lupyan & Clark 2015: 283). Words
themselves are “highly flexible (and metabolically cheap) sources of priors throughout
the neural hierarchy” (Ibid) (for discussion of simplicity in semantic computation, see
Al-Mutairi 2014, Bošković & Messick 2017, Collins 2020, Gallego & Martin 2018,
González Escribano 2005, Hauser et al. 2002, Hornstein & Pietroski 2009). The notion
of truth is also deeply wedded to complex syntax (Hinzen 2016, Hinzen & Sheehan
2013), and is a notion that enormously increases an agent’s ability to generate
environmental inferences.
To briefly elaborate on the language/meaning relation, consider how universal
syntactic hierarchies such as Complementizer Phrases (CPs) containing Tense
18
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Phrases (TPs), and TPs containing Verb Phrases (VPs) (i.e., [CP[TP[VP]]]), can be
thought to emerge directly from extra-linguistic conceptual relations, or the “cognitive
proclivity to perceive experience in terms of events, situations, and propositions”
(Ramchand & Svenonius 2014: 33). An event (VP) is a kind of timeless description
(e.g., ‘run’), and when an event is merged with a deictic anchor the result is a situation
(TP), a time-anchored eventuality. Only when a situation is merged with a specific
discourse link does it become a proposition (CP), providing speaker perspectives (e.g.,
‘John will run’).
3. A Kolmogorov Complexity Estimate for Narrow Syntax
3.1. Economy
The notion of simplicity has been a methodological value which has guided linguistic
inquiry for decades (Terzian & Corbalan 2021). Chomsky (2021b: 13) notes that
measures of simplicity in linguistics have traditionally focused on symbol counting,
which transpired to be too crude a measure, and that “measuring simplicity is an
essential task and is no simple matter”. We aim in this section to elaborate a measure
of syntactic complexity that connects directly to the principles that underwrite active
inference. We will not be concerned with typological, phonological or acquisitional
notions of complexity, which form the bulk of current complexity literature. Instead, we
are interested in underlying representational issues that pertain to syntax-semantics.
Even the most recent explorations of simplicity in language, such as the volume on
simplicity in grammar learning in Katzir et al. (2021), focuses on modelling minimum
19
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
description length in phonology and morphology, but not processes pertaining to the
derivation of syntactic objects.
A number of economy principles have been proposed in theoretical linguistics:
the No Tampering Condition (Chomsky 2008), Minimal Link Condition (Chomsky
1995), Minimal Yield (Chomsky 2021c), Extension Condition (Chomsky 1995), Last
Resort (Chomsky 1995), Relativised Minimality (Rizzi 1990, 2001), Inclusiveness
Condition (Chomsky 1995), Precedence Resolution Principle (Epstein et al. 1998),
Scope Economy (Fox 2000), Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 2004), Full
Interpretation (Freidin & Lasnik 2011, Lohndal & Uriagereka 2016), Global Economy
Condition (Sternefeld 1997), Feature Economy (van Gelderen 2011), Accord
Maximization Principle (Schütze 1997), Input Generalisation (Holmberg & Roberts
2014), Maximise Minimal Means (Biberauer 2019a), Resource Restriction (Chomsky
et al. 2019), and Equal Embedding (Murphy & Shim 2020) (for further discussion, see
Frampton & Gutmann 1999, Fukui 1996, Titov 2020).
Although economy principles have figured in models of phonology, morphology
and the lexicon (e.g., the Elsewhere condition, underspecification) for decades, it is
only relatively recently that theories of syntax have embraced economy not just as a
heuristic guiding research, but more concretely as a constitutive principle of language
design (Leivada & Murphy 2021, Reuland 2011, Sundaresan 2020). These have been
framed within a linguistic context, often invoking domain-specific notions (Wilder et al.
1997), despite a core part of the intended project of modern theoretical linguistics
being to embed linguistic theory within principles general to cognition. Motivating
language-specific computational generalizations by direct reference to the FEP may
broaden the explanatory scope for the existence and prevalence of particular syntactic
20
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
phenomena. Since linguists lack a general theory of computational efficiency for
language (e.g., Gallego & Chomsky 2020: “To be sure, we do not have a general
theory of computational efficiency”), additional support with respect to grounding these
concerns within a well-motivated framework for general organic behaviour will likely
prove productive. There are many promising paths to take here: minimising energy
expenditure during language processing (Rahman & Kaykobad 2005), shortening
description length (Schmidhuber 2015), reducing Kolmogorov complexity (Ming &
Vitányi 2008, Wallace & Dowe 1999), and the degree of requisite belief updating;
relatedly, we might consult the principles of minimum redundancy and maximum
efficiency in perception (Barlow 1961, 1974, Wipf & Rao 2007). We will provide a
concrete exploration of one of these notions (Kolmogorov complexity) below.
A core fact about many natural language expressions is that they involve
arrangements of nested constituents that enter into relations and dependencies of
various kinds. How are syntactic operations compressed into determinate,
unambiguous instructions to conceptual systems, and are there any general laws of
organic design that can be inferred from the FEP that appear to constrain this process
(and which successfully predict which objects cannot be constructed)?
Consider how under the No Tampering Condition the merging of two syntactic
objects, X and Y, leaves X and Y unchanged. The set {X, Y} created by MERGE
21
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
(Chomsky et al. 2019) cannot be broken and no new features can be added5. The
original structure in (2a) can be modified by the merging of a new element, λ, to form
(2b), adhering to the No Tampering Condition, while (2c) violates this condition since
the original structure (2a) is modified (Lohndal & Uriagereka 2016); hence why
adjuncts that merge ‘downstairs’ do not alter the structure of the object they adjoin to
(adjuncts are not labeled; Bošković 2015), i.e., if ‘John saw Mary [in the park]’, then
the fact that John saw Mary does not change (subscripts denote syntactic
heads/labels, standard script denotes lexical items, where (2a) could represent a
structure like ‘the red boat’)6.
(2) a. [ [β [ [δ ε]]]]
α γ
b. [ λ [ [β [ [δ ε]]]]]
α α γ
c. [ [β [ [δ [ ε λ]]]]]
α γ ε
Further, it is more economical to expand a structure, as in (2b), than to backtrack and
modify a structure that has already been built, as in (2c) (Lasnik & Lohndal 2013). How
5 MERGE has been defined as an operation on a workspace and its objects, formalized
as follows (WS = workspace; P/Q = workspace objects such as linguistic features; X =
additional elements):
MERGE(P,Q,WS) = WS’ = {{P,Q},X ,…,X }.
1 n
Other linguistic frameworks assume some similar, basic structure-building operation,
e.g., Forward-Backward Application in Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman 2000),
Substitution in Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Joshi & Schabes 1997). We put aside here some
controversies about the relation between a MERGE-based syntax and set theory (see Gärtner
2021).
6 Adjacent to minimalist syntax, Optimality Theory assumes that gratuitous adjunction
to a maximal projection violates an economy condition (SPECLEFT) (Broekhuis & Vogel 2009,
Grimshaw 2001). For syntactic economy conditions in Lexical Functional Grammar, see
Dalrymple et al. (2015).
22
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
can we more formally demonstrate these claims? We turn here to Kolmogorov
complexity.
3.2. Compression
Kolmogorov complexity is a measure of the length of the shortest program that can
reproduce a given pattern (Kolmogorov 1965, Li & Vitányi 2019). While measures of
minimum description length and Kolmogorov complexity have been typically applied
to linear, ‘externalized’ sequences, they can also be fruitfully applied to grammatical
relations, permitting measurement of the inherent information content of an individual
object or operation (Biberauer 2019b, Grünwald 1996, 2007, Newmeyer & Preston
2014). Sequence complexity is identified with richness of content (Mitchell 2009), such
that any given signal or sequence is regarded as complex if it is not possible to provide
a compressed representation of it. While complexity differences across languages can
be measured, for example, as a function of featural specifications on functional
elements (Longobardi 2017), here we are interested in the complexity of I-language
derivations. Previous efforts have already connected the theory of program size to
psychology by implementing a concrete language of thought with Turing-computable
Kolmogorov complexity (Romano et al. 2013), which satisfied the requirements of (i)
being simple enough so that the complexity of any binary sequence can be measured,
and (ii) utilizing cognitively plausible operations like printing and repeating. In contrast,
we aim to relate similar measures to syntactic economy criteria.
The concept of syntactic complexity remains underexplored in the literature
relative to other measures of linguistic complexity (Shieber 1985, Trudgill 2011). While
23
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
syntacticians have proposed economy principles, these all effectively boil down to
efficient tree-search, staying true to basic intuitions like “less search is preferable to
more search”—without formalizing these intuitions or attempting to broach this topic
with neighboring fields that might be able to provide highly valuable analytic tools.
Syntactic complexity can be operationalized across a number of dimensions,
such as online processing/parsing complexity (Hawkins 2004), tree-search and node
counts (Szmrecsányi 2004), number of MERGE applications (Samo 2021),
cyclic/derivational complexity (Trotzke & Zwart 2014), internal representational
complexity as opposed to derivational size (van Gelderen 2011), entropy reduction
(Hale 2016), or stages of second-language development (Walkden & Breitbarth 2019).
Syntactic complexity can be framed as grammar-based (derivational), or user-based
(parsing) (Newmeyer & Preston 2014); here, will be elaborating on the former type.
Crucially, sentence length does not always scale with syntactic complexity
(Szmrecsányi 2004), and instead an examination of the underlying operations is
required. Although syntactic complexity is often thought of in derivational terms,
removed and independent from surface realization, Kolmogorov complexity is
relatively theory-neutral and can be applied indiscriminately to mental objects with any
number of internal sequences, patterns, irregularities, and surface redundancies
(Miestamo et al. 2008). Perhaps most importantly, many postulates within theoretical
syntax (traditionally grounded in recursive function theory) cannot be obviously derived
from independently understood mathematical, physical or biological constructs,
whereas the above complexity metrics currently enjoy a more principled relationship
with the natural sciences (Ganguli & Sompolinsky 2012).
24
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Why do we focus here on such a generic, theory-neutral measure? We stress
that Kolmogorov complexity (and the related notion of minimal message length) relates
directly to frameworks emerging from the FEP (Friston 2019, Hinton & Zemel 1994,
Korbak 2021), with the prediction for natural language syntax of reducing the
complexity of hierarchical syntactic structures that are read off at conceptual interfaces
being sympathetic to a corollary of the FEP that every computation comes with a
concrete energetic cost (Jarzynski 1997, Sengupta & Stemmler 2014). As shown
above (Eq. 2), variational free energy can be formulated as a trade-off between
accuracy and complexity, whereby minimising complexity minimises variational free
energy. Considering the topic of universal computation, as in Solomonoff induction
(Solomonoff 1964) (which is directly grounded in the minimization of Kolmogorov
complexity), many formulations of variational free energy minimization explicitly invoke
algorithmic complexity and the type of mathematical formulations underlying universal
computation. Relating this more directly to our present concerns, the theme of
message length reduction has been fruitfully applied to analyses of grammar
acquisition in children. Rasin et al. (2021) show that minimum description length
(closely related to Bayesian grammar induction) can provide the child with a criterion
for comparing hypotheses about grammatical structures that may match basic
intuitions across a number of cases. The restrictiveness generated by these
complexity measures supplements the more general simplicity criterion of theoretical
syntax; much as how the ‘subset principle’ (restrictiveness) supplemented the original
evaluation metric (simplicity) (Berwick 1985). Lambert et al. (2021) demonstrated that
the computational simplicity of learning mechanisms appears to have a major impact
on the types of patterns found in natural language, including for syntactic trees, and
25
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
so it seems to us well motivated to turn to the issue of the underlying processes that
guide the generation of these structures.
Other recent work has successfully used minimum description length in a
domain much closer to our own concerns. Focusing on semantic properties of
quantifiers (e.g., ‘some’, ‘most’) and noting that natural language quantifiers adhere to
the properties of monotonicity, quantity and conservativity (Barwise & Cooper 1981),
van de Pol et al. (2021) generated a large collection of over 24,000 logically possible
quantifiers and measured their complexity and whether they adhered to the three
universal properties. They found that quantifiers that satisfied universal semantic
properties were less complex and also exhibited a shorter minimal description length
compared to quantifiers that did not satisfy the universals, pointing in intriguing
directions towards efficiency biases in natural language semantics that appear to
restrict the development of lexical meaning. Quantifiers that adhere to semantic
universals are simpler than logically possible competitors that do not. Do these
observations also apply at the level of syntactic structure building?
To briefly formalize our discussion of compression and complexity, given a
Turing machine M, a program p and a string x, we can say that the Kolmogorov
complexity of x relative to M is defined by the length of x. Formally, this can be
expressed as follows (Eq. 4), where |p| denotes the length of p and M is any given
Turing machine:
(Eq. 4)
𝐾𝐾𝑀𝑀(𝑥𝑥) ≝ min{|𝑝𝑝|:𝑀𝑀(𝑝𝑝) = 𝑥𝑥}∪ {∞}
This represents the length of the shortest program that prints the string x and then
halts. Yet, as implied by Gödel’s incompleteness theorem or Turing’s halting theorem,
26
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
we cannot compute the Kolmogorov complexity of an arbitrary string, given that it is
impossible to test all possible algorithms smaller than the size of the string to be
compressed, and given that we cannot know that the Turing machine will halt (Chaitin
1995). We therefore used an estimate of approximate Kolmogorov complexity (given
its fundamental incomputability) based on the Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm,
which we applied to the labeling/search algorithm needed to derive each syntactic
node in (2) and their subordinated terminal elements, investigating how ‘diverse’ the
patterns are that are present in any given representation of a syntactic tree-search. In
the service of replicability and for completeness, we used a current generative
grammar labeling/search algorithm that checks tree-structure heads and terminal
elements (Chomsky 2013, Ke 2019, Murphy & Shim 2020) (see also f.n. 11). In this
respect, Kolmogorov complexity is a more fine-grained measure of complexity than
previous measures in theoretical syntax (e.g., node count across a c-commanded
probe-goal path).
Searching the structure from top to bottom, identifying each branching node
and its elements, we used a Lempel–Ziv implementation (Faul 2021) of the classical
Kolmogorov complexity algorithm (Kaspar & Schuster 1987, Lempel & Ziv 1976) to
measure the number of unique sub-patterns when scanning the string of compiled
nodes7. This Lempel–Ziv algorithm computes a Kolmogorov complexity estimate
derived from a limited programming language that permits only copy and insertion in
7 We therefore assume that labeling/search occurs top-to-bottom, and not bottom-up,
due to the former yielding a more minimal search path with no ‘backtracking’, hence more in
line with economy considerations.
27
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
strings (Kaspar & Schuster 1987)8. The algorithm scans an n-digit sequence, S = s ·
1
s · …s , from left to right, and adds a new element to its memory each time it
2 n
encounters a substring of consecutive digits not previously encountered. Our measure
of Kolmogorov complexity takes as input a digital string and outputs a normalised
measure of complexity (Urwin et al. 2017).
To connect these ideas with active inference, we note that minimising free
energy corresponds to minimising complexity, while maximising the accuracy afforded
by internal representations9 , of hidden states , given outcomes (Eq.
2). In short, belief updating o𝑟𝑟r ∈m𝑅𝑅aking sense of any𝑠𝑠 d∈at𝑆𝑆a implies the minim 𝑜𝑜is∈a𝑂𝑂tion of
complexity:
(Eq. 5)
𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾[𝑄𝑄(𝑠𝑠)‖ 𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠)] ≈ 𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾[𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠|𝑜𝑜)‖ 𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠)]
When choosing how to sample data, the expected complexity becomes the intrinsic
value or expected information gain (in expected free energy):
(Eq. 6)
𝔼𝔼[𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠|𝑜𝑜,𝜋𝜋)−𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠|𝜋𝜋)] = 𝐼𝐼(𝑆𝑆,𝑂𝑂|𝜋𝜋) = 𝔼𝔼𝑃𝑃(𝑜𝑜|𝜋𝜋)[𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾[𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠|𝑜𝑜,𝜋𝜋)‖ 𝑃𝑃(𝑠𝑠|𝜋𝜋)]]
This is just the mutual information between (unobservable) hidden states generating
(observable) outcomes, under a particular choice or policy.
8 Kaspar and Schuster (1987) discovered that a readily calculable measure of Lempel-
Ziv algorithmic complexity can, for simple cellular automata, separate pattern formation from
the mere reduction of source entropy, with different types of automata being able to be
distinguished. We also note that Lempel-Ziv complexity does not simply measure the number
of elements in a sequence, but also factors in pattern irregularities. As such, it is not the case
that, by definition, a syntactic process with n steps will be trivially more Lempel-Ziv complex
than a syntactic process with n-1 steps.
9 That parameterise posterior beliefs .
28
𝑄𝑄(𝑠𝑠) ≜ 𝑄𝑄𝑟𝑟(𝑠𝑠)
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Importantly, variational free energy and formulations of artificial general
intelligence pertaining to universal computation both share a mathematical legacy.
This is rooted in the relationship between the complexity term in variational free energy
and algorithmic complexity (Hinton & Zemel 1994, Wallace & Dowe 1999), described
in terms of information length and total variation distance. As such, relating syntactic
operations to algorithmic compression maximisation feeds directly into assumptions
from active inference (Schmidhuber 2010).
Lempel-Ziv complexity is a measure of algorithmic complexity which, under the
law of large numbers, plays the same role as the complexity part of log model evidence
or marginal likelihood. Interestingly, minimising algorithmic complexity underwrites
universal computation, speaking to a deep link between compression, efficiency and
optimality in message passing and information processing.
With this background, we now return to the structures in (2b) (licensed) and (2c)
(unlicensed). Inputting the labeled nodes (subscript elements) and terminal elements
(regular script) across both structures into the Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm
(Faul 2021) left-to-right, the licensed representation in (2b) exhibits a normalized
Kolmogorov complexity of 1.88, while the unlicensed representation in (2c) exhibits a
complexity of 1.99. Crucially, while both (2b) and (2c) exhibit the same node-count
complexity and depth (i.e., bracket count), they can be operationally distinguished by
their Kolmogorov complexity, in compliance with what the FEP would demand. The
increased compression rate for (2b) indicates lower information content, hence lower
29
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Kolmogorov complexity (Juola 2008), and so the representation adheres to the priority
to minimise computational load.10
3.3. Redundancy
Can these types of complexity considerations find a broader architectural basis in
theoretical linguistics? Concerns over computational efficiency and representational
redundancy motivated the transition beginning in the 1990s from X-Bar models of
phrase structure rules involving intermediate hierarchical nodes (e.g., {TP {NP {T’ {T {VP
{V’ {V NP}}}}}}}) to Bare Phrase Structure (BPS), which simply involved set-Merge (e.g.,
{T {NP {V {T {V {V, NP}}}}}}). One of the goals of BPS in abandoning indexes, traces and
bar-level representations was to minimize the computational burden postulated both
within syntax and during the interface of syntax with language-external interpretive
systems. To align these themes with our broader concern of processing dynamics
(and, hence, biological plausibility), the psycholinguistic validity and polynomial
parseability of BPS minimalist grammars has recently been demonstrated (Torr et al.
2019). BPS attempts to express parsing stages using the fewest number of possible
derivational steps, which is not a concern inherent to other forms of parsers. Both X-
Bar and BPS models have been represented with rooted, directed acyclic graphs. The
10 This example of grounding the No Tampering Condition in a theory-neutral measure
of algorithmic complexity relates also to another economy condition in linguistics, the
Extension Condition. This states that “Merge always applies in the simplest possible form: at
the root” (Chomsky 1995: 248), i.e., there is only one site at which to extend a phrase marker.
This condition minimizes complexity and search space, and hence aids compressability of
structures fed to the interfaces.
30
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
main intuitive difference between X-Bar and BPS concerns when node closure is said
to occur, and ‘how much’ node closure occurs (Stabler 1997, Yngve 1960). In addition,
while X-Bar theory permits both binary and unary branching, BPS permits only binary
branching; every non-terminal node has exactly two daughters. BPS syntax effectively
generates simpler trees, yet with a late-stage burden of evaluating the labeled status
of a multi-phrase unit and transferring the constructed workspace to the interfaces
(Adger 2003).
3.4. Relativised Minimality
A further observation pertaining to economy in the literature concerns Relativised
Minimality (Rizzi 1990, 1991): Given a configuration, [X … Z … Y], “a local relation
cannot connect X and Y if Z intervenes, and Z fully matches the specification of X and
Y in terms of the relevant features” (Starke 2001). In other words, if X and Y attempt
to establish a syntactic relation, but some element, Z, can provide a superset of X’s
particular features (i.e., X’s features plus additional features), this blocks such a
relation. In (3a), which game provides a superset of the features hosted by how,
resulting in unacceptability. The equivalent does not obtain in (3b), and so a
relationship between both copies of which game can be established (strikethroughs
denote originally merged positions).
(3) a. *[[How ] [C [do you wonder [[which game ] [C [PRO to play

[+Q]
b. [[Which game , ] [C [do you wonder [[how ] [C [PRO to play
[+Q +N] [+Q] +Q +Q
which game ]]]]]]
[+Q,+N]
31
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Relativised Minimality emerges directly from minimal search (Aycock 2020): Consider
how when searching for matching features in (3b) the search procedure would ‘skip’
how but find the original copy of which game.
We note that the notion of movement ‘distance’ here is relativised to the specific
units across the path, and so even here formulations of Relativised Minimality seem
highly specific to language, as opposed to emerging from some kind of domain-
general constraint. Hence, in order to reach a more fundamental analysis we may
need some means of understanding what ‘distance’ actually reduces to. Under our
approach, algorithmic complexity and compressibility may offer a direction forward,
potentially being related in some manner to postulates such as syntactic ‘phases’. For
example, properties of phases, and phase heads, may fall out of independent features
of mental computation, perhaps relating to some threshold of compressibility that
serves to distinguish one phase from another when assessed alongside
representational category. These speculations aside, we can at least conclude for now
that there are avenues of current research that lend themselves quite readily to
explorations directed by notions of complexity and compression.
3.5. Resource Restriction
The principle of Resource Restriction (or ‘Restrict Computational Resources’, RCR;
Chomsky 2019, Chomsky et al. 2019) states that when the combinatorial operation
MERGE maps workspace n to workspace n+1, the number of computationally
accessible elements (syntactic objects) can only increase by one (Huybregts 2019,
Komachi et al. 2019). This can account for a peculiar property of natural language
32
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
recursion that separates it from other forms of recursion (e.g., propositional calculus,
proof theory): natural language MERGE involves recursive mapping of workspaces
that removes previously manipulated objects (Chomsky 2021c). Hence, Resource
Restriction renders natural language derivations strictly Markovian: The present stage
is independent of what was generated earlier, unlike standard recursion. Similar
observations apply to the idea that when MERGE targets objects in a workspace, non-
targeted elements remain conserved and intact once the new workspace has been
established (Chomsky et al. 2019), continuing the intuition of ‘No Tampering’. MERGE
itself exhibits the formal characteristics of a finite-state rewrite rule (Trotzke & Zwart
2014: 145), exhibiting minimal computational complexity, with MERGE being distinct
from the ultimate grammatical constructions later derived from its cyclic application.
A topic of recent discussion concerns how we can define the ‘size’ of a
workspace. Fong et al. (2019) suggest that the size of a syntactic workspace should
be considered to be the number of accessible terms plus the number of syntactic
objects. This proposal to constrain syntactic combinatorics can account for why the
applications of certain types of MERGE are ungrammatical (Fong et al. 2019). This
theory also requires only element counting—opening up questions about whether
other measures may be used to establish legal operations, such as compressibility.
Principles such as Resource Restriction and other economy considerations are
essential once we consider that a workspace with two elements with a simple MERGE
operation can generate excessive levels of combinatoriality. Within 8 MERGE steps
from two elements, around 8 million distinct sets can be formed (Fong & Ginsburg
2018). Older definitions of basic syntactic computations did not “worry about the fact
that it’s an organic creature carrying out the activities”, as Chomsky (2020) notes.
33
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Many aspects of these theories exhibited, to borrow a phrase from Quine (1995: 5),
an “excess of notation over subject matter”. Even many current models of syntax have
ignored questions of cognitive, implementational plausibility (e.g., Chomsky 2013,
Citko & Gračanin-Yuksek 2021, Collins 2017, Epstein et al. 2022). Computational
tractability (van Rooj and Baggio 2021) is a powerful constraint in this respect (e.g.,
implementable in polynomial time), and given that minimizing the model complexity
term (in formulations of free energy) entails reducing computational cost, this efficiency
constraint is also implicitly present in the FEP.
3.6. Interim Conclusion
We have considered how the FEP can in principle provide a novel explanation for the
prevalence of efficiency-encoded syntactic structures. To further stress this point,
consider Dasgupta and Gershman’s (2021) assessment that mental arithmetic, mental
imagery, planning, and probabilistic inference all share a common resource: memory
that enables efficient computation. Other domains exhibiting computational efficiency
include concept learning (Feldman 2003), causal reasoning (Lombrozo 2016) and
sensorimotor learning (Genewein & Braun 2014). As Piantadosi (2021) reviews,
human learners prefer to induce hypotheses that have a shorter description length in
logic (Goodman et al. 2008), with simplicity preferences possibly being “a governing
principle of cognitive systems” (Piantadosi 2021: 15; see Chater & Vitányi 2003).
So far, we have only provided one exemplar case of deriving a component of
syntactic design from complexity concerns that relate to formulations of variational free
energy minimisation. We will now turn to the most commonly explored syntactic
34
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
processes claimed to arise from economy considerations: syntactic movement and
minimal search. Further examples will be used to motivate what we term the principle
of Turing–Chomsky Compression, through which stages of syntactic derivations are
evaluated based on the algorithmic compressibility of some feature of the computation,
such as the movement path of an object, or the procedure of nodal labeling/search—
which can be unified based on how they manipulate the syntactic workspace.
4. Minimising Free-Energy, Maximising Interpretability
As has long been recognised, the syntactic categories of words are not tagged
acoustically, and yet sentential meaning is inferred from syntactic categorization
(Adger 2019). Interpreting thematic relations (who did what to whom) demands that
relations between words are established, however spoken sentences are often
ambiguous between distinct syntactic structures. For instance, below we can interpret
Jim Carrey as starring in the movie (4a), or sitting next to us (4b).
(4) a. [ [ We] [ watched [ a [ movie [ with [ Jim Carrey]]]]]]
TP NP VP NP N PP NP
b. [ [ We] [ [ watched [ a movie]] [ with [ Jim Carrey]]]]
TP NP VP VP NP PP NP
Linear distance (i.e., the number of intervening elements between dependents
in a sentence) can be contrasted with structural distance (the number of hierarchical
nodes intervening), and only the latter is a significant predictor of reading times in an
eye-tracking corpus (Baumann 2014). Violations of hierarchical sentence rules results
in slower reading times (Kush et al. 2015), and expectations of word category based
on hierarchical grammars also predicts reading times (Boston et al. 2011).
35
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
The apparent use of hierarchical structure to limit interpretation adheres to a
core tenet of the FEP, whereby interpretive processes that yield the lowest possible
amount of complexity (and thereby computational cost) can mostly (perhaps entirely;
Hinzen 2006) be derived directly from what the syntactic component produces. This
notion is closely related to the imperatives for structure learning (Tervo et al. 2016)—
or Bayesian model reduction—in optimising the structural (syntax) of generative
models based purely on complexity (pertaining to model parameters); see Friston, Lin
et al. (2017) for an example simulating active inference and insight in rule learning.
While sensorimotor systems naturally impose linear order, linguistic
expressions are complex n-dimensional objects with hierarchical relations (Gärtner &
Sauerland 2007, Grohmann 2007, Kosta et al. 2014, Murphy 2016). The following
sections provide concrete demonstrations of these design principles in action.
4.1. Structural Distance
Consider the sentence in (5).
(5) Routinely, poems that rhyme evaporate.
In (5), ‘routinely’ exclusively modifies ‘evaporate’. The matrix predicate ‘evaporate’ is
closer in terms of structural distance to ‘routinely’ than to ‘rhyme’, since the relative
clause embeds ‘rhyme’ more deeply (minimal search is partly “defined by least
36
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
embedding”; Chomsky 2004: 109)11. Language computes over structural distance, not
linear distance (Berwick et al. 2011, 2013, Friederici et al. 2017, Martin et al. 2020).
This can also be shown with simple interrogative structures. Consider the
sentence in (6a) and its syntactic representation in (6b), where the verb in the relative
clause (‘rhyme’) is more deeply embedded than ‘evaporate’.
(6) a. Do poems that rhyme evaporate?
b. [ [ Do][ [ [ poems][ [ that][ rhyme]]][ [ ][ evaporate]]]]
CP C TP DP DP CP C TP T’ T V
We can compute the complexity of both nodal search and Kolmogorov complexity,
contrasting the grammatical association between ‘Do’ and ‘evaporate’, and the
ungrammatical association between ‘Do’ and ‘rhyme’. When the [+Q] feature on C
searches for a goal, it needs to search down three node steps (from CP to V) to get to
the grammatical option, but needs to search down four node steps (from CP to
embedded TP) to construct the ungrammatical option. Since we are concerned with
analyzing a small but representative number of syntactic derivational processes, this
analysis differed from the approach to the structures in (2), which did not involve any
11 We refer the reader to Ke (2019: 44) and Aycock (2020: 3-6) for a detailed discussion
of minimal search, which can be formally defined below, from Aycock (2020), adopting an
Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search approach (Korf 1985); where MS = minimal search,
SA = search algorithm, SD = search domain (where SA operates), ST = search target:
(1) MS = SA, SD, ST
(2) SA:
a. Giv⟨en ST and S⟩D, match against every head member of SD to find ST [initial
depth-limit of SD = 1; search depth-first].
b. If ST is found, return the head(s) bearing ST and go to d. Otherwise, go to c.
c. Increase the depth-limit of SD by 1 level; return to a.
d. Terminate Search.

labeling procedure. This time, we enumerated the search steps across nodes,
replacing specific nodal categories with symbols interpretable to the Lempel–Ziv
compression algorithm (Faul 2021), since this is what the syntactic search algorithm
is claimed to monitor. The Lempel-Ziv complexity of the sequence of steps
enumerated from the C-V labeling/search algorithm is 1.72. For the embedded C-TP
search, it increases to 2.01.
Predictions about grammaticality generated by tree-search depth and
Kolmogorov complexity estimates such as Lempel-Ziv may provide an additional
advantage to models of syntax that attempt to establish these (and potentially other)
forms of sympathies with active inference, relative to rival theories. For instance, while
one might invoke purely semantic constraints on polar interrogatives and other forms
of question-formation (Bouchard 2021) to derive the kinds of acceptability contrasts
we have discussed, we see no way to ground these observations in concerns of
computability and complexity, and no way to measure or formalize these notions.
4.2. Ignoring Other People: Question Formation via Economy
As recent literature has explored, whenever there is a conflict between principles of
computational efficiency and principles of communicative clarity, the former seems to
be prioritized (Asoulin 2016, Murphy 2020a). For instance, consider (7).
(7) You persuaded Saul to sell his car.
The individual (‘Saul’) and the object (‘car’) can be questioned, but questioning the
more deeply embedded object forces the speaker to produce a more complex
circumlocution (‘[ ]’ denotes the originally merged position of the wh-expression).
38
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
(8) a. *[What] did you persuade who to sell [ ]?
b. [Who] did you persuade [ ] to sell what?
The structures in (8) involve the same words and interpretations, yet the more
computationally costly process of searching for—and then moving—the more deeply
embedded element cannot be licensed, despite the potential benefits of
communicative flexibility. Interestingly, one cannot feasibly posit parsing-related
factors to derive some independent complexity measure to explain this contrast (e.g.,
Newmeyer 2007), given the same number of words and same semantic interpretations
(i.e., give me the Agent and Object of the event). Experimental work has supported
the prevalence of these grammaticality intuitions (Clifton et al. 2006). Crucially, this is
not to say that when language is used for communication that this process is not also
structured via criteria of efficiency; for instance, see Gibson et al. (2019) (but see also
Galantucci et al. 2020 for evidence that people often fail to—and, indeed, do not care
to—communicate faithfully). Rather, we aim to stress the existence of conflicting goals
of economy.12
Consider also a model of dialogue through which internal generative models
used to infer one’s own behaviour are deployed to infer the communicative intentions
of another, given both parties have similar generative models (Friston & Frith 2015a).
As such, the core notion of surprise might be a crucial adjudicator in framing the
12 We also highlight here the generalisation, discussed extensively in Jackendoff and
Wittenberg (2014), that simpler syntactic structures typically lead to a greater reliance on
pragmatics for successful communication, whereas larger sentences lead to more of an
interpretive burden being placed on syntactic principles instead of conversational context.
39
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
distinction between I-language and more social conceptions of language production:
Reducing surprise/effort internally serves I-language functions of computational
efficiency, but it can also serve to encourage mutual predictability between speakers,
while, on the other hand, intentionally inducing surprise in others can often directly
serve certain communicative goals (Giorgi & Dal Farra 2019).
The syntactic structures for both (8a) and (8b) are represented in (9) (where
<DP> represents the movement path). With respect to tree-search depth, (9a) involves
searching down 11 nodes, while (9b) involves searching down 9 nodes. To expand
our survey of syntactic processes beyond labeling/search paths, we focused here on
the postulated path of syntactic object movement across the structure. The movement
path was represented with each site being attributed a symbol fed to the compression
algorithm, in keeping with a more general approach to annotating movement paths
(Adger 2003). Enumerating the movement path from the initially merged root, to
intermediate landing sites, to the terminal landing site in Spec-CP, the Lempel-Ziv
complexity of movement for (9a) is 2.15. For (9b), path complexity is 1.5.
(9) a. [ [ what] [ [ did] [ [ you] [ [ [pres] [ [ ] [ [ persuade] [
CP DP C’ C TP DP T’ T VP <DP> V’ V CP
[ [ Ø] [ [ ] [ [ ] [ [ who] [ [ to] [ [ [ buy] [ ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
C’ C TP <DP> T’ T VP DP PP P VP V’ V <DP>
b. [ [ who] [ [ did] [ [ you] [ [ [pres] [ [ ] [ [ persuade] [

C’ C TP <DP> T’ T VP <DP> PP P VP V’ V DP
A further empirical reason to assume that this economy condition is a general property
of language comes from the following data of Bulgarian multiple wh-fronting (Bošković
& Messick 2017; see also Dayal 2017 for discussion of the Superiority Condition). The
wh-phrase highest prior to movement (the subject in (10) and the indirect object in
(11)) needs to be first in the linear order of the sentence, such that the structurally
40
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
highest wh-phrase moves first, and the second wh-phrase either right-adjoins to the
first wh-phrase, or moves to a structurally lower Spec-CP position.
(10) a. *Koj e vidjal kogo?
who is seen whom
b. Koj kogo e vidjal?
“Who saw whom?”
(11) a. Kogo kakvo e pital Ivan?
whom what is asked Ivan
“Whom did Ivan ask what?”
b. *Kakvo kogo e pital Ivan?
Thus far, this suffices to show that the wh-element easiest to search for is selected for
movement. However, does syntactic economy simply rule out all but one option?
Crucially, Bošković and Messick (2017) show that when multiple options of equal tree-
geometric complexity are available, they are both licensed as grammatical. Consider
constructions with three wh-phrases. We can assume that whichever wh-element
moves to the structurally highest position (Spec-CP) satisfies the featural requirement
of interrogative C to have a filled Spec-CP position. After this structurally highest
element moves to Spec-CP, we can further assume that the remaining wh-elements
then move to Spec-CP to satisfy their own featural ‘Focus’-based requirements. At this
point, whichever order the remaining wh-elements move in, the requirements are
satisfied through movements of identical length (i.e., both cross the same number of
nodes, and hence generate the same sequence of derivational steps, and therefore
the same Lempel–Ziv complexity). As such, this predicts that the remaining two wh-
41
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
elements can move in any order after the initial wh-movement of the subject. This
prediction is borne out: the subject (‘koj’) is moved first in both constructions below,
but then either of the remaining wh-elements can move in any order.
(12) a. Koj kogo kakvo e pital?
who whom what is asked
“Who asked whom what?”
b. Koj kakvo kogo e pital?
4.3. Subject-Auxiliary Inversion
Another use of minimal tree-search to derive acceptability dynamics is found in the
observation that MERGE cannot select the linearly closest auxiliary in English Subject-
Auxiliary inversion, but must search for the structurally closest auxiliary.
(13) Somebody who is in Texas is on the phone.
(14) a. *[Is] somebody who [ ] in Texas is on the phone?
b. [Is] somebody who is in Texas [ ] on the phone?
In (14b), the search algorithm is a depth of 3 (moving from the matrix CP to the
immediately embedded VP, ‘is on the phone’, and finding its root auxiliary), while in
(14a) the search is a depth of 4 (from the matrix CP to the immediately embedded
relative clause, to the VP, and then its root auxiliary). Mapping the search path of (14a)
yields a complexity of 2. Mapping the search path of (14b), which is the same as (14a)
minus the intermediate relative clause, yields a complexity of 1.58.
42
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
4.4. Labeling
As a more stringent test, can Lempel-Ziv complexity shed light on cases in which the
ungrammatical derivation has less structural tree-geometric complexity than the
grammatical derivation? Consider the following case from Murphy and Shim (2020:
204). Putting ancillary technical details aside (see Mizuguchi 2019, Murphy & Shim
2020), (15a) is claimed to be ungrammatical because one final necessary operation
on the syntactic workspace has not been carried out; namely, merging ‘the students’
to the structure marked by γ. For expository purposes, we provide a schematic
representation to demonstrate the relevant movement path (the path of ‘the student’
is marked by t).
(15) a. *[ Seems to be likely [ the student [to [t understand the theory]]]]
γ α
b. [ The student [ seems to be likely [ t [to [t understand the theory]]]]]
δ γ α
The explanations from within syntactic theory as to why (15b) is grammatical concern
successful feature valuation and the minimal search of copies via the labeling
algorithm. However, this process might also be linked to more efficient compression
rates of syntactic labels at the interpretive systems. We can enumerate each labeled
node left-to-right marking the phrase boundaries separating each embedded object
that pertain to the grammaticality contrast (e.g., V-D-P-V). Computing the Lempel–Ziv
complexity of each successive phrase label in these structures, (15a) exhibits a
complexity of 1.86, while (15b) exhibits a complexity of 1.66, despite (15b) being a
more complex structure from the perspectives of node count and element count. As
such, both minimal search of syntactic labels and algorithmic compression rates may
be playing separate but related roles in determining how the interpretive systems
access objects generated by syntax.
43
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
4.5. Turing–Chomsky Compression
The brief number of exemplars we have derived syntactic economy principles from,
using a Lempel-Ziv estimate of Kolmogorov complexity, motivate the following
principle of language design:
Turing–Chomsky Compression: An operation (M) on an accessible object
(O ) in a syntactic workspace (W ) minimizes variational free energy if
1 p
structures from the resulting workspace (W ) are compressed to a lower
q
Kolmogorov complexity than if M had accessed O in W .
2 p
This is principally named after specifications over what (Chomsky) is compressed and
how (Turing) such compression can be achieved (Chomsky 2021c, Turing 1950). The
interaction between Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC) and more domain-specific
subcategorization requirements emerging from lexico-semantic features, and formal
syntactic features, is a promising topic for future research. We have shown across a
small but representative number of syntactic processes that derivations minimising
algorithmic complexity are licensed over those that result in structures and derivational
paths that are less compressible. In keeping with TCC, the examples we presented
constitute preliminary evidence that operations on syntactic workspaces are evaluated
by criteria that is independent of language-specific representational features—a step
towards a “genuine explanation” (Chomsky 2022) for language design.
5. Future Work
44
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
“Language and thought, in anything remotely like the human sense, might indeed turn
out to be a brief and rare spark in the universe, one that we may soon extinguish. We
are seeking to understand what may be a true marvel of the cosmos.”
Chomsky (2021c: 4)
We have arrived at a number of suggestive explanations for the way language
implements the construction of hierarchical syntactic objects: to minimise uncertainty
about the causes of sensory data, and to adhere to a least effort natural law (i.e.,
variational principle of least action), when composing sets of linguistic features for
interpretation, planning, prediction and externalization. We have shown that
measuring a Kolmogorov complexity estimate of syntactic representations and
movement paths can align with acceptability judgments. This was used to motivate a
new principle of language design, Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). Our use of
Lempel–Ziv complexity presents a more explicit measure than previous accounts. For
instance, consider Sternefeld’s (1997) Global Economy Condition, which states that,
given two derivations of a syntactic structure (D1, D2), D1 is preferred if D1 fares better
than D2 with respect to some metrical measure M (namely, number of derivational
steps). This basic ‘step counting’ measure (as with tree-search depth) seems to be in
line with grammaticality predictions of the more general complexity measure provided
by Lempel–Ziv complexity. Yet, Lempel–Ziv complexity also benefits from being
applicable across a range of other domains in syntax where nodal count does not differ
between competing structures, and is also related to formulations of variational free
energy minimization. Ultimately, this has the advantage of generating quantitative
predictions for syntactic computation based on general principles that apply more
broadly.
45
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Following neighbouring research in the active inference framework (Da Costa
et al. 2021), one could feasibly view our research programme as comparing the
information length of belief updating between distinct syntactic derivations and
theories. We view our proposals as being, in principle, concordant with the view that
neural representations in organic agents evolve by approximating steepest descent in
information space towards the point of optimal inference (Da Costa et al. 2021). Future
work could explore the utility of minimum description length (van de Pol et al. 2021)
and Gell-Mann/Lloyd ‘effective complexity’. In contrast to Kolmogorov complexity,
which measures the description length of a whole object, effective complexity
measures the description length of regularities (structured patterns) within an object
(Gell-Mann & Lloyd 1996), which may speak to properties of cyclic, phasal
computation in natural language.
More recent work has provided evidence for a mental compression algorithm in
humans (termed the Language of Thought chunking algorithm) responsible for parsing
very basic, binary sequences, providing evidence that human sequence coding
involves a form of internal compression using language-like nested structures (Planton
et al. 2021). Dehaene et al. (2022) extend this project to auditory sequences and
geometrical shapes. We have effectively extended these ideas further into the domain
of natural language syntax, suggesting some common capacity for symbolic recursion
across cognitive systems being constrained by compressibility.
While hierarchical complexity in language has clear neurobiological correlates
and energetic costs involved that relate to entropy and surprisal measures (Brennan
et al. 2016), the neurobiological status of more specific components of syntax that
pertain to economy criteria—such as the dynamics of BPS parsing—remains much
46
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
less clear. As a means to establish more direct, and testable connections between
these aspects of syntax and neighbouring domains of the cognitive sciences, we have
used a small number of exemplar cases to demonstrate that Lempel–Ziv complexity
(i) can align with nodal distance measures; (ii) can provide accurate predictions for
legal syntactic objects when nodal distance is identical across legal and illegal
syntactic objects; and (iii) can implement a principle of free energy minimization. In
addition, Lempel–Ziv complexity has been used to successfully measure the
complexity of cortical activity across a number of domains, including sleep and
wakefulness (Abásolo et al. 2015), the quantification of spikes and bursts of
synchronization (Blanc et al. 2008), the aging brain (Shumbayawonda et al. 2018),
cortical complexity under general anesthesia (Puglia et al. 2021), and the reduction of
resting-state neural complexity in schizophrenia relative to neurotypical controls
(Fernández et al. 2011). For linguists, we believe that the complexity metrics we have
discussed can constitute supporting hypotheses that connect theories of grammar to
observable psychophysical measurements and neural signals.
Some linguists might object to our complexity measure in the following way:
Why should syntax be organized so as to produce structures that minimise
Kolmogorov complexity, and why should the semantic component of language aim to
read off structures that are of corresponding complexity? We note in response that the
core ‘phase’/non-phase pattern of syntactic derivations (e.g., {C {T v {V D/n {N}}}};
Richards 2011, Uriagereka 2012) optimizes compression rate (effectively, 010101),
and since phase construction constitutes the major determining period when syntactic
workspaces are accessed by the conceptual systems, we see our proposal as aligning
closely with existing—if only implicit—assumptions.
47
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
Turning to other alternatives, innovative accounts that have invoked category
theory to model natural language syntax (Coopmans et al. 2021) have—thus far—only
modeled binary set-formation and lexical selection criteria without using the tools of
category theory to explain the design of these syntactic structures, economy criteria,
or other more complex syntactic features such as displacement. While category theory
is functionally useful for contrasting language with other cognitive faculties such as
action (as shown in Coopmans et al. 2021), the separate goal—and our present goal—
of grounding apparent economy constraints in syntax within a biologically plausible
model of language and computation in neural systems, and how these complex
systems implement these constraints, may require other formal tools.
Plainly, there are many issues with the framework we have outlined here that
need to be further unpacked and clarified. Our proposals concerning compression of
structures accessed from the syntactic workspace via TCC have been discussed in
the context of a cursory overview of the mathematical lineage shared between
formulations pertaining to the FEP and theories of universal computation. This suited
our current expository purposes, with our proposals being buttressed by conceptual
overviews of the FEP and syntactic economy, but future work should more carefully
align models of active inference with TCC. Although we made our assumptions about
syntactic complexity based on whether or not our measure can be formally grounded
within the FEP, we note that we have effectively equated complexity with
compressibility. As such, we acknowledge that there may be a number of other fruitful
directions to measure complexity in ways that are sympathetic to active inference (e.g.,
the “complexity equals change” framework; Aksentijevic & Gibson 2012).
48
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
We also believe that entropy measures (Hale 2016) are closely aligned with our
proposals, reflecting internal aspects of parser states, with entropy measuring their
uncertainty and relating to expected payoffs, and Kolmogorov complexity measuring
their compressibility (indeed, Shannon’s entropy is an upper bound on Kolmogorov
complexity). For instance, Yun et al. (2015) combine minimalist syntax with an entropy
reduction complexity metric to derive word-by-word predictions across Chinese,
Japanese and Korean. Looking at different types of relative clauses (subject relative
and object relative) that involve different syntactic movement paths, their entropy
reduction pattern directly matches independent psycholinguistic measures of reading
difficulty. Conceptually speaking, entropy reduction measures and Kolmogorov
complexity measures speak to the costs of endogenous syntactic computations, being
more directly informative about internal states than more externalist measures like
surprisal (Murphy 2021).
A challenge for future research is to appropriately frame the interfacing of
syntax with other systems in terms that accord with the minimisation of surprise and
variational free energy. Since the FEP has attendant process theories (e.g., active
inference), one of the latent payoffs of our suggestions here is the development of
generative models of active inference that fully ground specific factors in syntactic
theory and, through simulation work, may align with recent advances in the
electrophysiology, neural dynamics and neural harmonics of syntax (Keitel et al. 2017,
Tavano et al. 2021). For example, one crucial factor in any syntax model seems to be
phrasal category information, since it appears to drive cortical tracking of hierarchical
structures (Benítez-Burraco & Murphy 2019, Burroughs et al. 2021, Murphy 2020b,
Murphy, Hoshi et al. 2022, Wilkinson & Murphy 2016), in line with work highlighting
49
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
the unique computational contribution of phrase structure labeling (Adger 2013,
Hornstein 2009, Murphy 2015b, Zhao 2021).
6. Conclusions
We have reviewed how the FEP, that underwrites active inference, is an expression
of the principle of least action, which is additionally a principle implemented in models
of theoretical syntax. The FEP provides suggestions for why the brain computes the
way it does, while theoretical linguistics provides a means of establishing what is
computed. Our discussion of this topic culminated in a novel design principle for
natural language, Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). An intuition from 70 years
ago—that the extent to which a model of grammar is simple seems to determine its
explanatory power—echoes in the modern framing of syntactic computation as a
system of economy: “[T]he motives behind the demand for economy are in many ways
the same as those behind the demand that there be a system at all” (Chomsky 1951;
see also Goodman 1951). For Rissanen (1989), “given some data, the simplest
hypothesis explaining it is preferable”. Generative linguistics has long appealed to
economy considerations (e.g., the evaluation metric in Chomsky & Halle 1968). This
appeal to simplicity may even emerge from an evolved bias shared across our species
to favour simple solutions (see the ‘cognitive simplicity hypothesis’; Terzian &
Corbalán 2021). The FEP has produced formal, simulation-supported models of
complex cognitive mechanisms such as action, perception, learning, attention and
communication, while theories of syntax embracing computational efficiency have led
to empirically successful outcomes, explaining grammaticality intuitions (Adger 2003,
Martin et al. 2020, Sprouse 2011, Sprouse & Almeida 2017), certain poverty of
50
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
stimulus issues (Berwick et al. 2011, Crain et al. 2017, Culbertson et al. 2012, Wexler
2003, Yang et al. 2017) and the pervasive organizational role that hierarchy has in
language (Friederici et al. 2017, Grimaldi 2012) and the seemingly unique proclivity
humans have to parse sequences into tree-structures.
Our approach also mirrors previous applications of the FEP to cognition.
Exploring the issue of subgoaling, Maisto et al. (2015) conclude that favoured
subgoals are ones that permit planning solutions and controlling behaviour using fewer
information resources (yielding parsimony in inference and control), and conclude that
of those strings that represent procedures returning the same output, strings with lower
descriptive complexity are more probable, and should more likely be selected by
probabilistic inference. They argue that this framing is compatible with the FEP, and
we have further argued here that these assumptions of computational efficiency in
subgoals can be found in syntactic combinatorics (e.g., Momma & Phillips 2018
discuss linguistic parsing and production in terms of discrete subgoals). We find seeds
for these ideas in the foundational principles of universal computation, where, as we
have noted, free energy is often discussed in terms of minimum description or
message lengths (MacKay 2003, Schmidhuber 2010). Relatedly, core findings from
dependency length minimization (DLM) research suggest that, during online parsing,
comprehenders seek to minimize the total length of dependencies in a given structure
since this reduces working memory load (Gibson et al. 2019). These overt, ‘visible’
and linearized relations may therefore be constrained by similar efficiency criteria of
the kind we have discussed here, which seem to shape the operations of syntactic
structure building.
51
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
A core objective of current theories of syntax is to explain why language design
is the way it is (Adger 2019, Narita 2014), and we have suggested that the FEP can
contribute to this goal. The more efficiently a language user can internally construct
meaningful, hierarchically organized syntactic structures, the more readily they can
use these structures to contribute to the planning and organization of action, reflection
and consolidation of experience, exogenous and endogenous monitoring, imagination
of possible states, adaptive environmental sampling, and the consideration of personal
responsibilities. We used a brief number of examples to demonstrate proof of concept
for how compression algorithms, such as a Kolmogorov complexity estimate, can
provide principled insight into efficiency concerns alongside more traditional economy
criteria such as node count and tree-search depth. Given that one can characterize
major components of mental life as being derived from information compression (e.g.,
casting aside the vast majority of perceptual experience that does not inform
generative models), our conclusion that the most basic component of natural language
executes the same process as a primary constraint on its activities and its interfacing
with other cognitive systems should be seen as closely sympathetic to algorithmic
information theories of cognition and consciousness (Ruffini 2017). Other potential
topics to explore include Case systems of natural language, which do not seem to be
motivated purely by semantic demands (Chomsky 2020, 2021c) and which seem
instead to help the facilitation of perception and parsing by establishing clear relations
between discourse elements. How this and other components of natural language
relate to the priorities of active inference is a promising direction to pursue. Indeed, it
may transpire that developing a general understanding of computational efficiency for
organic, mental systems may only be possible by adopting an interdisciplinary,
52
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
systematic approach to natural phenomena (Cipriani 2021), of the kind afforded by the
active inference framework, moving beyond the types of descriptions initially tailored
specifically to linguistic categories.
Using examples involving minimal search and syntactic movement, we have
shown that natural language syntax and its interfacing with conceptual systems is
uniformly constrained by rates of algorithmic compression, motivating what we term
the TCC principle, which may be a foundational organizing constraint on language
design. While linguists can speak of the ‘Superiority Condition’, the ‘labeling algorithm’
and ‘minimal search’, we have claimed that some (perhaps all) of these postulates can
be derived from the goal of minimizing variational free energy via TCC. From the
perspective of active inference, individuals need to minimise the effort involved in
meaning-making, and TCC contributes to this goal. Active inference assumes an
imperative to find the most accurate explanation for sensory observations that is
minimally complex—recruited in Barlow’s (2001) exploration of minimum
redundancy—and which seems in accord with how the language system builds
structure, and structural relations (Hauser & Watumull 2017).
We note in this context recent work by van Gelderen (2018, 2021). Using a
series of historical reviews of extensive language changes, van Gelderen (2021)
shows that syntactic economy principles can account for language variation across a
broad variety of phenomenon, including that-trace constructions, CP-deletion, and the
presence of expletives. In addition, van Gelderen (2018) argues that regular patterns
of language change can be seen as resolutions to labeling failures (i.e., when the
labeling/search algorithm ‘fails’ to label a given structure). This work reveals how
considerations of economy (that we have argued arise directly from active inference)
53
NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAX COMPLIES WITH THE FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
are not simply formal stipulations useful in accounting for grammaticality—they can
also yield principled insights into large-scale dynamics in historical language change.
Moving beyond, we note that our measures of Kolmogorov complexity in the
operations of natural language syntax are exploiting a highly general, theory-neutral
measure of complexity, and that these and other related measures serve to index
some underlying, independent process of organic computation, which remains elusive
in its formal character and neural basis. While some domain-specificity will continue
to be required in the language sciences, if only due to the closed class of lexical objects
that syntax accesses, we hope to have shown that theory-neutral measures of
complexity that have previously been related to formulations of the FEP can provide
new inroads for the study of language.
More broadly, what the FEP can offer theoretical linguistics is proof of principle:
a foundational grounding and means of additional motivation for investigating
language in terms of efficient computation. The FEP is fundamentally a normative
model (Allen 2018) which can aid the generation of implementational/process models
(such as predictive coding or active inference) and can place constraints on feasibility.
Further simulation and modeling work is required to push these ideas further for
natural language and its various sub-systems, and we envisage that this type of future
work will provide fruitful insights into natural language syntax. If this project can be
expanded in this manner, we could make significant gains in ways that traditional
experimental psycholinguistics and neuroimaging of language processing have often
been unable to—we may discover a means to reconcile universal properties of human
language syntax with endogenous properties of the brain.
