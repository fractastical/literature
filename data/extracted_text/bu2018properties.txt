Abstract: We present a detailed study on the properties of the free energy density at high temperature by applying
the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) scale-setting method within e®ective ¯eld theory. The PMC utilizes
the renormalization group equation recursively to identify the occurrence and pattern of the non-conformal f¯i g-
terms, and determines the optimal renormalization scale at each order. Our analysis shows that a more accurate free
energy density up to g5
s -order level without renormalization scale dependence can be achieved by applying the PMC.
We also observe that by using a smaller factorization scale around the e®ective parameter mE , the PMC prediction
is consistent with the lattice QCD prediction derived at low temperature.

1 Introduction
At extremely high temperatures, hadronic matter is
assumed to undergo a phase transition to quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). The QGP might come from the early
universe up to a few milliseconds after the Big Bang or
from heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), etc.
This system therefore behaves more like a collection of
free quarks and gluons than a collection of their bound
states [1].
The static equilibrium properties of the QGP at tem-
perature T are governed by the free energy density [2]
F =¡T
V lnZQCD ; (1)
where V is the space volume and the partition function
ZQCD is a functional integral over quark and gluon ¯elds
on a 4-dimensional Euclidean space-time, with the Eu-
clidean time taking its values on a circle with circumfer-
ence 1=T. In the limit where the quarks are massless,
the free energy density is a function of T and the strong
coupling constant.
During the past decades, the free energy density, or
equivalently the negative pressure, of the QGP has been
calculated by using lattice gauge theory [3{23] or pertur-
bative QCD (pQCD) theory [2, 24{31]. In the present
paper, we shall focus on the situation where the QGP
has a high temperature T (T is considered as a measure
of the average energy of the constituents), indicating the
quarks and gluons are of high energy and the strong cou-
plings among them are small due to asymptotic freedom.
Within this temperature region, pQCD is a feasible tool
to study the free energy density. During the calcula-
tion, we shall resum speci¯c diagrams such as the \ring
diagrams" [2, 29], and it is helpful to expand the pertur-
bative series by the coupling constants gs rather than ®s.
The free energy density at high temperature has been cal-
culated up to O(g2
s ) [24], O(g3
s ) [25], O(g4
s ln(1=gs)) [26],
O(g4
s ) [27, 28], O(g5
s ) [2, 29, 30], and part of O(g6
s ) [31],
respectively. The O(g0
s ) term is the free energy density
of the ideal gas. The O(g2
s ) and higher-order terms con-
tain the corrections from the interactions among the ba-
sic particles, the screening e®ects from the plasma, etc.
There are new nonperturbative e®ects entangled with the
infrared divergence which emerge at the O(g6
s )-order [32{
34], and at present, only the speci¯c terms of the form
O(g6
s lngs) have been achieved.
For a high-order pQCD prediction, one has to choose
a renormalization scheme and a renormalization scale
¹r to ¯nish the renormalization. The scale ¹r is usually
taken as the typical momentum °ow of the process or
that to eliminate the large logs such as to make the
pQCD series relatively steady over the scale changes.
For the present case, one usually sets ¹r =2¼T, which
corresponds to the energy of the ¯rst non-vanishing

Matsubara mode [35]. However, such a simple choice of
\guessed" scale leads to mis-matching of the perturbative
coe±cients to the strong coupling constant, resulting in
the well-known scheme-and-scale ambiguities which per-
sist at any ¯xed order [36{41]. By using the \guessed"
scale, there are some other defects [42, 43], especially:
I) the predictions for a guessed scale are incorrect for
quantum electrodynamics, whose renormalization scale
can be unambiguously set by the Gell-Mann{Low pro-
cedure [44]; II) the perturbative series is factorially di-
vergent at large order { the renormalon problem [45, 46];
III) it is often argued that such scale uncertainties can be
suppressed by including enough high-order terms, which
however shall be diluted by the divergent renormalon
terms; IV) if a poor pQCD convergence is observed for
an observable, one cannot decide whether it is an in-
trinsic property of the pQCD series or is caused by an
improper choice of scale.
Many attempts have been made to improve the pre-
diction of the free energy density [47{75]. However, in
those studies, the renormalization scale uncertainty is
still quite large. In the paper, we will apply the princi-
ple of maximum conformality (PMC) [76{79] to the free
energy density up to O(g5
s ) with the goal of eliminat-
ing the renormalization scale ambiguity and achieving an
accurate pQCD prediction which is independent of the-
oretical conventions. Because the running behavior of
the coupling constant is controlled by the renormaliza-
tion group equation (RGE) or the ¯-function, the PMC
suggests using the knowledge of the f¯i g-terms from the
known pQCD series to determine the optimal scale of
a particular process. A recent review on this point can
be found in Ref. [80]. If one ¯xes the renormalization
scale of the pQCD series using the PMC, all the non-
conformal f¯i g-terms in the perturbative series shall be
resummed into the running coupling. One thus obtains
a unique, scale-¯xed, and scheme-independent prediction
at any ¯xed order. Many PMC applications have been
done in the literature, cf. the review in Ref. [81]. All of
those examples show that due to the rapid convergence
of conformal pQCD series, the residual uncertainties are
highly suppressed, even for low-order predictions.
There are several typical momentum °ows for the
free energy density up to O(g6
s ), e.g. T, gsT, g2
s T [82{
84]. The QCD hard thermal loop e®ective ¯eld the-
ory (EFT) [2, 30] provides a systematic way to unravel
the contributions under di®erent energy scales. The
QCD EFT is a three-dimensional one in which all the
quarks and non-static bosons have been integrated out of
the theory such that it reduces to purely static bosonic
modes [2, 30, 82{84]. The EFT factorizes the free en-
ergy density of the hot QCD into the perturbative coef-
¯cients and the non-perturbative parts via proper match-
ing. The PMC can be applied separately to set the renor-
malization scale of the free energy density within di®er-
ent scale regions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we present the calculation technique for achieving
the PMC prediction on the free energy density. Numer-
ical results and discussions are presented in Section 3.
Section 4 gives a summary.
2 Calculation technology
Using the EFT, the free energy density can be de-
composed into various parts which are characterized by
typical scales as T, gsT and g2
s T, and they are labeled
as FE, FM, and FG, respectively. Here the hard part FE
can be treated as a power series in ®s =g2
s =4¼, the softer
part FM is a power series in gs which begins at the g3
s
order, and the softest part FG is a power series in gs
which begins at the g6
s order. At present, the complete
g6
s -order terms are not known, so we shall concentrate
our attention on the free energy density up to g5
s order.
Up to g5
s order, the free energy density F can be for-
mulated as [2, 30],
F =FE(¤E)+FM(¤E); (2)
where ¤E is the factorization scale. The hard part
FE(¤E) can be expressed as
FE(¤E)=Fideal+8¼2

quark-gluon gas

Here the nf -terms in those coe±cients ri;j are free quark
numbers in QGP, which are irrelevant to the running of
the coupling constant and should be kept as conformal
coe±cients when applying the PMC [76{79].
After applying the PMC, the pQCD series of F 0

e.g. Eq. (6), can be improved as the following scheme-

In deriving FM(¤E), the RGE-involved fermion-loop
contributions have been incorporated into the EFT pa-
rameters m2
E, g2
E, etc. [2, 30, 82{84], so it is better to ap-
ply the PMC directly to those parameters to get more ac-
curate predictions of those EFT parameters and to avoid
the double counting problem1).
To be consistent with the known g5
s -order prediction
for the free energy density, we need to know m2
E up to the
next-to-leading order (NLO) level and g2
E to the leading-
order (LO) level. The m2

written as

By using the known NLO-terms for g2
E, we can de-
termine its optimal scale by applying the PMC in the
same way. For example, by using the computed g6

3 Numerical results and discussion
To do the numerical calculation, we adopt the value
®s(1:5 GeV;nf =3)=0:336+0:012
¡0:008 [85] as a reference point
to determine the QCD asymptotic scale ¤MS . By us-
ing the two-loop ®s-running formulae, we obtain ¤
nf =3
MS =
0:343+0:018
¡0:012 GeV. If not specially stated, we shall adopt
¤E =2¼T as the default value for the factorization scale.
In the following, we shall set the temperature T = 10
GeV as an example to show the basic properties of the
free energy density.
Firstly, we discuss the properties of the hard part
(FE) of the free energy density, which is characterized
by the scale around T. We present the renormalization
scale dependence of the ratio FE=Fideal before and after
applying the PMC in Fig. 1. We present the numeri-
cal results for the ratio FE=Fideal under several typical
1) The PMC resums the f¯i g-terms into the running coupling and the pQCD series of the free energy density also includes par-
tial resummation e®ects [27{29]. A straightforward application of PMC to the pQCD series might contain a mixing of inequivalent
resummations, leading to a double counting problem.

choices of renormalization scale, ¹r =¼T, 2¼T and 4¼T,
in Table 1. After applying the PMC, FE is independent of
the choice of ¹r , while the NNLO prediction under con-
ventional scale-setting still shows a strong scale depen-
dence. For example, Table 1 shows that FE=Fideal varies
by [¡2%;+4%] for ¹r 2[¼T;4¼T]. It is interesting to ¯nd
that the typical momentum °ow of FE should be '4¼T,
at which the PMC and conventional scale-settings give
almost the same prediction, which is about twice as high
as the usually considered 2¼T. This condition is similar
to the observation that the preferable choice of the renor-
malization scale for gg!H or H!gg is mH=4 [86] and
the preferable one for H!°° is 2mH [87], di®erent from
the usually considered mH. The typical momentum °ow
under conventional scale-setting is usually approximated
by eliminating the large log-terms of the perturbative se-
ries, while the PMC scale-setting provides a reliable way
to set the exact value for the typical momentum °ow for
high-energy processes.

Secondly, we consider the properties of the softer part
(FM) of the free energy density, which is characterized by
a softer scale around gsT.
To show how the scale uncertainty of the EFT pa-
rameters such as m2
E change, we vary the renormalization
scale from gsT (»mE) to approximately 2¼T. We present
the scale dependence of m2
E before and after applying
the PMC in Fig. 2. It shows that the PMC prediction
for m2
E is independent of the choice of ¹r , whose value
under conventional scale-setting shows a non-negligible
scale dependence ¤. We present the scale dependence of
m2
E by using three typical scales ¼T=2, ¼T and 2¼T in
Table 2. Under conventional scale-setting, m2
E varies by

As mentioned in Section 2, for a O(g5

tion on the free energy density, we only need a LO g2

However, by using the LO g2
E alone, we cannot deter-
mine its renormalization scale. To achieve a more accu-
rate prediction for g2
E itself, we adopt the known NLO-
terms [31] to set the scale for m2
E. The scale dependence
of g2
E up to NLO level before and after applying the PMC
scale-setting is presented in Fig. 3, which shows the scale
dependence can be eliminated by applying the PMC. Nu-
merical results for g2

4 Summary
In the paper, we have studied the properties of the
free energy density up to g5
s order at high temperature T
by applying the PMC within the EFT framework. The
PMC provides a systematic method to set the renormal-
ization scale of the high-energy process. Its predictions
are free of renormalization scale dependence even for low-
order predictions. As shown by Tables 1 and 4, our pre-
dictions for the free energy density up to g5
s order con¯rm
this observation.

scale is a completely separate issue from the renormal-
ization scale setting problem, since it is presented even
for a conformal theory with ¯ = 0. With the help of
Eqs. (21) and (22), we present a prediction for the fac-
torization scale dependence on the ratio F=Fideal up to
g5
s order as a function of T in Fig. 4. The factoriza-
tion scale uncertainty is discussed by taking the range
gsT »mE <¤E <2¼T [61]. The dashed line indicates the
Stefan-Boltzmann limit of the ideal gas. The lattice data
for the case nf =2+1 [13] is adopted for a comparison.
The upper edge of the band corresponds to ¤E =mE and
the lower edge of the band corresponds to ¤E =2¼T. Fig-
ure 4 shows that when ¤E =mE, the free energy density
agrees with the lattice data even for low temperature T
around 1 GeV, indicating a smaller factorization scale is
preferable.
