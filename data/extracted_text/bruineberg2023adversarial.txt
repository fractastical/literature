Abstract 
What is it about our current digital technologies that seemingly makes it difficult for users to attend to what matters to them? According 
to the dominant narrative in the literature on the “attention economy,” a user’s lack of attention is due to the large amounts of 
information available in their everyday environments. I will argue that information-abundance fails to account for some of the central 
manifestations of distraction, such as sudden urges to check a particular information-source in the absence of perceptual information. 
I will use active inference, and in particular models of action selection based on the minimization of expected free energy, to develop 
an alternative answer to the question about what makes it difficult to attend. Besides obvious adversarial forms of inference, in 
which algorithms build up models of users in order to keep them scrolling, I will show that active inference provides the tools to 
identify a number of problematic structural features of current digital technologies: they contain limitless sources of novelty, they 
can be navigated by very simple and effortless motor movements, and they offer their action possibilities everywhere and anytime 
independent of place or context. Moreover, recent models of motivated control show an intricate interplay between motivation and 
control that can explain sudden transitions in motivational state and the consequent alteration of the salience of actions. I conclude, 
therefore, that the challenges users encounter when engaging with digital technologies are less about information overload or inviting 
content, but more about the continuous availability of easily available possibilities for action.

Introduction
In the competition for attention, digital platforms build up models 
of their users: where they click, what keeps them watching, what 
triggers them. These models are used to present the user with 
content and structure that optimizes the platform’s “engagement 
goals.” This much is the central premise of the “attention econ-
omy,” the business model in which human attention is the scarce 
resource over which digital platforms compete for their existence. 
Needless to say, there is increasing concern about the effects of 
living in the attention economy on the user’s mental lives, their 
agency, and their autonomy (Williams 2018; Zuboff 2019; Castro 
and Pham 2020; Chomanski 2023).
There is a striking parallel between the functional descrip-
tion of the algorithms involved in the attention economy and 
predictive-processing theories of the human mind. According to 
predictive processing, adaptive behavior is achieved by an agent 
building up a model of its environment. This model, in turn, is used 
to generate predictions about which actions will most likely lead 
to outcomes that are in line with the agent’s desired observations. 
Through the continuous adaptation of perception and action (a 
process known as “active inference”), an agent learns to exploit the 
regularities in its environment to ensure favorable observations 
(Parr et al. 2022).
In this paper, I will explore the interplay between the agent as 
predicting its exchanges with the environment (central to active 
inference) and the (smart) environment as actively predicting its 
exchanges with the user. By further developing this interplay, we 
can better understand what it is about digital technologies that 
make them demand engagement, and, consequently, to better 
understand the vulnerabilities of the embodied mind situated in 
an increasingly designed and digital environment.
2 Bruineberg
In popular treatments on the attention economy, such as in 
the documentary The Social Dilemma (Orlowski 2020), the user is 
depicted as a passive marionette, at the mercy of whoever is able 
to pull its strings. As we will see later in the paper, active inference 
paints a much more active picture of the mind in which action 
selection is dominated by both a pursuit of desired observations 
and a pursuit of uncertainty-reducing observations (especially in 
places where it expects uncertainty to be found). One central 
claim I will develop in this paper is that the challenges users 
encounter are less about seductive content (i.e. clickbait), and 
more about the continuous availability of easily available opportu-
nities for uncertainty-reduction. The expectation of uncertainty-
reduction gives rise to the urges in the user to regularly check out 
the opportunities for novelty (Oulasvirta et al. 2012).
I will start the paper by putting some more substance to the 
concept of the “attention economy” and its underlying concep-
tion of attention. Second, I will situate the conception of attention 
within the debate in the psychology of attention about attention 
being a “cause” or an “effect.” As an intermediate finding, I will 
conclude that the conception of attention, as used in the debate 
on the attention economy, is problematic and that selection for 
action models are better able to capture the relevant phenomena. 
I will then introduce active inference and motivate why I think 
active inference can provide a better understanding of attention 
and the way it is dependent on the structure of the environment. 
I will focus on three distinct aspects of active inference in the 
context of the attention economy: the idea that both agent and 
environment are mutually predicting one another. Second, the 
specific conceptualization of attention, salience, and action in 
contemporary accounts of active inference. And third, the rel-
atively underexplored idea that effort biases action selection in 
active inference.
The attention economy
According to Wu (2017), the attention economy started with the 
first newspaper beginning to use advertisement, rather than paid 
subscriptions, as its primary source of income. In contemporary 
times, the attention economy refers to the idea that the major-
ity of digital platforms exist by virtue of their capacity to attract 
large amounts of “attention.” The phenomenon of the “influ-
encer” shows that the business model of the attention economy 
is not limited to tech companies, but also pertains to competition 
between its users (academics included). According to the logic of 
the attention economy, the present text has “won” in the compe-
tition with all the other things that you, dear reader, could have 
been doing right now.
Following this logic, a consequence of the attention economy 
is that players in the attention economy (be it free newspapers, 
social media platforms, or influencers) start to tailor the content 
they produce to what draws most attention ( Nguyen 2021). The 
business model pushes for “a race to the bottom of the brainstem” 
(Harris 2019) in which companies are ever better able to exploit 
the vulnerabilities of its users. The result is “an assault on human 
autonomy” (Zuboff 2019 ), in which the users’ attention is not 
aligned with their supposedly noble personal level interests, but 
with their most “primordial desires” (sex, violence, outrage, gos-
sip, etc.). Perhaps even more disconcerting, it seems like one way 
of keeping a user engaged is to present them with more and more 
radical content, such that eventually their personal level interests 
threaten to shift in a more radical and extremist direction (Alfano 
et al. 2021).
While this might be one aspect of what it is to be a “user” in 
the attention economy, it cannot be the whole story. A second 
consequence of the attention economy is said to be increased dis-
traction: we do not just pay attention to different things than we 
would like to, there is a sense in which we do not pay attention 
at all. In this second sense of attention, more related with notions 
as focus and concentration, our mental lives are becoming more 
fragmented overall: “the mind is simply jumping about and fol-
lowing whatever grabs it” (Wu 2017, p. 180, my italics). While writing 
this text, I may suddenly find myself scrolling through my T witter 
feed without really having noticed the transition. In many of such 
instances, there is no prompt or notification that guides the user 
to transition to T witter. The transition seems to be self-initiated, 
but without anything like volition being involved.
In his guidebook on how to hook users to one’s product, 
Eyal (2014) distinguishes between “external” and “internal” trig-
gers. External triggers are salient stimuli in the environment that 
attract attention. Consider, for example, the attention-grabbyness 
of the red circle with a white number that many apps use to indi-
cate a user has unread messages. The “action” that is “triggered” by 
the prompt is to click on the app and see what new messages there 
are. Focusing on external triggers leads to the attention economy 
as it is commonly portrayed: an environment full of salient stimuli 
that compete for the users’ attention/engagement. In some cases, 
the salience of a stimulus seems to derive from indeterminacy: the 
user does not know what e-mails await behind the notifications. 
The urge to click and open the app seems primarily epistemic. In 
other cases, the salience seems to derive from a particular mix 
of hedonic and epistemic factors as, for example, in the case of 
“clickbait.” (Wu 2017, p. 282) describes clickbait as:
sensationally headlined articles, paired with provocative pic-
tures - a bikini-clad celebrity was always good […]. When 
properly calibrated, such content seemed to take control of 
the mind, causing the hand almost involuntarily to click on 
whatever was there.
The persuasive force of clickbait, and how it seems to sidestep 
conscious control, is itself a highly fascinating and interesting 
phenomenon that deserves further interest.1 However, the atten-
tion economy is more than the competition of external triggers for 
attention and engagement. After all, external triggers presuppose 
that the user is already in perceptual contact with the notifica-
tions of a particular platform. If you are anything like me, you 
have switched off distracting notifications and pop-ups a long time 
ago. According to Eyal, the “brass ring of consumer technology” is 
therefore to intervene in the process one step before, by connect-
ing “internal triggers with a product” (2014, p. 48). Internal triggers 
are prompts for action that arise in the absence of stimuli: you 
stand waiting for the train and feel an urge arising to check your 
e-mails. Or you are engaged in a conversation and feel an urgency 
to check your social media accounts (a phenomenon known as 
phubbing (Aagaard 2020)). Eyal writes that the aim here is to instill 
in the user an imbalance or stress “so that the user identifies the 
company’s product or service as the source of relief” (2014, p. 52).
On Eyal’s website, the model for how to instill internal triggers 
in a user is introduced under the heading Hooks: An Intro on How 
to Manufacture Desire in 4 Steps (Eyal 2012). Indeed, the competition 
for attention is an “epic struggle to get inside our heads” (Wu 2017, 
subtitle). Note though, that this is “desire” in scare quotes. These 
are not consciously endorsed desires or preferences, but desires 
1 Eyal’s use of the term “trigger” suggests a reflex-like relation between 
salient stimulus and action. This literature is often ambiguous between the 
stimulus-response relation being a pure reflex, or as stimuli providing a highly 
persuasive demand for action. In this light, Wu’s “almost involuntarily” conveys 
deep ambiguity about the underlying philosophy of mind.
Adversarial inference  3
embodied by sensorimotor engagement (perhaps more akin to 
conative “aliefs” (Gendler 2008)). I will return to this issue in a 
moment. For now it is important to point out the deep misalign-
ment between the user’s own explicit goals and desires, and the 
ones “manufactured in them” through engagement with digital 
technologies. Williams writes: “No one wakes up in the morning 
and asks: ‘How much time can I possibly spend using social media 
today?”’ (2018, p. 8). Still, these are the targets employees of tech 
companies set out to optimize in shaping our behavioral cycles. 
As Jeff Hammerbacher puts it succinctly: “The best minds of my 
generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That 
sucks.” (as quoted in Wu 2017, p. 30).
Zooming in on attention
Despite its terminological prominence, the concept of attention 
itself has been poorly theorized in the literature on the attention 
economy. Prominent authors like Williams (2018) and Pedersen 
et al. (2021)  point to Herbert Simon’s essay Designing Organiza-
tions For An Information-Rich World (Simon 1971) for providing the 
initial formulation of what we now know as the attention econ-
omy.2 According to Simon’s analysis, humans have long lived in a 
world of “information scarcity.” With the rise of new technologies, 
mass media, and communication, information has become exces-
sively available. Consequently, we now live in an “information-rich 
world”:
In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means 
a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that 
information consumes. What information consumes is rather 
obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a 
wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need 
to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance 
of information sources that might consume it. (Simon 1971, pp. 
40-41)
On Simon’s account, information and attention are inversely 
proportional quantities: information-abundance implies attenti-
on-scarcity and vice versa. He follows the logic of resource alloca-
tion as used in economics: the wealth of information in our society 
creates the problem of “allocating” the scarce resource of attention 
to the abundance of information sources that can consume it.
In his 1971 paper, Simon’s concern was not with consumers 
bombarded by stimuli fine-tuned to draw their attention away. 
Instead, his paper deals with designing information-flows in large 
organizations to avoid bottlenecks. His focus lies on bureaucrats 
that receive more reports than they have time to read, and hence 
cannot process and pass information on efficiently. Through-
out the paper, Simon assumes that the agent themselves allo-
cates their attention to particular (attention-consuming) tasks. 
His analysis of the attention economy therefore does not seem to 
have much space for distraction, triggers, and lack of focus in the 
sense discussed above.
As far as I am aware, it is only James Williams who draws 
the connection between information abundance, in Simon’s sense, 
and a loss of control or agency. Williams writes:
[T]he main risk information abundance poses is not that one’s 
attention will be occupied or used up by information, as though it 
were some finite, quantifiable resource, but rather that one will 
lose control over one’s attentional processes. . (Williams 2018, p. 
15)
2 For example, Pedersen et al. write: “Indeed, it was the psychologist Her-
bert Simon who first defined the basic terms of what is called the “attention 
economy”. (Pedersen et al. 2021, p. 311)”
To illustrate his point, Williams (2018) compares reaching the 
informational threshold to progressing in a game of Tetris. As more 
and more chunks of information come in at an increasingly rapid 
pace, we lose our capacity to process and store the chunks in the 
way we want. What we need to do then, following this logic, is to 
reduce the amount of information in our environment to come to 
regain control over our attention:
To say that information abundance produces attention scarcity 
means that the problems we encounter are now less about 
breaking down barriers between us and information, and more 
about putting barriers in place. (Williams 2018, p. 16)
There is no doubt that putting barriers in place between the 
user and information is part of the solution. Indeed, switching off 
notifications on one’s phone is something like putting a barrier in 
place between the user and (irrelevant) information. But the inter-
esting question is whether the barrier serves to keep the outside 
world from coming in, as Simon and Williams argue, or the inside 
from breaking out. There is an important difference between tools 
that block ads and pop-ups (i.e. tools that modify our perceptual 
environment) and tools that block particular websites from being 
visitable (i.e. tools that modify our field of action possibilities). An 
app like Self-Control blocks access to websites for a preset amount 
of time, even when the user tries to visit them. While the former 
are tools to keep external triggers in check, the latter are tools to 
restrain our internal triggers.
The fundamental issue seems to me to be the following: Simon 
(and consequently Williams) operates with a view in which the 
need for attention arises out of a structural bottleneck in human-
information processing. This is a very common view in classical 
cognitive science. Attention-pioneer Broadbent writes for exam-
ple: “selection takes place in order to protect a mechanism of 
limited capacity” (Broadbent 1971, p. 178). In a 1983 chapter on 
attention, Marsel Mesulam takes this thought to its logical conclu-
sion: “If the brain had infinite capacity for information processing, 
there would be little need for attentional mechanisms” (Mesulam 
1983, p. 125).
3 Simon’s conception of attention is premised on a 
cognitive architecture in which perceptual and motor processing 
might be parallel, but in which central processing (i.e. cognizing or 
thinking) is the mechanism of limited capacity: “[h]uman beings, 
like contemporary computers, are essentially serial devices. They 
can attend to only one thing at a time” (Simon 1971, p. 41). The 
scarce cognitive resource for Simon is the serial activity of central 
processing. As a result, Simon defines attention as having central 
processing involved in processing information.
There seem to me two obvious downsides to the attention-
scarcity view. First of all, the way Williams conceives of the 
problem of attention-scarcity, as losing control as a result of too 
much information in the environment, suggests that controlling 
one’s attention is relatively easy in the absence of information-
overload (just like controlling the placement of Tetris tiles is easy 
in the beginning of the game). If you moreover want to maintain 
that attention-scarcity is a relatively recent development, then 
one needs to claim that before the advent of digital technolo-
gies (or some other relevant technological development), having 
control over one’s own attention was relatively straightforward. 
This seems an implausible claim. The emphasis on meditative 
and attentional practices across many contemplative traditions 
suggests that control over one’s attention always has been a 
3 To be fair to Mesulam, in a revised version of the book, published in 2000, 
the passage has disappeared and the introduction has been rewritten to reflect 
a much more nuanced account of the different bottlenecks involved in human 
cognition (cf. Mesulam 2000).

rare achievement (see Kreiner (2023)  for an account of Chris-
tian monastic traditions in the Early Middle Ages). Leading a 
life of the mind (i.e.  having “agentive control” over one’s atten-
tion) has never been an easy feat, regardless of the amount of 
information around. It seems perhaps more plausible then that 
the omnipresence of digital technologies, rather than introducing 
distraction, made possible different and perhaps more pervasive 
forms of letting one’s mental dynamics wander ( Bruineberg and 
Fabry 2022).
Second, on Simon’s view attention is primarily a perceptual 
phenomenon: there is too much information in the environment 
to be perceived and processed, and the challenge is to select the 
relevant information for further processing. If anything, the bot-
tleneck widens again from central processing to action. It is there-
fore difficult to see how Simon could account for internal triggers: 
urges for action that arise in the absence of perceptual stimuli 
and that are often directed at bringing about “more” information, 
rather than less. It seems that we require an approach that is 
oriented around action and that takes as a starting point that cog-
nitive control has always been an achievement. Fortunately, such 
an approach to attention is available.
Selection for action
The idea that limited capacity is explanatorily prior to selective 
attention is challenged by selection for action views of attention 
(Allport 1993; Neumann 1987, 1990; Wu 2011, 2014). On this alter-
native view, the need for attention arises because animals have at 
any point in time more action possibilities at their disposal than 
they are able to carry out. As Odmar Neumann writes:
The problem is how to avoid the behavioral chaos that would 
result from an attempt to simultaneously perform all possible 
actions for which sufficient causes exist, i.e., that are in agree-
ment with current motives, for which the required skills are 
available and that conform to the actual stimulus situation. 
(Neumann 1987, p. 374)
In order to avoid the “behavioral chaos” resulting from try-
ing to do everything at once, the animal’s processing needs to be 
selective from the start. Limiting processing in order to maintain 
behavioral coherence is an achievement.
The selection for action account of attention reverses the 
explanatory order between limited capacity and attentional selec-
tion. Odmar Neumann and Alan Allport (Allport 1987, 1993; Neu-
mann 1987, 1990) put their views of attention in explicit contrast 
with a perceptual bottleneck view of attention. On their view, 
attention is not a way to protect a mechanism of limited capacity, 
but limiting processing is a way to ensure the coherence of action 
selection.
The implication of Neumann’s and Allport’s explanatory rever-
sal is that attention is the outcome of cognitive activity, not the 
cause of altered cognitive activity. Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 
(2002) draw a broad distinction between “Cause Theories of Atten-
tion” and “Effect Theories of Attention” (James 1890; Johnston and 
Dark 1986; Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 2002 ), each rooted in 
different conceptual metaphors. Cause theories hold that paying 
attention to a stimulus “causes” it to be processed differently from 
an unattended stimulus. The main question for cause theories is 
to give an account of what (or who) allocates attention to the rele-
vant stimulus, while avoiding a homunculus-like regress or taking 
out a “loan of intelligence” ( Dennett 1978; Braem and Hommel 
2019
). On a cause theory, attention needs to be something like 
“a causally efficacious substance-like reality that modulates cog-
nitive processes” (Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 2002 , p. 158). 
Simon’s notion of attention seems to be a prime example of a 
cause theory of attention.
On an effect account (most prominently represented by 
selection-for-action theories and competition models ( Desimone 
and Duncan 1995; Cisek 2007 ; Cisek and Kalaska 2010 )), “what 
we call ‘attention’ is an emergent property or epiphenomenon” 
(Fernandez-Duque and Johnson 2002, p. 158), a byproduct of some 
more fundamental process. As a consequence, there is no single 
“attention center” in the brain from which attention originates. 
Attention is instead distributed throughout the cognitive system.
This little detour through debates in the psychology of atten-
tion serves to motivate the approach taken in the rest of this paper. 
In one of his latest writings on the topic, Alan Allport (2011) spec-
ulates that what might be seen as the “executive control center” 
of attention is in fact a cognitive system’s increased sensitivity 
to context. Interestingly, Allport mentions predictive coding as a 
close ally of the approach to attention he advocates:
A crucial role in these [predictive coding] models is played by 
cortico-cortical “backward connections”, as defined by their cor-
tical layers of origin and termination. Backward connections 
are both more numerous and more widely branching than for-
ward connections, and they transcend more levels, consistent 
with their postulated role in mediating context effects (e.g., 
Zeki and Shipp 1988). Moreover, context effects appear to be 
essentially universal to cortical processing: cortical units have 
dynamic receptive fields that can be modulated from moment 
to moment by activity in other units, including anatomically 
remote areas (McIntosh 2000; Friston 2002). Within this frame-
work, attention becomes simply “an emergent property of 
‘prediction”’ (Friston 2009, p. 300). (Allport 2011, p. 41)
Following Allport’s analysis, predictive coding provides an 
“effect account” of attention in which attention is a byproduct 4 
of prediction. If attention is “an emergent property of ‘prediction”’ 
(Friston 2009, p. 300), and prediction itself is a function of both 
context-sensitive models of the environment and the structure of 
the environment, then, one should be able to analyze how the 
altered structure of the environment leads to different ways of 
predicting, and hence of different ways of attending. More than 
“there just being too much information,” we are in a position to 
give a more precise and nuanced account of how attention is medi-
ated by the omnipresence of digital technologies. In particular, I 
think the analysis can shed light on the agent’s active involvement 
in bringing about particular states that, in turn, direct attention.
To manage expectations, I do not think that current active 
inference models can be used to model behaviors as complex 
as humans situated in a highly structured technological niche. 
What follows can hopefully be used as thinking tools and intuition 
pumps to better understand how human attention is structured 
in the attention economy.
Active inference
Active inference is a computational framework based on the 
premise that living systems selectively anticipate exchanges with 
their environment, and, in acting to realize their anticipations, 
achieve adaptive interactions with their environment (Clark 2015; 
Friston 2011; Hohwy 2013; Parr et al. 2022; Pezzulo et al. 2015).
The backbone of active inference is a synthesis of two influ-
ential ideas in the history of cognitive science: the Helmholtzian 
idea that error-correction serves to infer a hypothesis that best 
4 Both Allport and Friston seem to use the term “emergent” in a slightly 
non-standard sense that is more akin to attention being the “consequence,” or 
“effect,” of prediction.
Adversarial inference  5
explains the available data (Gregory 1980; Friston et al. 2012) and 
the cybernetic idea that error correction serves to maintain favor-
able conditions (Ashby 1956; Seth 2014). According to the original 
Helmholtzian proposal, perception functions analogously to sci-
entific hypothesis-testing: the agent holds a model that maps 
hypotheses about the world to their sensory effects. By minimiz-
ing the discrepancy (error) between predicted sensory effects and 
the actual sensory effects, the system will arrive at the hypothesis 
that best explains the data. Predictive success means epistemic 
success.
Cybernetics provides a control-theoretic perspective on error-
correction. An agent’s prolonged existence is dependent on the 
control of essential variables (such as body temperature and 
metabolic needs). When a deviation occurs (say, low blood-sugar 
level), the body compensates to reduce the deviation. In some 
cases, this can happen by internal changes (by releasing glycogen 
stores in the liver) or by external changes (seeking out sugar). The 
right kind of compensation requires a grasp on the relationship 
between sensed deviations and the relevant actions.
Although active inference models are sometimes introduced as 
a first principles theory of everything cognitive, they first emerged 
in cognitive science in the context of active vision: neural models 
underlying an agent’s capacity to actively probe and make sense 
of a continuously changing environment (Rao and Ballard 1995 ; 
Friston et al. 2010 ). On this approach, active vision requires a 
generative model of the structure of the environment. Using the 
generative model, an agent can infer the “hidden” structure of 
the environment based on its observations. An important aspect 
of active vision is the selection of targets for saccadic searches. 
While perceiving a scene, saccading to something the agent has 
already seen will not deliver new information, while redirecting 
saccades at random will, in most instances, be sub-optimal. To 
efficiently deal with a changing environment, an agent needs to 
select saccades (or actions more generally) that resolve the great-
est uncertainty about the state of the environment. For example, 
hearing a loud sound might lead to high uncertainty about the 
cause of the sound, and, at the same time, a visual orientating 
action toward the (estimated) source of the sound to disambiguate 
between different causes. Perception is therefore described in 
this literature as generating the most likely hypothesis that fits 
observations, while actions serve as “experiments” that can dis-
ambiguate between competing hypotheses (Gregory 1980; Friston 
et al. 2012).
The question is now how value gets incorporated in models 
of active vision. It is of no use to orient toward the headlights 
of an incoming truck, and correctly infer that a truck is about to 
run you over, only to be rooted to the spot. Early active inference 
models assumed that the agent’s generative model was biased 
toward adaptive states (cf. Bruineberg et al. 2018a ). Only if the 
agent’s expectations of its environment are congruent with its 
own existence will the agent persist in reality. This “optimistic” 
generative model is simply assumed, motivated by evolutionary 
considerations (an agent that does not predict itself to stay alive 
will not survive for long), or learned in specific settings. For exam-
ple, Friston et al. (2009)  make their agent learn in a controlled 
environment in which the agent is shown the correct trajectory 
without being able to intervene. After having learned the succes-
sion of states that lead to the adaptive outcome, the agent is then 
put in an uncontrolled environment where it is able to act on its 
environment in order to make its observations congruent with the 
succession of states that it has previously encountered (i.e.
 the 
ones that lead to adaptive outcomes). Although this might be a 
good model for some forms of social learning, it fails as a general 
account of learning.
In contemporary models of active inference (Friston et al. 2015), 
value and epistemics are integrated a bit more neatly by distin-
guishing between the quantities of “free energy” and “expected free 
energy.” Free energy pertains to the epistemic dimensions of active 
inference: its minimization involves finding the simplest hypoth-
esis that best explains the available observations. Expected free 
energy has both a hedonic (i.e. value-related) and an epistemic 
component. In what follows, I will provide a relatively abstract 
and non-mathematical version of the argumentation (some of this 
literature tends to be a bit technical both in terms of mathemati-
cal formalisms and the concepts involved, see Friston et al. 2015; 
Tschantz et al., 2020; Parr et al. 2022 for details).
Expected free energy is tied to a specific policy, a course of 
action that the agent can undertake. It says: “what is the free-
energy I expect to receive if I were to pursue this policy”. Verbally, 
expected free energy can be written out as: 
Expected free energy = expected cost + expected ambiguity
Probability of policy 𝛼1/expected-free energy of policy
The expected cost term states: “how close will following a 
particular policy bring me to a desired observation.” Desired obser-
vations are the way to bring (and make explicit) value and reward. 
If the agent’s desired observation is “tasting coffee,” then a pol-
icy that involves pouring oneself a cup of coffee will involve less 
expected cost than a policy that does not. The expected ambiguity 
term roughly states: “how much uncertainty will be reduced by 
pursuing this policy.” A policy that explores a location the agent 
thinks it knows about will have less expected ambiguity than a 
location the agent is uncertain about. The probability of pursu-
ing a policy is then inversely proportional to the relative expected 
free-energy of the policies: the lower the expected free energy of 
a policy, the higher the probability of that policy being selected. In 
other words: “The agent will pursue those policies most often that 
it expects will minimize free-energy.” This involves selecting poli-
cies that are expected to lead to desired observations and selecting 
policies where new information is expected to be learned.
The minimization of expected free energy provides a relatively 
simplified, yet elegant, account of action selection in an envi-
ronment that contains both uncertainty and elements that are 
valuable for the agent. In the following, I will go into more detail 
in specific aspects of the account that I think are relevant for the 
discussion on attention and technology that I started this paper 
off with.
Adversarial inference
Most of the simulations in the active inference literature assume 
a rather passive environment: the environment is static except for 
the changes an agent makes to it or it has a rather simple intrin-
sic dynamic (Friston et al. 2016). In some other cases, simulations 
involve two mutually inferring active inference agents, equipped 
with the same generative model, resulting in synchrony ( Friston 
and Frith 2015). In cases where the environment changes as a 
function of the behavior of the agent, focus lies on beneficial forms 
of niche-construction, such as the formation of so-called desire 
paths (Bruineberg et al. 2018b).
However, it does not take much effort to think of an active 
environment, which itself engages in a form of active inference 
(see Fig. 1). One can think of the algorithms, mentioned in the 
introduction, as active inference agents that gather data about 
users and generate a user’s newsfeed in order to keep them 
scrolling as long as possible. One can think of these algorithms 
as “seeing” the user’s actions over time (its clicks, timing, mouse 
movements, perhaps even its saccades), as well as the actions 
6 Bruineberg
Figure 1. Schematic depiction of “adversarial inference.” The user predicts the environment, and the environment actively predicts the actions of the 
user. The user’s active states are the environment’s sensory states and the user’s sensory states are the environment’s active states
of a whole range of relevantly similar agents in a whole range 
of similar environments. The algorithm “acts” by generating the 
newsfeed on the user’s screen. The “desired observations” (or 
engagement goals) of the algorithm are, for example, to keep the 
agent scrolling through the timeline for as long as possible. The 
algorithm is doing well if it sees observations corresponding to its 
“goals,” and otherwise changes the world to bring it closer to these 
“desired” observations. If the goals of the user and algorithms 
are opposed (something that seems baked into the very premise 
of the attention economy), this qualifies as a case of adversarial 
inference.
The means by which an algorithm learns to keep an agent 
engaged can have different kinds of side-effects. For example, in 
an attempt to keep users watching, recommender systems can 
provide more and more radical content, as such contents are likely 
to keep the user watching (Alfano et al. 2021). Moreover, if negative 
mood is a predictor of prolonged social media use, downregulat-
ing the user’s mood might be an effective way to obtain desired 
observations (Lanier 2018).
Such fine-tuning of the reward structure in order to optimize 
engagement has been perfected in the gambling industry. In Addic-
tion by Design, Natasha Dow Schüll (2012) describes in detail how 
the gambling industry developed algorithms that would gather 
data about a specific user in a specific session and calculate “how 
much that player can lose and still feel satisfied, thereby estab-
lishing personalized “pain points.” When the software senses that 
a player is approaching the threshold of her pain point, it dis-
patches a live “Luck Ambassador” to dispense rewards such as 
meal coupons, tickets to shows, or gambling vouchers” ( Schüll 
2012
, p. 154).
Timms and Spurrett (2022) introduce the notion of “hostile scaf-
folding” to characterize environmental structures that change the 
cognitive demands of a task in order to serve the interests of one or 
more other agents. If the environmental structure is changed on 
the spot as a function of the agent’s behavior, then this qualifies 
as what Timms and Spurrett call “deep hostile scaffolding.” If 
Williams’ analysis of the attention economy as a brute optimiza-
tion of “engagement goals” irrespective of the consequences is 
correct, then the algorithms that generate a timeline based on a 
detailed user profile do count as an exemplary instance of deep 
hostile scaffolding.
All of this paints a bleak, but also quite generic, adversarial 
picture with respect to human–technology relationships. It should 
be note that not all of the environments (digital or not) are adver-
sarial in nature. My aim in the next section is to focus on how 
attention and salience are operationalized in active inference.5
Attention, salience, and novelty
Attention is one of the most widely used constructs in the psy-
chological, cognitive, and neuroscientific literature. As mentioned 
above, one of the distinct advantages of using active inference 
is the ability to provide a precise mathematical operationaliza-
tion of some core aspects of attention. In order to operationalize 
attention within active inference, more detail is needed.
So far, I have only presented prediction based on a genera-
tive model, but not the way in which the generative model is 
changed and updated in light of new exchanges with the envi-
ronment. Key here is that the agent does not just predict specific 
causes of sensory observations, but a distribution of causes. For 
simple (Gaussian) distributions, these distributions can be cap-
tured by their “mean value” and their “variance,” or the inverse 
of variance, “precision.” Visually, a probability distribution which 
is sharply peaked around some value has low variance and high 
precision, while a probability distribution which is very broad 
5 The more ambitious claims about attention made by proponents of active 
inference have been criticized by Ransom et al. (2017, 2020). My claim is just 
that aspects of attention that are relevant for the attention economy can be 
usefully conceptualized and modeled using active inference, not that active 
inference explains “everything” about attention.
Adversarial inference  7
has high variance and low precision. “Precision” and “variance” 
are both measures of the “uncertainty” related to a probability 
distribution.
It is possible to give something like an “anatomy of attention” 
based on the functional role that particular forms of uncertainty 
play within the active inference framework. Parr and Friston 
(2017) distinguish between “attention as gain” and “attention as 
salience”. Gain is primarily associated with regulating the uncer-
tainty related to sensory signals. For example, in a foggy room, 
an agent should expect its auditory signals to be more precise 
than its visual signals. In estimating the state of the environment, 
auditory signals are inferred to be more precise than visual sig-
nals. The relative uncertainty of sensory signals plays a decisive 
role in weighing different forms of sensory evidence. In the foggy 
room, incoming visual signals have a comparatively small effect 
on the agent’s estimate, while auditory signals have a relatively 
large effect. The same mechanism of uncertainty accounts for rel-
evant and irrelevant aspects of a stimulus. If the agent expects the 
letter A to appear on a screen, its expectations will involve a pre-
cise mapping between the hidden cause “letter A” and a particular 
visual form and shape. If the letter can take on any color, there 
will be a highly uncertain mapping from the hidden cause to the 
observed wavelength, such that observing a particular wavelength 
does not change the agent’s expectation of a particular letter (cf. 
Parr and Friston 2019).
The second notion of attention, “attention as salience” captures 
a more action-oriented aspect of active inference. “Attention as 
salience” is a property of policies. Those policies are salient that 
are expected to minimize free energy. Remember that expected 
free energy is a function of both “expected cost” and “expected 
ambiguity.” Those policies are salient that will bring the agent 
close to desired observations and that are expected to reduce 
uncertainty. In the absence of desired observations, salience is 
associated exclusively with selecting policies that are expected to 
deliver unambiguous information. In the absence of uncertainty 
about the environment, policy selection reduces to reward-based 
decision-making: selecting the policy that best delivers desired 
observations.
A further distinction can be made between the reduction of 
“certain ambiguity” and “uncertain ambiguity” ( Schwartenbeck 
et al. 2019). Certain ambiguity refers to the reduction of ambiguity 
in places where it is expected to be found (i.e. hidden state explo-
ration); uncertain ambiguity refers to the reduction of uncertainty 
about the statistics of the environment (i.e. model parameter 
exploration). For example, one can throw a die in order to figure 
out whether the die is fair or not (i.e. explore the model parame-
ters), but even when one has established that the die is fair, each 
throw is expected to resolve ambiguity (i.e.  explore the hidden 
state). Schwartenbeck et al. (2019) call the resolution of ambigu-
ity about states “salience” and the resolution of ambiguity about 
parameters “novelty”: “‘salience is to inference’ as ‘novelty is to 
learning”’ (p.3).
Although the distinctions introduced by Schwartenbeck et al. 
(2019) are useful for illuminating different forms of exploratory 
behavior, it creates a slight terminological tension with other dis-
cussions of salience that focus on the phenomenologically salient 
(or noticeable) character of particular states or actions ( Archer 
2022
). If active inference is right, a policy’s salience in this richer 
sense is explained by the extent to which a policy is expected to 
deliver preferred observations, “salience” and “novelty”. In what 
follows, I will use the term salience to refer to a property of policies 
in this richer sense.
Following the logic of active inference, one way to attract 
“attention as salience” is to crank up the amount of uncertainty 
in particular areas of the agent’s environment. Indeed, it seems 
to be the case that digital environments provide essentially limit-
less sources of reducible uncertainty. This is true for social media 
platforms that allow for infinite scrolling: content is added just 
as fast as the agent can scroll through its newsfeed. But also more 
mundane websites and applications, such as an e-mail inbox, pro-
vide highly variable potential novelty. At each moment in time, 
an important e-mail could be waiting in my inbox, or a highly 
relevant news article could just have dropped on the homepage 
of my favorite newspaper. I might just go and briefly check if 
I missed anything relevant. The uncertainty here seems to be 
mainly what Schwartenbeck et al. (2019) call “certain uncertainty.” 
The uncertainty does not derive from a lack of knowledge about 
the parameters that specify the environment but is an intrinsic 
and structural feature of digital environments. Important here is 
that the uncertainty is irreducible: even right after checking my 
inbox (and hence reducing uncertainty about its state), I might go 
straight back to check again. Aranda and Baig (2018, p. 19:3) quote 
from an interview they conducted among excessive smartphone 
users:
“When I’m bored, I keep going into my news app and tapping 
the same article over and over, hoping for a new story to read.”
From the perspective of active inference, checking habits are 
a logical consequence of living in an environment that contains 
information channels that provide large irreducible amounts of 
uncertainty.
As mentioned above, the current analysis serves as a thinking 
tool rather than as a concrete model for human–technology inter-
action. The Markov Decision Processes currently in use work well 
in simple environments with simple tasks, but do not scale u well 
up to more complex behaviors. At least two questions stand in the 
way of scaling-up. One question pertains to policies and motor 
control, and the other to the nature of desired observations.
Policy selection and effort
A first question to ask is: which policies figure in the agent’s action 
selection process? In principle, the agent has a large (if not infinite) 
amount of policies available. One pragmatic option, prevalent in 
toy models of active inference, is to equip an agent with a lim-
ited set of policies that are relevant for its current task. Especially 
in MDP models, both the environments and the policies in play 
are rather abstract, glossing over motoric details (i.e. “move left,” 
“move up,” “stay put,” etc.). Although these simplifications work 
well enough for proof-of-principle simulations, they fall short 
when wanting to model ecological decision-making ( Cisek and 
Kalaska 2010; Cisek and Pastor-Bernier 2014; Pezzulo and Cisek 
2016).
In more ecological settings, the motoric details of the deci-
sion process matter. First of all, there is good evidence that action 
selection is a distributed process in which multiple selection pro-
cesses occur at the same time ( Cisek 2012). Cisek and Kalaska 
(2010) differentiate between “action selection,” the process of 
choosing between possible alternatives, and “action specification,” 
the process of specifying the parameters of possible action. Policy 
selection is hierarchical and parallel. More importantly, action 
specification does not just facilitate action selection (once the 
agent decides to reach, the parameters of its reaching are already 
specified), but also feeds back in action selection itself (if the 
reaching behavior is motorically more complex than the pointing 
behavior, the agent is more likely to select the pointing behavior).
The role of (expected) motoric effort in action selection has 
received relatively little attention in the literature on active
8 Bruineberg
inference.6 Only recently have models of decision-making started 
to incorporate the way (expected) effort modulates decision-
making (Rangel and Hare 2010; Lepora et al. 2015 ; Shadmehr 
et al. 2016; Pierrieau et al. 2021). Pierrieau et al. (2021) hypothe-
size based on their findings that “motor costs quickly modulate the 
early formation of action representations and/or the competition 
process taking place in parieto-frontal regions, and thus automat-
ically bias action selection, even when it is supposed to rely on 
abstract or cognitive rules” (p.2). This suggests that policy selec-
tion can be modulated by expected action costs. It seems possible 
to incorporate motor costs in the expected costs part of expected 
free energy, but, as far as I am aware, such models have not been 
developed.
What this points to, however, is a different lens through which 
the attention-grabbyness (in the salience sense) of digital tech-
nologies can be understood: digital technologies are “frictionless,” 
portable multi-tasking devices. They are frictionless in the sense 
that their use typically requires very simple and smooth motor 
actions (such as tapping and swiping), typically with one or more 
fingers. Because they are portable, they offer their action possibili-
ties everywhere and anytime regardless of place, time, or context. 
Moreover, because they are multi-tasking devices, they can be 
used for many different activities. Switching between different 
activities often requires just as much effort as continuing to do 
one and the same activity. For example, scrolling through the text I 
am writing and inserting a word requires a two-fingered swipe and 
a small number of taps on the keyboard. Switching from writing 
to scrolling through T witter requires a four-fingered swipe and a 
tip on the mousepad followed by a couple of taps on the keyboard. 
Looking up a chapter I cite in my reference manager is motorically 
just as complex as starting a completely unrelated task altogether.
The above suggests that if  action selection is modulated by 
expected effort, and if  switching to distracting activities is motor-
ically easier (or at least comparable in complexity) to staying on 
task, then the majority of our digital devices are set up to bias 
action selection toward distraction (or at least not away from it). 
This is not a case of hostile scaffolding in Timms and Spurrett’s 
(2022) sense of above, but just “bad scaffolding.” I will return to 
this point in the conclusion,
Motivation and control
The last point I want to consider is the nature of goals and desired 
observations in active inference. So far, I have simply assumed 
that an agent has “desired observations” that serve as a stan-
dard to measure the expected cost of particular policies (i.e. which 
of these policies brings me closest to my desired observations). 
In simple decision-making tasks taking desired observations for 
granted might be unproblematic: we might just assume that a 
particular observation (seeing the green dot at the end of the 
maze) is rewarding. In ecological settings, however, an agent typ-
ically has multiple “desires” at the same time at multiple levels 
of abstraction, where the relevance of each of those desires is 
itself dependent on current observations. This gives rise to what
Pezzulo et al. (2018) call a “multidimensional drive-to-goal prob-
lem.” For example, if I am (following the logic of expected free-
energy minimization) on my way to the bakery to satisfy my 
desired observation of tasting pastry, I might happen to come 
across an old friend. In such a case, I should be able to revise my 
desired observation and prioritize my (until then latent) desire to 
6 A first step has been recently made by Parr et al. (2023), who use active 
inference to model “cognitive” effort, operationalized as the effort to resist a 
mental habit.
see my friend, such that I start talking to her, instead of passing 
her by and racing to the bakery. 7 The sudden achievability of a 
different desire than the one that is currently driving my behavior 
should make me switch my priorities. Hence, goals and desires are 
themselves adaptive, and their relevance is dependent on context.
From the perspective of active inference, the relevance of a 
particular desired observation is given by its associated precision 
(Pezzulo et al. 2018). A precise expectation of tasting pastry will 
guide policy selection toward a bakery, sidestepping any possibil-
ity to resolve ambiguity along the way. Pezzulo et al. (2018) propose 
to model multidimensional drive-to-goal problems by means of a 
theory of “motivated control.” The authors propose two function-
ally separate but interacting hierarchies: a control hierarchy and 
a motivation hierarchy. The control hierarchy captures the causal 
regularities in the environment ranging in complexity from senso-
rimotor contingencies to more abstract beliefs like knowing there 
is typically a line at the bakery on Saturday mornings. The moti-
vation hierarchy ranges in complexity from a craving for carbs, to 
wanting to eat less sugar, to more abstract desires like wanting to 
be a sociable person.
At the basic (sensorimotor) level, action policies compete with 
one another, and their competition is biased (or contextualized) by 
higher level states (themselves in competition with one another). 
The resulting choice architecture has strong affinities with ear-
lier mentioned competition models (Desimone and Duncan 1995; 
Cisek 2007; Cisek and Kalaska 2010).
The novelty of Pezzulo et al. (2018) with respect to these ear-
lier models is the way the authors make explicit the functional 
integration between the control hierarchy and the motivation hier-
archy. Motivational states like “I should eat less sugar” will, if 
inferred to be relevant, bias expectations away from going to 
the bakery. Importantly, if active inference is right, the higher-
level contextual goal-states do not come from above, but are 
themselves learned and inferred, in part based on behavior. As a 
consequence, the authors propose that making progress toward a 
goal (i.e. approaching the bakery) increases the precision of beliefs 
about policies that achieve the goal (i.e. “apparently I want to get 
pastry”). The authors write:
Thus, when precision is itself inferred, successful goal-directed 
behaviour creates a form of positive feedback between control 
and motivational processes. […] Intuitively, it is sometimes dif-
ficult to start a new task, but once progress has been made, it 
becomes difficult to give it up – even when the reward is small. 
A possible explanation is that, as goal proximity increases, its 
inferred achievability increases – with precision – hence placing 
a premium on the policy above and beyond of its pragmatic 
value. (Pezzulo et al. 2018, p. 302)
The loopy dynamics between control and motivation consti-
tutes an intricate case of motivated reasoning, in which the agent 
both starts to do what it wants but also starts to want what is likely 
to happen: I want the pastry in part “because” it is in front of my 
nose.
The upshot of the motivated control model is that both “achiev-
ability” and “goal-proximity” bias salience. An agent’s action selec-
tion is primed toward what is achievable. This is a mechanism 
that allows an agent to effectively switch courses of action: the 
immediate achievability of talking to my friend increases the 
motivational precision of wanting to be a sociable person, and 
7 When taken in at full force, the problematic amounts to the “frame prob-
lem” or the “relevance problem” (Dreyfus 1992; Wheeler 2008; Rietveld 2012; 
2016; Shanahan 2016).
Adversarial inference  9
decreases the precision of craving sugar, constituting an atten-
tional shift in the relevance of particular motivational states. This 
capacity to interrupt what one is currently doing in order to satisfy 
a more urgent or achievable goal seems central to the motivational 
economy of any agent that needs to satisfy multiple goals or needs 
over time ( Simon 1994 ). However, the same mechanism allows 
for distraction: a biasing away from what one is currently doing, 
and toward an easier achievable activity with its own kind of
“reward.”
Remember that in Eyal’s “Hooked” model (Eyal 2014), the ulti-
mate aim is to create an association between a user’s need and the 
use of a company’s product as a source of relief. In the context of 
active inference, this amounts to a motivational state that, when 
inferred, directly biases action selection toward particular poli-
cies. An association between, say, anxiety about social status and 
T witter-likes, will, whenever the anxiety plays up, lead to precise 
expectations about the policies that bring about T witter-scrolling. 
More speculatively (but in line with the motivated control model), 
prolonged T witter use will in turn enhance the relevance of the 
motivational state (“If I spent so much time on T witter, apparently 
social status is important to me”). At any rate, the learned associa-
tions between motivational states and action policies forms what 
Eyal calls an “internal trigger”: an urge to act that is not directly 
prompted by any aspect of the environment.
Conclusion
In his book Stand Out of Our Light, James Williams (2018) calls the 
liberation of human attention the “defining moral and political 
struggle of our time” (xii). Attention is intimately tied to notions 
such as agency, autonomy, and self-determination. I agree. It is 
therefore of utmost importance that the debate on the atten-
tion economy operates with a plausible account of attention, and 
with a specific understanding of what it is about our current 
environments that undermines attention.
In presenting the current debate on the attention economy, I 
have articulated three desiderata of a theory of attention (wrapped 
up as criticisms of the dominant account). First of all, any the-
ory of attention should avoid “attention nostalgia,” the idea that 
in the information-scarce days (before mass media) controlling 
one’s attention was easy. This was evidently not the case (Kreiner 
2023). Second, a theory of attention should be able to articulate 
what it is about our current environments that makes paying 
attention to the relevant things more difficult. The information-
scarcity account points to the sheer “amount” of information in 
our environments that makes attention more difficult to control, 
due to added “pressure” on the bottleneck from perception to cen-
tral cognition. And third, an account of attention should be able 
to accommodate the fact that many instances of distraction are 
not driven by salient stimuli. Models of digital technology-related 
habits emphasize the importance of “internal triggers,” urges to 
bring about an application in the absence of stimuli.
Selection for action models operate with an account according 
to which attention is tightly integrated with an agent’s ongo-
ing interactions with its environment. Attention is said to be 
an “emergent property” or “outcome” of a more fundamental 
selection process. In particular, active inference provides a set 
of tools to develop an “anatomy” of different forms of attention. 
One central distinction in this literature is between “attention as 
gain” and “attention as salience.” While “attention as gain” involves 
the weighting of evidence in updating one’s current hypothesis, 
“attention as salience” is central to action selection, and it is here 
that active inference has a number of insights to offer.
First of all, active inference can make sense of explicitly adver-
sarial or hostile scenarios in which the environment actively infers 
the state of the agent to provide it with content that satisfies the 
environment’s (and not the agent’s) goals. Such cases of adver-
sarial inference well documented in the gambling industry, and 
the timelines presented by digital environments provide plausible 
candidates for such hostile scaffolding.
But active inference provides insight into more ways in which 
digital environments reorganize “attention as salience.” In this 
paper, I have focused on three: I have focused on the central 
role that novelty and the expectation of novelty plays in action 
selection. Second, I have focused on the role that motor costs, 
or friction, plays in action selection: action selection is biased 
toward actions that involve less expected effort. The third insight 
pertains to the way in which the motivation and achievability of 
actions interact. The salience of actions is dependent on one’s 
current motivational state, but the motivational state is itself 
dependent on the perception of the environment and on one’s 
current activities.
Taken together, these aspects of active inference can make 
intelligible that, besides the overtly indubitably adversarial and 
hostile aspects of digital engagement, there is a profound mis-
match between the kind of agent’s that we are, and the kind of 
environments that we inhabit. As active inference agents, we are 
not well “equipped” to deal with environments that present fric-
tionless engagement (including frictionless task-switching), prac-
tically infinite amounts of easily accessible novelty, highly variable 
reward, and content that taps into different motivations. The chal-
lenges users encounter with digital technologies are therefore not 
specifically about information-overload or irresistible content, but 
more about the continuous availability of easily available novelty 
and achievable rewards.
8
To contrast, there is a certain way of thinking about agency 
and action selection on which carrying low-effort, maximum-
possibility devices with us all day makes a lot of sense. If I know 
firmly what I want to achieve, then a device that helps me real-
ize my preferences with as little effort as possible will generally 
be a good thing. Jan Slaby dubs such thinking about the mind a 
“user/resource model”:
Baseline mentality in many of the example cases under dis-
cussion is that of a fully conscious individual cognizer (“user”) 
who sets about pursuing a well-defined task through inten-
tional employment of a piece of equipment or exploitation of 
an environmental structure (“resource”). (Slaby 2016, p. 5)
Following this model, there is a clear division of labor between 
user and technology: the “user” brings the goals, and the tech-
nology simplifies the means by which the goals can be achieved. 
In some cases, devices are designed and (particularly) branded as 
“autonomy-enhancing” exactly because they minimize the effort 
it takes to perform a task.
9
If active inference is right, we are not such agents.
8 One reviewer is right to point out that information-overload is not nec-
essarily at odds with the current account. After all, environments with large 
amounts of novelty will also need to be rich in information. I hope to have made 
clear that the decisive factor for attention and distraction is the structure and 
dynamics of information, rather than the sheer amount. Libraries are filled with 
information, but this information is not structured in a way that fosters distrac-
tion: it does not make sense to develop a checking habit for a particular page 
of a book.

channel surfing for an especially vivid example.
