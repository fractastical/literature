Highlights 29 
 Active net-tDCS groups showed better inhibitory control compared to the sham group. 30 
 Stronger increase in hypothalamic functional co nnectivity associated with better 31 
inhibitory control after active net-tDCS.  32 
 No differences were found between the active net -tDCS and sham groups for total 33 
kilocaloric intake. 34 
 Anodal net-tDCS showed lower sweet food intake compared to the sham group. 35 
Abstract 36 
Background Reduced inhibitory control is associated with obesity and neuroimaging studies 37 
indicate that diminished prefrontal cortex activity influence eating behavior and metabolism . 38 
The hypothalamus regulates energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to cortical and 39 
subcortical regions especially the frontal areas. 40 
Objectives We tested network -targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net -tDCS) to 41 
influence the excitability of brain regions involved in appetite control. 42 
Methods In a ra ndomized, double-blind parallel group design, 44 adults with overweight or 43 
obesity (BMI 30.6 kg/m 2, 52.3 % female) received active ( anodal or cathodal ) or sham 12-44 
channel net -tDCS on the hypothalamus appetite -control network for 25 minutes on three 45 
consecutive days while performing a Stop-Signal-Task to measure response inhibition. Before 46 
and after stimulation, state questionnaires assessed changes in desire to eat and food craving. 47 
Directly after stimulation, participants received a breakfast buffet to eva luate ad-libitum food 48 
intake. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted at follow-up. Resting-state functional MRI 49 
was obtained at baseline and follow-up. 50 
Results The Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) was shorter in both active groups versus sham, 51 
indicating improved response inhibition. Additionally, a stronger increase in hypothalamic 52 
functional connectivity was associated with shorter SSRT. Caloric intake of sweet food was 53 
lower in the anodal group versus sham, but no main effects between groups were o bserved on 54 
total and macronutrient intake, food craving ratings and desire to eat. At follow -up, no 55 
differences were observed between groups on peripheral metabolism. 56 
Conclusion Our study suggests that modulating hypothalamic functional network 57 
connectivity patterns via net-tDCS may improve food choice and inhibitory control.  58

1. Introduction 96 
The prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016, representing one of the leading 97 
causes of morbidity and mortality  [1]. Obesity is highly linked with an increased risk for 98 
numerous health conditions , notably cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance and the 99 
development of  type-2 diabetes (T2DM) [2]. Its etiology  is co mplex and includes genetic, 100 
environmental, social and behavioral factors and the interactions among those  [3] with a 101 
suspected significant contribution of the brain [4; 5].  102 
In the long run, various obesity prevention and treatment approaches have demonstrated only 103 
limited success  [2]. Among current interventions, bariatric surgery and pharmacological 104 
therapies represent the most effective approach es for significant weight loss  and weight 105 
maintenance. Moreover, recent pharmacological therapies, particularly glucagon-like peptide 1 106 
(GLP1) receptor agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP1 107 
receptor co -agonists have shown promising results  by targeting brain circuits  involved in 108 
appetite control [6]. However, these interventions are not universally applicable and  do not 109 
serve a preventive role, highlighting the need for new prevention approaches reducing obesity 110 
rates and maintain long-term weight management.  111 
Thereby, the brain plays a pivotal role in regulating eating behavior wherein its altered response 112 
to peripheral hormones and external food cues increases the vulnerability to obesity [5; 7] . 113 
Central to this regulation is the hypothalamus, a key regulator of energy homeostasis, which is 114 
functionally connected to brain areas important for rew ard processing, food perception  and 115 
cognitive control such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and the striatum [8]. 116 
Neuroimaging studies in persons with overweight or obesity have identified modifications in 117 
these areas on a local and network level [for review [9–11]]. Specifically, the hypothalamus 118 
exhibits attenuated functional connectivity (FC) to brain regions crucial f or cognitive control 119 
over food intake and increased FC to areas involved in reward [12; 13]. Moreover, persons with 120 
obesity show elevated food cue reactivity in brain regions important for reward and gustatory 121 
processing [14].  122 
Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress a prepotent response (e.g. [15; 16] ). 123 
Accordingly, impairments in dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity are associated with  reduced 124 
inhibitory control  and higher impulsivity , which plays a role in t he development and 125 
maintenance of obesity [17–19]. For instance, individuals with overweight  or obesity showed 126 
lower FC between the hypothalamus and the dlPFC [13] and exhibit poorer performance in an 127 
inhibitory control task  [20–22]. On the other hand, evidence from a functional magnetic 128

resonance imaging (f MRI) study showed that increasing FC of the dlPFC enhanced control 129 
mechanisms related to food intake  [23] and is related to better food choices  [24]. Taken 130 
together, findings suggest that the br ain activation is a predictor for dietary success [25] and 131 
understanding these connections offers profound insights into the neurobiological 132 
underpinnings of dietary habits and obesity. 133 
Changing excitability of these brain areas may result in the modulation of food intake behavior 134 
and cognitive functions. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) serves as a non-invasive 135 
tool for neurostimulation to alter spontaneous firing rate and excitability of cortical neurons in 136 
the brain [26] to increase (anodal) or decrease (cathodal) resting membrane potential in neurons 137 
[27].  138 
Several studies have shown that  tDCS enhanced inhibitory control  [28–30] reduced food 139 
craving and binge-eating episodes [31–37], especially for sweet foods [33; 35; 36; 38], lowered 140 
food intake [31; 39] and improved glucose metabolism  [40–42]. Despite encouraging results, 141 
not all studies showed an effect of tDCS on food -related outcomes  [for review see [43]], 142 
possibly due to inconsistency of stimulation parameters, large variation in experimental settings 143 
[44; 45] and inter-subject variations [46]. Moreover, previous efforts have mainly focused on 144 
stimulating isolated brain region, usually the dlPFC [43], without taking the interplay among 145 
various brain regions into account.  146 
The hypothalamic FC network could be an ideal target for influencing eating behavior, reward 147 
and inhibitory control due to its functional connections to striatal and prefrontal regions. Using 148 
multiple small-sized electrodes, it is possible to target an entire brain network. This is referred 149 
to as network (net)-tDCS [47; 48]. Our recent pilot study [49] showed promising results with 150 
enhanced inhibitory control after anodal net-tDCS stimulation of this hypothalamus appetite-151 
control network. This network covered areas of the dlPFC, ventromedial PFC, inferior frontal 152 
gyrus (IFG) and limbic regions that are critical for reward processes and decision making.  153 
The current study examined net-tDCS targeting the hypothalamus appetite-control network to 154 
modify inhibitory control, food intake , food craving , and desire to eat in individuals with 155 
overweight or obesity and at high ri sk to develop T2DM . Given limited research on cathodal 156 
stimulation in this context, both anodal and cathodal forms were included. We hypothesized 157 
that the anodal net-tDCS group will show: (i) higher inhibitory control, as measured by the 158 
Stop-Signal Task (SST); (ii) lower caloric intake, food craving and desire to eat and; (iii) higher 159 
peripheral insulin sensitivity derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) compared to 160 
those receiving sham or cathodal stimulation.  For this purpose, w e conducted a randomized, 161 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in parallel group design with resting-state fMRI as well 162

2. Materials and Methods 165 
2.1 Study population 166 
Men and women with overweight or obesity  were recruited via email at the University Clinic 167 
Tübingen in Germany.  Volunteers were eligible to participate if they met the following 168 
inclusion criteria: age between 20 to 65 years; body mass inde x (BMI) between 25.5 and 39 169 
kg/m2 with a waist circumference of ≥ 80 cm in women and ≥ 94 cm in men; stable body weight 170 
(weight gain or loss ≤ 5 kg within 3 months). The exclusion criteria were: manifest T2DM ; 171 
insufficient knowledge of the German language;  pregnancy or lactation; history of severe 172 
mental or somatic disorders including neurological disease; drug or alcohol abuse; hemoglobin 173 
values ≤ 12g/dl for women and ≤ 14g/dl for men; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contra-174 
indications; participation in a lifestyle intervention or pharmaceutical study. Written informed 175 
consent was obtained from all partici pants. The ethics committee of the University Hospital 176 
Tübingen approved the study protocol (project number: 243/2019BO1) and it was registered on 177 
ClinicalTrials-gov (registration number: NCT04420650). The trial was carried out from May 178 
26, 2020, until September 28, 2023, according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.  179 
2.2 Experimental design and procedure 180 
The study was conducted as a double -blind, parallel-group design , sham -controlled trial 181 
comparing active ( anodal or cathodal ) net-tDCS versus sham . The experimental design is 182 
depicted in Fig. 1 (reporting checklist for tDCS studies is shown in Suppl. Table 1). In short, 183 
participants attended a total of five visits and were screened for eligibility criteria via phone 184 
prior to the baseline visit. At baseline, participants were interviewed for pre-existing psychiatric 185 
and neurological conditions during a detailed medical history  assessment, followed by 186 
determination of body weight, body size, waist circumference and hip circumference. 187 
Participants underwent a resting -state fMRI  and completed a series of psychometric 188 
questionnaires (see Suppl. Methods for questionnaire information) . Following, thre e 189 
consecutive visits were conducted 7 to 76 days after the baseline visit . Participants were 190 
assigned using a block randomization method  into either the anodal  net-tDCS, cathodal net -191 
tDCS or sham group . At the visits, participants, who were instructed to f ast for 4 -6 hours 192 
beforehand, arrived between 11:00 am and 3:00 pm  and completed a battery of state 193 
questionnaires, namely Food Craving Questionnaire – State (FCQ-S), Desire to eat Visual 194 
Analogue Scale (VAS) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) (pre net-tDCS, see 195

Suppl. Methods for questionnaire information ). This was  followed by 25 minutes of either 196 
anodal, cathodal, or sham net-tDCS. During stimulation, participants completed a SST for 20 197 
minutes. Subsequently, they repeated the state questionnaire battery (post net-tDCS) and filled 198 
out a questionnaire evaluating any side effects that may have occurred during stimulation. After 199 
the net-tDCS treatment, participants were left alone in an examination room where an ad libitum 200 
buffet was provided for 30 minutes. The follow -up took place one day after the last visit and 201 
included the same procedures as the baseline visit, followed by a 75-g oGTT.  202 
2.3 Network transcranial direct current stimulation 203 
Stimulation aimed to modulate the hypothalamus appetite control  network and  stimulation 204 
montage was d erived as described prev iously [49]. In brief, electrode position and current 205 
strength were determined using the Stimweaver TM algorithm [50], which resulted in a 12 -206 
channel optimization. The target network was defined based on the correlation strength of the 207 
resting-state FC network of the hypothalamus  on the Neurosynth website 208 
(https://neurosynth.org/locations/6_2_-10_6/). Stimulation was applied using a network -209 
targeted multichannel tDCS device (Starstim® 32, Neuroelectrics Barcelona S.L.U., Barcelona, 210 
Spain) controlled by the  corresponding NIC 2.0  software ( NIC2 v2.0.11, 211 
https://www.neuroelectrics.com/resources/software). Twelve circular Ag/AgCl gelled 212 
electrodes were fitted into a neoprene cap (Neoprene Headcap, Neuroelectics Barcelona S.L.U., 213 
Barcelona, Spain)  at positions defined by the  international 10-20 EEG system ( see Suppl. 214 
Table 2  for details on  electrode placement, current intensities and current density).  Prior 215 
stimulation, the scalp at the electrode positions was gently rubbed with a cotton swab soaked in 216 
alcohol in order to increase cur rent conductivity. Net-tDCS was aimed to activate (anodal) or 217 
inhibit (cathodal) the functional connected brain areas of the hypothalamus . Active net-tDCS 218 
was delivered for 25 min, including a 15 s ramp -up and 60 s ramp-down at the beginning and 219 
end of the session. The maximum total injected current was limited to 4 mA, with each electrode 220 
delivering up to 2 mA  (in absolute value) . A reference electrode for the return current was 221 
attached to the participant's ear. In the sham stimulation, the procedures were identical except 222 
that the current was only active during the ramp -up and ramp -down phases using the anodal 223 
protocol to simulate the sensation of stimulation . Impedance was kept below 10 kΩ to reduce 224 
skin sensation.  225 
2.3.1 Blinding and Tolerability of net-tDCS 226 
Blinding was ensured by using the NIC 2.0 software  (Neuroelectrics Barcelona S.L.U., 227 
Barcelona, Spain), with both the investigator and participant unaware of the particular protocol 228

being used, which was generically named and activated with a password by a third party in 229 
‘double-blind’ mode. At follow-up, participants were asked what stimulation (active or sham) 230 
they believed was delivered during the sessions.  231 
Side effects during net-tDCS were evaluated using a 100 mm VAS directly after the session. 232 
Questions included the specification of common possible side effects (itching, tingling, pain, 233 
exhaustion and nausea). Moreover, participants were asked on a 100 mm VAS, ‘Overall, how 234 
uncomfortable was the stimulation for you?’  (i.e., discomfort). A blank line was included for 235 
any other side effects not mentioned as VAS.  236 
2.4 Stop-Signal task 237 
For measuring response inhibition during net -tDCS, the SST by CANTAB  (Cambridge 238 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) was applied simultaneously to the stimulation for 239 
20 minutes. 240 
The Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) was used as the primary outcome parameter. For the 241 
task, participants were instructed to press a button on the left or right edge of a tablet computer 242 
screen using their corresponding index finger, reacting as swiftly as possible, every time an 243 
arrow in the screens’ center pointed to the left or right site. In 25 % of the cases, an additional 244 
auditory signal (beep sound) was presented, signalling the participant to withhold the pre-potent 245 
response (response inhibition). The experiment includes a 16-item trial block and a total of five 246 
test blocks, each block consisting of 64 trials. The  task uses a staircase design to dynamically 247 
adjust to the participants’ perfo rmance, leading to a success rate of 50  % for inhibition. The 248 
SSRT is calculated by a stochastic model that takes into account the average reaction time in 249 
runs without a stop signal, as well as the t ime interval between visual and auditory signal in 250 
which the participant is still able to successfully inhibit in 50 % of cases [51].  251 
2.5 Oral glucose tolerance test 252 
All participants underwent during follow-up an oGTT with a standardized 75 g glucose solution 253 
(ACCU-Check® Dextro, Roche, Germany). At six timepoints (pre and 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 254 
min), blood samples were taken to determine glucose and insulin. Blood glucose was measured 255 
via the glucose dehydrogenase method using a HemoCue blood glucose photometer 256 
(HemoCueAB, Aengelholm, Sweden). Levels of plasma insulin were determined by using 257 
chemiluminesence assays for ADVIA Centaur (Siemens Medical Solutions, Fernwald, 258 
Germany). 259

2.6 Ad-libitum food buffet 260 
Ad libitum food consumption was measured using a standardized buffet, which comprised of a 261 
vast collection of food items ( Suppl. Table 3 for weight and nutritional information). 262 
Participants were instructed to eat as much as they liked within 30 minutes. During this time , 263 
they were not allowed to interact with their mobile phone or comparable devices to avoid 264 
distractions. Participants were told that they could take left over bakery goods home. Food items 265 
were weighted before and after buffet. For calorie intake evaluation , total calorie intake and 266 
kilocalories (kcal) intake from marcronu trients were used . Caloric intake by s weet food was 267 
separately analyzed, with the analysis being based on the percentage of calories from swee t 268 
foods relative to the total kcal intake from each participant. The analysis included the following 269 
items: apple filled pastry, chocolate croissant, pastry with with poppy seed filling, cocoa powder 270 
for chocolate milk, sugar, apple juice, apple, banana, h oney, strawberry jam, hazelnut spread 271 
(Nutella), raspberry joghurt, chocolate and vanilla pudding. 272 
2.7 Functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition 273 
Functional fMRI data of the whole brain were collected  at baseline and follow-up using a 3.0 274 
T sca nner (Magnetom Prisma, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany)  with a 20 -275 
channel head coil . Functional resting -state data were obtained by using simultaneous multi –276 
band sequence. The following sequence parameters were used: Acceleration factor = 4; TR = 277 
1.18s; TE = 34ms; FOV = 205 mm2; flip angle 65°; voxel size 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm 3; slice 278 
thickness 2.5 mm; The images were acquired in an interleaved order. The total scan period was 279 
3 minutes and 56 seconds, with each brain volume consi sting of 60 slices and each functional 280 
run containing 200 image volumes. Moreover, high-resolution T1 weighted anatomical images 281 
(MP2RAGE: 192 slices, matrix: 256 x 240, 1 x 1 x 1 mm3) of the brain were acquired.  282 
2.8 Resting-state fMRI Data preprocessing and analyses 283 
Analyses of resting state fMRI data were performed using CONN  [52] release 22.a [53] and 284 
SPM [54] release 12.7771 (see Suppl. Material). First-level analysis: Seed-based connectivity 285 
maps (SBC) were estimated characterizing the patterns of functional connectivity with the 286 
hypothalamus seed and the rest of the brain. The hypothalamus seed was defined as MNI 287 
coordinate x = 6, y = 2, z = -10, including a 4 mm sphere according to our previous published 288 
research [49]. Functional connectivity strength was represented by Fisher-transformed bivariate 289 
correlation coefficients from a weighted general linear model (we ighted-GLM), modeling the 290 
association between their BOLD signal timeseries. The regions of the hypothalamic FC network 291 
were defined based on the hypothalamic resting -state FC pattern 292

thresholded mask was binarized and SBC with the hypothalamus seed and the mask was 294 
computed. The values were extracted from the participant’s first level SBC analysis.  295 
2.9 Statistical analysis 296 
Data is presented as mean and stand ard deviation [ SD] unless otherwise stated. Statistical 297 
analysis was performed using the program R (R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29 ucrt), https://cran.r-298 
project.org/bin/windows/base/) for statistical computing and graphics . Statistical significance 299 
was set at p ≤ 0.05. The normality of the data distribution was tested using the Shapiro‒Wilk 300 
test. When data was not normally distributed, parameters were log -transformed prior analysis 301 
or non-parametrical analyses were conducted.  302 
Blinding efficiency as well as d ifferences in side effects between study visits  were analyzed 303 
using a Friedman-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. For post -hoc comparisons, Dunn -Bonferroni 304 
corrections were used.  305 
To compare demographics and scores of psychol ogical questionnaires, an ANOVA or a 306 
Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A Fisher’s exact test was examined to compare sex ratio.  307 
To analyze the effect of net-tDCS on eating behavior (state questionnaires and food intake) and 308 
response inhibition, we conducted l inear mixed effects models (LMER) employing the lmer 309 
function of the lme4 package in R. Net-tDCS visits (visit 1, visit 2, visit 3) and net-tDCS group 310 
(sham, anodal, cathodal) were entered as fixed effects in all  of these  models. We used the 311 
extracted FC v alues to evaluate whether changes in resting -state FC of the hypothalamus 312 
appetite-control network (follow-up minus baseline) show an interaction with the changes in 313 
SSRT. In this exploratory analysis, the changes in hypothalamic FC from baseline to follow-up 314 
were considered as fixed effects. Sham and visit 1 were defined as reference category.  315 
Participants were included as random factor to account for  varying intercepts between 316 
participants. To evaluate the effects on peripheral metabolism, we used the lm function of the 317 
stats package in R. Here, condition (sham, anodal, cathodal) were entered as fixed effects in all 318 
models and sham was defined as reference category.  319 
To identify the best -fitting model, we employed a stepwise model approach with the Akaike 320 
Information Criterion (AIC) as basis for the selection. See Suppl. Table 4 for the model 321 
selection procedures. The general covariates tested across different analyses included age and 322 
sex. In more specific analyses, the following covariates were tested: For macronutrient intake, 323 
considered covariates were BMI, total kcal intake, and the time period since the last meal (in 324 
minutes) prior to net -tDCS. For sweet food intake, the covariates tested were BMI, total kcal 325 
intake, and the time  period since the last meal (in minutes) prior to net -tDCS. For state 326

questionnaires, baseline values were considered. For total kcal intake, BMI and the time period 327 
since the last meal (in minutes) prior to net -tDCS were tested. Residuals of the models were 328 
investigated to assess normality and homoscedasticity. To check multicollinearity, we used the 329 
check_collinearity function in the performance package. Results were printed via the tab_model 330 
function in the sjPlot package. Figures were created using the ggplot2 and ggeffects packages.  331 
3. Results 332 
3.1 Participants 333 
Sixty-six men and women were eligible for the study and forty-four participants were included 334 
in the final analysis ( 36.3 years, BMI 30.6 kg/m 2, 52.3  % female) . The CONSORT flow 335 
diagram for the recruitment process is s hown in Suppl. Fig. 1. Participants’ baseline and 336 
anthropometric characteristics are reported in Table 1. No significant difference between net-337 
tDCS groups were observed in sex ratio, age, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip 338 
circumference, waist-to-hip r atio ( WHR), body -fat content  and number of days between 339 
baseline and follow-up. In addition, there were no statistical differences in eating behavior trait 340 
profiles between stimulation groups (Suppl. Table 5).  341 
3.2 Blinding and tolerability 342 
Participants were not able to distinguish active net-tDCS from sham net-tDCS (χ²(4) = 2.28, p 343 
= 0.685). Suppl. Table 6 gives an overview of the net-tDCS groups and the participants’ guess. 344 
Active and sham net-tDCS was well tolerated and no participant withdrew from the study due 345 
to side effects. There was no significant difference with respect to  side effects between net-346 
tDCS groups (see Suppl. Results and Suppl. Table 7 for statistical analysis ). We fou nd 347 
significant effects of visit;  There was a significant difference for the anodal group regarding 348 
discomfort (χ²(2) = 7.35, p = 0.025) with higher values at visit 2 compared to visit 1 (p adjust= 349 
0.043). Moreover, there was a significant difference in the cathodal group ( χ²(2) = 7.00, p = 350 
0.030) showing post-hoc higher itching values at visit 1 compared to visit 3 (padjust= 0.024). 351 
3.3 Response inhibition 352 
There was a significant main effect of net -tDCS on the SSRT for sham vs. anodal net -tDCS 353 
(Estimate = -0.12, 95%, CI [ -0.19 – -0.04], p  = 0.004) and sham vs. cathodal net -tDCS 354 
(Estimate = -0.12, 95%, CI [-0.20 – -0.04], p = 0.005), indicating a greater response inhibition 355 
for active net-tDCS. Age was a significant predictor, indicating a higher SSRT with increasing 356

age (Estimate = 0.04, 95%, CI [0.01 – 0.06], p = 0.004). No effects of sex was observed. The 357 
raw values of the SSRT for all visits and net-tDCS groups are available in Suppl. Table 8. 358 
Since we recently reported that net-tDCS effects on SSRT are associated with hypothalamic FC 359 
[49], we investigated in an exploratory analysis whether the change in hypothalamic FC from 360 
baseline to follow -up interacts with the net-tDCS induced effect on SSRT. As in the 361 
aforementioned model, we found a significant main effect for sham vs. anodal net -tDCS 362 
(Estimate = -0.13, 95%, CI [ -0.20 – -0.06], p < 0.001) and sham vs. cathodal net -tDCS 363 
(Estimate = -0.12, 95%, CI [ -0.19 – -0.04], p = 0.00 2). Moreover, w e found a significant 364 
interaction for anodal net-tDCS × change in hypothalamic FC (Estimate = -1.27, CI [-2.07 – -365 
0.48], p = 0.002) and cathodal net-tDCS × change in hypothalamic FC (Estimate = -0.67, CI [-366 
1.31 – -0.03], p = 0.039;  Fig. 2 a-c and Suppl. Table 9 ). This  indicates that an increase in 367 
hypothalamic FC from baseline to follow -up was related to better response inhibition  in the 368 
active net-tDCS groups compared to sham. 369 
3.4 Food consumption 370 
No significant main effect of net-tDCS group on total intake (kcal) was observed for sham vs. 371 
anodal net-tDCS (Estimate = -108.64, CI = [-519.61 – 302.32], p = 0.602) or sham vs. cathodal 372 
net-tDCS (Estimate = 72.19, [CI = -346.20 – 490.58], p = 0.733); Suppl. Table 10). There was 373 
no effect of visit. Sex was a significant predictor with male participants showing a higher kcal 374 
intake compared to women (Estimate = 752.14, [CI = 412.28 – 1092.00], p < 0.001). Food 375 
intake in kcal for all three visits and net -tDCS groups are shown in Suppl. Table 11 and Fig. 376 
3a-d. 377 
For macronutrient intake, no main effect for sham vs. anodal net -tDCS and sham vs. cathodal 378 
net-tDCS was observed (all p > 0.05; Suppl. Table 12). For carbohydrate intake, there was a 379 
significant interaction effect of cathodal net-tDCS x visit 3 (Estimate = -65.15, [CI = -128.09 – 380 
-2.20], p = 0.043, Fig. 3e). Hence participants of the sham net-tDCS group consumed more 381 
calories during visit 3 compared to visit 1, while the cathodal stimulated group showed no rise 382 
in kcal over time.  Moreover, for protein intake, there was a significant interaction effect of 383 
anodal net-tDCS x visit 3 (Estimate = 18.06, [CI = 0.56 – 35.56], p = 0.043) and cathodal net-384 
tDCS x visit 3 (Estimate = 25.90, [CI = 8.10 – 43.71], p = 0.005, Fig. 3f). Hence, participants 385 
in the sham group consumed  less protein during visit 3 compared to visit 1, while the active 386 
tDCS groups showed no reduction in comparison.  Anodal tDCS has previously been reported 387 
to decrease craving or appetite for sweet foods [33; 35; 36; 38] . Therefore, as an exploratory 388 
analysis, we evaluated if sham vs. active net-tDCS was related to lower  sweet food intake . 389 
Results showed a significant main effect for sham vs. anodal net-tDCS (Estimate = -8.06, [CI 390

= -15.61 – -0.50], p = 0.037; Fig. 4a-b) but not for sham vs. cathodal net-tDCS (Estimate = -391 
7.56, [CI = -15.25 – 0.13], p = 0.054; Suppl. Table 13), indicating a higher sweet food intake 392 
for sham vs. anodal but not cathodal net-tDCS. Moreover, total intake (kcal) was a significant 393 
predictor (Estimate = 0.01, [CI = 0.00 – 0.01], p = 0.006).  394 
3.5 State questionnaires 395 
Baseline ratings for desire to eat, FCQ-S values and PANAS did not differ between groups (see 396 
Suppl. Table 14 for baseline values and analysi s). No main effects for sham vs. anodal net -397 
tDCS and sham vs. cathodal net-tDCS for desire to eat ratings, FCQ-S and positive and negative 398 
affect of the PANAS questionnaire were found (all p > 0.05; Suppl. Table 15).  399 
3.6 Glucose metabolism 400 
There was no significant main effect of net-tDCS groups on metabolic parameters (all p > 0.05). 401 
The raw metabolic values  (insulin sensitivity index (ISI) Matsuda, glycohemoglobin A1c  402 
(HbA1c), fasting insulin/glucose, oGTT -derived 2 hour glucose/insulin and triglycerides) 403 
divided by net-tDCS groups are shown in Table 2. Parameter estimates for the fixed effects , 404 
based on the linear models are presented in Suppl. Table 16.  405 
4. Discussion 406 
Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) such as tDCS is an emerging tool for improving 407 
cognitive control over eating in individuals with overweight or obesity. Unlike earlier studies 408 
focusing on single brain areas, net-tDCS targets entire brain networks. Our study examined net-409 
tDCS effec ts on the hypothalamus appetite -control network. Stimulation was effectively 410 
blinded and well tolerated. Our results suggest enhanced inhibitory control and lower caloric 411 
intake from sweet food after active net-tDCS compared to sham , with strongest effects after 412 
anodal stimulation. Additionally, increased hypothalamic FC predicted better inhibitory control 413 
performance in both anodal and cathodal net-tDCS groups.  414 
Overall, our findings imply that especially anodal net -tDCS of the hypothalamus appetite 415 
control network can modulate eating behavi or and cognitive control. The association between 416 
increased hypothalamic FC and enhanced inhibitory control further substantiates the specificity 417 
of the stimulation for the intended brain network. 418 
4.1 Active net-tDCS related to better inhibitory control 419 
We previously showed in a pilot study an improved response inhibition after anodal net -tDCS 420 
compared to sham in a within-subject design in persons with overweight or obesity [49]. Here, 421 
we could replicate these effects for anodal net-tDCS, supporting our hypothesis that net-tDCS 422

targeting the hypothalamus appetite -control network can result in better cognitive functions 423 
related to inhibitory control. Notably, in contrast to our earlier trial, we also revealed better 424 
inhibitory control in the cathodal net-tDCS group compared to sham. In fact, previous research 425 
questioned the simple dichotomy of anodal-excitation and cathodal-inhibition effects, which is 426 
rarely seen in cognitive studies [55] and cognitive performance was shown to be improved 427 
using cathodal tDCS [for overview [56]]. Moreover, Batsikadze et al. [57] demonstrated that 428 
low current of 1 mA cathodal tDCS decreased corticospinal excitability while higher current (2 429 
mA) was associated with excitatory effects. The present study stimulated with a total injected 430 
current of 4 mA and was aimed to stimulate a brain network , potentially leading to excitatory 431 
effects during the cathodal stimulation. Future studies should consider implementing varying 432 
levels of injected currents  or perform brain imaging measurements to further investigate the 433 
effects of different strength of cathodal stimulation.  434 
Resting-state FC was shown to be a predictor for individual variances in cognitive performance 435 
and impairments [58; 59]. Thereby, lower resting-state FC in brain regions related to cognition 436 
were found in individuals with obesity [9]. Enhancing FC between the dlPFC and ventromedial 437 
PFC (vmPFC) was shown to increase food intake -related control mechanisms in participants 438 
with overweight or obesity [23], emphasizing the critical role of FC between brain areas in 439 
inhibitory control processes . Both the dlPFC and vmPFC are part of the hypothalamic FC 440 
network targeted in this study; hence, modulating hypothalamic FC to strengthen control 441 
mechanisms might in the long run promote weight loss and support weight maintenance . The 442 
current trial showed that higher increase in hypothalamus resting -state FC is associated with 443 
better cognitive performance during anodal and cathodal net -tDCS. Evidence from a previous 444 
study showed that tDCS can affect FC, which is associated with enhanced response inhibition 445 
[60]. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that net -tDCS influences response inhibition 446 
with hypothalamus network connectivity playing a crucial role. These findings advance our 447 
understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement through tDCS.  448 
4.2 Anodal net-tDCS does not reduce total caloric intake but associates with 449 
lower sweet food intake 450 
In the present study, total kcal intake was not different between anodal, cathodal net-tDCS and 451 
sham. This is in contrast to the hypothesized calorie-reducing effects of active stimulations 452 
previously reported in overweight and obese participants [35; 39; 61]. For macronutrient intake, 453 
however, we found a significant interaction between stimulation group and visit. Active net-454 
tDCS groups maintained a stable intake of protein and carbohydrates over the study visits. The 455 
sham group, on the other hand, shifted to an unhealthier eating pattern after repeated exposure 456

to the breakfast buffet, by increasing carbohydrate intake an d decreasing protein intake on the 457 
third visit . Hence, active net -tDCS may facilitate inhibitory control during exposure to an 458 
obesogenic environment. While only few p revious studies investigated tDCS effects on 459 
macronutrient intake, Jauch-Chara et al. [38] attributed the calorie-reducing effect after anodal 460 
tDCS to a reduced carbohydrate  intake. Concomitantly, anodal tDCS over the right dlPFC has 461 
been previously shown to reduce appetite and cravings for highly palatable foods [33–36; 38], 462 
and left dlPFC stimulation decreased actual sweet food intake [39]. On the other hand, tDCS of 463 
the right IFG has been linked to increased chocolate consumption [62]. Indeed, variations in 464 
stimulation parameters such as stimulation site [63] can contribute to the varied outcomes . In 465 
the present study, we observed lower caloric intake by sweet food with anodal, but not cathodal 466 
net-tDCS compared to sham . Unlike previous studies focusing on one brain area  [43], our 467 
design targeted regions functionally connected to the hypothalamus, which is crucial for the 468 
regulation of hunger and satiety signals [8]. Stimulation therefore might have followed other 469 
mechanisms compared to previous research targeting the dlPFC or IFG solely. In fact, targeting 470 
a whole network has been shown to increase excitability twofold compared to bipolar tDCS 471 
[47]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that successful dietary self -control requires the 472 
synchronized activation of the dlPFC and vmPFC [23; 24], whereby our target network included 473 
both lateral and medial PFC regions. More specifically, the anodal stimulation was aimed to 474 
increase excitability of positive functional connections of the hypothala mus as part of the 475 
vmPFC, hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex, while simultaneously decreasing negative 476 
functional connections as the striatum and insula cortex. This suggests that stimulating the  477 
hypothalamus appetite-control network may more effectively influence hedonic food intake by 478 
integrating key brain regions for cognitive control and reward. Further investigation of this 479 
specific network is crucial to better understand the underlying processes. 480 
4.3 Net-tDCS does not influence subjective rating of food cravings  481 
While previous studies have reported effects of tDCS on food craving [31–36], this was widely 482 
questioned in the last years. In the present study, no significant differences were found, which 483 
aligns with more recent research . For instance, studies in  healthy participants could not show 484 
beneficial effects on food craving [64; 65], which was also concluded in a meta-analysis [66]. 485 
However, studies in persons with frequent food cravings or persons with binge eating disorders 486 
reported reduced food cravings after anodal tDCS [31–36], whereas studies with non-selective 487 
samples reported no effect on food craving or desire to eat ratings [67]. Beaumont et al. [68] 488 
observed no impact of anodal tDCS over the right dlPFC on craving or appetite in normal and 489 
overweight females with mild -to-moderate binge eating, attributing this to the subclinical 490

severity of conditions. In this study, we included individuals with overweight or obesity without 491 
eating disorders. Our findings therefore support recent findings suggesting that tDCS does not 492 
significantly impact food cravings or desire to eat in a non-clinical population.  493 
4.4 Net-tDCS does not affect glucose metabolism 20 hours after last 494 
stimulation 495 
In the present study, active net-tDCS did not affect glucose metabolism and peripheral insulin 496 
sensitivity, as no effects were detectable at the 20-hour follow-up. During stimulation, previous 497 
research has shown improved glucose tolerance. Specifically, anodal tDCS over the primary 498 
motor cortex improve d systemic glucose tolerance, demonstrated by higher glucose infusion 499 
rates (GIRs) derived from a standard hyperinsulinaemic‐euglycaemic glucose clamp procedure 500 
[40; 42]. Moreover, Kistenmacher et al. [41] found that anodal tDCS lowered blood glucose 501 
levels compared to sham , with effects lasting more than 50 minutes post stimulation onset. 502 
Given that tDCS is able to increase neuronal excitability [27] and energy levels of the brain [40; 503 
42], it is conceivable that the brain could regulate its own glucose uptake from the periphery as 504 
needed. Indeed, a positive correlation has been shown between overall cerebral energy 505 
consumption and systemic glucose tolerance  [42]. Moreover, the brain and specifically the 506 
hypothalamus controls outflows to the periphery that control systemic glucose metabolism [69]. 507 
In the present study, the  oGTT was conducted more than 20 hours after the third net-tDCS 508 
session. Thus, the direct effects of net-tDCS, such as an increased neuronal excitability, are no 509 
longer present. Hence, it is not possible to evaluate whether net -tDCS acutely influenced 510 
glucose metabolism during stimulation. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of 511 
tDCS on glucose metabolism in a more detailed and time-dependent manner. 512 
4.5 Limitations and further directions 513 
In interpreting our findings, several limitations and methodological considerations needs to be 514 
acknowledged. First, the present study used a stimulation design, based on fixed electrode 515 
positions according to the international 10-20 EEG system. This reflects a standard 516 
configuration, individual anatomical differences were not considered. Therefore, it is possible 517 
that for some individuals we did not target the optimal stimulation points. Future trials should 518 
evaluate the possibility of personalized electrode arrangements, according to their unique brain 519 
anatomy and fMRI network dynamics.  520 
Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that fMRI measurements and the oGTT were conducted 521 
one day after the last visit. Consequently, we cannot decipher direct acute effects of net-tDCS 522 
compared to sham on neural activity and functional con nectivity as well as metabolism . The 523

excitatory effects of anodal tDCS measured based on changes in motor evoked potential amplitudes 524 
haven been shown to  be present up to 90 minutes after completion of tDCS  [57]. Hence, future 525 
studies should implement fMRI recordings directly after stimulation to identify regional and 526 
network related changes in response to net-tDCS. Additionally, the time span between baseline and 527 
follow-up ranged from 7-76 days which could have influenced outcomes.  528 
Furthermore, hormonal fluctuations, which are known to influence food cravings and brain control 529 
on metabolism, as during the menstrual cycle or menopause in women [70; 71], were not taken into 530 
account in the present work and should be investigated in future studies.  531 
5. Conclusion 532 
In conclusion, these find ings demonstrate that anodal  and cathodal  net-tDCS targeting the 533 
hypothalamus appetite-control network is a suitable approach for enhancing inhibitory control. 534 
Anodal stimulation shows a greater potential to ameliorate hedonic food intake than cathodal 535 
or sham net -tDCS. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the influence of active anodal and 536 
cathodal network tDCS on hypothalamic functional connectivity 20 hours after simulation and 537 
its potential link to inhibitory control.  538

Fig. 1.  Experimental design, electrode setup  and resulting normal electric field. (a) Experimental design. 745 
Participants were randomly assigned to either the anodal, cathodal, or sham -net-tDCS group and completed five 746 
study days: one baseline assessment, three consecutive visits during which the net -tDCS was administered, and 747 
the follow -up. (b) Electrode setup for net -tDCS: The electrode assembly consists of 12 ciruclar Ag/AgCl 748 
electrodes. Orange dots show electrodes where the current entered into the cortex; blue dots indicate electrodes 749 
where the cu rrent dissipated. (c) Normal electric field (V/m) induced by the net -tDCS montage aimed at 750

Fig. 2. Response inhibition results. (a) Raw data of the SSRT for each condition and each visit. Boxplots display 755 
median and 1.5 x interquartile range. The half -violin plots show the distribution of the data and the dotted lines 756 
display changes of mean values across visits. (b) Results indicate a greater response inhibition for active net-tDCS. 757 
P values are for main effect of active net-tDCS group compared to sham by two-sided linear mixed model adjusted 758 
for age and sex , with change in hypothalamus functional connectivity (FC) as fixed effects . (c) Results indicate 759 
that a stronger increase in hypothalamic  FC from baseline  to follow-up is associated with shorter SSRT  (better 760 
inhibitory control) in the active net -tDCS groups compared to the sham group.  P values are for change in 761 
hypothalamus FC by net-tDCS group interactions. Shaded areas around the line are depicting the 95% confidence 762
