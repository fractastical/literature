Capacity for generativity and unlimited association is the de ﬁning characteristic
of sentience, and this capacity somehow arises from neuronal se lf-organization
in the cortex. We have previously argued that, consistent with t he free energy
principle, cortical development is driven by synaptic and cellular selection
maximizing synchrony, with eﬀects manifesting in a wide range of features
of mesoscopic cortical anatomy. Here, we further argue that in the postnatal
stage, as more structured inputs reach the cortex, the same princi ples of
self-organization continue to operate at multitudes of local co rtical sites. The
unitary ultra-small world structures that emerged antenatally can represent
sequences of spatiotemporal images. Local shifts of presynap ses from excitatory
to inhibitory cells result in the local coupling of spatial eigen modes and the
development of Markov blankets, minimizing prediction erro rs in each unit’s
interactions with surrounding neurons. In response to the supe rposition of
inputs exchanged between cortical areas, more complicated, poten tially cognitive
structures are competitively selected by the merging of units an d the elimination
of redundant connections that result from the minimization of variational free
energy and the elimination of redundant degrees of freedom. The trajectory
along which free energy is minimized is shaped by interaction with sensorimotor,
limbic, and brainstem mechanisms, providing a basis for creativ e and unlimited
associative learning.

/one.tnum. Introduction
The search for rules that account for the function of the mammalian brain,
and more speciﬁcally the role of the cerebral cortex, is long-standing and central to
biological neuroscience, as well as to the development of artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g.,
James, 1890 ; Freud, 1895 ; Sherrington, 1906 , 1940; Pitts and McCullough, 1947 ; Hebb,
1949; Ashby, 1960 ; Young, 1964 ; Edelman, 1987 ; Domingos, 2015 ). Somehow the
development and interaction of individual cortical neurons, each of which has its own
metabolic necessities, lead to sentience. Two recent proposals seek to deﬁne essential
features at each of the highest and lowest levels: the concept of unlimited associative
learning, on the one hand (
Ginsburg and Jablonska, 2019 ; Birch et al., 2020 ), and the
energy homeostasis principle of neurons, on the other hand ( Vergara et al., 2019 ).

The free energy principle of Friston and colleagues oﬀers a
powerful abstract theoretical bridge between these concepts, even
to the extent that a form of neuromorphic computation can be
seen to emerge inevitably in all self-organizing systems (
Fields
et al., 2022 ). How this abstract principle becomes manifest at
the level of conventional anatomical cellular description requires
explanation. The account of mesocortical embryogenesis developed
by the present authors explains aspects of observable cortical self-
organization in accordance with the free energy principle, partially
meeting this need. We here extend our earlier arguments to show
that there is a unity between all the above ideas and that the
property of unlimited association, or generativity, is implicit in our
earlier account.
/one.tnum./one.tnum. Generativity and unlimited associative
learning
The concept of unlimited associative learning deﬁnes sentience
as the capacity to develop very general learning, outside the bounds
of Pavlovian or operant conditioning. Within the limitation of the
organism’s life and capacity, sentient organisms extract what they
can from the information available to them, so as to make their way
in the world, without being bound to the exact sequence in which
subcomponents of learning are acquired and later associated. This
notion follows a long discussion of conditioning vs. spontaneous
mentation, expressed particularly regarding the development of
speech, in the famous Chomsky–Skinner debate (
Skinner, 1957 ;
Chomsky, 1959 ). Currently, the emulation of generativity is of
importance in the commercial development of AI [ChatGPT
(OpenAI); LAMDA (Google)].
Unlimited associative learning has appeared only in some
insects (honey bees), some arthropods (squids and octopuses),
and vertebrates and is associated with the evolution of cortex-like
structures. It is also clear that this additional capacity for learning
outside of immediate stimulus and action-bound constraints is
built on the underlying, more obviously reﬂexive, base of (in
the case of mammals) the brainstem, thalamostriate, and limbic
systems—subsystems with which the neocortex interacts and acts
in parallel in the reception of sensory input and execution of
motor commands.
Unlimited association implies the individual’s creative
anticipation of potential organism/environmental interactions,
with exploration of these possibilities taking place “oﬀ-line” from
overt behavior—yet becoming coupled with immediate sensory
experience (Pavlovian conditioning) and the consequences of
expressed behavior (Skinnerian conditioning) as circumstance
demands—and that selection from a large set of possible behaviors
must generally be those that are favorable to the organism. How
these aspects are reconciled is a part of the puzzle to be solved.
We hope to show that unlimited associative learning is a
natural outcome of the enormous number of neural activity states
and rapid information exchanges within the cortex and that
its mechanisms are reﬂected in observable mesoscopic cortical
anatomy. Selective development of behavior from reinforced
imagination is accommodated in our account, subject to the
mathematical constraints of the free energy principle.
/one.tnum./two.tnum. The free energy principle, error
minimization, and synchrony
The neurodynamic and mesoscopic growth models to be
subsequently considered were developed independently of the
presently understood free energy principle (
Wright and Kydd,
1984; Wright, 1989 ). Instead, our work sprang from the
consideration of the dynamics of electrocortical activity as
emerging from coupled stochastic oscillators, and the analogy of
electrocortical steady states to thermal equilibrium. It was recently
realized that this treatment conformed to the more rigorous
formalism of the proper free energy principle. Our appeal to the
free energy principle is more qualitative than quantitative, and our
arguments are geometric rather than analytic.
The free energy principle, spearheaded by
Friston (2002, 2005,
2010a,b, 2022), Friston and Ao (2012), Friston et al. (2012, 2020),
Clark (2013), Buckley et al. (2017), and Constant (2021), draws
parallels between laws of nature at all levels, from the principle of
least action to the organization of artiﬁcial and real intelligence.
A central concept is provided by Jaynes’ explicit linking of the
maximum entropy principle of optimum statistical information
representation to the laws of thermodynamics (
Jaynes, 1957 ), and
the principle can be understood from the perspective of inference
and the Bayesian brain, or neuron (
Friston, 2010a ,b), as dual to
Jaynes’ constrained maximum entropy principle ( Ramstead et al.,
2022; Sakthivadivel, 2022 ). This perspective follows from the fact
that the variational free energy of inputs to any system is its
negative log evidence, or marginal likelihood, so that one can
interpret self-organization in neuronal systems as a form of self-
evidencing (
Hohwy, 2016 ; Palacios et al., 2017 ), i.e., changing in
a way to maximize the marginal likelihood of its representation
of all the inputs it receives from other neuronal systems.
Kiebel
and Friston (2011) provide some worked examples from the
viewpoint of single neurons. Friston et al. (2015) provide a related
formulation of pattern formation and morphogenesis with point
neurons. In terms of neuronal dynamics, the minimization of free
energy leads to generalized synchrony that can be read as the
minimization of surprisal. In turn, this surprisal can be regarded
as a prediction error, in anticipatory interactions among coupled
neuronal systems. Technically, prediction errors correspond to the
free energy gradients that drive neuronal dynamics. This means
that neuronal dynamics are involved in the service of minimizing
prediction errors and lead to generalized synchrony that—as we
will see later—emerges as correlations in synchronous oscillations.
For present purposes, another way to express the idea of self-
evidencing and minimized prediction error is that within any
system with a boundary (a Markov blanket) through which it
must interact with the surrounding environment, an open steady
state must be reached, in which equal and opposite signals are
continuously exchanged through the blanket, canceling each other.
Here the term “Markov blanket” means that events interior and
exterior to the blanket are stochastically independent apart from
their mutual dependences on the blanket states. In a physical
system, this is a condition required for the stability of the enclosed
system and its resistance to perturbation. In informational terms,
if brain states are regarded as enclosed in a Markov blanket in
their interaction with environmental states, then at an asymptotic
limit of learning, when learning is complete and perfectly adapted,
Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org
Wright and Bourke /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fncom./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/seven.tnum/two.tnum
information exchanges between the brain and environment would
correspond exactly to their mutual information. Although this
asymptotic limit could probably never be reached in life, it oﬀers
an important guide when applied to the cerebral cortex. Exchange
of completely matched information requires that for most eﬃcient
matching there must exist a 1:1 mapping: a single topology for
information representation in the external and internal worlds—
a mapping of all sensory and motor interactions with the
environment onto the structure of developed synaptic connectivity,
with a common metric, and common dimensionality of the external
and internal worlds. Synaptic connections would have developed as
pathways for neural signals to pass through so that the passages of
signals replicate all the ways the organism has learned to interact
with the world—and, in the case of the cortex, must form this
map via its interactions with intervening subcortical systems. In
the following arguments, we show that the emergence of synaptic
connectivity during cortical embryogenesis and later learning leads
to such 1:1 maps in realistic anatomical conﬁgurations. We not only
consider the cerebral cortex as itself enclosed in a Markov blanket
that separates it from the brainstem and thus the external world,
but we also consider small groups of neurons in the cerebral cortex
as themselves becoming enclosed in Markov blankets so that there
is an enclosure of blankets-within-blankets.
Variational free energy inherits its name from free energy
as in thermodynamics, which is the system’s internal energy
minus its entropic energy. Statistically, the dual is accuracy minus
complexity. These complementary perspectives on free energy
are formulated in equations (1) and (2), in terms applicable to
synaptic activity and plasticity, which are later used to illustrate key
emergent properties.
Equation (1) is as follows:
F =A −C (1)
where A is the population sum of action potential pulse auto-
correlations in a population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons
within a short epoch, and C is the corresponding sum of pulse
cross-correlations. The electrocortical system exchanges signals
with the environment in analogy to a thermodynamic system
exchanging heat with both a heat source (signal generation) and
a heat sink (dissipation of pulses in dendrites). Consequently, A
is analogous to internal energy and C is analogous to the energy
associated with entropy. F, which is analogous to thermodynamic
free energy, is continuously minimized as cortical connections
become more ordered and reciprocal. Minimization must continue
in relative terms, even if the number of cells is increasing over
time, as is the case during neurodevelopment, or simply because
of changes in cell ﬁring rates.
In Equation (1), both pulse auto-correlations and cross-
correlations including lag correlations can be given in equivalent
terms as the emitted and received synaptic ﬂuxes, ϕij,ji between i−th
and j −th cells, where the synaptic ﬂux is the aﬀerent pulse rate to
pre-synapses weighted by synaptic gain factors. Thus
C =1
T
n/2∑
ij,ji
∫ T
0
∫ +∞
−∞ϕij(t)ϕji(t −τ )dτ dt (1a)
for n directed ﬂows between cells, in combinations ij, ji during
an epoch T, with lead and lags, τ , and times t = 0 −T. We
will consider the changes in the cross-correlation structure as
development proceeds, and we will decompose cross-correlation
into interactions of combinations of excitatory, e, or inhibitory, i,
pairs of neurons, and mixed pairs, thus
C =Cee +Cii +Cei,ie (1b)
The second representation, Equation (2), is equivalent but
is stated in terms of accuracy and complexity. As learning
progresses, the complexity of the information stored in the synaptic
connections must increase, as must the dimension of its statistical
model, obeying a time-dependent version of the Akaike Criterion
(
Akaike, 1974).
α (t) =2lnL
(
k
)
−2k (2)
Here argminα (k, t) is the Akaike Criterion optimum, which
is a representation of variational free energy when minimized to
determine optimum k at each stage of learning. It is then a measure
of how reproducibly neural circuits will respond to a subsequent
presentation of similar inputs. The log-likelihood, lnL
(
k
)
measures
how accurately the synaptic connections represent this stored
information, and k is the number of orthogonal dimensions or
degrees of freedom required to represent partial correlations among
the terms summed in Equation (1a). This is one of a number of
alternative decompositions of variational free energy into accuracy
minus complexity (
Penny, 2012 ). As the amount of information
stored increases with learning, so must the dimension, k, of the
most eﬃcient descriptive model. As learning progresses and free
energy is minimized, accuracy increases but under the constraint
that complexity is minimized by the elimination of redundant
degrees of freedom. Thus L
(
k
)
→ 1, as random synaptic
connections are progressively eliminated.
/one.tnum./three.tnum. The free energy principle and the
pleasure principle
The application of the free energy principle to the brain
has been controversial in certain respects (
Friston et al., 2012 ;
Bruineberg et al., 2022 ; Mann et al., 2022 ). One aspect that has
been widely discussed is the possible termination of learning in
conditions of minimal stimulation rather than its owner’s active
engagement in life (
Friston et al., 2012 ; Clark, 2013 ). These
problems are dealt with by ascribing the organism an inherited
tendency to go into circumstances that are best for it—its “preferred
states, ” based upon the properties of its sensory receptors—a
modern-day version of Freud’s pleasure principle. Because the
preferred states are those with negative surprisal, the organism is
seen as solving a multiple constraint satisfaction problem. How this
occurs is necessarily related to the exact means by which global free
energy is minimized at meso- and micro-scales.
In this article, we attempt to contribute to our understanding
of these issues by showing that stable overall synaptic structures
can emerge from smaller subsets of networks that are also stable
Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
Wright and Bourke /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fncom./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/seven.tnum/two.tnum
and form at preliminary and intermediate stages, subject to the
initial guidance of innate “preferred states.” Acquiring a capacity
for generalizing further from initial learning, the organism then
becomes increasingly unbound by innate predispositions. In this
way, we hope to show that the operation of the free energy principle
provides the key by which unlimited association emerges assisted
by, but not limited to, operant and Pavlovian learning.
/one.tnum./four.tnum. Competitive neuronal growth
The growth of neurons from their precursor forms is subject to
continuing death from apoptosis of some cells and the ﬂourishing
of others with the expansion and re-arrangement of their synaptic
contacts. These processes are known to be subject to the uptake
of neural growth factors and the operation of a caspase execution
pathway activated in those cells that undergo apoptosis (
Elmore,
2007). A comparatively simple explanation for the distinction
between those cells that die and those that thrive is given in
the energy homeostasis principle (
Vergara et al., 2019 ). This
argues that a crucial factor is the energy economy of individual
neurons and their supporting astrocytes—a criticality forced by
the extreme elongation of neurons, their large surface area,
and the high metabolic demands imposed by ion pumping in
axons and synapses. The homeostasis principle proposes that each
neuron continually self-adjusts between an extreme of high energy
utilization and activity with increasingly rapid synaptogenesis and
an extreme of energy resource underconsumption—the extremes
bounded by negative feedback processes on the one hand and by
cell death on the other hand. Neurotropic factors and the caspase
execution pathway of apoptosis are intermediaries of the metabolic
processes. We accept this concept as correct in principle, without
comment on speciﬁc metabolic pathways, and also argue that the
engagement of neurons in synchronous oscillation, thus elevating
their level of metabolic activity above the baseline action potential
rate, acts as a driver for synaptogenesis and survival.
The energy homeostasis principle does not in itself account
for the spatial disposition of particular synapses from/to the
neuron. Another part of our purpose is to explain how during
the development of the cortex synaptic dispositions develop as
they do, although we do not intend to imply that the energy
homeostasis principle is a suﬃcient model of the complexity
of experience-expectant and experience-dependent plasticity. A
complete account would need to consider the concurrent unfolding
of the genetic program and a wealth of other factors, ranging
from hormone eﬀects and stimulus characteristics up to and
including societal factors (e.g.,
Nelson, 1999 ; Mateos-Aparico and
Rodriguez-Moreno, 2019 ; Mohammend and Khalil, 2020 ). All of
these wider inﬂuences, in our account, would act to modulate
energy-dependent growth and selection by apoptosis.
/one.tnum./five.tnum. Cortical neurodynamics
Neural ﬁeld equations that are essential for the arguments that
follow are given in
Wright and Bourke (2021a). The development
of our speciﬁc form and parameterization of neural ﬁeld equations
is recounted in
Wright (2016), with debts to Beurle (1956),
Wilson and Cowan (1972), Freeman (1975), Lopes da Silva
et al. (1976), Nunez and Katznelson (1981), and Liljenstrom
(1991). The equations are suﬃcient to model the power spectrum,
frequency wavenumber content, evoked responses, synchrony, and
eigenmodes of electrocortical waves (
Wright and Liley, 1995 ,
1996; Robinson et al., 1997 , 2001; Chapman et al., 2002 ; Rennie
et al., 2002 ; Henderson et al., 2022 ). The mechanism leading
to synchrony is the selective dissipation at dendritic junctions
of asynchronous pre-synaptic pulses, and summation of co-
incident synaptic inputs—a universal attribute of all summing
junctions, including dendrites (
Chapman et al., 2002 ). Although
synchrony can arise because neurons are driven by common
inputs, and non-linear phase-locking of neurons can also lead
to their synchrony, widespread synchrony always arises in the
neural ﬁeld when coupling strengths between cells (whether via
polysynaptic or monosynaptic connections) are bidirectionally
symmetric, and the cells are driven by spatially diﬀusing white noise
inputs. It is this universal mechanism of synchronous equilibrium
upon which our subsequent arguments depend. Because of
this mechanism, when suﬃciently driven, neurons enter into
synchronous oscillation. At synchronous equilibrium, all excitatory
cells ﬁre synchronously, all inhibitory cells ﬁre synchronously,
and excitatory and inhibitory cells ﬁre in anti-phase. At lower
levels of excitation, the background ﬁring rate of most cells in the
cortex for most of the time is a low Poisson distribution of action
potentials. Neurons that ﬁre synchronously and frequently are
therefore driven toward more active synaptogenesis in accordance
with the energy homeostasis principle.
Transfer of these dynamic properties to simpliﬁed growth
simulations requires the assumption of uniﬁed fast and slow
synaptic learning rules (
Izhikevich and Desai, 2003 ) in which
synaptic strength is modiﬁed on a pulse-by-pulse basis when
operating upon short-term plasticity (STP) and short-term
depression (STD). Slower and more permanent synaptic gain
modiﬁcation follows the Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro (BCM) rule,
subject to slow “ﬂoating hook” negative feedback. New synaptic
growth is cumulative on the fast and slow synaptic changes and
is subject to decay with synaptic disuse. Consistency with the
energy homeostasis principle requires that synaptic changes are
competitive on all time scales.
/two.tnum. Cortical embryogenesis and
apoptosis. The primary antenatal
synaptic scaﬀold
The account of antenatal development of the neocortex given
in Wright and Bourke (2013, 2016, 2021a,b); Wright and Bourke
(2022) exploits the neural and synaptic dynamics given above
in such a way that growth can be modeled by a simple force-
equilibrium process. This explains the pattern of connections
that develop in the embryonic cortex and early in postnatal life,
emphasizing lateral organization of the cortex at the millimetric
scale, with no speciﬁc attention to the cellular organization
in cortical layers. While developed mainly in relation to the
primary visual cortical area (V1), simulation ﬁndings indicate
that the model is applicable to all cortices, whether columnar
or non-columnar.

/two.tnum./one.tnum. Anatomical considerations
The explanatory power of the model arises from its account of
superﬁcial patch connections and their relationship to short-axon
cells surrounding the center of cortical columns in V1. Properties
of orientation preference (OP), spatial frequency preference (SFP),
and temporal frequency preferences (TFPs) of cortical cells and
their topologies are explained as consequences of the connection
geometry and conduction lags of the patch cells, as these provide
contextual inputs to cortical neurons additional to direct inputs
from the visual pathway. The anatomical background literature
is cited in
Wright and Bourke (2013, 2016), and the historical
development of models for the anatomical and physiological
properties is reviewed in
Wright and Bourke (2022). Figure 1
summarizes the main structural features.
/two.tnum./one.tnum./one.tnum. Superﬁcial patch cells
Throughout the cortex in all species, layers II and III of the
cortex have aggregated patches of cell bodies of relatively long-axon
pyramidal cells. The patches are approximately 50 to 300 microns
in diameter, depending on the species and situation. They arise
during early embryogenesis, forming synaptic connections within
each patch and between patches, projecting not only to immediate
neighbors but also to more distant patches. Neighboring patches
that are reciprocally connected are spaced apart by about the same
distance as the size of the patches and thus tile the cortical plane.
In area V1, this results in a roughly hexagonal gridwork, as shown
in the left-hand frame of
Figure 1, or a square gridwork in ocular
dominance columns.
/two.tnum./one.tnum./two.tnum. Cortical columns and OP
In V1, populations of short-axon cells, both excitatory and
inhibitory, are enclosed by the patch cell system, forming cortical
columns. The excitatory cells respond selectively to slowly moving
orientated lines moving in the subject’s visual ﬁeld and projected
by the visual pathway to the cell’s position in V1, thus revealing
their OP. The OP of the cells is ordered such that OP from 0
to 180 degrees circles the center of each column over 0 to 360
degrees, creating an OP singularity. Away from the singularity,
OP varies continuously, and OP order within adjacent columns
tends to mirror that of its neighbors, within the limits imposed by
the hexagonal or square order, as shown in the middle frame of
Figure 1. Continuities of OP between columns produce linear zones
and saddle points.
As shown in the middle frame of Figure 1, the cells in the
patch system form synaptic connections with cells in the cortical
columns, with any given patch projecting to columnar cells all
sharing a common OP and creating systems of “like to like”
connections linked by chains of patch cells in roughly straight lines.
In this way, contextual information about activity in the wider
cortical ﬁeld is conveyed to cells of a given OP within each column.
Cortical areas that are clearly columnar are best seen in V1
of large animal species. More generally, this ordered structure is
not apparent but is blurred by overlapping patch systems, and
by smearing of selective cell responses, as indicated in the right-
hand frame of
Figure 1. However, even at its most apparently
disorganized, some vestige of the patch and column organization
generally remains.
/two.tnum./two.tnum. The model of embryogenesis
The origin of superﬁcial patch-to-patch connectivity and “like-
to-like” connections is key to the model because once these are
accounted for, the organization of OP singularities, linear zones,
and saddle points, in both monocular V1 and ocular dominance
columns, the variation of OP with stimulus angle and speed, the
interrelationship of SFP and TFP and their topological relations to
OP all follow as logical consequences. No previous account has yet
been able to explain more than a few of these features in a single
model. In the summary below, we focus on the development of the
key anatomical features as illustrated in
Figure 1.
During embryogenesis, the synchronous ﬁring of neurons
protects them against apoptosis ( Heck et al., 2008 ; Sang et al.,
2021; Warm et al., 2022 ), as they form into small-world assemblies
(Downes et al., 2012 ). Selection of developing neurons and synapses
by apoptosis to maximize synchronous cell ﬁring would thus shape
the outcome of genetically regulated cell numbers, patterns of
cell migration, and diﬀerentiation into cell phenotypes (
Rakic,
2009; Geschwind and Rakic, 2013 ). Since synchronous oscillation
is the “ground state” of equilibrium pulse exchanges among
mixed excitatory and inhibitory cells, while constantly seeking
equilibrium, the developing neurons are holding themselves within
the domain of average ﬁring rate that is optimal within the energy
homeostasis principle.
The early selection process is followed in a population of short
and long-axon excitatory intracortical cells that are mixed with
short-axon inhibitory partners, linked in a very sparse network
with one-to-very-many connectivity, and rich axonal/dendritic
contacts, with synapses emerging at only a relatively few locations.
Equilibrium requires that synaptic ﬂux be equal in both directions
between any given pair of neurons in the developing cortex or any
small groups of neurons with cell bodies that are closely situated
and have similar characteristics within groups. That is
ϕij =ϕji (3)
where ϕij,ji is the exchanged pre-synaptic ﬂuxes between i-th
and j-th neurons over all pathways of connection. Competition
and feedbacks inherent in synaptic learning rules lead toward
bidirectional symmetry of gains along the proliﬁc pathways, so a
trend develops such that,
ρijgijǫij =ρjigjiǫji (4)
where ρij,ji is the net connectivity between the two cells because
of synaptic growth, over all paths of polysynaptic connections
between them, gij,ji is the synapses’ net slowly consolidated synaptic
gain, according to the BCM rule, and ǫij,ji is their fast transient
synaptic eﬃcacy, operating within STP and STD. Each of the
three factors converges toward symmetry, with some pairs of
cells losing, and others increasing, reciprocal connectivity. On
the fast time scale, synaptic eﬃcacies determine the patterns of
synchronous pulsing. On slower time scales, patterns of stronger
synaptic coupling become established at those sites of axo-dendritic
contact that favor synchrony.
Neurons unsuccessful in these competitive processes are

leads to the substitution of the initial, almost entirely unidirectional
excitatory synaptic links, by an increasing proportion of
bidirectional monosynaptic connections. Thus, free energy,
as deﬁned in Equation (1), is progressively minimized.
The emergence of bidirectional monosynaptic connections
in patterns that maximize synchrony has eﬀects diagrammed in
Figure 2, and these reﬂect the basic anatomical ﬁndings shown in
Figure 1.
Patch cell connections emerge because beyond a distance, X,
from their somas, the long-axon cells have a greater population
axonal density than the short-axon pyramidal cells, and vice
versa, while at distance X axonal densities are equal for the
two cell types. Linkages of the neurons into ultra-small world
conﬁguration require the long-axon cells to cluster locally, with
cluster separations at distance X, so that they form synaptic
connections with other patches, maximizing synchrony, via inter-
patch connections skipping at multiples of X to neighboring
clusters. This leads to their forming of a regular tiling of the
cortex, as shown in both
Figure 1 and modeled in Figure 2. Many
such systems of tiled patches can form, so the patch systems
Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org

can overlap, as is the case shown in the right-hand panels
of
Figures 1, 2.
As shown in the middle panel of Figure 2, the enclosures
formed by the patch cell system are ﬁlled by short-
axon local cells, forming preferential reciprocal synaptic
connections at distances less than X. The sparsity of all
connectivity means that interpenetrating networks of the
short-axon cells form with sparse cross-links maximizing their
total synchrony.
Between the long-axon and short-axon cell types, bidirectional
monosynaptic connections emerge at the distance of separation
X, since this is the distance at which their population axonal
densities are equal. This produces a projection of the wider
cortical surface (termed “the global map”) via the superﬁcial
patch cells, to neurons within neighborhood short-axon clusters
(termed “the local maps”), reproducing the “like to like”
connections shown in the middle frame of
Figure 1. The reason
OP from 0 to 180 degrees circles the singularity around all
360 degrees, as diagrammed in the middle frame of
Figure 2,
is as follows:
A 1:1 global map projection to each of the set of neighboring
local maps must take the form
P →
{
p =±p
′ (P−p0)n
|P−p0|n−1 +p0
}
(5)
where P is a position in the global map and p is
a position in a local map, each designated as complex
numbers; n determines the angular multiplication from
the global to the local map; p
′
= √
−1k deﬁnes the
rotation and scale of the local map; ± indicates map
chirality, and p0 = p0 (1) , p0 (2) , p0 (3) , . . . are the local
map centers.
The reason this mapping develops is that presynapses develop
from superﬁcial patch cells to local cells (from which reciprocal
connections return) in arcs of a circle of radius X, the arcs
radiating from each map center. This requires that the projection
of the global map to the local map be rotated by 90 degrees.
Furthermore, a 1:1 projection of the global map to the local maps in
their partially cross-connected sheets of interpenetrating networks
requires n to take even integer values, so that, in the simplest
case, angles are doubled in the projection from the global map
and are thus deployed around the re–entrant-loop conﬁguration
of the local map. As a result, OP angles ranging from 0 to
180 degrees circle the singularity. The simplest case, n = 2, is
that of projection to a single Mobius strip or to multiple cross-
linked Mobius strip-like networks. Other cases representing more
complicated patterns of n =4, 6, 8 . . . may also be embedded and
cross-linked with each other, but will create a similarly appearing
OP map.
These considerations enable us to deﬁne an elementary
mesoanatomical unit as a local map and its inputs and outputs
via superﬁcial patch connections. This organization is considered
elementary for the entire cortex, not restricted to V1, where its
columnar form is readily apparent.
/two.tnum./three.tnum. Antenatal cross-correlations and the
dimensionality of the mesoanatomical units
Because the antenatal mesoanatomical units arise as
bidirectional and symmetric monosynaptic connections emerge in
a ﬁeld driven by diﬀuse noise, in Equation (1), the corresponding
cross-correlation structure has terms with maxima at zero-lag
for excitatory–excitatory and inhibitory–inhibitory pairs, and
maxima at the lag of the reversed phases of the excitatory–
inhibitory pairs, as these maxima correspond to zero-lag
synchronous equilibrium. In Equation (2), the mesoanatomical
unit could be speciﬁed by a model of k = 3 dimension,
since there is continuous rotational symmetry about the OP
singularity, with a depth dimension introduced by Mobius
strip-like folding of the local map. This folding disambiguates
the identity of distance from the local map and the associated
time lag.
/three.tnum. Postnatal information storage on
the antenatal scaﬀold
/three.tnum./one.tnum. Postnatal spatiotemporal maps and
spatial and temporal frequency preferences
The mesoanatomical units oﬀer a scaﬀold upon which
spatiotemporal images and sequences can be represented. Because
antenatal connections reﬂect the general declining synchrony-vs.-
distance relationship among cortical neurons and are structured
in three dimensions, this approximates the same topological order
of generally declining cross-correlation-vs.-distance relationships
of the sensory surface in space and time. The antenatal
map thus provides a scaﬀold of a suﬃcient dimension for
the representation of stimulus objects moving in two spatial
dimensions and time.
As structured inputs arrive from cortical input pathways, they
create patterns of active cell ﬁring, O (P, t), and these activity
patterns are relayed via patch cells to positions
{
p
}
in many local
maps. Because they are transmitted with conduction delays, they
then give rise to activity patterns, {o}, within each of the local maps,
O (P, t) →
{
o

p, t +|P−p|
ν
)}
(6)
where ν is the velocity of signal conduction.
Figure 3 shows this signal transfer diagrammatically. A single
point of stimulus input at the global level, varying in position with
time, becomes mapped to multiple concurrently pulsing neurons.
Particularly if the inputs to these cells arrive in approximate
synchrony, the interaction of the excited neurons will lead to the
cells exchanging signals and, as they seek equilibrium, entering
synchrony as a whole, by the general mechanism discussed in
Section 1.5. Each of the concurrently active neurons has received
information about the moving input at diﬀerent positions and
times. The synchronous set of neurons thus contains information
about the average position, velocity, and acceleration of the moving
point, within a short epoch—the epoch deﬁned by the duration
of sustained synchrony. These synaptic assemblies of cells induced

to ﬁre in synchrony are spatiotemporal images. /one.tnumBecause the
inputs are moving in two spatial dimensions and time, they can
be represented on the three-dimensional space of the antenatal
mesoanatomical units, but the break in connection symmetry as
new synaptic connections are induced by co-synchrony requires an
increase in model dimension. A series of images of this sort can be
linked together by unidirectional connections to form assemblies
of moving images, and at points of overlap, further bilateral
connections can store partial correlations of separate images. These
considerations foreshadow a postnatal increase in the dimension of
the stored information.
As shown in
Figure 3 and further illustrating the postnatal
increase in dimension, structured postnatal inputs bring about a
systematic reorganization of synaptic connectivity within the short-
axons cells of the local maps, breaking the antenatal rotational
symmetry (
Wright and Bourke, 2022 ). Signals originating from
global positions circumferentially arranged around the center
of a local map generate circumferential connectivity within
the local map, while those radial to the local map center
reinforce the antenatal radial “like to like” connectivity. The
response characteristics, and the anatomical distributions, of high-
and low-space frequency preferences (HFSPs and LFSPs), and
temporal frequency preferences (TFPs) of V1 neurons can thus
be explained—the essential reason being that signals generated
concurrently in circumferential positions in the global map relay
to the local map with equal, or near-equal delays, generating a
relatively high frequency and synchronous signal in the local cells.
Conversely, signals generated concurrently at positions oriented
radially in the global-to-local projection arrive with diﬀerent delays
and therefore generate activity at a lower frequency (Similar
considerations also explain the variation of OP with stimulus
velocity and angle of attack.). This leads to the generation of zones
of connected local cells that respond to diﬀerent input frequencies,
i.e., to the creation of separate synchronous eigenmodes.
/three.tnum./two.tnum. Maps in multiple cortical areas and
motor outputs
The bidirectional connections formed in the global-to-local
maps can be regarded as having a “forward” sensory relay function,
as in Equation (5), but also a “backward”, motor-eﬀerent function,
as indicated by signals following connections that are the inverse of
Equation (5), given by

/one.tnum Any single spatiotemporal image need only be an incomplete
representation of stimulus properties. If the points and times in O(P, t)
are widely separated, the image will covey information mainly ab out the
“where” and “when” of the stimulus. If the points are closely loc ated, then
the emphasis will be on stimulus details – of “what” it is. This corresponds
to receptor ﬁeld tuning of neurons in the dorsal and ventral neocor tical
systems respectively (
Tucker and Luu, /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum).
Extending this organizational principle to the motor cortices,
the output of motor commands follows the same form as equation
(6), but in reverse—that is
M (P, t) ←
{
o
(
p, t −|P−p|
ν
)}
(8)
where M (P, t) is the time-ordered sequence of eﬀerent
motor commands.
Signal transmission through the cortex does not, of course,
simply pass directly from sensory to motor systems, but is mediated
additionally via complex exchanges within association areas. How,
by synchrony matching between cortical areas, information stored
and manipulated at a mesoscopic scale may contribute to cortical
computation, has been discussed in
Wright and Bourke (2021a,b).
From these exchanges, “unlimited association” must be generated.
But how? We next suggest that it is in the backward and forward
exchange of signals between patch cells and local maps, under the
minimization of prediction error, that an important part of the
solution can be found.
/four.tnum. Postnatal modiﬁcations of
connectivity under structured inputs
/four.tnum./one.tnum. Stability approaching asymptotic limit
of learning and eigenmode coupling
If the asymptotic limit of learning is to be continuously
approached in the face of ongoing perturbation, the free energy
principle requires that the diﬀerence in exchanged signals must be
progressively minimized to zero at critical parts of the network—all
those higher and lower in a hierarchy of signal ﬂow.
In addition to the ﬂows of signals into, from, and between
cortical areas, which take place via topographic projections, we
need to consider ﬂows of signals laterally across the cortical
surface in the connections between patch cells and short-axon cells
described in Equations (5) and (7). At the learning asymptote,
the two-way ﬂow must cancel the ﬂow from lower to higher in
the hierarchy. This requires the generation within the local map
network of patterns of activity that replicate in anticipation the
pattern of activity that will next arrive in the global map—the
reverse of arrivals described by Equation (6)—so that
{
o

p, t −|P−p|

)}
→O (P, t) . (9)
The generation of this patterned activity can be described as the
action of coupled eigenmodes, i.e., ﬁelds of synchronous activity
that interact in some way with each other to produce the required
time-varying patterns. More complicated cross-correlation terms
must then appear in Equations 1, 1a, and 1b.
There must also be certain cells where the forward and
backward ﬂows converge to cancel, so only for these cells, where

same reference frame as the moving stimulus. All the local neuron s activated within the brief epoch, marked in the appropriate c olor for their signal
input from the global map, can enter into synchrony, thus creating a representation of stimulus position and movement within the ep och. Right: The

local maps retain their approximately circumferential and r adial relations, and correspond to neurons with high space- and te mporal frequency, and
low space- and temporal frequency preferences, respectively.
This set of cells acts as a Markov blanket between the global ﬁeld
and each of the local maps.
These considerations raise the question of how synaptic
connectivity in the neural ﬁeld must be modiﬁed to serve the
functions of eigenmode coupling and the formation of mesoscale
Markov blankets.
/four.tnum./two.tnum. Changes in synaptic ﬂux and
connectivity
To facilitate the consideration of the coupling of
spatial eigenmodes, the neural ﬁeld can be represented as
stochastic oscillators, each oscillator being a small group of
interacting excitatory and inhibitory cells, and each group
linked at longer range by excitatory cells (
Wright, 1989 ),
where ϕi,j are the excitatory synaptic ﬂuxes in the small
groups. where ϕi is the excitatory synaptic ﬂux generated
in one of these small groups, ϕi,j is the excitatory synaptic
ﬂuxes in the small groups, and
{
Di, Ni, Kij
}
are time-
varying stochastic parameters analogous to damping factors,
natural frequencies, and coupling strengths of harmonic
oscillators, then
¨ϕi +Di ˙ϕi +N2
i ϕi =∑
j
Kijϕj. (11)
When driven by the diﬀuse white noise of wide bandwidth
W, the ﬁeld has eigenmodes with frequencies, Mi, and damping
factors Di. If total energy is U, and Ui is the energy
of the i − th mode, then the entropy of the i − th
mode is
σi =
(
Ui
U
)
ln
(
Ui
U
)
. (12)
Applying these terms to the Gibbs equation for free energy,
we get
F =U −τ ∑ σi (13)
where F is again free energy and τ is a constant that scales
the average entropic energy per mode. This is the thermodynamic
equivalent to Equations (1) and (2). Free energy reaches the
absolute minimum when energy is equipartitioned between
resonant modes, and entropy is thus maximized. Equipartition of
energy requires all Di are equal.
/two.tnum
How spatial eigenmode coupling and construction of Markov
blankets can arise follows simply as departures of synaptic
connectivity from the antenatal near-equilibrium case.
Figure 4
shows the four ways that changes in synaptic ﬂux (and subsequent
synaptic consolidation) could occur.
The top row represents the symmetric exchange of synaptic
ﬂux between groups of excitatory cells. Excitatory ﬂux exchanges
are in phase with opposite excitatory cells, so that zero-lag
synchronous oscillation is sustained. Flux dissipation is minimal.
This corresponds to the antenatal state, and with a subsequent
strengthening of connections, to the postnatal formation of
spatial eigenmodes.
The second row indicates that the symmetric exchange of
excitatory synaptic ﬂux is directed to opposite inhibitory cells,
so that excitatory ﬂux is received in anti-phase to the opposite
inhibitory pulse activity, thus suppressing oscillation if suﬃciently
strong. Flux dissipation is maximal, and perturbation is minimized.
Each excitatory group cancels activity in the other if each group has
predicted the other with zero error, in which case they also remain
/two.tnum The approach to equality ofDi in alert electrocorticogram has been

twin unidirectional ﬂows of the third type, cross-inhibition.
The third row represents an asymmetric exchange of excitatory
synaptic ﬂux directed to opposite inhibitory cells so that one
excitatory group can suppress oscillation in the other, producing
cross-damping of synchronous eigenmodes.
The fourth row indicates an asymmetric exchange of excitatory
ﬂux between excitatory groups, with conduction delay, permitting
self-exciting chains and the “winnerless synaptic competition”
(
Rabinovich et al., 2008 ) required for heteroclinic neural networks.
The second, third, and fourth rows introduce increasingly
complicated lag correlation terms into C of Equations 1, 1a, and
1b and increasing k in Equation (2). The next section describes
how such connection modiﬁcations can be embodied within
mesoscopic anatomy.
/four.tnum./three.tnum. The anatomical embodiment of
postnatal synaptic evolution
Figure 5 shows changes from antenatal connectivity toward
meeting postnatal conditions. It is notable that as these synaptic
changes can be induced because excitatory neurons are always
intimately entangled with inhibitory cells, all four types involve
only local shifts in synaptic connections, and could therefore take
place with relatively high metabolic eﬃciency. This helps explain
how the energy homeostasis of entire neurons can be closely linked
to the generation of speciﬁc synapses, since small local changes in
connectivity, complying with the STD, STP , and BCM rules at the
microscale, can have major eﬀects on synchrony and thus metabolic
demand throughout the neuron soma.
Mesoanatomical units can become stabilized by the
development of zero-error connectivity at patch cell connections to
local cells, replacing antenatal zero-lag synchronous connections,
thus moving toward the construction of a Markov blanket.
Concurrently, cross-inhibition and lag-excitation connections can
develop within each local map as temporal and spatial frequency
preferences become tuned, giving rise to groups of excitatory
cells arranged in contrasting, anisotropic, orthogonal systems
that, by interacting through common inhibitory cell neighbors,
couple spatial eigenmodes, while lag-excitation orchestrates time
sequencing of the eigenmode switching. Cross-correlations must
now involve more complicated lag terms, with an increasing
dimension of information storage. Corollary to these adaptations,

all local excitatory cells can further adapt their connections to
maximize their co-synchrony, eliminating some of the noisiness
of the antenatal connectivity that developed in the presence of
diﬀuse noisy inputs, raising model likelihood to match increasing
model dimension, and in so doing actively interpolate values by
smoothing of surrounding connectivity by joint synchrony.
As these changes take place, the mesoanatomical unit continues
to respond synchronously to diﬀuse noise in the global ﬁeld—
so that unless speciﬁcally engaged by structured inputs the unit
sends only low information signals to other units. The asymptotic
limit of learning can be approached when zero-error couplings
increasingly act to stabilize activity—but each unit will become
perturbed when local and global signals are asymmetric so that
inputs convey high surprisal.
/five.tnum. Emergent unlimited associations
and generativity
/five.tnum./one.tnum. Interareal exchanges and the
generation of possibilities
The overlap of many mesoanatomical units permits their
merging into larger and larger ensembles, always in accordance
with the minimizations of Equations (1) and (2). These larger
systems are referred to as “assemblies” in Hebb’s terminology for
“cell assemblies.” This can develop by a process of enclosure, in
which smaller component assemblies become ringed with enclosing
chains of zero-error connections, while the enclosed units can
furnish ever more complicated patterns of eigenmode coupling.
This can take place by the generation of zero-error types of
connection between the chains of patch cells.
Transmissions to and from the growing assemblies can
propagate rapidly throughout the cortex, via cortico-cortical ﬁbers,
resulting in a combinatorial explosion of image superpositions
from cortical areas PX, PY , PZ, to any given area, PA

With subsequent lateral propagation into local maps, we get

Most assemblies and sequences will be transient, but those that
minimize free energy will persist, progressing through the three
separate time scales of connection formation of Equation (4),
ultimately resulting in fusions cortex-wide.
/five.tnum./two.tnum. Subsequent evolutionary selection of
assemblies and innovative outcomes
We can now turn consideration toward the role of preferred
states in the application of the free energy principle. In a recent
review,
Tucker and Luu (2023) describe the functional signiﬁcance
of the anatomical studies of Barbas (1986), Barbas and Rempel-
Clower (1997), and Garcia-Cabezas et al. (2019) revealing the
pathways of migration of cells from the embryogenic paleo- and
archi-cortex that generate the dorsal and ventral divisions of the
neocortex and form a central core of paleo- and archi-cortex with
radial neocortical areas. This study emphasizes the rich interactions

of all neocortical areas with limbic, sensory, and motor systems,
including attentional mechanisms, and Tucker and Lu relate this
structure to diﬀerences in dorsal and ventral systems of the role
of surprisal and prediction error minimization, depending on the
level in the hierarchy of information ﬂow. It is within such a global
system that we envisage the creation and merging of assemblies
taking place.
The left side of
Figure 6 shows how the initial assemblies can
undergo merging into larger conglomerates, by enclosing a number
of assemblies within larger rings of zero-error connections among
patch cells.
The right side of
Figure 6 represents, as a Venn diagram,
how the self-assembly of synaptic connectivity, excited by
superpositions of inputs can ultimately result in collective
assemblies capable of generative cognition.
The right-hand facing arrows show by their origins and
arrowheads the initiation of assemblies and their termination
within the subsets F, P , B, and R.
Assemblies arising in F (failed) comprise the following:
(a) all those that do not meet the demand for organized
zero-error connections and coupled eigenmodes
satisfying the matching of forward and backward
signals (Equation 10) required for continuing
self-stabilization by gradient descent in free
energy, or
(b) cannot link with others into conﬁgurations surrounded by
zero-error connections also satisfying equation (10) at a
larger scale, or
(c) require increasing external energy to achieve transition into
conﬁgurations meeting (a) or (b) when such inputs are
not available.
All these must dissipate under competitive pressure from
other assemblies.
Assemblies arising in P (possible) are those that meet the
primary requirements not attained by those in set F. However,
they too will dissipate if they are unable to form associations
based on sensory preferred states, with assemblies falling in
the B (behavioral) set. These components potentially capable of
generating actions, either overtly or through internal adjustments
of attention that acquire linkage with motor expression and overt
behavior, without which they, too, will dissipate under competitive
pressures due to a lack of a path for forward evolution. Innately
generated actions must include escape from averse stimuli and
approach to the pleasurable and are thus the motor equivalent of
sensory preferred states.
But to persist toward permanency, assemblies must further
gain access to R (reinforcement). That is, they must produce
behaviors (including cognitive operations) that are consistent with
innate limbic and subcortical components in the reinforcement
of behavior.
Reinforcement pathways that can be artiﬁcially activated during
intracranial self-stimulation (
Olds and Milner, 1954 ) and are
mediated by dopaminergic and related pathways ( Wightnan and
Robinson, 2002 ) exert diﬀuse eﬀects cortex-wide ( Wright, 1973 ).
They are concerned with cortical activation and the driving of
motor behavior, and also modulate synaptic consolidation (
Pawlack
and Kerr, 2008 ; Shindou et al., 2019 ), thus strengthening all
synapses recently active, even in widely distributed assemblies.
These R-actions, too, can be considered a part of the “preferred
states” ensemble of the organism, but are not simply equivalent
to the action of hard-wired sensory and pain receptors. They
introduce the capacity for internally generated designation of
current sensory states as “preferred, ” by designating certain states as
more salient than others. As assemblies are added to the inner set by
reaching R, they can expand the membership of the R, B, and P sets
(indicated by the dotted right-to-left red arrows at the boundaries
of the sets), increasing the available assemblies upon which further
expansion can take place.

Overall, then, the system can ﬁnd structure within its inner
world as it moves toward the learning asymptote and has
an unbounded capacity for innovation—unlimited association—
within its lifetime.
/six.tnum. Conclusion
The same relatively simple model of neuronal and synaptic
dynamics has been applied throughout the antenatal and postnatal
stages of development. The wide range of features of mesocortical
anatomy that are accounted for have been mentioned in preceding
sections, and the free energy principle is complied with at all stages
and scales. We have speciﬁed the stages of outcome in a motor and
reinforcement-related evolution and showed how this may lead to
an unlimited association or generativity.
The development of a map of the external world goes through
stages from simple to more complex. The early embryonic self-
organization maps the general decline of cross-correlation in
space and time of the external world onto the general decline of
cross-correlation of synchrony among cortical neurons, forming
a scaﬀold for the representation of elementary spatiotemporal
images. The scaﬀold acts as a position holder so that as further
cross-connections are added, the partial correlations of stimuli (and
actions) in space and time maintain mutual consistency. As more
highly structured signals reach the cortex in postnatal life, the initial
framework of simple synchronous connections provides a starting
point, from which further modiﬁcations of synaptic connectivity
can take place by simple local transfers of synaptic connectivity
in a metabolically eﬃcient fashion and in accordance with the
neurons’ homeostatic principle. Attaining and sustaining a stable
state is possible both locally and globally via gradient descent in
free energy. Implicit in this self-stabilization is also the retention
of sensitivity to surprise required in realistic learning short of the
theoretical asymptote, as is the minimizing of unwanted cross-talk
among trained units.
The elimination of random connections and ongoing
smoothing of connections by synchrony acts as an interpolative
and anticipatory process, oﬀering the best prediction of further
modiﬁcations that may be required as learning progresses.
Further quantitative development of this concept in rigorous
terms of the free energy principle is possible, but it is beyond our
scope. Such a quantitative approach might consider, for example,
the provision of activation energy by driving from subcortical
activation and attention that might bring about fusion of initially
rather unlikely large assemblies—an analog for sustained thought.
Replication in the simulation of more detailed learning, taking
advantage of the properties of the scaﬀold and the relatively
simple and restricted form of local synaptic updating, seems not
beyond practicability.
Our proposal must face the test of integration with detailed
synaptic and cellular physiology. Similar synaptic modiﬁcations
minimizing prediction errors, detecting surprisal, and co-
ordinating interactions can operate equally well via the topographic
interareal (cortico-cortical) projections, so an integration between
mesoscale and whole brain dynamics seems possible.
