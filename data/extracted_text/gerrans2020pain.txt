Pain Asymbolia as Depersonalization
for Pain Experience. An Interoceptive
Active Inference Account

“Mineness,” also called “subjective presence” or “personalization,” is the feeling that
experiences belong to a continuing self. This article argues that mineness is produced by
processes of interoceptive active inference that model the self as the underlying cause of
continuity and coherence in affective experience. A key component of this hierarchical
processing system and hub of affective self-modeling is activity in the anterior insula
cortex. I defend the account by applying it to the phenomenon of pain asymbolia, a
condition in which nociceptive signals (of bodily damage) are not attributed to the self.
Thus, pain asymbolia is a form of “depersonalization for pain” as Klein puts it. The pain
is experienced as happening tomy bodybut is not experienced asmine. Thus, we can
describe it as loss of subjective presence or “mineness” for the experience of pain.
Keywords: interoception, self-awareness, depersonalization, predictive processing, pain asymbolia
INTRODUCTION
The topic of this article is a form of experience variously baptized “subjective presence, ”
“mineness, ” or “personalization” (Seth et al., 2011; Seth, 2013; Billon, 2017a; Guillot, 2017).
As the name suggests, it refers to the feeling that experiences belong to a continuing self or
comprise autobiographical episodes. The nature and even existence of this elusive phenomenon are
contested. However, one important reason for thinking that this form of experience is a genuine
phenomenon is a pathological condition in which subjects claim that experiences feel as though
they do not “belong to them.” In such cases, subjects are not in doubt that they are the subject of
experience, sensory, bodily, or cognitive, but they report feeling as though the experience is not
“theirs.” Such experiences comprise the essence of disorders of depersonalization. These disorders
suggest that the feeling of mineness has a distinct phenomenological signature, which can be lost in
some conditions, and invites investigation of its causes and typical and atypical manifestation.
As Alexandre Billon puts it:
“Every sensation has such a coeﬃcient; we do not notice it, always encountering it; we need to be confronted
with exceptional and pathological cases (. . .) to notice it and measure its importance (Billon, 2017a).
As a way to develop an account of this experience, I focus on a condition called pain asymbolia,
aptly described by Klein (2015) as “depersonalization for pain.” In pain asymbolia, subjects report
feeling detached from painful experience as though it is happening in their body but is not “theirs.”
It presents as a case of loss of “mineness” for the experience of pain. Pain asymbolia is of particular
interest because pain is a bodily state that is normally felt as urgently belonging to the self. For
example, Descartes thought it as one of the bodily states that “teach me that . . . I compose a
single thing with it [my body].” Wittgenstein’s anti-Cartesian meditations on pain were devoted

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
to explaining the intuition that one could not be in doubt that one
was the subject of painful experience. “It is nonsense to say that
“I know I am in pain” as it means nothing more than that “I am
in pain” (Philosophical Investigations 246).
The account of pain asymbolia I provide situates it in the
framework of active inference theories of embodied selfhood,
emotion, aﬀect, and self-awareness (Friston et al., 2011;
Limanowski and Blankenburg, 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2015; Barrett
et al., 2016; Seth and Friston, 2016; Kirchhoﬀ et al., 2018).
One version of that framework is proposed by Hohwy and
Michael (2017). They argue that experience of embodied selfhood
is the product of an inference about the hidden causes of
interoceptive (representation of states of the internal milieu)
experience. On their view, the mind integrates signals from
disparate interoceptive channels by inferring that they have a
common origin in a uniﬁed entity: a bodily self.
This account forms part of an active inference account that
treats cognition and action as a hierarchically integrated suite of
processes whose goal is reduction of variational free energy. On
this account, cognition is the iterative use of generative models
(representations) to predict the consequences of actions taken to
optimize organismic functioning (Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2013;
Pezzulo et al., 2015). Discrepancies between predicted and actual
sensory consequences of action, signaled as prediction errors,
entrain the next round of action to reduce error or optimize the
model. The active inference theory tells us that prediction error
is best minimized over the long term by attributing internally
generated interoceptive sensations to a stable, uniﬁed entity, a self
(Limanowski and Blankenburg, 2013; Hohwy and Michael, 2017;
Letheby and Gerrans, 2017). This process of self-modeling creates
a basic bodily form of self-awareness.
As Anil Seth puts it:
“Mental representations of selfhood are ultimately grounded in
representations of the body, with the internal physiological milieu
providing a primary reference—a ‘ material me”’ (Seth, 2014).
As suggested by Seth, material me provides an anchor for
other forms of self-representation. Sensorimotor control, agency,
perceptual perspective, and explicit narrative self-representation
are cognitive processes that require a form of implicit or explicit
self-representation: a model of the entity that sustains the relevant
process. The basic sense of being the continuing subject of
experience on whose behalf all these activities are performed
is the awareness of material me and underpins other forms of
self-representation and awareness.
The explanation of mineness and its absence in
depersonalization I propose focuses attention on a particular
form of interoceptive self-representation, namely, aﬀective
self-representation. In aﬀective self-representation, the mind
models the bodily self as the source of aﬀective experience and
target of aﬀective regulation. This level of self-modeling produces
the experience of being the person/entity whose aﬀective states
modulate as her goals are realized or frustrated in action. We can
call this the experience of being aﬀective me.
At still higher levels of self-modeling, we deploy explicit
conceptual or imagistic representations of the self. This is the level
at which we self-attribute character and personality traits using a
self-concept. We can call this self-model narrative me because it
models the self as the protagonist of a recountable autobiography
(Schechtman, 2011; Goldie, 2011).
Aﬀective me and interoceptive me are very closely related,
because aﬀective experience is a form of interoceptive experience.
However, they are distinguishable, particularly in conditions such
as depersonalization in which they dissociate. These conditions
do not seem to be the result of loss of interoceptive or other
basic capacities for body sensation and regulation. Rather, I
shall argue that depersonalization is the result of a failure of
aﬀective self-modeling resulting from impairment in the neural
substrates of aﬀective me. Someone with depersonalization
experience has the intractable experience of an intact material and
narrative me, combined with hypoactivity in the circuitry that
sustains aﬀective me.
The concept of an aﬀective me produced by interoceptive
active inference integrates and synthesizes ideas advanced in
diﬀerent forms by a variety of theorists across disciplines
of psychiatry neuroscience cognitive science and philosophy.
I ﬁrst explain the concept of interoceptive active inference
and show how it explains (i) how interoception and aﬀective
experience are related via the process of hierarchical self-
modeling, (ii) how the framework explains the role of the
anterior insula cortex (AIC) in producing the experience
of “mineness, ” “subjective presence, ” or “personalization” of
experience. I then apply the framework to the explanation of
pain aysmbolia. Pain asymbolia is a case in which nociceptive
signals (of bodily damage) are not integrated with aﬀective
signals because of hypoactivity in the anterior insula. The
mind, however, predicts that aﬀective me will feel distress as
a consequence of pain/nociception. The result is a prediction
error that cannot be resolved because relevant aﬀective and self-
modeling mechanisms are deactivated. As a result, when an
experience of pain, predicted to have a strong aﬀective signature,
does not produce aﬀect, the subject feels as though it is not
happening to her.
MATERIAL ME: INTEROCEPTION AS
ALLOSTATIC ACTIVE INFERENCE
Interoceptive and aﬀective states have a common basis in
allostatic (action to optimize internal body states in context)
regulation. Allostasis is a reﬁnement of the concept of
homeostasis, which implies a reﬂexive return to an optimal
“set point” for levels of basic bodily function such as blood
oxygenation. Allostasis extends that concept, recognizing that
optimality for some variables requires variation according to
context rather than maintenance of a single optimal set point. In
fact, it can be helpful to think of homeostasis and allostasis as on a
continuum of ﬂexibility. Some functions (like blood oxygenation)
have very tight parameters and are context insensitive. Others
(like blood pressure) need to ﬂuctuate more widely to sustain
viability of the organism. Thus, some variables representing
body state are monitored not only in relation to a homeostatic
set point, but also in relation to their departure from a level
predicted as optimal in context (Barrett and Simmons, 2015;

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
Barrett et al., 2016; Corcoran and Hohwy, 2017; Kleckner et al.,
2017). Allostasis thus introduces an element of forecasting to
homeostatic regulation.
“Interoception and homeostatic regulation are inevitably linked
and form a closed loop: tuning the set points of homeostatic reﬂex
arcs depends on accurate allostatic predictions about future bodily
states; these predictions, in turn, depend on accurate inference about
current bodily states” (Stephan et al., 2016).
Interoception is the integrated representation of information
about states of very basic, dynamically controlled, bodily
processes such as blood oxygenation and endocrine and
electrolyte balance for the purpose of allostatic regulation. In
order to regulate the body, interoception models the hidden
causes of allostatic ﬂuctuations by attributing them to a
uniﬁed entity (Limanowski and Blankenburg, 2013; Moutoussis
et al., 2014; Sel, 2014; Barrett, 2017; Seth and Tsakiris,
2018; Wiese, 2018). The uniﬁed hidden cause of allostatic
variation along multiple dimensions tracked and integrated in
interoception is material me.
Interoception eﬀectively integrates disparate streams of
information about basic bodily regulation to inform us of
global organismic state relative to predicted state. As Seth and
Tsakiris (2018) point out, we feel the results of dehydration,
poisoning or deoxygenation, but the eﬀects are felt globally at
the level of conscious awareness in sensations such as fatigue.
When we attend to states such as thirst or fatigue, we do not
succeed in more precisely representing the causal structure of
the entities responsible for the experience (for example, the
molecular mechanisms of dehydration or shifts in the production
of metabolites and eﬀects on neurotransmission). Rather, the
goal is to establish the degree of departure from optimality of
a global feeling state so that we can manage it at the systemic
level (e.g., by drinking or resting). Interoceptive experience thus
provides a personal-level proxy for the regulation of low-level
homeostatic/allostatic variables whose mechanisms are opaque
to introspection Joﬃly and Coricelli, 2013). The predictive or
forecasting aspect is introduced by the need to regulate, by
anticipating interoceptive ﬂuctuations, and to evaluate actual
state against those predictions. In other words, when we feel
fatigue, we feel overall energy depletion relative to a prediction
of optimal energy levels for that context. Interoceptive regulation
uses experience to predict
“how an action would aﬀect physiological homeostasis, given a
model” (Seth and Tsakiris, 2018).
The idea that interoception is experienced as a systemic
non-localized phenomenon connects with an interesting
metaphysical point made by Wiese (2018) in his discussion
of self-representation and predictive coding. Like Letheby
and Gerrans (2017) and Hohwy and Michael, he argues that,
phenomenologically, the self seems to be a substance: an enduring
entity that underlies changing sensations and perceptions. Wiese
points out, however, that interoceptive experience does not
specify a particular localizable entity in a way that allows
further discovery by the attentive deployment of perception or
theoretical inference, because there is no concrete (by which he
means spatiotemporally located) object of interoception to focus
on. Wiese has an intricate and sophisticated predictive processing
account of the sense of being the subject of experience as an
“abstract enduring object” to which experience issalient. Abstract
because it is a higher-order amodal integrator of lower-order
information streams, and enduring because it represents the
continuing entity in which those streams cohere.
“the apparent substantiality of the phenomenal self is explained
by a structural feature of this salience model: it binds diﬀerent
dimensions of salience by representations of higher-order
dimensions of salience (just as more abstract object representations
bind representations of perceptual features in predictive processing
accounts of feature binding)” (Wiese, 2018).
The similarity between material me, qua object of
interoception, and objects of perception is their explanatory
role as underlying hidden cause of coherence in experience. The
diﬀerence between material me and objects of visual perception
is the non-concreteness of material me. Seth and Tsakiris make a
similar point to Weise.
“instrumental (control-oriented) interoceptive inference plausibly
underlies a phenomenology related to the evaluation of the allostatic
consequences of regulatory actions. A non-localized, non–object-
based phenomenology associated with both mood and emotion, and
with the pre-reﬂective (i.e., non-reﬂexive) self-related experience of
being an embodied organism (Seth and Tsakiris, 2018).
AFFECTIVE ME: EMOTION AS
INTEROCEPTIVE ACTIVE INFERENCE
So far, we have only explained why interoception creates “the pre-
reﬂective self-related experience of being an embodied organism”
as Seth and Tsakiris put it. The short answer is that allostatic
regulation requires us to experience ourselves in interoception as
an integrated entity to serve as the target of regulation. However,
we have not begun to explain (i) how it is that interoception is
associated with mood and emotion and (ii) how it is that this
account can be mobilized to explain how people can feel detached
from their bodily experiences in cases of depersonalization
and pain asymbolia.
To do so, we need to explain the higher levels and dimensions
of interoceptive self-modeling. The starting point is to note
that some signals of body state are “vital signs.” Fatigue,
sustained high temperature, or intractable nociception threatens
the organism and requires urgent action. Consequently, we
have evolved the capacity to feel such states, not simply as
perturbations of body state, but as urgently motivating. Aﬀective
processes provide this “feeling of what matters” to slightly modify
Antonio Damasio’s phrase.
Damasio’s account is a neo (William) Jamesian account
of emotion, aﬀect, and self-awareness that grounds all these
experiences in bodily processing. The history of this idea and the
way it is expressed are not uniform across the disciplines. Not
everyone is using terms the same way. So, somewhat stipulatively,
let me say I am using the term self-awareness to refer to a
feeling of being the entity whose continued life underpins other

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
forms of experience. I use the term representation to refer to
information-bearing structures. There is no implication that the
content of such structures is always consciously experienced.
Thus, self-representation can be conscious or unconscious, but
self-awareness is experienced. And I use emotion in a standard
way derived from analysis of prototypical episodes of mental life
(for example sadness, nostalgia, anger) that are evaluative and
motivational, have characteristic bodily and behavioral indices,
and are, typically, felt (Deonna and Teroni, 2012). I use the term
aﬀect to refer to a form of experience that carries emotional
content. Thus, aﬀect is common to emotion, which usually has
an identiﬁable eliciting object, and mood, which does not. The
feeling of anxiety can be part of an episode of emotion (anxiety
about a speciﬁc forthcoming event) or, in the case of anxious
mood, a feeling of hypervigilance and uncertainty without a
particular object.
The idea that emotional episodes have evaluative, behavioral,
cognitive, and aﬀective components is part of the appraisal theory
of emotion (Scherer, 2004; Grandjean et al., 2008). On this theory,
emotional processes evaluate (appraise) the relevance of events
(including internal events such as allostatic prediction error)
for the organism. We might say that cognition and perception
represent aspects of the world, and emotional processes represent
the signiﬁcance of that information for the well-being of the
organism. And to do so, they need to model the organism as
an entity with goals realized or frustrated in action (including
internal regulatory action) (Scherer, 2004; Kalisch et al., 2006;
Grandjean et al., 2008; Kalisch, 2009; Brosch and Sander, 2013).
This explains the subtle relationship between aﬀective
processing and interoception. Interoception integrates and
aggregates allostatic variables to inform us of global organismic
state. Emotional processes evaluate interoceptive signals against
expectations about goal satisfaction in context. The result is
experienced as an aﬀective state. And aﬀective states inherit from
the interoceptive processes they metarepresent two interesting
properties. They are intimately felt as states of a self, and
at same time, they are global and non-localized. We do not
experience sadness as a change in the state of a perceived
object but as a global, overall feeling state of aﬀective me.
And in the same way as interoceptive experience is a proxy
for allostatic regulation aﬀective experience is a higher-level
proxy for lower-level regulation. Experience or anticipation of
danger, for example, prompts a suite of cognitive and behavioral
responses that entrain a set of lower-level activities designed to
optimize organismic function.
In order to provide the aﬀective interpretation of changes in
body state, aﬀective processes exploit extra layers of emotional
processing that metarepresent and interpret interoceptive
signals (Stephan et al., 2016). The emotional interpretation
of interoceptive signals requires integrating the interoceptive
signal with information about the emotional salience of the
situation and the subject’s aﬀective history. In other words,
“should material me expect to feel like this given the (emotional)
context?” For predictive processing theories of emotion,
predictive models of the emotional context set parameters
that determine how physiological changes are regulated and
experienced. Thus, interdependent models representing the
emotional world (hostile, favorable, tractable for me ) and the
capacities of the organism to deal with that world interpret
and predict interoceptive changes in a continuous cycle. It is in
that sense that emotional processes are forms of interoceptive
active inference (Barrett and Simmons, 2015; Barrett et al.,
2016; Barrett, 2017; Kleckner et al., 2017). They provide higher-
level interpretive and regulatory models for the reduction of
interoceptive prediction error signals. Thus, emotional processes
are part of a hierarchy of active inference. Interoception
is allostatic active inference, and emotion is interoceptive
active inference.
Still higher levels of self-modeling, narrative or conceptual,
interpret and predict states of aﬀective me, and one can see
that other forms of self-representation and related experience,
agential, and sensorimotor are guided and reinforced by their
eﬀects on aﬀective me. In the end, without aﬀective me, we are an
organism to whom the world and its own states, as represented
by our battery of cognitive faculties, no longer matter.
NEURAL CORRELATES OF MATERIAL
AND AFFECTIVE ME: EMOTIONAL
TRANSCRIPTION
Aﬀective experience is produced by emotional processes
that integrate interoceptive information with perception and
cognition to produce the “feeling of what happens, ” in Antonio
Damasio’s phrase. To create this feeling, emotional processes
eﬀectively transcribe bodily feelings into aﬀective experiences.
This is why an interoceptive state such as fatigue can be
experienced as disconsolate apathy when transcribed emotionally
as part of an episode of sadness. As a bodily state, it has
a particular experiential signature. Transcribed by emotional
processes as the state of a self, rendered hopeless by an
irretrievable loss, it has an aﬀective signature. Given the way
emotional and interoceptive processes are woven together, almost
every interoceptive state is transcribed like this. It takes disorders
and dissociations, such as pain asymbolia or rare states of
emotional neutrality, to decompose their interactions. There is
an analogy with delusions of misidentiﬁcation (DMS) based on
loss of predicted aﬀective response to familiar faces. Normally,
the feeling of familiarity evoked by recognizing a face is not
salient amid the ﬂux of experience, but when it is absent,
the experience is of seeing a familiar but feeling “as if ” one
sees a stranger. Similarly, when one’s own body is damaged,
the mind predicts an aﬀective response. When that feeling is
absent, it feels “as if ” the experience is not happening to the
subject. It is actually a striking parallel between disorders of
depersonalization and the experiential (or ﬁrst stage as it is
sometimes called) component of DMS that they are reported
in “as if ” vocabulary (Breen et al., 2001; Brighetti et al., 2007;
Coltheart et al., 2010). In both cases, the loss of predicted aﬀective
response combined with preserved cognition in other relevant
domains (face recognition or nociception/interoception) creates
the experience of estrangement.
The fatigue of depression and its morphing into disconsolate
apathy provides a nice case study of the role of hierarchical

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
interoceptive inference in producing aﬀective me. Fatigue is an
adaptive state designed to restore depleted subsystemic function.
If, however, fatigue is intractably sustained, the result will be
a persistent homeostatic/allostatic error signal experienced as a
characteristic interoceptive state: weariness and exhaustion. The
active inference hierarchy will exploit higher-level models to
interpret and contextualize these interoceptive signals (Barrett
et al., 2016; Friston et al., 2018; Velasco and Loev, 2020).
Those higher-level models include models of aﬀective me and
narrative me that predict the eﬀects on feeling state of activity
across system, given the subject’s life history. Initially, such
models predict restoration consequent on rest. If, however, the
homeostatic error signals “from below” cannot be canceled,
higher-level models can be revised to reﬂect that signal. This
reﬂects the general principle that the hierarchical processing
system settles into a state that minimizes error across the system.
The self will be modeled as unable to control basic states and
to act eﬃcaciously in the world. At the level of aﬀective me, the
state is now felt as apathy and anhedonia, possibly anxiety at the
prospect of exertion. At the level of narrative self-representation,
thoughts of hopelessness and inadequacy can come to dominate.
As Stephan et al., put it in their predictive processing account of
fatigue and depression:
“belief of failure at one’s most fundamental task—
homeostatic/allostatic regulation— . . . arises from experiencing
enhanced interoceptive surprise. We suggest that fatigue is
a (possibly adaptive) initial allostatic response to a state of
interoceptive surprise; if dyshomeostasis continues, the belief of low
allostatic self- eﬃcacy and lack of control may pervade all domains
of cognition and manifests as a generalized sense of helplessness,
with depression as a consequence” (Stephan et al., 2016).
This quotation suggests a bottom-up etiology (“belief arises”),
but active inference accounts such as this also give a constitutive
role to top-down models in reconﬁguring low-level allostatic
processing. As Seth puts it:
“On this theory of interoceptive inference [ . . .], emotional states
(i.e., subjective feeling states) arise from top-down predictive
inference of the causes of interoceptive sensory signals [ . . .]” (Seth
and Friston, 2016, p. 9).
The hierarchical nature of interoceptive processing and
emotional processing is reﬂected in cytoarchitecture (Barrett
and Simmons, 2015). Sections of the posterior insula cortex
(PIC) take primary interoceptive aﬀerents and integrate those
representations to coordinate basic regulatory functions. The
PIC, for example, integrates values of allostatic variables
such as blood pressure and hydration as well as nociception
(bodily damage). These signals are progressively remapped and
integrated with other information at higher levels of cognition.
Although it is not the only channel for bodily signaling, its role
as a primary integrative hub of interoceptive aﬀerents makes
PIC a crucial substrate of the experience of material me (Singer
et al., 2009; Medford and Critchley, 2010; Gasquoine, 2014;
Moayedi, 2014).
The AIC is specialized to re-represent and integrate
information about body state to allow us to feel the signiﬁcance
of interoceptive states as aﬀects. AIC sits at the apex of the so-
called “salience system, ” the neural hierarchy that signals whether
and how information matters to the organism. In order to
perform its role, it must communicate with emotional processing
hubs that coordinate appraisal of that information at all levels
(Craig, 2009a; Craig, 2009b; Garﬁnkel and Critchley, 2013). The
AIC is an enigmatic and functionally ubiquitous system widely
connected to both lower- and higher-level processing circuitry.
One telling feature is its consistent involvement in the processing
of self-relevant information and the switching/anticorrelation
between executive and default processing (a key substrate of
narrative me) (Starr et al., 2009). Another is its connectivity to
hubs of lower- and higher-level emotional appraisal (amygdala
and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These hubs coordinate
the appraisal of and response to information presented in
sensorimotor and higher-level cognition, respectively (Bechara
et al., 1999; Scherer, 2004; Koenigs and Grafman, 2009; Adolphs,
2010; Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010; Gerrans and Scherer, 2013;
LeDoux and Pine, 2016). Thus, the AIC is activated by perception
of emotionally salient/self-relevant scenarios. Its activity allows
us to feel the emotional signiﬁcance of events. It is also active
in scenarios in which we reﬂect on past events or anticipate
the future, allowing so-called mental time travel to be imbued
with aﬀective signiﬁcance. Thus, AIC activity can also provide
the aﬀective texture for anticipation and recollection as well as
sensory processing. When imagining going on holiday or getting
married, the aﬀective texture of the episode predicts how the
action will make us feel. This is a crucial adaptation for learning
and planning. We plan our actions on behalf of future states of
aﬀective me. To do so, we remember how previous actions made
us feel. This way of conceptualizing mental time travel makes it a
form of extended active inference in which aﬀective regulation
is a proxy for overall organismic regulation (Suddendorf and
Corballis, 2007; Boyer, 2008; Buckner et al., 2008; Broyd et al.,
2009; Spreng et al., 2009; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010).
Thus, it is not surprising to see that contemporary aﬀective
neuroscience treats experience produced by AIC activation as
a form of higher-order bodily representation that represents
the integrated functioning of the organism evaluated against
emotionally salient goals creating a sense of self in the process As
Bud Craig (2009a) puts it:
“The integration successively includes homeostatic, environmental,
hedonic, motivational, social, and cognitive activity to produce a
‘global emotional moment, ’ which represents the sentient self at one
moment of time” (Craig, 2009a).
In other words, aﬀective me is the body under an emotional
mode of presentation (to import some philosophical jargon).
I am endorsing Craig’s idea that the AIC plays a key role in
transforming interoceptive signals integrated by the PIC into
representations of states of an aﬀective self. This process can
be described as one of higher-order metarepresentation and
interpretation but to do so underplays constitutive inﬂuence of
higher-order aﬀective processing on lower-order processing. The
role of emotional processing is not just to determine the relevance
of interoceptive predictive error after the fact but also to set the
parameters that determine which allostatic variations become

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
prediction errors. How the bodily signal is processed depends on
how it is emotionally contextualized.
Thus, I prefer to describe the relationship between AIC
and PIC as emotional transcription. The AIC is an integrative
hub of processes that transform a bodily into an aﬀective
signal, in the process transforming what would otherwise be a
pure bodily feeling into an aﬀective/emotional one. The AIC
communicates with hubs of emotional processes to convert the
neural signal representing interoceptive information into a neural
signal representing the emotional signiﬁcance of that information
for the organism.
This transcription creates the crucial aﬀective dimension
of self-modeling. Without it, we could navigate the world
using other dimensions, agential, narrative, sensorimotor, and
bodily in order to optimize organismic functioning, however,
we would lack a way to experience the signiﬁcance of our
interactions with the world.
Furthermore, this aﬀective dimension of self-modeling
provides a simple and eﬀective proxy for the adaptive integration
of other dimensions and the systems they coordinate. When our
narrative, agential sensorimotor, agential, and bodily self-models
are simultaneously optimized, we feel good: our organism is
prospering in the world. When it is not, we feel a form of negative
aﬀect appropriate to the context. Within the predictive coding
framework, negative aﬀect signals failure to reduce prediction
error across the system. More accurately, it reﬂects failure to
reduce prediction at a rate predicted for that action (Joﬃly and
Coricelli, 2013).
This is not a claim that the AIC is a discrete or modularized
substrate of self-representation. Rather, its integrative role,
connecting low- and high-level emotional processing and
interoception and in the generation of aﬀective experience,
makes it an important hub of processing that enables us to
feel the signiﬁcance of events as aﬀective states. Predictive
coding suggests that the mind will model ﬂuctuations in aﬀective
states by attributing them to a continuing entity: the thing that
experiences the emotional ups and downs. Aﬀective me is that
entity. And a good candidate for its neural substrate, given its role
as a hub of self-referential processing, is the AIC.
PAIN ASYMBOLIA AS A FORM OF
DEPERSONALIZATION EXPERIENCE
The idea that the AIC is the substrate of aﬀective self-modeling
ﬁts with studies of (relatively) selective damage or hypoactivity
of AIC in disorders of depersonalization. In depersonalization
disorder, patients report phenomenology such as the following:
“I feel some degree of ‘out of it’ all the time ( . . .) I can sit looking
at my foot or my hand and not feel like they are mine. This can
happen when I am writing, my hand is just writing, but I’m not
telling it to. It almost feels like I have died, but no one has thought
to tell me. So, I’m left living in a shell that I don’t recognize any
more” (Sierra and David, 2011).
Within the multidimensional multilevel framework, this
could be explained as a result of preserved narrative/conceptual
levels of self-modeling and basic bodily self-modeling in the
absence of the basic experience of being the self who experiences
autobiographical episodes. Another classic description of
generalized depersonalization is Dugas’ patient who said:
“I only feel anger from the outside, by its physiological reactions”
(Dugas and Moutier, 1911) my italics, ” quoted in Billon (2017b).
This is a particularly telling example because it suggests that
bodily processes and bodily awareness are intact, but the patient
feels detached from them, despite awareness that they occur in
his own body. On the account developed above, that is the result
of failure to transcribe bodily interoceptive signals into aﬀective.
The mechanism is sometimes hypothesized to be spontaneous
inhibition of AIC by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Medford
et al., 2006; Medford, 2012; Medford et al., 2016). On most
accounts, this is an involuntary defensive/dissociative response to
unmanageable adversity. Of course, given the integrative role of
the AIC and its dense multidirectional coupling and functional
connectivity, there may be no unique cause of hypoactivity.
What matters to the account here is that in the experience
of depersonalization AIC hypoactivity is unpredicted by a self-
model that anticipates AIC activity in context. It could be the
case that the AIC is not receiving interoceptive aﬀerents from
lower levels or systems that appraise those signals for emotional
relevance. If, however, the AIC is not responding in a predictable
way to those aﬀerents, the result is an error signal experienced
as loss of predicted aﬀect. The result is that most dimensions of
self-representation, bodily, agential sensorimotor, and narrative
are intact, but the agent does not feel as if any of the resultant
experiences belong to her. The reason is that the AIC is no
longer functioning to allow her to feel the signiﬁcance of bodily
changes evoked by her passage through the world (Gerrans, 2015,
2019). It is worth mentioning here that this interpretation of
the role of the AIC has been disputed on the bases of cases of
AIC lesion with “preserved emotional and aﬀective responses”
(Philippi et al., 2012; Damasio et al., 2013; Feinstein et al., 2016).
My reading of these cases, however, is that the patients have intact
behavioral aspects of emotion (such as aversive response) and
primary interoception, which accounts for intact bodily feeling.
However, the same patients do not seem to exhibit aﬀective
aspects of emotion such as feelings of sadness or remorse.
Similarly, their empathic responses are cognitive rather than
aﬀective. In fact, the proﬁle of Roger, the subject of discussion
in two key articles, somewhat resembles that of Dugas’ patient
(Gerrans, 2019). Very interestingly, Roger cannot be aversively
conditioned to painful stimuli, although he responds aversively
on each separate presentation is intact. This suggests that he does
not anticipate negative aﬀective experience when re-presented
with the aversive stimulus.
Rather than discuss full-blown global depersonalization,
this section concentrates on a fascinating subtype of
depersonalization experience in which only one channel of
processing is disconnected from aﬀective me. Pain asymbolia
is in which the subject feels pain or its nociceptive aspects,
but says that the pain feels as if it does not matter or does
not belong to her.

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
Colin Klein has argued persuasively that pain asymbolia is a
form of depersonalization for pain. As he puts it:
“the phenomenology of asymbolia might resemble a kind
of depersonalization syndrome. . . . The asymbolic, and the
depersonalized more generally, feel sensations that they are
estranged from—that they do not take to be theirs in the sense that
we normally do. . . .[This]does show that there is another sense in
which our sensations may be uniﬁed: as sensations over which we
have a feeling of ownership. Asymbolia, and depersonalization more
generally, shows that this sort of unity may fail. Its failure comes not
from a change in the sensations we feel, but in the sort of agents we
are (Klein, 2015) [my italics].
Klein suggests that the pain sensation is unchanged, but what
has changed in the experience is “the sort of agents we are, ” i.e.,
the type of self we are. This can be ﬁnessed still further when we
add that this latter change must itself be experienced. Otherwise,
the patient would not report the feeling that the pain sensation
does not matter to her. Given the previous discussion, it is not
quite right to say that the sensations have not changed, but the
experience of the self has. Given that the self-model sets the
parameters for bodily representation and consequent experience,
a change in self-model aﬀects the quality of experience.
Pain asymbolia is a nice example of the connection between
basic bodily processing, emotional processing, and aﬀect. Pain
itself is a representation of damaged body state (nociception),
but given its signiﬁcance for organisms, the nociceptive signal
is almost automatically appraised at primary level as distressing.
Thus, pain, aversive response, and negative aﬀect are very tightly
linked (Krahé et al., 2013; Klein, 2015; Gogolla, 2017; Von Mohr
and Fotopoulou, 2018; Gehrlach et al., 2019). Another way to
put this is to say that bodily damage is represented at multiple
levels in terms of its eﬀects not just on the body but on the self
and its prospects.
“Pain can therefore constitute a process of perceptual inference
about nociceptive signals on the basis of predictive, top-down
signals about the homeostatic signiﬁcance of such signals in the
context of other synchronous biological, cognitive, and social
conditions. Furthermore, such re-mappings of interoceptive signals
across the neurocognitive hierarchy suggest possible neurobiological
mechanisms by which not only cognitive, but also social
contextual factors can inﬂuence the awareness of interoceptive
and other multimodal information about one’s own body”
(Krahé et al., 2013).
Given these facts, the substrate of pain experience is
a complex network of nociceptive, interoceptive, and
social/cognitive/emotional circuitry. This “pain matrix”
incorporates the insula as well as somatosensory and limbic
regions (Starr et al., 2009). Characterizing the role of the insula
in the matrix is complex due to its extensive connectivity, but
one study reports a consensus view:
“insula may be well positioned to utilize cognitive information to
modulate connected brain areas involved in processing of sensory-
discriminative, aﬀective, and cognitive-evaluative components of
pain” (Wiech and Tracey, 2013).
or, as I might put it, to help coordinate higher-level active
inference in response to lower-level nociceptive prediction error.
And one feature of this coordinating role is the production of
aﬀective states that inform the organism of the signiﬁcance of
bodily damage. When, however (due to hypoactivity in the AIC),
the predicted negative aﬀect does not occur, the subject has to
explain away the resultant prediction error. The bodily self-model
is already functioning optimally: telling the organism that she is
damaged. The narrative model is also intact: it says explicitly that
pain should produce negative aﬀect. Thus, the patient is in the
situation of sensing bodily damage and knowing, intellectually,
that she has bodily damage but feeling no distress in a situation in
which she normally feels it automatically. She reports the result as
the feeling that the pain is not “hers.” Pain asymbolics no longer
assign or feel emotional signiﬁcance in response to bodily damage
in virtue of hypoactivity in their AIC. Eﬀectively, they are in the
situation of losing a crucial dimension of aﬀective self-modeling
for nociception. Consequently, they report that the experience
is painful but that it does not matter and feels as if it is not
happening to them. What this shows is that “mineness” can be lost
locally, for aspects of bodily functioning, such as pain (Phillips
et al., 2001; Phillips and Sierra, 2003; Medford et al., 2006; Simeon
and Abugel, 2006; Simeon et al., 2008; Stein and Simeon, 2009;
Sierra et al., 2012; Michal et al., 2013; Sedeño et al., 2014; Medford
et al., 2016; Gogolla, 2017; Gerrans, 2019).
The idea that the anterior insula is a substrate of the feeling of
mineness for pain via its role in aﬀective processing is consistent
with the similarity between depersonalization experience for pain
and mild opioid analgesia. In opioid analgesia, patients report
that the pain is not extinguished but no longer matters . A key
ﬁnding here is that that opioids target not only the PIC, as one
might expect, but also the AIC and related limbic structures
involved in emotional processing.
The AIC in fact is even more responsive than PIC to low doses
of opioids. This is an adaptation. It is easier for an organism
to regulate emotional/aﬀective response to bodily damage than
to repair bodily damage. Thus, in contexts where the organism
cannot devote resources to repair, it inhibits the system that
produces negative aﬀect and thereby stops pain from drawing
attention away from other relevant activities. Opioids exploit this
adaptation, down-regulating the AIC, reducing, not pain itself,
but the felt signiﬁcance of pain.
“the FMRI data suggest that opioid analgesics can directly inﬂuence
emotional responses at low doses that do not alter sensory aspects of
pain” (Lee et al., 2014).
Another way to put this is to say that mild opioid analgesia
produces a mild form of pain asymbolia.
This suggestion about the role played by modulation of AIC
activity independent of nociception is supported by an interesting
ﬁnding about voluntary imagination of sensory states.
“For the visualization of internal state sensations, this meant
increased activity in areas of interoceptive sensory processing,
including the mid and anterior insula in the right hemisphere. This
is a critical ﬁnding, as it suggests that primary interoceptive cortex,
located in the posterior insula, was not signiﬁcantly involved in the
imagery of internal state sensations” (Bennett and Baird, 2009).

Gerrans Self Awareness in Pain Asymbolia
Cases like this suggest that when we imagine or reﬂect
on an experience, we (re)construct the aﬀective component of
experience. In other words, we represent not what happens to
us but how it matters to us. We empathize with our past or
future self by activating circuitry, which represents not body
state per se , but the signiﬁcance of body state. This allows us
to enrich the narrative self-model with episodic and aﬀective
imagery, transforming it from a linguistic autobiographical
model to one which we feel, as well as know, is ours. In other
words, activity in the AIC links the aﬀective dimension of self-
modeling to our bodily and narrative models. In this respect, the
aﬀective self-model has a crucial integrative role. It sits at the
border between sensorimotor bodily modeling, which controls
organismic interaction with the environment, and explicit top-
down cognition, which exploits narrative and conceptual models.
It allows us to feel not just like a cognitive system manipulating
a body through the world (which we are) but a self, with an
autobiographical trajectory that matters.
CONCLUSION
The mind models and predicts ﬂuctuations of aﬀect by attributing
them to a continuing self. That “self-model” allows us to
experience not just the way things are, but the way they matter
to us given our history, goals, and concerns.
Perhaps the most crucial dimension of self-modeling is
aﬀective. The ability to feel the signiﬁcance of our engagements
with the world allows us to regulate our organism moment to
moment and oﬄine over long time scales to “feel the future” and
rehearse the past. In this sense, aﬀective processes knit systemic
functioning together allowing us to pursue organismic well-being
by regulating our aﬀective states.
When this integrative process fails (due to hypoactivity in the
AIC or systems that link aﬀective processing to cognition), but
the world and body are being otherwise accurately represented,
the subject feels that something is wrong. Furthermore, her
autobiographical knowledge is undisturbed. The result is a
massive prediction error in the hierarchical multidimensional
self-model. The narrative and bodily dimensions are intact, but
the predicted aﬀective dimension is absent. She reports the result
naturally enough by saying that the experience feels as if it is not
happening to her.
