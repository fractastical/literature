Abstract
The properties of flux-cored Zn-Al filler metals are prone to deteriorating due to corrosion,
making filler metals unusable. In this study, flux-cored Zn-2Al- xGe (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, and
0.8 wt.%) filler metals are prepared to explore the effect of minor Ge on the corrosion
resistance of Zn-2Al filler metals. The salt spray test is carried out on filler metals. A
scanning transmission electron microscope is used to identify the phases in filler metals.
The electrochemical performance of filler metals was tested by a workstation. The findings
indicate that the microstructure of the Zn-2Al filler metal is composed of α-Al and η-Zn.
Diamond-Ge forms in the microstructure of the Zn-2Al filler metal due to the introduction
of Ge. Zn-2Al- xGe filler metals exhibit pitting corrosion characterized by intergranular
corrosion (IGC) in the salt spray environment. Ge improves the IGC resistance of filler
metals by changing the distribution of α-Al in the filler metal. The Zn-2Al-0.3Ge filler metal
demonstrates the most excellent corrosion resistance. It has 16% elongation after 15 d of
corrosion, which is higher than that of Zn-2Al by 13.6%.
Keywords: Zn-Al-Ge filler metals; intergranular corrosion; microstructure;

1. Introduction
Zinc-aluminum (Zn-Al) filler metals are employed for brazing aluminum alloys to
heterogeneous materials due to their advantages, such as a low melting point, favorable
wettability, and superior processability [1–4]. The flux-cored Zn-Al filler metal wire belongs
to the category of composite filler metals. It is structured with a brazing flux encapsulated
within a filler metal tubule. In contrast to conventional Zn-Al filler metal wires, the
flux-cored Zn-Al filler metal wire demonstrates better suitability for automatic brazing
equipment. Moreover, it can enhance the utilization efficiency of the flux [5,6]. However,
flux-cored Zn-Al filler metals are susceptible to corrosion attacks during storage, which
reduces the fluidity of filler metals [7].
Multiple approaches are employed to enhance the corrosion resistance of flux-cored
filler metals [8–12]. Alloying element is the most common and effective method. Compared
with elements such as Cu, Ti, Ag, etc., minor Ge could reduce the melting point of the Zn-Al
alloy and improve its wettability [2,13]. Furthermore, minor Ge could enhance the corrosion
resistance of Zinc alloys and aluminum alloys [ 14–16]. Jiang et al. [ 17] investigated the

effects of minor Ge on the corrosion behavior of Mg-Zn alloys. The findings indicate that
Ge could inhibit hydrogen evolution reactions that occur in the Zn-rich region. Mg-Zn
alloys display the best corrosion resistance when the Ge content is 0.2 wt.%. Wang et al. [18]
analyzed the corrosion behavior of aluminum alloys, and the findings demonstrated that
minor Ge could improve the corrosion resistance of the aluminum alloy by changing
the distribution of the η strengthening phase. According to patents disclosed by Cao
et al. and Luo et al., Ge could decrease the corrosion current of Zn-Al alloys [19,20]. Liu
et al. [14] studied the influence of Ge on the corrosion behavior of Al-Zn-Mg alloys, and the
results showed that Ge decreased the densities of precipitates and improved the corrosion
resistance of the Al-Zn-Mg alloy.
The effect of Ge on the corrosion resistance of the Zn-Al filler metal has not been
investigated. In this study, four types of flux-cored Zn-2Al filler metals containing different
Ge contents (0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 wt.%) are fabricated. The accelerated corrosion process of
filler metals in humid and hot environments is analyzed through the salt spray test. The
effect of the trace Ge on the corrosion resistance of Zn-2Al filler metals is investigated.
2. Materials and Methods
In the present work, commercially pure Zinc (99.95%), aluminum (99.70%), and ger-
manium (99.99%) are employed as raw materials to prepare Zn-2Al- xGe alloys. The
composition of the filler metal is listed in Table 1. Based on previous research [ 14–18],
the Ge content range is 0.3–0.8 wt.%. The raw materials are loaded into a high-frequency
induction graphite crucible and heated to 650◦C for 5 min. Thereafter, they are air-cooled to
25 ◦C to obtain the ingots. The filler metal ingot is processed into a Φ50 × 80 mm cylinder,
with a Φ20 × 60 mm hole in the center. The brazing flux CsAlF4 is filled into the hole. The
ingot filled with flux is extruded into alloy rods with a diameter of 8 mm at 380 ◦C. The
alloy rods are processed into a wire-shaped flux-cored filler metal with a diameter of 3 mm
through multi-pass processing.

The salt spray test is performed according to the standard GB/T10125-2021 [21]. The
deionized water and NaCl are prepared in proportion to obtain a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution.
The test temperature is set to 38 ◦C to improve the corrosion rate. Filler metals are cleaned
with ethanol before performing the salt spray test.
The electrochemical performance of Zn-2Al-xGe is measured using an electrochem-
ical workstation (CHI760E, Chenhua Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a standard three-
electrode system. Prior to the test, the surface of the filler metal is sequentially ground
with 400#, 800#, 1000#, and 2000# diamond abrasive papers to remove surface oxides and
machining defects. All samples are washed by ultrasonic cleaning in absolute ethanol for
15 min to eliminate residual abrasive particles. After drying naturally at room temperature,
samples are used as the working electrode with an exposed area of 1 cm2, a platinum sheet
(10 mm × 10 mm × 0.5 mm) as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte is a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution (ana-
lytical grade, without further purification) and is maintained at 25 ± 1 ◦C throughout the
test. The curves are recorded at a scan rate of 1 mV·s−1, with the potential range set from
Materials 2025, 18, 5111 3 of 12
−1.5 V to 0.5 V (vs. SCE). Before scanning, the samples are stabilized in the electrolyte for
30 min to achieve a steady open-circuit potential (OCP). Each test is repeated three times to
ensure data reliability.
The filler metal is subjected to tensile tests using a universal testing apparatus
(DNS-100) (Sinotest Equipment Co., Ltd., Jinan, China) at a rate of 1 mm/min. The average
tensile strength of five identical filler metals is calculated. The phases in filler metals are
identified by a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan). A TEM sample with a thickness of 50 nm is prepared by focusing the ion
beam (FIB, Helios G4 UX, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The melting
points of filler metals are determined by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC, NETZSCH
DSC300, NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, Selb, Germany). A scanning electron microscope
(SEM, ZEISS-SUPRA55, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) and energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments, Oxfordshire, UK) are used to analyze the mi-
crostructure and corrosion morphology of the filler metal. The BSE mode is adopted to
obtain pictures.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Microstructures of Filler Metals
The typical microstructure of Zn-2Al filler metals with different Ge contents is illus-
trated in Figure 1. Zn-Al filler metals are composed of a black phase, white phase, and gray
phase. According to the EDS analysis results, as shown in Table 2, the chemical composition
of the black phase is 97.3 wt.% Al + 2.7 wt.% Zn. The black phase is α-Al. The chemical
composition of the white phase is 3.59 wt.% Al + 96.41 wt.% Zn. The white phase is η-Zn.
The chemical composition of the gray phase is 6.7 wt.% Al + 9.7 wt.% Zn + 83.6 wt.% Ge.
The gray phase is represented as Diamond-Ge because it has a diamond-type atomic con-
figuration [22–24]. In order to accurately characterize the crystal structure of each phase
in the filler metal, a transmission analysis was carried out on the filler metal, and the
results are shown in Figure 2. From the bright-field image in Figure 2a, three different areas
can be found. The relevant selected electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are revealed in
Figure 2b–d. SAED 1 confirmed the α-Al phase along the [012] crystal band axis of the Al
crystal. SAED 2 identified the η-Zn phase along the [11-2-3] crystal band axis of the η-Zn
crystal. The remaining Ge in the filler metal formed the Diamond-Ge phase in the SAED
3 region along the [011] crystal band axis of the Diamond-Ge crystal. Therefore, the black
phase is α-Al, the white phase is η-Zn, and the gray phase is Diamond-Ge.
Figure 1a–d displays the distribution of α-Al in the microstructures of Zn-2Al-xGe
filler metals. It can be seen that the α-Al phase displays obvious band-like arrangement
characteristics. Compared with the Zn-2Al filler metal, the distance of the two adjacentα-Al
bands was increased from 20.47 µm to 36.9 µm. In addition, the majority of α-Al coexists
with the Diamond-Ge, showing a strong spatial association. In addition, a minor amount
of α-Al is sparsely dispersed within the η-Zn, with no obvious aggregation characteristic in
the filler metal. As the Ge content increases, the trend of the aggregation of α-Al becomes
more pronounced, and the size of the α-Al phase gradually increases. When the Ge content
is 0.3 wt.%, α-Al phases aggregate and exhibit discontinuous distributions. When the
Ge content is 0.8 wt.%, the α-Al gradually becomes continuously distributed. This is
mainly attributed to Ge exerting a thermodynamically driven enrichment effect on Al, as
this interaction aligns with the minimum free energy principle of the alloy system. The
free energy of the Zn-Al-Ge ternary system is calculated based on the Miedema model of
solution enthalpy, the Tamaka model, and the Toop model [24–26], as shown schematically
in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the free energy contour map of the Zn-Al-Ge ternary system at
25 ◦C. It can be seen that the ∆G is smaller when the Ge content is not zero, indicating that
Materials 2025, 18, 5111 4 of 12
Ge makes it more convenient to generate ternary eutectic phases rather than binary eutectic
phases in the Zn-Al-Ge ternary alloy system. This can be confirmed by the EDS analysis
results in this article. Therefore, it can be inferred that in order to reduce the free energy of
the system, Al will accumulate in the high-Ge region, which causes the precipitated Al to
aggregate in the Diamond-Ge during the drawing process, increasing the size of the α-Al
phase and promoting the continuous distribution of α-Al.

dimensional graphs; (b) contour map corresponding to (a).
DSC curves of Zn-2Al-xGe filler metals are displayed in Figure 5, and the relevant
temperature data is shown in Table 3. It can be seen that there are mainly two peaks
when the Ge content is zero. Peak 1 appears between 385 ◦C and 410 ◦C, corresponding to
the precipitation of the primary Zn, and peak 2 (between 360 ◦C and 400 ◦C) represents
the binary Zn-Al eutectic process. While peak 3 appears (between 345 ◦C and 355 ◦C)
when the Ge content is not zero. According to the Zn-Al-Ge ternary phase diagram [27],
peak 3 represents the ternary Zn-Al-Ge eutectic process. As the Ge content increases
from 0 to 0.8 wt.%, peak 3 becomes sharp, and peak 2 gradually flattens, indicating the
transformation from the Zn-Al eutectic reaction to the Zn-Al-Ge eutectic process. Therefore,
the solidus temperature (T 1) decreased by 28 ◦C. In addition, the temperature of peak
1 (Tproeutectic2) moves left, and the liquidus temperature (T2) decreases from 405.61 ◦C to
404.27 ◦C, indicating that Ge can promote the precipitation of primary Zn and reduce the
liquidus temperature of the Zn-2Al filler metal.

3.2. Corrosion Behavior Analysis
Figure 6 presents the polarization curves of Zn-Al filler metals with varying Ge
contents when immersed in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. All filler metals exhibit polarization
curves with similar features. For the cathodic polarization curves, a clear trend emerges: as
the cathodic overpotential goes up, the cathodic corrosion current first rises rapidly and then
increases at a slower rate. This trend suggests that the diffusion process of oxygen (O) exerts
an influence on the cathodic reaction. The anodic polarization curves show a different
characteristic: as the anodic overpotential increases, the anodic corrosion current rises
sharply. At this stage, the pitting potential (Epit) equals the corrosion potential (Ecorr)—a
phenomenon that indicates that the anodic reaction is affected by the pitting process.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Polarization curves of Zn-2Al-xGe filler metals.
Additionally, it can be seen from Figure 6 that the pitting potential of the Zn-2Al
filler metal is −1.21 V , and it goes up when the Ge content is not zero. This change in the
pitting potential means that Ge decreases the corrosion tendency of the filler metal. The
polarization curves are fitted, and the resulting data shows that the corrosion currents of
the four target filler metals are 1.36× 10−5 A/cm2, 7.21 × 10−6 A/cm2, 1.06 × 10−5 A/cm2,
and 1.12 × 10−5 A/cm2, respectively. This set of data indicates that the pitting current of
the filler metals decreases firstly and then increases with the growth of the Ge content.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Zn-2Al filler metals is investi-
gated, and the obtained curves are fitted through an equivalent circuit diagram, as shown
in Figure 7, in which Rs represents the electrical resistance of the 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution,
ROX represents the electrical resistance related to the oxide film, Rct represents the electrical
resistance related to the charge transfer, QOX represents the capacitance related to the oxide
film, and Qdi represents the electrical double-layer capacitor. Figure 8 shows the fitting
results. It can be seen that the R OX and Rct of the Zn-2Al filler metal is 190.5 Ω/m2 and
319.1 Ω/m2, respectively, which is lower than when the Ge content is not zero. In addition,
as the Ge content increases, the ROX and Rct increase at first and then decrease, and the peak
appears at the Zn-2Al-0.3Ge filler metal. This reveals that Ge strengthens the protective
effect of the oxide film on filler metals and increases the hindrance of the charge transfer,
thereby improving the corrosion resistance of filler metals.

Figure 9 presents the microstructure of the Zn-2Al filler metal after 10 h of salt spray
corrosion. It can be seen that pitting corrosion occurs on the surface of the filler metal, and
the corroded areas exhibit a distinct grid-like morphology, which is a typical characteristic
of IGC. Figure 9b–d illustrate the microstructures of Zn-2Al- xGe filler metals. It can be
seen that the depth of corroded regions reduces when the Ge content is not zero. This
demonstrates that Ge exerts a positive effect on enhancing the corrosion resistance of the
Zn-2Al filler metal. However, as the Ge content increases from 0.3 wt.% to 0.8 wt.%, the
corrosion depth increases accordingly.
Figure 10 illustrates the XRD pattern of corrosion products derived from Zn-2Al filler
metals with varying Ge contents. The corrosion products are mainly composed of Zn(OH)2,
ZnCl2, ZnO, Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O, and Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2. According to Table 4, for the Ge-rich
region and Al-rich region, the Zn content decreased obviously, indicating thatη-Zn occurs
an anodic dissolution reaction. Therefore, corrosion occurring in filler metals belongs to
electrochemical corrosion, and η-Zn acts as the anode.
In order to further investigate how Ge influences the corrosion performance of Zn-2Al
filler metals, corrosion propagation paths are analyzed as shown in Figure 9e–h. According
to Figure 9e, corrosion mainly propagates along the extrusion direction (α-Al bands) and
the radially inward direction (grain boundaries of η-Zn). Compared with the radially
inward direction, corrosion is more likely to extend along the extrusion direction. In
addition, η-Zn grains adjacent to α-Al grains in the Zn-Al-Ge filler metal suffer more severe
corrosion attacks, whereas the corrosion at grain boundaries between α-Al bands is less
pronounced. The increase of α-Al makes it form a microgalvanic cell effect characterized
by a “large cathode/small anode” configuration, accelerating the corrosion rate of η-Zn
grains adjacent to α-Al. Wang et al. [28] reached the same conclusion in their research on
the corrosion behavior of high-strength steel alloys. Therefore, corrosion prefers to extend
along the extrusion direction with continuously distributed α-Al.
As shown in Figure 9e,f, the corrosion zone of filler metals can be divided into an
intergranular corrosion area (ICA) and a uniform corrosion area (UCA). The width of the
ICA in the Zn-2Al, Zn-2Al-0.3Ge, Zn-2Al-0.5, and Ge Zn-2Al-0.8Ge is 36 µm, 12 µm, 15 µm,
and 32 µm. This shows that Ge can inhibit the generation of IGC along the extrusion
direction. Ge facilitates the enrichment of precipitated Al in the filler metal, which increases
the size of α-Al phases acting as cathodes. The increased size of the α-Al phase leads to
a reduction in the Al content at the grain boundaries of the η-Zn phase. Liu et al. [ 14]
also revealed that Ge decreases the densities of precipitates and improves the corrosion
resistance of Al-Zn-Mg alloys. With increasing Al contents at the grain boundaries, the
corrosion current decreases, and the anodic dissolution declines. However, it can be seen
from Figure 9f–h that the width of the ICA rises from 12 µm to 32 µm as the Ge content
increases from 0.3 wt.% to 0.8 wt.%, indicating the deterioration of corrosion resistance. In
Materials 2025, 18, 5111 9 of 12
particular, the UCA appears for local IGC when the Ge content is 0.8 wt.%. The main reason
for this is that excessive Ge will result in the precipitation of Ge phases at boundaries. The
increase in Ge leads to the enrichment effect of Al at the grain boundary. The purification
effect of Ge on grain boundaries is weakened. The Diamond-Ge and α-Al at boundaries
form microcells with η-Zn, demonstrating the difficulties of corrosion generation along the
η-Zn grain boundaries. At this time, the corrosion width of the filler metal decreases along
the radial direction, and the corrosion resistance of the filler metal reduces.

Figure 11 shows the load–displacement curve and elongation of Zn-2Al-xGe filler met-
als after 15 d of salt spray corrosion. It can be seen that the displacement of four filler metals,
from high to low, is as follows: Zn-2Al-0.3Ge > Zn-2Al-0.5Ge > Zn-2Al-0.8Ge > Zn-2Al.
The Zn-2Al-0.3Ge filler metal has the greatest elongation (16%), which is greater than that
of the Zn-2Al filler metal (2.4%) by 13.6%. This is mainly due to the regulatory effect of
Ge on α-Al in the microstructure of filler metals. Ge promotes the enrichment of Al atoms
in the filler metals, which decreases the Al content at the grain boundaries. The purity
of grain boundaries is beneficial for suppressing intergranular corrosion. Therefore, Ge
slows down the attenuation trend of the mechanical properties of filler metals that results
from corrosion.

4. Conclusions
This study primarily investigates how minor Ge additions influence the corrosion
behavior of Zn-2Al filler metals. The key conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1) The microstructure of Zn-Al-Ge filler metals mainly comprises three phases: η-Zn,
α-Al, and Diamond-Ge. Ge reduces the free energy of the Zn-Al binary alloy system
and promotes the enrichment of Al in the filler metal, which increases the size of
α-Al phases.
(2) Under corrosive conditions, Zn-2Al filler metals undergo electrochemical corrosion,
with α-Al and Diamond-Ge acting as cathodes and η-Zn as the anode. When the Ge
content reaches 0.3 wt.%, the Al content at grain boundaries decreases, reducing the
intergranular corrosion rate. Compared with the Zn-2Al filler metal, the elongation of
the Zn-2Al-0.3Ge filler metal increases by 13.6% after 15 days of salt spray corrosion.
(3) When the Ge content in the filler metal rises to 0.8 wt.%, the purification effect of
Ge on grain boundaries is weakened, and the corrosion resistance of Zn-2Al filler
metals decreases.
