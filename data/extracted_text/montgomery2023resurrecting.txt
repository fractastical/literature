This paper applies the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to propose that the lack of action
in response to the global ecological crisis should be considered a maladaptive
symptom of human activity that we refer to as biophilia deﬁciency syndrome . The
paper is organised into four parts: the characterisation of th e natural world under
the Gaia Hypothesis, the employment of the FEP as a description of the behavior
of self-organising systems, the application of the FEP to Gai a to understand
coupling dynamics between living systems and purportedly non- living planetary
processes, and the oﬀering of positive interventions for addr essing the current
state of ecological crisis under this framework. For the latter, we emphasize the
importance of perturbing stuck states for healthy developmen t, and the necessary
appreciation of life existing as nested systems at multiple l evels in a hierarchy.
We propose the development of human biophilia virtue in accordan ce with the
FEP as a practical intervention for treating biophilia deﬁciency syndrome and
helping to safeguard the balance of planetary processes and the integrity of living
systems that depend on them, oﬀering some examples of what this might look
like in practice. Overall, this paper provides novel insights into how to catalyse
meaningful ecological change, proposing a deliberate and disru ptive approach
to addressing the dysfunctional relationship between humans an d the rest of the
natural world.

/one.tnum. Introduction
The relation of humanity to the rest of the natural world is essentially one of
dependence. Our continued survival and ﬂourishing are utterly contingent upon the state
and functioning of our environment, which supplies us with eatable food, drinkable water,
and breathable air. In the most practical sense possible, we are existentially bound to the
rest of nature. Moreover, extensive empirical evidence demonstrates that connection to
natural environments is a key ingredient of mental health. Speciﬁcally, spending time in
natural settings has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, and enhance mood,
cognitive function, mental health and wellbeing (
White et al., 2019 ; Bratman et al., 2021 ).
The psychological construct “connection to the world” correlates with therapeutic outcomes
in treatment for depression (
Watts et al., 2022 ), while Berto (2014) found that even exposure
to images of natural scenes can improve mood and cognitive function. These results suggest
that nature can be a powerful tool for promoting mental health and wellbeing.

However, to frame the value of nature purely in such utilitarian
terms would be to gravely miss the point. Recent research in
cognitive science suggests that humans possess an innate cognitive
disposition towards nature, known as “biophilia.” This concept,
coined by biologist
Wilson (1984), purportedly has deep roots in
our evolutionary history as the natural psychological disposition
of humans to seek out and connect with other living organisms
and natural environments (
Clowney, 2013 ; Olivos-Jara et al.,
2020; Barbiero and Berto, 2021 ). This evolutionary adaptation is
believed to be the biological basis for human values of nature and
environmental virtue (
Clowney, 2013 ): the sense of connection
and identity with, and fondness for (the continued existence
of) all forms of life on Earth entails a sense of care towards
the rest of the natural world and a willingness to protect it
(
Rowlandson, 2015 ). The concept of biophilia is therefore not
merely a psychological theory, but rather a fundamental aspect
of human nature that has played a crucial role in our survival
and adaptation throughout our evolutionary history. The ﬂip-
side to this bond is the increasing prevalence of eco-anxiety
among young adults and children upon learning about climate
change, and observing human inaction towards it (
Pihkala, 2020 ;
Baudon and Jachens, 2021 ; Gunasiri et al., 2022 ). The question
remains as to whether there can be an eﬀective therapeutic strategy
that addresses eco-anxiety without addressing the fundamental
ecological crisis, or whether they are two crises which can only be
tackled together.
We therefore arrive at a philosophical dilemma. On the
one hand, human beings are imbued with biophilia, the “innate
emotional aﬃliation . . . to other living organisms” (
Wilson,
1993; p. 31). This biopsychological disposition suggests that
people would be inclined to strive to protect and preserve the
environment, including mitigating and ideally overcoming the
threats of ecological breakdown. On the other hand, the lack
of action to address the ecological crisis appears contradictory
to this biophilic inclination. As our population and global
footprint continue to expand, humanity’s catastrophic impact
on the Earth has become increasingly apparent: it is by now
beyond doubt that activities such as deforestation, pollution
of the oceans, and greenhouse gas emissions are harming
our planet.
This paper seeks to address the contradiction between the
biophilic inclination towards environmental protection and the
lack of action taken to address the current ecological crisis.
The paper proceeds in four parts. First, the natural world is
characterised by the Gaia Hypothesis (GH). Second, the Free
Energy Principle (FEP) is described, and then, third, employed to
further develop and augment the GH. Fourth, it is argued that
human failure to act on the ecological crisis does not invalidate
the FEP. Rather, it is shown that this failure is indicative of an
imbalance between active and sensory states, which reﬂects an
unhealthy condition in the human species. If not addressed, this
condition will lead to the dissipation of adaptation, the painful
decline of our species, and ultimately the end of (human) “life as
we know it” (
Friston, 2013 ). The paper concludes by proposing
that organised action motivated by biophilia in line with the FEP
is necessary to treat this unhealthy condition.
/two.tnum. The Gaia Hypothesis
“We have to use the crude tool of metaphor to translate
conscious ideas into unconscious understanding.” (Lovelock,
2007, p. 178).
The Gaia Hypothesis—named after the goddess who
personiﬁed Earth in Ancient Greek mythology ( Lovelock,
1972)—holds as its central tenet that the conditions required
for life on our planet are maintained by and for the biosphere
(Lovelock and Margulis, 1974 ). The “biosphere” (synonymous with
“Gaia” hereafter) refers to the thin spherical layer of the planet at
which life exists, starting where rock meets magma roughly 100
miles below the surface, and extending another 100 miles towards
the thermosphere where air meets space (
Lovelock, 2007; p. 19; see
Figure 1). Consisting of rock, soil, water, air, and all of the ∼ 5.5 x
1014 kg of organic matter in the known universe ( Bar-On et al.,
2018), Gaia is a geophysiological entity, since the totality of life and
its non-living environment are bound as a single interdependent
system (
Lovelock, 1989). The “abiotic” parts are considered part of
the total living organism, like the shell of a snail ( Lovelock, 1972).
The GH is motivated by the fact that during the 3.8 billion
years that life has persisted on Earth, conditions have remained
remarkably constant and favourable across a huge range of
parameters. Most obvious of these is temperature, which has
remained within the tight parameters required for life to survive
and thrive, despite an increase of the sun’s output by at least
30% since life began (
Lovelock and Margulis, 1974 ). The same
applies to the pH and salinity of the ocean, despite the incessant
depositing of salts from the land into the ocean by rivers (
Lovelock,
2007; p. 34), and to the chemical composition of the soil and
atmosphere ( Lovelock and Watson, 1982 ). For a quarter of the
time the universe has existed, these and countless other variables
have been vastly diﬀerent from what they “should” be, lying far
from equilibrium at the levels that just happen to support life,
even withstanding countless catastrophic volcanic eruptions, solar
ﬂares and asteroid strikes (
Lovelock, 1979 ; p. 33). “For this to have
happened by chance, ” originator James Lovelock says, “is as unlikely
as to survive unscathed a drive blindfolded through rush-hour
traﬃc.” (
Lovelock, 1989, p. 10).
The Gaia Hypothesis instead takes this constancy to be a natural
product of evolution. However, in a modiﬁcation of canonical
Darwinism, rather than the evolution of individual organisms to
an inert environment, “what evolves is the whole Earth system with
its living and non-living parts existing as a tight coupled entity.”
(
Lovelock, 2007 , p. 178). This can be understood through the
“hologenome” concept ( Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2011 ):
according to this framework, a holobiont—a living host plus all
of the smaller organisms living in dependence to it—is the unit
of selection, such that changes in environmental parameters can
lead to long-term adaptive changes to the holobiont via iterative
changes to the constituent living systems. This is corroborated by
Pricean formalisations, which demonstrate that natural selection
can be extended to accommodate evolution (of Gaia) without
reproduction (
Bourrat, 2023 ). Thus, in a neo-Lamarckian turn

within a Darwinian framework, the combined genetic wealth
of information of the whole system (the hologenome) acquires
characteristics that are conducive to its continued existence and in
turn aﬀect changes on the environment.
The biosphere thereby constitutes a complex system which
“appears to have the . . . goal of regulating the climate and the
chemistry at a comfortable state of life.” (p. 19). This fact was
recognised by the scientiﬁc community in the 2001 Amsterdam
Declaration, where it was acknowledged that the Earth is indeed
a self-regulating system (
Moore et al., 2001 ): just as an animal
employs homeostatic feedback cycles to maintain viable conditions
for its survival, the biosphere is kept within the limits needed for its
own continued existence by thermodynamic imperatives (
Karnani
and Annila, 2009 ). This self-regulation tends not towards set points
but adapts in a ﬂexible manner to support the particular current life
forms given the current environmental conditions (
Lovelock, 2007,
p. 19)./one.tnum
Some literature on simulations can elucidate this further.
“Daisyworld” was originally a caricature of Gaia wherein the
only life forms—black and white daisies—absorb and reﬂect light,
respectively (
Watson and Lovelock, 1983 ). Temperature-driven
competition between the two creates a balance in populations
and therefore albedo eﬀects, such that a planetary temperature
favouring daisy growth is maintained, even as the output of the
nearby “sun” varies in the simulation (
Watson and Lovelock, 1983 ).
Considered as a complex adaptive system, Daisyworld thereby
exhibits “emergent self–regulation as a consequence of feedback
coupling between life and its environment” (
Lenton and van Oijen,
2002).
/one.tnum For instance, oxygen, which was extremely poisonous to the organisms
of the time, was virtually absent from the atmosphere for more than a billion
years of life, until the explosion of aerobic life coincided with a dramatic
increase of oxygen levels as it was produced by cyanobacteria (Schirrmeister
et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/three.tnum; Lyons et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/four.tnum).
More recent models have corroborated and extended these
ﬁndings. Using standard methodology from quantitative genetics,
it has been shown that the self-regulating dynamics are explainable
purely in terms of the low-level evolutionary dynamics of
competition between the daisies: no higher level principle
(such as teleology) need be invoked (
Wood and Coe, 2007 ;
Makarieva, 2022 ; Bourrat, 2023 ), at least at certain timescales
(Weaver and Dyke, 2012 ). The implications have also been
corroborated by models of diﬀerent properties of organic
systems: for instance, the metabolically abstract microorganism
system (METAMIC) model simulates nutrient recycling (rather
than temperature regulation) given appropriate thermodynamic
constraints, and largely recapitulates the relevant behaviour of
Daisyworld (
Downing, 2002, 2003). Further, models based on based
on Chemical Organization Theory (COT) and the Zero Deﬁciency
Theorem (ZDT) demonstrate the autopoietic properties of the
biosphere, and suggest how these might relate to other intrinsic
features of living systems, such as autonomy and anticipation
(
Rubin et al., 2021 ). Finally, Daisyworld has been used in spatial
systems dynamics simulations which demonstrate the importance
of spatio-temporal interactions in such systems, thereby bridging
the gap between purely abstract models and the three-dimensional
coupling involving the biosphere (
Neuwirth et al., 2015 ).
At a broader level, the perspective that the GH brings is
appealing for many reasons. Conceptualised as a single complex
system, Gaia changes in a way that is adaptive and non-linear
(
Lovelock, 1979 ); it displays dynamical, emergent, and sudden
tipping behaviour: when bifurcation points are reached, new
attractor states form, and higher order is established ( Lovelock,
1979, 1989; Gleick, 1987 ; Capra, 1997 ; Lenton et al., 2020b );/two.tnum
importantly for our purposes, it is self-organising (Lenton and
/two.tnum These tipping points are partly what make climate change sucha diﬃcult
challenge, especially since we won’t necessarily know when they h ave been
passed (Lenton et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnumb).
Frontiers in Psychology /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
Montgomery and Hipólito /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/three.tnum
van Oijen, 2002 ), and strong emphasis is given to the extreme
interdependence between the processes of the system ( Capra,
1997). Due to this combination of properties, the GH has both
informed and been informed by a wide range of ﬁelds including
ecology, climate science, cybernetics, complex systems theory,
chaos mathematics, and the philosophy of mind.
Furthermore, there is an intuitive—and, indeed, poetic—
attraction to Gaian thinking, as it allows us to transcend
conventional levels of analysis, bridge philosophy and science, and
prompt novel discussions on planetary-scale issues (
Ruse, 2013 ).
We generally ﬁnd it intuitively easy to distinguish life from non-
life, but only at the (somewhat arbitrary) level of resolution that
the range of our senses allows: we would not recognise an E. coli
bacterium without a microscope (
Lovelock, 2007; p. 174). Similarly,
although we struggle to see it that way ( Lenton et al., 2020a ),
the natural way for aliens observing the Earth from space would
plausibly be not to see a writhing mass of individual organisms on
a dead planet, but rather a rock that has come to life (
Oliver, 2020;
p. 11). As a mode of thought, this visualisation of Gaia, while not
necessary to comprehend it, provides a powerful tool for scientiﬁc
understanding (
de Regt, 2014 ). Thus, like the “overview eﬀect”
experienced by astronauts viewing our planet from orbit ( White,
2014), the GH oﬀers a glimpse of a fundamentally diﬀerent way of
thinking that in fact dominated most of human history, whereby
the world was considered a single living organism—a “Thou” rather
than an “It” (
Frankfort et al., 1960 ). This may amount to a revival
of some important elements of animism in its most basic form: a
sensed appreciation of the vitality of the more-than-human aspects
of Earth (
Abram, 1997).
However, the GH has been subject to a wide range of
criticisms (see e.g., Ruse, 2013 ; Rubin and Cruciﬁx, 2022 ). Of
the two most vociferous objections, however, the ﬁrst worries
unnecessarily that the use of language in the formulation of the idea
entails commitments concerning the divine, sentient, or otherwise
supernatural status of Gaia. Despite being largely compatible
with strong claims such as those made in panpsychism, and
somewhat ontologically slippery as an edge case of metaphysical
categories,
Lovelock (2007; p. 20) stresses that his illustrative
goddess metaphor is just that.
Secondly, it has variously been argued that the GH is either
false or unfalsiﬁable ( Kirchner, 1989). Both cannot be correct, and,
while it clearly contains and presupposes certain empirical claims
(concerning the age of the solar system, the composition of the
atmosphere, and so on), the actual idea of the biosphere as a self-
regulating system is not a “hypothesis” at all but a perspective,
a way of describing the fact of life’s existence on Earth (though
we will stick to its conventional name to avoid confusion). As
per the assertions of
Elgin (2019), truth is deﬁned within this
framework, rather than applied to it, and the mode of thinking
that the GH engenders “refracts” with other modes, rather than
competing with them. This is the “explanatory pluralism” that
Kleinhans et al. (2010) refer to in their conclusion from an analysis
of the philosophy of earth science.
Like Newtonian physics or psychoanalysis, the GH is therefore
much more a framework or a method of investigation than it
is a falsiﬁable empirical claim, and it is therefore to be judged
by its usefulness, not its purported correctness, where usefulness
is determined by factors such as parsimony, coherence and
consistency, plus its power to explain phenomena, produce new
facts, and so on, in a given context and a given time-frame (
de Regt
and Dieks, 2005 ). Thus, we eﬀectively adopt a broadly pragmatic
epistemological view of scientiﬁc understanding with regards to
GH, similar to that endorsed by
de Regt (2009) and others. By
analogy, when meeting someone on the street, we conventionally
treat the object of the encounter as a single fellow living being,
rather than a composite menagerie of over 40 trillion discrete
microorganisms in a state of cohabitation (
Sender et al., 2016 ).
This “Human Hypothesis” is not more or less correct than a
“Microorganism Hypothesis, ” it is simply a diﬀerent (and usually
more useful) scale at which to engage with the phenomena. In
principle, then, the GH can at worst be called unpragmatic, but
not false.
/three.tnum. The Free Energy Principle for
self-organising interacting systems
In this section, we aim to present the fundamental framework
of the FEP and active inference. Subsequently, we intend to
apply this framework to the planetary-scale processes which
comprise Gaia. By doing so, we can apply the FEP to analyse the
interdependent dynamics between living systems and (non-living)
planetary processes. Speciﬁcally, this framework allows us to gain
insights into future states of Gaia, formulate predictions, and devise
potential interventions to alleviate future dysfunction.
The second law of thermodynamics, which governs the
behaviour of energy and entropy in a system, stipulates that all
open systems—which means almost all systems in the natural
world—tend to dissipate, i.e., tend towards chaos or increased
entropy. For example, a cup of hot coﬀee will always cool down
to room temperature, but it will never spontaneously heat back up
to its original temperature. The principles of thermodynamics in
physics stipulate that the behaviour of open systems is critically
inﬂuenced by the interaction with the environment. The ﬂow of
these interactions cannot be replicated in the opposite direction due
to the irreversible nature of time (
Von Bertalanﬀy, 1950 ; Ptaszy´nski
and Esposito, 2019 ; Pokrovskii, 2020; Rovelli, 2023).
However, there are displays of “negentropy” ( Schrödinger,
1944), pockets of the universe where order and bodily integrity
are maintained in the face of the surge towards chaos. These
pockets are self-organising systems, or “ things” (
Hipólito, 2019 ),
including—but not limited to—living organisms. These things resist
entropy by interacting with the world such that their integrity
is maintained, i.e., the process of homeostasis. They use energy
to keep themselves within the restricted set of possible states
that allows for their continued existence. Hence the workings of
feedback cycles—drinking when one is thirsty, retreating from a
hot ﬁre, etc.—represent work that can only be done by the energy
that is “bound” within the system and therefore useful, whilst
the remainder is called “free” energy (
Friston and Stephan, 2007 ).
Simply by existing, then—by virtue of seemingly defying the second
law of thermodynamics by acting to minimise entropy—all such
self-organising systems necessarily act so that their free energy is
minimised. This is the Free Energy Principle.
Moreover, a system’s free energy bears upon various other
related concepts in addition to entropy, including the number of

possible states the system can manifest, the predictability of its
behaviour, and the level of “surprise” associated with new data
(
Table 1)./three.tnumFurthermore, at least in Karl Friston’s formulation, /four.tnumfree
energy is equal to information, i.e., the number of new binary
facts about the state of the world gleaned by a system from a
given data sample (
Solms, 2021 ). This means that, adhering to
the FEP , every thing should act so as to minimise the amount of
information about the world it needs to process, which amounts to
minimizing its free energy, chaos or entropy and thus maintaining
its physical integrity.
Organisms minimise free energy by action. Active inference is
a corollary of the FEP that allows us to model and understand a
complex system’s behaviour. In its formulation, living systems:
will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference . In other
words, they will appear to model—and act on—their world to
preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to
homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis ( Friston, 2013 ;
p. 1, emphasis added).
“Active inference” is a modelling technique that, because
it employs a scale-free formalism known as Markov blankets,
allows us to understand and make predictions about the coupling
dynamics taking place between interacting systems. A living system
is equated with “internal states, ” while the system it interacts
with is “external states.” Because, mathematically, internal and
external states are conditionally independent, they do not directly
inﬂuence one another. The direct inﬂuence occurs via yet another
set of states: active and sensory states. A balanced reciprocal
inﬂuence between active and sensory states is fundamental for a
system (internal states) to maintain a healthy interaction with—and
thereby adaptation to—its environment (external states).
These interdependencies and dynamics are understood by
employing a Markov blanket. A Markov blanket is a statistical
tool that can be applied to any system that self-organises. More
precisely it furnishes probabilistically deﬁned tools to set a system’s
boundaries through conditional dependence or independence
/three.tnum Though a technical term, this formal meaning of ‘surprise’ is close enough
to its use in common parlance.
/four.tnum As opposed to Helmholtz’s and Gibbs’ free energy, which refer to related
thermodynamic and chemical quantities, respectively.
relationships. Because they are scale-free, they can be applied
to any level of analysis of the natural world. The concept of
Markov blanket involves deﬁning a set of variables, denoted as b,
that surround the internal states while labelling all other external
variables as η .
The internal and active states are a function of a system’s
internal and blanket states. Similarly, external and sensory states
are a function of external and blanket states. This sparse dynamical
coupling means that the state of a system at a moment in time
results from the interactive dynamics between internal, sensory and
active states; meanwhile, the state of the environment at a moment
in time is a result of the dynamics between external, sensory and
active states. It follows from this that internal and external states
reciprocally (indirectly) inﬂuence each other.
There are therefore two ways for a thing to minimise its free
energy, and thereby maintain its own integrity and continued
existence: the ﬁrst is to change the model (or belief) that it
instantiates so as to more closely resemble the world, by perpetually
generating, testing and updating it based on incoming prediction
error information. The second is to change the world by acting upon
it to bring it in line with predictions, under the generative model.
These processes form a feedback loop, from within the system to
without and vice versa (as seen in
Figure 2).
This loop involves the system being described as if using
inference to both update its model of the environment and act upon
it, as illustrated by
Figure 3 in the case of a human. The loop can be
described in terms of the following steps (where we can regard free
energy as the total amount of prediction error):
1. The generation of a prediction of its sensory input based on
its internal model. This prediction is compared to the actual
sensory input to generate a prediction error.
2. The updating of its internal model to reduce the prediction
error. This involves adjusting the probabilities assigned to
various possible causes of the sensory input.
3. Based on an updated internal model, the system is then
supposed to generate an action that it “believes” will lead to
a predicted outcome in the environment.
4. The system’s action upon the environment is seen as
generating new sensory input.
5. The loop then repeats, as a system generating a new prediction
of sensory input based on the updated internal model, and
so on.
The system is then understood by scientiﬁcally interpreting
and predicting its behaviour as a system’s internal model is
constantly updated in response to new sensory input to improve the
accuracy of predictions. This loop therefore minimises the system’s
uncertainty about the causes of its sensory input, since it is driven
by (or amounts to) the minimisation of free energy.

blanket consisting of sensory (green) and active (blue) states . The schematic highlights directed inﬂuences with dotted conne ctors. Autonomous
states are those not inﬂuenced by external states, while sensor y and autonomous states constitute an entity, namely, blanket an d internal states. A
system of scientiﬁc interest (e.g., a cell, an organ, an organism, a community, an ecosystem) is composed of sensory, active, and int ernal states, as
described in more detail by
Hipólito (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/nine.tnum).
FIGURE /three.tnum
An organism-environment interaction. Active inference and the Free Energy Principle describe a closed causal loop of action and p erception within a
system, such as a human. This loop involves the system using infe rence to both update its model of the environment and act upon it.and ecosystems are self-organising systems which are each part
of a larger multiscaled system. The FEP framework facilitates
greater understanding of current states and enables us to make
predictions about future states. Additionally, it helps to identify
and develop interventions to rectify any maladaptive responses,
namely actions which are antithetical to maintaining the integrity
of a system: human behaviour that leads to an imbalance within
the Markov blanket states is therefore to be considered maladaptive
or pathological.
As a self-organising system, Gaia meets the requirements to
be formalised as part of an active inference system. It exists
in non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), viz. its processes and
states must persist over time within a range of states that
are far from equilibrium (i.e., resisting entropy); and it is
distinguishable from its larger scale cosmic environment, deﬁned
by conditional independence between its internal and external
states (which inﬂuence each other only vicariously through
blanket states).
The issue of distinguishability—that is, the ability to
diﬀerentiate the biosphere from the earth’s core on one side
and the larger-scale solar system, galaxy, and universe on the
other—presents a challenge. Experts from diverse ﬁelds, from
climate and complexity scientists to Buddhist philosophers,
have stressed that the biosphere is an integral part of the larger
cosmic environment, demonstrating fundamental continuity with
and interdependent upon it (

The Markov blankets of Gaia. When we consider the geophysical proc esses of the biosphere as internal states , the external states refer to everything
outside the organism, including the atmosphere, other planets, a nd celestial bodies. Sensory states include gravitational eﬀects of other celestial
bodies, climate and weather, the evolution of life, the compositi on of the atmosphere. Active states are the Earth’s gravitational eﬀects, magnetic
ﬁeld, radiation etc.
Danvers, 2016 ; Kaçar et al., 2021 ; Boulton, 2022 ; Stahel, 2022 ).
However, while the ontological continuity of the Earth and the rest
of the universe should be emphasised, it is nevertheless possible
to employ epistemic (statistical) tools to help us understand the
interactions between multiscaled systems, in the same way that we
can usefully distinguish between cells and organisms or countries
and continents without supposing that they are truly separable.
We can therefore use Markov blankets to elucidate
the interdependencies and dynamics between the nested
systems, since, as outlined above, a Markov blanket is
scale-free, making it suitable for application across various
scales in the natural world, depending on the object of
scientiﬁc interest. For example, we can employ Markov
blankets in a multi-scale system to further understand and
predict the interactions between human behaviour, Gaia, and
the Cosmos.
To envision what this might look like, we can draw from
Rubin et al. (2020) who assigned Markov blankets speciﬁcally
to the Earth’s climate system. The authors begin by deﬁning
metabolic rates of the biosphere as internal states and the
changes in “space weather” (mostly driven by solar radiation)
as external states. Further, they deﬁne active states as the
changes in greenhouse eﬀects and the reﬂection of sunlight, and
sensory states as ocean-driven changes in global temperatures.
Internal and external states are conditionally independent, thereby
indirectly inﬂuencing each other via the ocean’s very slow
reaction to thermal ﬂuctuation. Through this formalism, “the
Earth’s climate system [can] be interpreted as an anticipatory
system that minimises variational free energy” (
Rubin et al.,
2020).
As stressed previously, because Markov blankets are a scale-
free formalism, we can broaden our object of scientiﬁc interest
to cover the entire biosphere. If the geophysiological processes
of the biosphere are considered internal states, then external
states would refer to the external environment, which includes
everything outside of the system, such as the outer atmosphere,
and other planets and celestial bodies, as well as the molten
core of the planet lying below the Earth’s crust. Sensory states
are the inﬂuences the external environmental states have on the
planet Earth such as the impact on the Earth’s rotation, orbit,
and ocean tides by gravitational eﬀects of the sun, moon, and
other planets. Earthquakes and volcanoes caused by the inﬂuence
of by convection currents within the mantle on plate tectonics;
climate and weather are inﬂuenced by solar radiation and space
weather events; cosmic events like meteor impacts can trigger
evolutionary changes and cause mass extinctions; the composition
of the Earth’s atmosphere is similarly inﬂuenced by cosmic events.
Active states are simply the capacity of the earth to assimilate
external inﬂuence and adjust to it (i.e., change its properties) in
ways that will feed back to the external states. For example, the
Earth’s gravitational force causes slight perturbations in the orbits
of other objects in the solar system, and its magnetic ﬁeld interacts
with the solar wind, aﬀecting phenomena such as the aurora
borealis. The Earth also emits radiation that can be detected by
other objects in the solar system, even from billions of kilometers
away (
Figure 4).
The active states of a system embody its primary mechanism
for self-regulation, representing its eﬀorts to remain within the
bounds required for ongoing existence, based on predictions about
the present and future states of the system. For instance, the current
levels of greenhouse and albedo eﬀects, soil pH, and the number
of living organisms reﬂect the predictive attempts of the Gaian
system to adapt to the anticipated eﬀects of solar events, volcanic
eruptions, ocean salinity changes, and other environmental factors
in the future. It is in this context that the role of life itself assumes
paramount importance in the self-regulation of the biosphere.
In information theory, the dynamics described above can
be explained by considering the active states as realizing the
prior predictions of the generative model, while the sensory
states provide information resulting from the external world,
which is used to update the inferred state of the biosphere into
posterior beliefs. The system responds to prediction errors, to
accommodate this new information, while at the same time acting
on the external states to resolve the prediction error, to the
Frontiers in Psychology /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org
Montgomery and Hipólito /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/three.tnum
extent possible. Note that only certain kinds of prediction errors
can be actively resolved. In neurobiology, the prediction errors
resolved by movement are the predictions of signals from the
muscles, known as proprioception. If prediction errors cannot
be resolved via action, then they will be resolved by changing
predictions. This can be cast as Bayesian belief updating and an
elemental kind of perception. Updating the priors to accommodate
this new information causes a change in the macro properties
responsible for enabling such ﬂuctuations, thereby updating the
model itself such that the mutual information between the
internal and external states is maximised, and free energy is
minimised. Describing Gaia as a complex system of interacting,
self-organising processes that exist in non-equilibrium steady
states, actively adapting to changing environmental conditions,
aﬀords new syntheses between diﬀerent conceptual approaches.
For instance, combining the greenhouse eﬀect and the role of life
in the biosphere provides a unique opportunity to incorporate
energy and information as two aspects of the same underlying
physical process (
Hermann-Pilath, 2011), namely the minimisation
of free energy.
Finally, a purported weakness of the FEP actually speaks in
favour of its application to the GH. /five.tnumRaja et al. (2021) rightly
point out that Markov blankets do not automatically capture every
relevant property of biological systems: relational properties such as
aﬀordances—what the environment “oﬀers the animal [sic], what
it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (
Gibson, 1979 ;
p. 127)—fall into this bracket. However, the claim that they are
precluded by the FEP is not true, at least with respect to the
biosphere: on the contrary, aﬀordances correspond well to Gaia as
one rung in a ladder of nested Markov blankets—with the system
in question at every level ranging up from, say, cells and organs,
through animals and ecosystems, to our solar system (
Dennison,
2020) and the whole cosmos. In this framework, it is entirely
coherent to say that our solar system is one that aﬀords a living
planet, or that the geosphere aﬀords a biosphere, when we consider
that lower levels or layers in such hierarchies operate at much faster
rates of change than higher levels (
Wu, 2013 ). The aﬀordances
available in an environment are not determined solely by the
physical properties of the environment, but also by the organism’s
goals, abilities, and previous experiences. In the case of the sun and
its aﬀordances for life on the planet, we can apply this theory to
understand how the physical properties of the sun, as well as the
goals and abilities of organisms on Earth, shape the aﬀordances that
the sun provides.
The same principles of dynamics, interdependence and scale
apply to the symbiotic evolution and exchange of genetic
information throughout the history of life (
Paracer and Ahmadjian,
2000; Watson, 2002 ; Gontier, 2016 ), and, increasingly, to the
tight coupling between humans and technology and the possible
emergence of autonomous symbiotic AI systems (
Wang et al.,
2021). Hierarchy theory is therefore not only compatible with the
/five.tnum Note that applications of the FEP to systems such as animals introduces
the notion of planning (as inference) in a psychological sense and the
consideration of epistemic and pragmatic aﬀordances. However, h ere, we
are applying the FEP to the systems that do not necessarily pla n, such as the
weather, market economy, evolution, et cetera.
FEP as applied to the Gaia Hypothesis, it is a highly tractable vehicle
for understanding it, in terms of the complexity in ecosystems
(
Allen and Starr, 2017 ), the evolution of the planetary genome
across billions of years ( Margulis and Sagan, 1995 ) and changes
to the (“non-living”) aspects of ecological landscapes ( King, 1997 )
at diﬀerent scales of time and space. Overall, there is good
evidence that phenomena in earth science are emergent, but
should be considered irreducible to the laws of physics (
Kleinhans
et al., 2010 ): we therefore aim to marry “bottom-up” principles
intrinsic to the FEP from fundamental physics to the higher-level
phenomena captured by the GH. As emphasised above, we are not
arguing not that this approach to understanding life on Earth is the
best one, merely that it can be beneﬁcial.
/five.tnum. Human behaviour as an aspect of
Gaia
We can now employ Markov blankets to further understand
and predict the actions of humans within the biosphere.
Speciﬁcally, we want to understand the extent to which human
behaviour is antithetical to the healthy behaviour of the larger
system, why this is the case according to the FEP , and what might
be done to improve the situation.
Larger systems provide the smaller nested systems they
contain with existential challenges as well as aﬀordances: the sun
provides energy for photosynthesis and regulation of the climate,
but also threatens humans with bad harvests and skin cancer.
These challenges demand adaptation in a dynamic fashion. The
mechanism for this—as per the FEP—is to assimilate information
(in the form of prediction error) of an upcoming threat from the
world, and act accordingly on the world such that the system’s
integrity will be maintained and free energy minimised. Thus,
according to the FEP , living beings have a natural tendency to
act upon their environment to prevent the dissipation of their
integrity. Therefore, if the principle holds true, the knowledge
that (for example) climate change caused by continued greenhouse
gas emissions will have catastrophic consequences for continued
human existence should prompt drastic action from the human
species to rectify it, in the form of behaviour that reﬂects
biophilia. The lack of such action can be seen as an imbalance
within (Markov) blanket states, therefore indicating a profoundly
unhealthy condition in the human species, whereby it is unable
to maintain its integrity by adapting to changing environmental
conditions. It is the combination of knowing that disrupting the
balance in such a way is self-harming, and yet acting as if this were
not the case that constitutes a pathological state.
According to the FEP , a system’s interaction with the
environment consists of using inference to both update the model
of the environment and act upon it to make the environment ﬁt the
model.
/six.tnumTherefore, learning (as we have done) that the global status
quo represents a serious threat to human civilisation, one would
expect to see behaviour change accordingly. This would amount to
gathering more evidence and then acting upon it to minimise free
/six.tnum Or, fails to attenuate sensory evidence that nothing is — or can —be done
about the situation.
Frontiers in Psychology /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org
Montgomery and Hipólito /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyg./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum/six.tnum/nine.tnum/six.tnum/three.tnum
energy and, by extension, preventing the rise of entropy, chaos, and
the ultimate dissipation of life.
Instead, the human species either rejects the information
available so as to remove the imperative for action or, possessing
the information available, still refrains from taking action, or worse,
continues the same harmful behaviour and perpetuates the same
systems (such as capitalism) that enable it. If the FEP holds, then
the observed contradictory behaviour is a maladaptive state, arising
as an imbalance within the Markov blanket states (
Figure 5).
Using the lens of the FEP to model the dynamics of the
relationship between humans and the environment, it is possible
to see the current lack of sustainability and pro-environmental
behaviour as a pathology of the human species that must receive
treatment. We label this condition biophilia deﬁciency syndrome .
To unpack the notion of biophilia deﬁciency syndrome—and lend
it construct validity—it is useful to consider other applications
of the FEP to pathology. In general, these applications rest upon
instances of false inference, of the sort found in psychiatry and
neurology. For example, inferring things are not there when they
are, describes certain dissociative and hysterical (e.g., neglect)
syndromes. Conversely, inferring things are there when they are
not, describes phenomena like hallucinations and delusions.
These pathologies are commonplace in computational
psychiatry and generally reduce to a failure to assign the right
weight or precision to prediction errors. Perhaps the most prescient
example of this is Parkinson’s disease, characterised by a failure to
initiate movement or action that manifests as bradykinesia. From
the perspective of the FEP , this is simply explained by a failure to
attenuate evidence from sensors providing evidence that the one
is not moving. Put simply, a failure to realise prior predictions
can be due to a failure to ignore evidence that predictions are not
coming true. This seems to be an apt description of our communal
and cultural response to the ecological crisis. In other words,
biophilia deﬁciency syndrome can be seen as a collective or cultural
Parkinsonism that inherits from our inability to attenuate the
evidence that we are not acting in a remedial or restorative fashion.
From the perspective of the FEP , this is a pernicious pathology
because doing nothing is a Bayes optimal response in the
face of a pathological attention to various sources of evidence.
In computational psychiatry, one then is led to therapeutic
interventions that rest either on restoring neurochemical deﬁcits
in the brain or engaging in therapy that allows people to become
skilled in deploying their attention—and exploring other models
of active engagement with the world. In short, enabling patients to
escape from particular patterns of active inference in which they
are stuck.
By leveraging the concepts of the FEP and active inference,
a compelling analogous perspective on how humans relate to
the ecological crisis emerges. The FEP and active inference
formalisms shed light on climate change and the wider
ecological crisis as a predicament that is both human-generated
and often disregarded due to a lack of action. According
to the FEP , living systems possess a biologically encoded
inclination to interact with their environment in order to survive
and adapt.
However, the current state of aﬀairs diverges from this
natural inclination. Despite climate change being a pressing
issue, proactive measures to reverse its eﬀects are not given
the priority they deserve. This discrepancy between the
expected and observed actions can be understood in the
framework of the FEP as an illness. It implies that systems,
including human societies, may form erroneous inferences
that prevent them from eﬀectively addressing the problem
at hand.
Given this characterisation, it is imperative that we recognise
the current ecological imbalance as a “stuck state” that requires
active disturbance to bring about systemic change (for detail see
Hipolito, 2023 ). What we are calling for amounts to a kind of
“homeostatic awakening” (Wong and Bartlett, 2022 ): a deliberately-
induced, disruptive shift in trajectory reﬂecting a prioritisation of
planetary homeostasis over inﬁnite growth. To achieve this, we
must focus on addressing the reciprocal unbalanced inﬂuences
between sensory and active states at multiple levels of nested
systems, rather than solely at the level of the individual: the best
eﬀorts of individuals to change their own behaviour will be in
vain so long as the lack of appreciation of dynamics at higher
nested levels persists. On the other hand, if we can come to truly
understand our relationship to Gaia at a depth that becomes part
of cultural common sense,
/seven.tnumthen we will no longer be able to deny
our current knowledge, and more appropriate behaviour will follow
as a natural reﬂection of our (FEP-driven) values. Meaningfully
addressing the ecological crisis is therefore synonymous with
restoring the felt connection between humans and the rest of life
on Earth, such that we collectively come to truly embody the fact
that we are a part of, not apart from, the natural world (
Seth,
2022). This will entail the transformation of the very concepts of
“self” and “nature” to reﬂect a part-to-whole relation, rather than
a subject-object dichotomy, in much the same way that integrating
the understanding that the Earth revolves around the sun required a
shift in what those words actually mean (
Kuhn, 1962)./eight.tnum
It should be clear that individual responses will not suﬃce for
problems that are essentially collective and relational. Thus, beyond
enforcing institutional climate commitments at the national and
international levels, future work should focus on identifying
strategies for action and intervention at community, societal and
whole-species levels to stimulate both the integration of ecological
knowledge and the practice of biophilia virtue. In this way, both
sides of the Markov blanket are addressed simultaneously in an
/seven.tnum It is arguably only in WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialised, rich,
democratic) cultures that this is not already the case: “Many i ndigenous belief
systems share a view of people and nature as part of an extended ecological

Raramuri worldview includes ‘Iwigara’: the total interconnecte dness of all

feeling separate from nature would signify a state of disconnectedne ss and
constitute a signiﬁcant rupture in wellbeing .” ( Watts et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum, emphasis

eﬀort to remedy the insulation of internal states (i.e., to address
the loss of connection between humans and the Earth;
Figure 5).
Providing a full manifesto for doing so is far beyond the scope
of this paper; however, some intuitive examples of measures that
can point towards directions of implementation and be taken at
the institutional level to catalyse biophilia virtue as conceptualised
under the FEP may include the following:
(1) Education: Ecopedagogy is a holistic approach to education
that emphasises the interdependence of social, economic, and
ecological systems. One of the main goals of ecopedagogy is
to integrate environmental sustainability and social justice into
educational practices and to encourage learners to take an active
role in addressing environmental and social issues. By promoting
experiential and place-based learning, ecopedagogy encourages
learners to connect with their local environment and community,
fostering a deeper understanding of ecological systems and
their interrelationships (as opposed to the abstract intellectual
knowledge many of us currently harbour). For example, learning
about the fundamental role of fungi in the web of life through
mycology can foster an appreciation of Gaia’s interconnected nature
and prompt a shift away from the anthropocentric insistence on
thinking of organisms as individuals (
Sheldrake, 2020 ), as well as
providing practical skills in food-growing and restorative practices
(
Stamets, 2005).
Ecopedagogy also emphasises critical thinking skills and
encourages learners to engage in social and environmental activism,
by promoting, ﬁrstly, a true reciprocity between nature and humans
(
Varanasi, 2020 ) that recognises that the fate of the latter is
dependent on the state of the former, and secondly, non-linear
thinking, so that the Earth and its inhabitants can be encountered
as the highly complex adaptive systems they are (
Varela et al.,
1991; Margulis and Sagan, 1995 ; Capra, 1997 ; Duncan, 2018 ;
Fried and Robinaugh, 2020 ; Hayes and Andrews, 2020 ). Thus
individuals and collectives can become more aware of the impact
of human activities on the natural world at multiple levels of
analysis, and develop a corresponding sense of responsibility
towards the environment (
Zysltra et al., 2014 ; Norat et al., 2016 ;
Misiaszek, 2020 ; Hung, 2021 ). A shift in the value pyramid of
the educational priorities towards sustainable behaviour not only
acts as a perturbation to the biophilia deﬁciency syndrome but also
addresses the raising eco-anxiety symptoms reported by young
generations (
Pihkala, 2020 ; Baudon and Jachens, 2021 ; Gunasiri
et al., 2022 ).
(2) Urban design : Green spaces, such as parks, green roofs,
or community gardens, provide opportunities for individuals to
connect with nature, even in urban areas. These spaces oﬀer
a range of beneﬁts, from relaxation and recreation to habitat
for wildlife. Community gardens, in particular, can promote
community engagement and healthy eating, while also fostering a
deeper connection to nature through shared stewardship (
Roe and
McCay, 2021).
(3) Technological and Artiﬁcial Intelligence design :
Technological design can be used to promote sustainability
and reconnect humans with nature. This can be achieved through
environmental monitoring to understand the impact of human
activities on ecosystems (
Bodini, 2012 ), nature-based gaming to
promote education about biodiversity and conservation ( Schneider
and Schaal, 2018 ), and sustainable design of buildings and green
infrastructure to create and maintain natural environments
in urban areas (
Restall and Conrad, 2015 ; Leavell et al., 2019 ;
McKewan et al., 2020 ).
(4) Mindful nature practices: Mindfulness practices like yoga
or meditation can help individuals develop a greater sense of
embodiment and connection with their physical selves, which
can translate into a felt appreciation of the “interwoven nature”
of the natural world (
Danvers, 2016 ). By cultivating mindfulness
practices, individuals can become more attuned to the natural
world and develop a greater sense of respect and responsibility
towards the environment (
Amel et al., 2009 ; Barbaro and
Pickett, 2016 ). Conscious and responsible use of psychedelic plant
medicines like ayahuasca and psilocybin can also be fruitful
options. Psychedelic use predicts nature connectedness (
Nour
et al., 2017 ; Kettner et al., 2019 ), and solidarity with other
species ( Pöllänen et al., 2022 ), translating into pro-environmental

behaviour ( Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017 ), as well as both
concern for and objective knowledge about climate change
(
Sagioglou and Forstmann, 2022 ), while a recent survey on
“psychedelically induced biophilia” found a tendency to elicit a
“passionate and protective” connection with nature (
Irvine et al.,
2023). Engagement with these practices would also encourage
interaction with cultures from which they originate, aﬀording
opportunities for learning from and cooperation with indigenous
peoples who currently steward lands with 80% of the world’s
biodiversity (
Watene and Yap, 2015 ), and increasingly carry the
ﬂame for cultural diversity and lost ecological wisdom ( Toledo,
2013; Rowlandson, 2015; Etchart, 2017; George et al., 2019 ).
This list is neither fully developed nor exhaustive, but oﬀered
as an exemplar of how the principles provided in this paper can
be applied. Despite eﬀorts made by individuals, organisations, and
governments to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the impact
of climate change and the wider ecological crisis, progress has been
hindered by the multifaceted and global nature of this problem.
To catalyse meaningful change, a deliberate, disruptive and holistic
approach is necessary to address the symptomatic ways in which
humans induce (self-)harm upon Gaia.
/six.tnum. Conclusion
This paper employs the Free Energy Principle to argue that the
lack of action taken in response to threats to planetary life, such
as those posed by the ongoing ecological crisis, should be treated
as a maladaptive disruption to Gaia’s Markov blankets, referred to
as biophilia deﬁciency syndrome . Adopting a pragmatic, pluralist
epistemological approach to understanding planetary life processes,
the paper proceeded in four parts. Firstly, it characterised life under
the Gaia Hypothesis, wherein the biosphere constitutes a single
self-organising system of living and non-living planetary processes,
arguing that this is a plausible and useful way of looking at life on
Earth. It then described the Free Energy Principle as a means of
understanding self-organising (living) systems, before employing
the FEP to elucidate the coupling dynamics within the biosphere
with a view to developing beneﬁcial interventions. Finally, the
paper demonstrated the possibility for positive alternatives aﬀorded
by this framework to remedy the ongoing crisis of ecological
breakdown, emphasising the importance of perturbing stuck states
at multiple levels of nested hierarchies to promote biophilia virtue
and, by extension, the healthy development of human behaviour as
part of Gaia. Ultimately, this paper considers the Gaia Hypothesis
through the lens of the Free Energy Principle to reveal insights
into how we can restore the balance of planetary processes and
safeguard the integrity of living systems that depend on them.
