Developing a sense of internal safety and security depends mainly on others: 
numerous neuromodulators play a significant role in the homeostatic process, 
regulating the importance of proximity to a caregiver and experiencing 
feelings that enable us to regulate our interdependence with our conspecifics 
since birth. This array of neurofunctional structures have been called the 
SEPARATION DISTRESS system (now more commonly known as the PANIC/ 
GRIEF system). This emotional system is mainly involved in the production of 
depressive symptoms. The disruption of this essential emotional balance leads 
to the onset of feelings of panic followed by depression. We will focus on the 
neuropeptides that play a crucial role in social approach behavior in mammals, 
which enhance prosocial behavior and facilitate the consolidation of social 
bonds. We  propose that most prosocial behaviors are regulated through the 
specific neuromodulators acting on salient intersubjective stimuli, reflecting an 
increased sense of inner confidence (safety) in social relationships. This review 
considers the neurofunctional link between the feelings that may ultimately be at 
the base of a sense of inner safety and the central neuromodulatory systems. 
This link may shed light on the clinical implications for the development of 
early mother-infant bonding and the depressive clinical consequences when 
this bond is disrupted, such as in post-partum depression, depressive feelings 
connected to, addiction, neurofunctional disorders, and psychological trauma.

(e.g., thoughts, feelings, beliefs, volition, all experienced from the 
“first-person perspective”) significantly influence the various levels of 
brain functioning (e.g., molecular, cellular, neural circuit) and brain 
plasticity. These findings indicate that subjective variables must 
be seriously considered to reach a correct understanding of the neural 
bases of behavior in humans.
Below, we first illustrate the theory of emotional homeostasis 
from a particular neuroscientific perspective. In the next section, 
we  describe the one supported by psychoanalysis. In both 
descriptions, the base regulatory principle, as we will show, is focused 
on the homeostatic maintenance of a maximum rate of an inner sense 
of safety (given by the absence of any drive or affect); in other terms, 
the minimization of inner free energy (given when all the subject’s 
needs and expectancies are met). In joining these two views, this 
paper aims to offer an integrated neuropsychoanalytic account.
Psychoanalytic view on the 
development of a sense of safety
Psychoanalysis may be defined as the discipline that studies the laws 
underlying human subjective life, i.e., this discipline’s scientific purposes 
concern intrapsychic processes. Neuroscientists tend to avoid tackling 
these questions, considering them as not belonging to their 
methodological field (e.g., Kinsbourne, 2001). Even many psychoanalysts 
believe the knowledge of neuroscience as irrelevant to the psychoanalytic 
scientific endeavor (Blass and Carmeli, 2007, 2015; Michels, 2010). Still, 
most psychoanalysts would assume that their discipline’s assumptions 
on mental processes will have to be confirmed, or at least paralleled by 
comparison, with the other scientific branch that deals with brain 
processes (for a review, see Canestri, 2015; Y ovell et al., 2015).
Therefore, in our discussion of the neuromodulatory aspects of 
the primary regulatory principle of safety, Joffe and Sandler (1967), for 
example, showed that psychoanalytic psychology is a psychology of 
adaptation, dealing in particular with the subjective adaptations to 
changes in feeling states. This model implies that even the most refined 
and abstract cognitive representations may be activated only if feelings 
are associated with them. Specifically, a primary task of the mental 
apparatus during its maturation and development is to manage 
feelings: the prominent role of learning from experience is to widen 
the tolerable range of (conscious or unconscious) experiences without 
disrupting the fundamental feeling tone of safety (inner sense of 
mastery over one’s feelings, security, and absence of external 
threatening situations) and well-being (lack of anxiety and distress). 
Therefore, the neurological and mental apparatuses are constantly 
concerned with maintaining feelings of self-preservation (i.e., safety), 
largely maintained by monitoring perceptual constancy and 
congruence. The successful performance of such an act of integration 
is accompanied by a definite feeling tone, a fundamental ego tone, as 
Sandler (1960) puts it, that might be figured as a constant background 
state of mastery over unpleasant feelings, even though such activities 
often occur outside our usual sphere of awareness. Safety seeking is a 
fundamental survival skill that enables organisms to actively search 
for and identify potential sources of safety within their environment. 
This adaptive ability not only involves the detection and recognition 
of available resources but also entails the utilization of these resources 
to address pressing inner needs. By leveraging their innate safety 
seeking abilities, organisms can effectively navigate their environment 
to ensure their safety and well-being. It yields an internal sense of 
comfort, a function related to, but distinct, from the well-studied 
ability to learn about new dangers (FEAR avoidance; Panksepp, 1998; 
LeDoux, 2000, 2003).
In human clinical settings, the concept of safety has been studied 
by developmental psychologists and psychodynamic psychologists. 
Several authors (especially attachment theorists, and psychoanalysts, 
as for instance Sandler, 1960; Joffe and Sandler, 1967; Bowlby, 1970, 
1988; Ainsworth, 1989; Fonagy, 2018) emphasized the role of safety, 
security and related feelings as critical concepts in the refined 
attunement of the interaction between the mother and the infant and, 
henceforth, in the early development of personality and its 
psychopathology. The idea of inner safety was developed in the ‘60s 
or ‘70s in different contexts, mainly developmental attachment 
theorists on one side and psychoanalysts on the other, converging on 
the child’s early attachment processes. The concept has various 
meanings in these two contexts, and the term safety is used differently 
in the two related disciplines. Traditionally, attachment theorists refer 
more to secure attachment ( objective safety), meaning the child’s 
experience with its mother in the history of their mutual relationship, 
as it may be objectified by an external observer (Belsky, 1999; Fonagy, 
2018). In psychoanalysis (see for example Sandler, 1960; Winnicott, 
1965) the same concept is applied, but to emphasize subjective safety, 
an intrapsychic condition achieved through the conscious and 
unconscious elaboration of affective drives. Unconscious 
motivational processes (from basic needs to conflictual urges) aim at 
the perception  (see the concept of identity of perception and 
transference; Sandler, 1976), a re-representation of early relational 
significant and reassuring experiences of the child with its caregivers.
According to attachment theorists ( Bowlby, 1970; Ainsworth, 
1989), security is the core regulatory process promotes healthy 
prosocial psychological development from infancy. Bowlby (1988) 
developmental notion of a “secure attachment” and a “secure base” 
were implicitly based on a conception of safety–related processes. Still, 
differently from the psychoanalytic use of the concept, the dissimilarity 
may be found in the diverse possible origins of the threat (external for 
attachment theorists, internal for psychoanalysis). Psychoanalysts 
(Sandler and Joffe, 1968 ; Fonagy, 2005) stress the importance of 
intrapsychic adaptation, avoidance of feelings of destabilization, and 
the development and consolidation of internal working models  
(representations of the caregiver in a specific relation with the subject) 
to achieve a sense of safety. Attachment theorists and psychoanalysts 
agree that security and safety are based on innate functions that 
operate soon after birth and govern long-term psychological 
development and emotional responsivity. Thus, both attachment 
theory and psychoanalytic models emphasize the primary status and 
biological function of intimate emotional bonds between individuals: 
we  want to add to the discussion that the maintaining of these 
emotional intersubjective bonds is controlled by specific 
neurobiological systems situated within the deeper parts of central 
nervous system (CNS). Parent-infant affective exchanges rely on the 
activation of ancient and deep evolutionarily preserved brainstem 
networks: the infant’s separation distress behavior is mediated by the 
PANIC/GRIEF system, which promotes reunion with the caregiver, 
while the complementary parental CARE system (Panksepp, 1998) 
processes feeling of tenderness: both sustain early attachment 
development. These basic emotional systems are modulated by various 
neuroamines and neuropeptides that converge on opioid-mediated 
processes (Panksepp et al., 1980). The positive interactions between 
parent and infant facilitate the development of a positive working

model of self-other relationships (or internal representations of 
interactions that have been generalized in an implicit or explicit 
memory process; Stern, 2014).
Moreover, Panksepp (2010) conceptualized an intermediate layer 
in the learning processes during the developmental age in the child: 
he termed this level the secondary process. At this level, there is the 
consolidation in a procedural form of the relationships to attachment 
figures (introjection; Olds, 2012). These secondary processes take the 
form of relational implicit memories that have a vital role in the 
developmental interplay between the basic emotional systems 
(primary process) and higher cognitive functions (tertiary processes) 
(see also Solms and Panksepp, 2012). This hierarchical model evolved 
in the brain to sustain its fundamental principle of minimizing 
disorganization (or free energy; see Friston et al., 2006), warranting 
the organism to remain in the vital homeostatic bounds of inner safety.
The neuropsychology of specific 
safety signals
The neurobiology of processes associated with the affective states 
related to safety has only recently received experimental 
neuropsychological attention (Rogan et al., 2005). These researchers 
have tried to identify and localize neural networks connected to 
conditions of safety and security, not simply to be considered as states 
of lack of fear of dangers but as the result of specific comforting 
signals, which depart from subcortical motivational networks. Other 
studies ( Eisenberger et  al., 2011 ) have tried identifying affective 
cortico-limbic systems connected to safety modulation. Fear learning 
and safety-related conditions are undoubtedly interconnected since 
safety signals reduce conditioned fear responses (Grillon and Ameli, 
2001), indicating the existence of an interaction with the neural 
circuitry underlying fear conditioning, of which the amygdala is a 
crucial structure ( LeDoux, 2000 ). The critical areas of the safety 
processing system in the brain appear in specific areas of the dorsal 
striatum ( Rogan et  al., 2005 ) and portions of the ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (Eisenberger et al., 2011). Both animal and human 
research have shown that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(VMPFC) is an essential component of neural mechanisms underlying 
perceived safety in fear learning (Schiller et al., 2008). However, the 
correlation between animal and human studies is not univocal 
(Josselyn et  al., 2004 ). A cascade of fear-related brain networks, 
including the periaqueductal grey, amygdala, and bed nucleus of the 
stria terminalis, seems to be deactivated in response to safety signals 
that decrease threat value ( Mobbs et  al., 2010 ). Notably, all the 
structures mentioned above seem to be  mainly involved in safety 
regulation, and they possess a high quantity of oxytocin (OT) 
receptors on the surface of their neuronal cells (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 
2001). OT seems to modulate the responses to stress and increase the 
subjective feelings of comfort and safety. Studies on natural variations 
of oxytocin receptor polymorphism confirm the linkage between OT 
and feeling of safety. For instance, a specific homozygotic configuration 
of oxytocin receptor enhances self-confidence and optimism in 
healthy individuals (Saphire-Bernstein et al., 2011) in conjunction 
with lower levels of perceived loneliness and stress responses (Lucht 
et  al., 2009) compared to individuals who carry the heterozygote 
alleles. Positive affectivity, a sense of being in a “safe” social 
environment, and the related ability to seek social resources are 
considered protective factors for depressive disorders. However, the 
effects of oxytocin appear to be stronger when the baseline condition of 
the subject is already “safe. ” For instance, Declerck et al. (2010) found 
that people behave more cooperatively under the influence of oxytocin 
only when interacting with familiar targets. Thus, future studies 
should aim to investigate the association between OT polymorphism 
and responsiveness to OT administration in depressed patients and, 
eventually, the association between OT and the testing environment.
Brains and minds as safety-seeking 
agencies
According to the theory of brain information processing, the brain 
is an inferential machine, meaning a sophisticated device capable of 
generating and testing hypotheses about the causes of its internal states 
(of the body and the mind) to self-maintain and perpetuate its primary 
functional organization over time (Friston, 2005). In a previous paper, 
one of us (Clarici et al., 2019) focused on how this self-organization 
follows the evolutionary laws of self-preservation and is fundamentally 
regulated in organic and psychological terms by achieving a basic 
safety necessary for the organism’s survival. The underlying principle 
is the Free Energy Principle (Friston et al., 2006). It argues that for an 
organism to self-preserve, it must first minimize the number of 
surprising events occurring in time. Thus, surprise refers to the 
quantity of unexpected “informational disorder” or the degree of 
dissipation of its energy. If this dissipation is too high, the organism 
will gradually disorganize, cease to function, ultimately disintegrate, 
and consequently die. In physics (and in particular in information 
theory), “disorder” in this context is formalized in terms of the degree 
of this measure of dissipation (or entropy) in the system. 1 It is, 
therefore, crucial for every organism to possess specific characteristics 
that allow constant monitoring of its state and the extent of its disorder 
and to implement measures capable of correcting any excessive 
deviation from optimal ranges of homeostatic regulation. 2 In an 
attempt to simplify the complexities of the mathematical and 
theoretical formulations underlying information theory, we  can 
summarize that to minimize the degree of surprise (and thus maximize 
the system’s inner state of safety and security), the organism must, first 
and foremost, have (1) boundaries that delineate the inside from the 
1 It should be noted that in psychiatry, for several decades now, as it is well-
known, it has become common practice to refer to mental illness using the 
term “psychiatric disorder” (e.g., as in bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, or personality disorder, etc.), a term which is evocative of an entropic 
tendency affecting the psyche.
2 As challenging as it may appear for a reader with a psychological background 
to delve into these arguments drawn from theoretical physics, we want to 
emphasize (as we have extensively done in the mentioned article; Clarici et al., 
2019) that this principle may be considered a conceptual corollary of the 
equally well-known principle of intrapsychic safety put forth by Sandler (in the 
1960s) in the context of psychopathology. Similarly, it aligns this Safety principle 
with the fundamental need for a secure base present in the infant (as in many 
animal species) in the field of intersubjective attachment development, as 
proposed by Bowlby and his followers (also in the same decade of the 20th 
century – i.e., the 60ies).

outside (a Markov blanket); (2) a sensory-perceptual apparatus capable 
of receiving, encoding, and translating the possible causes of external 
states into an internal representation (internal states); (3) a motor 
apparatus capable of altering the origin of these possible external 
causes; and (4) an apparatus capable of recording the outcomes of 
these “experimental tests” deriving from the interaction of the System 
with the non-System (the external environment) and updating this 
internal model, by constantly modifying it to adapt it to its needs or 
the context. Finally, a self-maintaining system must be capable of (5) 
assessing the reliability of a specific series of events, enhancing the 
salience of certain stimuli that are more significant for the organism’s 
survival and preservation. This assessment of reliance (or confidence) 
(a) in incoming relevant signals (predictive errors) or (b) in our internal 
expectations (prior predictions) projected outward is inherently a 
conscious activity linked to the effects of feelings. First and foremost, 
the world must be felt as we navigate through our senses to perceive it. 
With each of these five components in place, we can assume that an 
organism can resist its dissipation according to the functioning of 
homeostasis, surviving for as long as the interaction with its 
environment maintains its organization in dynamic balance to 
perpetuate and reproduce its “informational heritage. ”
Neuromodulators and their adaptive 
role in infant development
Given the regulatory role of safety over anxiety argued by Freud 
(1938[1940])3, we  could wonder whether the safety feelings are 
inversely correlated to social separation-distress processes that Panksepp 
(1998) postulated stemming from what he called the PANIC/GRIEF 
system or to more general anxiety responses that help the child avoid 
dangers and external threatening situations (such as the FEAR 
system). As suggested by Panksepp (2005a,b), the genesis of panic 
attacks (i.e., the behavioral analog of feeling ultimately unsafe and 
utterly lost) is closely related to our mammalian capacity to have social 
bonds. As conceptualized initially by Panksepp (1992), oxytocin and 
the concept of safety are strongly associated. Panksepp states in this 
respect that the vicissitudes of the perception of the proximity of a 
caregiver are regulated by various neuromodulators (e.g., oxytocin, 
together with other neuromodulators such as endogenous opioids and 
prolactin) that create and maintain a sort of affective background 
sense of safety and security. The setting of these bounds on the 
homeostasis of parent-infant attachment and bond is established in 
the critical first stages of development.
We are herewith reviewing the hypothesis that the 
neuroanatomical system supporting the achievement of maladjusted 
attachment styles and those supporting adaptation and mature 
behavior may be connected to a standard safety and motivational 
regulatory homeostatic system involving, to some extent, oxytocin. 
The origin of such feelings seems rooted in the supportive social 
behaviors of a central attachment figure (or caregiver), for the mother 
3 Freud in the Outline of Psychoanalysis (1938 [1940]) states: “Just as the id 
is directed exclusively to obtaining pleasure, so the ego is governed by 
considerations of safety. The ego has set itself the task of self-preservation, 
which the id appears to neglect” (p. 199).
provides the infant with a warm and intimate sense of psychological 
safety and security ( Heinrichs et al., 2009 ). However, the infant’s 
sense of inner safety and security constitutes the base for confidence 
in oneself and trust in others. This sense of confidence is constructed 
with brain chemistries that carry such experiences of social 
commitment and support. Very early in life, the infant’s attachment-
seeking behaviors come to be  directed toward individuals who 
sustain such rewarding and comforting feelings. The first brain 
chemistries demonstrated to mediate such effects were endogenous 
opioids (for reviews, see Panksepp et  al., 1980 , 1985; Panksepp, 
1981), but in the 1990s, great interest was extended to the analysis of 
oxytocin (OT) in the mediation of social affects and attachments 
(Panksepp, 1992 ; Carter, 1998 ; Uvnäs-Moberg, 1998 ), and the 
previous decade observed an expansion of work to humans through 
the use of intranasal oxytocin, which was found to penetrate the 
brain ( Born et  al., 2002 ). The dopaminergic system and its 
interactions with oxytocin have been implicated in many aspects of 
motivational states and affiliative behavior ( Leckman et al., 2005 ). 
There is a significant anatomical overlap between the oxytocin and 
dopamine neuron populations. Projections of oxytocinergic neurons 
in the medial preoptic area to the ventral tegmental area (the origin 
of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway that mediates 
behavioral responses to stimuli of salience) are associated with the 
regulation and maintenance of social bonds, including human 
parenting and affiliative behavior (Y oung and Wang, 2004). In this 
perspective, the critical effect of oxytocin is to promote feelings of 
safety and, hence, social confidence, which are of foremost 
importance in affectively positive human relations, from mother–
infant bonding to adult attachments and experiences of friendships 
(Heinrichs et al., 2009). Even though it is also clear that endogenous 
opioids are very robust mediators of similar psychological processes, 
we  here focus on oxytocin because of the great potential for 
immediate applications to various human clinical problems ranging 
in adults (from addiction to depression to suicidality; Stevens et al., 
2013; Y ovell et al., 2016) and in child development (Quattrocki and 
Friston, 2014 ). One point often lost in these discussions is the 
anatomy of oxytocin systems, concentrated in ancient subcortical 
“animalian” regions of mammalian brains (Panksepp, 1998). Hence, 
it is essential to recognize that these emotional foundations of human 
minds may need to be discussed at many distinct levels of analysis 
— from primary processes we share with animals to higher-order 
ones, some of which are unique to humans (for a discussion of this 
levels of analysis issues, see Panksepp, 2011a,b). Suppose we  use 
terminologies that are generally more critical for human interactions, 
such as the “trust” needed in financial negotiations. In that case, 
we may focus on social cognitive processes mediated by oxytocin and 
be  confronted by paradoxical results such as intranasal oxytocin 
promoting financial “trust” in many humans but reducing it among 
individuals with borderline personality disorders ( Bartz J. et  al., 
2010). At the same time, both effects may make sense if 
we  understand how higher mental processes might respond to 
elevations of primary affective processes such as a sense of safety, 
security, and confidence. Such feelings may ramify widely in higher 
regions of the brain, leading at times to love, at times to trust, social 
congeniality, and other good social feelings that require 
“propositional objects” — namely specific cognitive representations 
of events or of significant others from which the details of our lives 
are constructed.

The particular role of oxytocinergic 
neuromodulation in constituting 
prosocial life in the infant
Numerous findings in animals ( Boer, 1993; Bales and Carter, 
2003) and humans (Kendrick, 2000) have now converged to highlight 
the role of the evolutionarily ancient neurohormone oxytocin (Gimpl 
and Fahrenholz, 2001) in promoting parental urges and mediating 
parent-infant affective exchanges (Pedersen et al., 1982; Panksepp, 
1992, 1998; Carter, 1998 ) in moderating social stress responses 
(Panksepp, 1992; Heinrichs et al., 2003), and also facilitating adult 
pair-bonding (Insel and Y oung, 2001; Domes et al., 2007 ; Ditzen 
et al., 2009).
In humans, OT was thought to promote prosocial behaviors: 
following intranasal OT administration, individuals show enhanced 
trust (Baumgartner et al., 2008), promote the understanding of others 
(Domes et al., 2007), and various “compassionate” behaviors (Barraza 
et  al., 2011). These seemingly diverse forms of human prosocial 
behaviors at their fundamental levels rely on ancient basic emotional 
subcortical systems and their neurochemistry ( Panksepp, 1998). 
Because of the diversity of behaviors observed, it now seems 
reasonable to inquire whether a general oxytocin-induced 
improvement of the “psycho-relational” behaviors that have been 
studied in humans may share a common denominator. We hypothesize 
that this basic affective signal of enhanced comfort may be associated 
with the basic feeling of safety, which opens the door to social 
confidence (brought about by the absence of feelings of PANIC/
GRIEF). One of the most recent theories for how oxytocin modulates 
behavior is the “social salience” hypothesis. According to Love (2014), 
many of the several oxytocin-induced changes in mammals’ social 
behavior may be  under control of dopamine reward system. The 
location of oxytocin receptors in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine 
system places oxytocin in an ideal position to influence a wide range 
of motivated behaviors.
As already stated, endogenous opioids operate with other 
neuropeptide systems like oxytocin to enhance the feeling of comfort 
and reduce feelings of PANIC/GRIEF . We here develop the idea that 
OT may contribute to helping mediate feelings of intrapersonal safety, 
which at the psychobehavioral level is expressed as increased 
confidence, prosocial behaviors and other higher-order cognitive 
expressions of such primal processes, such as trust, social cognition, 
empathy, love and compassion ( Panksepp, 1992, 2009). Of note, 
disorders in mother-infant primary interaction and mental pain 
experienced in Postpartum Depression share standard anatomical and 
functional neural systems, one of the most studied being the PANIC 
separation-distress system ( Panksepp, 2005a,b). This system also 
appears to be amply regulated through oxytocinergic pathways. This 
assumption has implications for the clinical management of social 
bonding and related disorders in humans and animals ( Panksepp, 
2005a,b). In diverse human cultures, people talk about losing a loved 
one in terms of painful feelings. Evidence suggests that localized 
electrical stimulation of subcortical brain areas involved in regulating 
pain can provoke separation cries, and endogenous 
neuroendocrinological substances regulate these responses, indicating 
an evolutionary relationship between social and physical pain systems. 
Additional areas of painful feelings related to PANIC/GRIEF include 
the anterior cingulate, the bed-nucleus of the stria terminalis, the 
ventral septal and dorsal preoptic areas, the dorsomedial thalamus, 
and the Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) of the brainstem (Panksepp, 1998). 
Notably, most of these areas coincide with the Central Oxytocinergic 
System (see above Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001). The effects of OT on 
the emotional response of PANIC/GRIEF were more robust than on 
physical pain (Panksepp and Watt, 2011). Along this way, it was also 
discovered that other important chemistries robustly quelled PANIC/
GRIEF , such as endogenous opioids and prolactin, as well as brain 
chemistries that intensify feelings of distress, such as CRF and 
glutamate (Panksepp, 2005a,b). A critical question is whether and to 
what extent OT brain pathways mediate affective and maternal urges.
In line with recent theories of its modulating role (instead of 
promoting one), OT does not appear essential for mothering: its 
removal through OT antagonist substances does not interfere with 
mothering behavior (Nelson and Panksepp, 1998). Oxytocin helps 
develop a secure attachment by facilitating and extending the security 
period during bonding formation. Maternal attachment patterns have 
been found to impact the caregiving practices of mothers significantly. 
Specifically, mothers with secure attachment patterns during 
interactions with their infants tend to produce a higher level of 
oxytocin, known as the “love hormone, ” which increases the reward 
experience. This, in turn, may contribute to the mother’s ability to 
provide consistent and nurturing care. These findings highlight the 
importance of maternal attachment patterns in developing healthy 
mother-infant relationships and may have implications for promoting 
positive parenting practices (Strathearn et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, OT may not be  implicated only in “positive” 
rewarding or prosocial basic emotional processes. Another hypothesis 
is that oxytocin may be a neuropeptide involved in the codification and 
informative function in the CNS of conditions of achieved emotional 
homeostasis. Incidentally, this may be why OT effects are so subtle and 
not perceivable even after administration of high doses in the CNS. This 
passage discusses the hypothesis that homeostatic processes do not 
inherently promote prosocial or developmental novel states but instead 
aim to maintain a dynamic stationary state. This suggests that OT may 
also be  involved in psychopathological processes if it is present to 
maintain a maladaptive state of “well-being, ” and its release is linked to 
any developmental new issue experienced as a disruption. Ultimately, 
this could inform the psychic apparatus of a potential deviation from 
the maladaptive but stable state. (Y ong, 2012; Miller, 2013).
Intranasal oxytocin has shown an anxiolytic effect, as measured 
by decreased corticosterone in men during a test involving a stressful 
public speaking task (Heinrichs et al., 2003). Women viewing pictures 
of loved ones have high brain activity in dopaminergic pathways 
associated with reward, which is supposed to be modulated by the 
highly represented OT and arginine-vasopressin receptors in the same 
areas (Bartels and Zeki, 2004), as do people who describe themselves 
as being “intensely in love” (Fisher and Aron, 2005). All these studies 
confirm a positive effect of OT on prosocial mental processes and a 
substantial decrement in anxiety signals along with elevated feelings 
of safety. In women, various studies have been conducted using 
intravenous infusions and the measurement of plasma levels of OT 
during labor and postpartum. Such research shows that oxytocin 
plasma levels are positively correlated with higher self-reported 
feelings of social attachment (Tops et al., 2007) and also associated 
with decreased negative feelings ( Mezzacappa and Katlin, 2002 ). 
Presumably, the OT-induced affective shifts are also manifested and 
further processed at higher cognitive levels, but these influences can 
only be inferred from human self-reports.

Psychopathologies connected to 
altered neuromodulation
This review will present in the following sections some disorders 
that appear to be  related to disturbances or alterations in the 
fundamental principle of inner safety maximization (Sandler and Joffe, 
1969) or free energy minimization (as Friston, 2010 puts it). In fact, 
according to Friston (2023) , from a computational psychiatry 
perspective states:
if psychology — read as belief updating in the brain — can be cast as 
a computational process of inference, it follows that psychopathology 
just is false inference. False inference is meant in the usual sense of 
false positives (i.e., type I errors); namely, inferring something is 
there when it is not. Cardinal examples here include hallucinations, 
delusions and other features of reality distortion seen in psychosis. 
False negatives (i.e., type II errors) mean inferring something is not 
there when it is; for example, dissociative disorders, neglect 
syndromes, derealization phenomena, et cetera. Indeed, when one 
thinks about psychiatric and neurological disorders, most can 
be framed as false inference. (p. 257)
We will begin with a description of stress-related disturbances, 
then move on to describe some psychopathologies deeply related to 
stress, trauma, or relational issues (functional neurological disorders, 
pathological addictions), and finally, mood disorders deeply 
interrelated to relational dynamics. Throughout the discussion, 
relationships with oxytocin will be highlighted.
Stress-related diseases and 
neuromodulation of depressive feelings
Research has shown that the hypothalamic–pituitary-
adrenocortical (HPA axis) functions differently in individuals with 
certain psychological and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, 
anxiety disorders, and PTSD (Baskerville and Douglas, 2010; Walker 
and McGlone, 2013; Herman et al., 2016). These conditions are often 
associated with an altered response to stress. The mechanisms behind 
maladaptive reactions to chronic stress are still being understood. 
However, the complex relationship between prolonged HPA axis 
activation and neural pathway activation in the brain is known. In 
normal conditions, the stress response “[…] represents an integrated 
reaction to stressors, broadly defined as real or perceived threats to 
homeostasis or wellbeing. ” (Herman et  al., 2016 ). The HPA axis 
recruits the energies needed to respond to stressors, whether it is a 
reactive response or an anticipatory response. After the active phase, 
the HPA axis activity decreases due to a negative feedback mechanism 
regulated by glucocorticoids. However, if this system is repeatedly or 
continuously activated, it can lead to various problems. Studies suggest 
that prolonged or repeated stress during childhood, caused by negative 
social experiences, abuse, or parental neglect, can result in more 
prominent reactions to stressors later in life (Walker and McGlone, 
2013). However, genetic components shape personal responses to 
stress by influencing the presence and density of specific receptors, 
which will define the neurobiological response patterns to stressors in 
conjunction with early childhood expressions. According to research, 
individuals who have experienced emotional trauma or have PTSD 
have significantly lower levels of oxytocin (OT) in their bodies 
(Donadon et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that oxytocin receptors 
located in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex may play a role 
in regulating stress responses, as these areas are also involved in the 
physiology of PTSD (see for example Sack et al., 2017; Takayanagi and 
Onaka, 2021; Jin et al., 2023).
Oxytocin exerts a significant anti-stress function by suppressing 
both the secretory and behavioral reactions to stress within the HPA 
axis due to its actions within the PVN (paraventricular nucleus), 
which inhibits the activity of corticotrophin-releasing hormone 
neurons. It seems that oxytocin also has a role in the modulation of 
anxiety, acting in the diverse regions involved in these disorders, 
namely the PVN, SON (supraoptic nucleus), and amygdala. In chronic 
stress, magnocellular oxytocinergic neurons are inhibited by 
corticosterone, decreasing the amount of central oxytocin and 
preventing an anxiolytic and anti-stress effect (Di et al., 2005). The 
anxiolytic effect of oxytocin would be  given by an action via 
serotoninergic pathways, which are also involved in depressive 
disorders; these findings are inherent in animal models only 
(Baskerville and Douglas, 2010 ). The anti-stress effect of oxytocin 
would also be due, in synergy with dopamine, to the rewarding part 
of social and addictive behavior. Other evidence from animal models 
suggests how crucial dopaminergic pathways and the alteration of 
their plasticity are in determining depressive spectrum disorders 
(Lamanna et al., 2022). In this regard, the relationships between the 
dopaminergic system and oxytocin could be significant in treating 
these disorders.
Functional neurological disorders and 
neuromodulation of depressive 
feelings
The absence of an organic etiopathogenesis characterizes functional 
neurological disorders. Interpretation of the establishment and 
development of these disorders is complex given the variety of symptom 
manifestations and neurological or psychiatric comorbidities Current 
theoretical systems recognize several possible causes, predisposing 
factors and triggering events that can be primarily traced back to the 
individual’s developmental history, i.e., individual and family history of 
illness, past and present trauma, organic and genetic vulnerabilities, and 
others (Edwards et al., 2012; Ludwig et al., 2018; Edwards, 2021). The 
interpretative model we refer to here is based on the Bayesian model of 
the brain and the role of attentional components (exteroception, 
interoception, and proprioception) in establishing of the disorder. In 
particular, the role of emotional activation is relevant, influencing 
attentional orientation and salience (see Edwards et al., 2012; Solms and 
Friston, 2018, for an account of attention and affective precision).
The absence of an organic etiopathogenesis characterizes functional 
neurological disorders. These disorders are difficult to interpret due to 
various symptom manifestations and neurological or psychiatric 
comorbidities (Edwards et al., 2012; Espay et al., 2018; Gilmour et al., 
2020; Patron et al., 2022). Various theoretical systems acknowledge 
several possible causes, predisposing factors, and triggering events that 
can primarily be traced back to the individual’s developmental history 
(Edwards et al., 2012; Ludwig et al., 2018; Edwards, 2021). This includes 
their individual and family history of illness, past and present trauma, 
organic and genetic vulnerabilities, and more. The interpretative model 
Clarici et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1395247
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org
that we are referring to is based on the Bayesian model of the brain and 
the role of attentional components such as exteroception, interoception, 
and proprioception in the establishment of the disorder (Edwards et al., 
2012; Edwards and Bhatia, 2012; Edwards, 2021). Emotional activation 
plays a significant role in influencing attentional orientation and 
salience. The role of attention and affective precision is explained in 
detail in works by Edwards et al. (2012) and Solms and Friston (2018).
The purpose of this article is not to delve into the details of this 
model. Instead, we will focus on the potential role of neuromodulators, 
specifically oxytocin, in certain disorders. Studies have shown that 
patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) often have 
comorbid mood disorders such as dysthymia and depression, anxiety 
disorders, and stress-related problems ( Ludwig et  al., 2018; Liang 
et al., 2021). Other studies have found alterations in the limbic-motor 
axis, with abnormal amygdala activations and a possible suppression 
effect on unwanted memories, and, more generally, an abnormal 
emotional activation (Aybek et al., 2014 , 2015; Liang et al., 2021 ). 
Moreover, patients affected by FND complain of high levels of pain, 
both acute and chronic (Espay et al., 2018; Gilmour et al., 2020; Liang 
et al., 2021). There are very few references in the literature regarding 
FNDs and the efficacy of drug treatments, especially in randomized 
controlled trials ( Perjoc et  al., 2023 ). These aspects suggest an 
imbalance in the regulation or expression of neurotransmitters that 
regulate such emotional and stress aspects in the brain. However, the 
literature has no complete agreement on this (Liang et al., 2021).
It is essential to conduct further investigation to fully comprehend 
the role of monoamines such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and 
serotonin. These monoamines are involved in various affective and 
adaptive mechanisms, including mood regulation, fear management, 
pain experience, reward mechanisms, motor programming/regulation, 
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is also crucial to explore 
the role of oxytocin in modulating specific affects. Additionally, it is 
necessary to understand any alterations in the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the role of corticotropin-releasing 
hormone (CRH) and cortisol in patients with functional neurological 
disorder (FND). These mechanisms appear to be closely related to the 
neurodynamic of oxytocin. The uncertainty regarding the use and 
effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments in FND leads to a need for 
more agreement and knowledge among experts. While antidepressants, 
antipsychotics, and neuroleptics are used for symptom management, 
their mechanisms of action concerning symptoms are not yet fully 
understood. Additionally, therapy cannot act on the neural 
mechanisms of the disease (Gelauff, 2020; Perjoc et al., 2023).
To summarize, there is much more to learn about functional 
neurological disorders (FNDs). However, recent research suggests that 
there may be a connection between altered emotional regulation and 
bodily experience in patients with FNDs. This has led to increased 
study of the neural systems, such as the motor, limbic, and executive 
systems, and the associated neuromodulators (Espay et al., 2018; Liang 
et al., 2021; Perjoc et al., 2023).
Neuromodulation of functional 
disorders connected to attachment 
styles
Further exploration is needed to understand the complex factors 
contributing to functional symptoms fully. The age-old debate 
between nature and nurture is relevant in this context, as research by 
Torgersen (1986) suggests that both genetic and environmental factors 
influence the inheritance of somatoform disorders within families in 
a complex interdependence. Although the concordance rates in 
monozygotic (MZ) twins were higher (29%) compared to dizygotic 
(DZ) twins (10%), the difference was not statistically significant. This 
indicates that although genetics may play a role, it is not the only 
factor in developing of functional neurological disorders. The study 
acknowledges the limitations imposed by the small sample size and 
the shared childhood environments, which were found to 
be correlated, albeit weakly, with the concordance rates for both MZ 
and DZ twins. This nuanced interpretation suggests that the 
transmission of functional disorders within families could 
be attributed to genetic predispositions and shared environmental 
influences. The findings highlight the need for a more comprehensive 
understanding of the factors contributing to somatoform disorders, 
considering the biological underpinnings and the environmental 
contexts in which these disorders manifest. On the same leitmotiv, a 
recent study (Hur et al., 2019) conducted on a sample of 1,754 South 
Korean adolescent and young adult twins aimed to estimate the 
heritability of somatization and to explore the shared genetic and 
environmental influences between somatization and Hwabyung (HB), 
an anger syndrome. The sample included 367 monozygotic males, 173 
dizygotic males, 681 monozygotic females, 274 dizygotic females, and 
259 opposite-sex dizygotic twins. Participants completed self-report 
questionnaires on HB symptoms and somatization scales through 
telephone interviews.
The findings revealed that 43% of the variance in somatization was 
attributable to additive genetic factors. In comparison, the remaining 
57% was due to individual-specific environmental influences, 
including measurement error, with no significant sex differences 
observed. A notable phenotypic correlation of 0.53 between HB and 
somatization was identified, suggesting a significant relationship. 
Bivariate model-fitting analyses indicated a genetic correlation of 0.68 
between HB and somatization, signifying a substantial genetic overlap. 
However, the individual-specific environmental correlation, including 
correlated measurement errors, was 0.41, suggesting that while there 
is a shared genetic basis, the environmental factors contributing to the 
development of HB and somatization may be largely independent.
This study’s findings emphasize the complex interplay of genetic 
and environmental factors in the manifestation of somatization and 
HB, underscoring the importance of considering both in 
understanding and treating these conditions. The significant genetic 
correlation between the two suggests potential shared biological 
pathways, which could inform future research and treatment 
strategies. However, the distinct environmental influences highlight 
the role of individual experiences and contexts in developing these 
conditions, pointing to the need for personalized approaches in 
treatment and prevention.
Adult attachment styles (AAS) may play a significant role in 
further explaining the relationship between genetic and 
environmental factors. A recent fMRI study ( Vrtička et al., 2012 ) 
delves into the modulation of social emotion perception and 
regulation by AAS. Conducted with 19 healthy adults, the research 
investigates how avoidant (AV) and anxious (AX) attachment 
styles affect neural responses to social emotions. AV individuals 
displayed increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) and left amygdala during cognitive reappraisal of 
Clarici et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1395247
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
unpleasant social stimuli, indicating a potential inefficiency in 
emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, during the suppression 
of positive social emotions, these individuals showed heightened 
activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and ventral 
caudate, suggesting a more significant effort to inhibit 
emotional expressions.
Conversely, AX individuals exhibited increased activation in the 
right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex in response to 
negative and positive social stimuli, respectively, but only during 
spontaneous emotional judgments. This pattern suggests a heightened 
sensitivity to social cues without the corresponding difficulty in 
emotion regulation that AV individuals experience. The study’s 
findings underscore how AAS influences the neural underpinnings of 
social emotion regulation. Avoidant individuals may struggle with 
cognitive reappraisal and exhibit more significant neural effort during 
emotion suppression, while anxious individuals display heightened 
neural sensitivity to social stimuli.
In 2012, Vrticka and Vuilleumier conducted a comprehensive 
overview of the relationship between neuroscience, human social 
interactions, and adult attachment styles (AAS) ( Vrtička and 
Vuilleumier, 2012). They offered a unique perspective on how 
individual differences in attachment impact emotional and social 
cognition through neurobiological processes. The authors recognized 
the critical role of attachment theory (AT) in understanding the 
development and maintenance of social bonds. They explored the 
neurobiological factors influencing attachment orientations and how 
they impact various social and emotional behaviors.
The review proposes a framework that combines current 
neuroscience with relational and attachment theories. This 
framework has two key components. The first component is a 
system that allows for rapid and automatic affective appraisals. This 
system encodes basic dimensions of safety versus threat or approach 
versus aversion tendencies in social contexts. It relies on limbic 
cortico-subcortical areas. The second component is a controlled 
processing system that engages in mentalizing processes such as 
theory of mind, self-reflection, and emotion regulation. This system 
uses frontotemporal areas.
This review explains how two different systems, called affective 
appraisal and emotional arousal, work together in social situations. 
These systems affect people differently, depending on their attachment 
styles. People with an avoidant attachment style tend to ignore or 
downplay positive social signals. Those with an anxious attachment 
style are more sensitive to negative cues, which can cause emotional 
arousal. These findings help us understand functional disorders, 
which are physical symptoms that do not have a clear medical cause. 
These disorders are affected by psychological factors, including how 
people process and regulate emotions (Edwards et al., 2012; Solms and 
Friston, 2018). Attachment styles play a significant role in emotional 
regulation and processing (see for example Liu and Ma, 2019; Eilert 
and Buchheim, 2023). People with an insecure attachment style may 
have trouble controlling their emotions (see for example Tammilehto, 
et al., 2022) and this may lead to experience physical symptoms which, 
in turn, could become predisposing factors for the functional 
disorders (Edwards, et al., 2012; Espay et al., 2018 ; Gilmour et al., 
2020; Liang et al., 2021).
In conclusion, attachment styles can affect how people process 
and regulate emotions. This can lead to physical symptoms that are 
part, as triggers or predisposing factors, of functional disorders. 
Understanding this connection can help us develop better treatments 
for these disorders.
Addictions and neuromodulation of 
depressive feelings
Addiction is a complex issue that arises due to the misuse of 
various substances, which triggers a specific type of brain plasticity 
that is common across all addictive substances. While we have a good 
understanding of the neurobiology of addiction, the exact role of 
certain neuromodulators, such as serotonin and dopamine, is still not 
entirely clear. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that is most involved 
in the mechanisms of addiction.
Numerous medications can stimulate the release of dopamine in 
the nucleus accumbens, a crucial brain nucleus within the reward 
circuit. Typically, the prefrontal cortex receives a steady dopamine 
flow due to the ongoing activity of dopaminergic neurons that 
originate in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and connect to the 
cortex. However, when an enriching experience or an extremely 
unpleasant event occurs, the dopaminergic neurons become much 
more active and fire rapidly. This sudden increase in activity causes a 
temporary but significant spike in dopamine levels. It is widely 
believed that these heightened dopamine levels during this rapid 
discharge phase are crucial for dopamine’s reward effect (Uhl et al., 
2019; Becker-Krail et al., 2022).
The dopamine receptors (D1) stimulate both reward and 
conditioning mechanisms in which the amygdala, medial orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC) and hippocampus are involved, thus enhancing memory 
and creating memories associated with substance use ( Uhl et  al., 
2019). Memory processes allow the creation of an automatic 
association, i.e., a prediction of satisfaction (reward). In subjects with 
addiction, however, dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens are 
lower than levels found in healthy subjects. This would be given by the 
tolerance/habituation mechanisms, which lead to behaviors (due to 
increased dopamine in the dorsolateral striatum) of habit and are no 
longer goal-directed, as in the early period of addiction (McSweeney 
et al., 2005; Lipton et al., 2019; Uhl et al., 2019). Over time, a change 
leads to goal-directed, habit behaviors, as the connections between the 
dorsolateral striatum and basolateral amygdala, which processes the 
cues that trigger habit behaviors, are reinforced (Lipton et al., 2019). 
Then, a reduced response of the reward system is generated. 
Concurrently, the absence of the psychoactive substance triggers 
adverse reactions, i.e., withdrawal (Uhl et al., 2019). The brain systems 
that regulate reward and stress responses are intimately connected. In 
the absence of the substance (e.g., opioids, alcohol or stimulants), a 
negatively perceived reaction is generated in the individual by the 
release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin in the 
amygdala (Knoll and Carlezon, 2010; Zorrilla et al., 2014; Baumgartner 
et  al., 2022). In turn, CRF stimulates the production of precisely 
Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) in the pituitary gland, which 
stimulates cortisol production (Panksepp and Biven, 2012; Zorrilla 
et al., 2014; Uhl et al., 2019; Lightman et al., 2020). The hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis coordinates neuroendocrine stress response 
systems (Herman et al., 2016).
A renewed abuse reduces stress-related reactions, ending the 
aversive reactions of withdrawal. However, there are alternative ways 
to reduce blood cortisol levels. It appears, for example, that serotonin 
Clarici et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1395247
Frontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org
may also play a role in inhibiting reward establishment and aversive 
states (Uhl et al., 2019).
This review emphasizes that oxytocin plays a role in reducing 
cortisol levels. First, studies show how dense the interactions between 
dopamine and oxytocin are in the context of social behaviors such as 
sex and pair bonding. The prefrontal cortex receives important 
oxytocin innervations, and receptors for dopamine and oxytocin are 
found in large populations in both the prefrontal cortex and nucleus 
accumbens. This evidence indicates how oxytocin plays a role in the 
expression of complex social behaviors and how, conversely, may 
shape such behaviors. In people with addiction, reduced dopamine 
receptors (due to prolonged overstimulation over time given by nerve 
pathways projecting from the VTA into the prefrontal cortex) 
resulting in less activation of these areas is partly responsible for 
impulsive and compulsive behaviors.
There exists a body of evidence which suggests that the 
neurotransmitters dopamine and oxytocin work in tandem to regulate 
addiction. Specifically, oxytocin is believed to facilitate abstinence 
while mitigating mechanisms of tolerance and dependence. This 
would be due to its relationship with dopamine: endogenous opioids 
in natural social situations control the expression of oxytocin neurons. 
Opioid-based drugs, therefore, act on oxytocin neurons by inhibiting 
them since they express opioid receptors. In addiction and abstinence, 
therefore, the oxytocin system, as well as the dopaminergic system, 
would be altered; this evidence prompts further investigation into the 
therapeutic role that OT might play in the treatment of addiction, 
particularly in the withdrawal phase (Baskerville and Douglas, 2010).
When managing stress, oxytocin is known for reducing stress-
related reactions. Social support can also increase the production of 
oxytocin and lower cortisol levels. In addition, taking oxytocin directly 
through the nose has been shown to have an even more significant 
impact in reducing the neuroendocrine responsible for adverse stress 
reactions (Love, 2018). Recent findings show how oxytocin can reduce 
drug-seeking and drug-induced behaviors. This could be  because 
oxytocin may have a direct role in glutamatergic pathways involved in 
addiction (Sundar et al., 2021). This evidence leads us to discuss the 
role oxytocin plays in prolonged and acute stress contexts.
Neuromodulation of depression and 
anxiety
Interdisciplinary studies, as reviewed above, may help better 
understand many psychiatric problems. For instance, since social loss 
is one of the most robust precipitants of depression ( Nelson and 
Panksepp, 1998) and oxytocin administration reduces PANIC/GRIEF , 
we could anticipate that oxytocinergic facilitators should be effective 
treatments for sadness and depression.
Postpartum depression is a clinical condition that is 
accompanied subjectively by conflictual ambivalent feelings of a 
mother toward her baby (Green, 1986; Lemaitre-Sillère and Bennett, 
1998). Compared with non-lactating women, postpartum mothers 
(2 days after birth) who have received OT during labor (just after 
birth) have significantly lower scores on anxiety and aggression self-
report scales and also score higher on a socialization scale, with the 
result remaining constant at 2 and 6 months postpartum (Jonas et al., 
2008). Plasma OT and pregnancy OT plasma levels are very stable 
throughout all trimesters of pregnancy. They are positively associated 
with maternal–fetal attachment as measured by a prenatal 
attachment scale administered to the mothers ( Levine et al., 2007 ). 
Feldman et al. (2007)  analyzed OT levels in the first trimester and 
early postpartum period and found a positive correlation with 
certain maternal bonding behaviors, such as gazing at the infant, 
vocalizations to the infant, and affectionate touch. Of course, many 
measures of peripheral OT levels can be  criticized since the 
correlation between central and peripheral oxytocin remains unclear 
in all human experiments, and the results are mixed in animal 
experiments. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that viewing images of 
one’s children activates dopaminergic pathways in the mothers’ 
brains associated with reward, where there are also high levels of OT 
receptors (Bartels and Zeki, 2004).
The findings are consistent with clinical studies showing an 
association between specific adult attachment styles and depression 
(Carnelley et  al., 1994 ). In particular, of the four categories of 
attachment style, only insecure attachment is linked with the risk of 
developing depression (Mickelson et al., 1997 ; Murphy and Bates, 
1997). Recent studies suggest interactions between central OT and 
attachment style (Bartz J. A. et al., 2010 ; Rockliff et al., 2011 ). For 
instance, Bartz and colleagues found that intranasal OT promotes the 
recollection of negative representation of the mother in individuals with 
insecure attachment styles, with opposite effects in individuals with 
secure attachment styles (Bartz J. et al., 2010). These findings contrast 
the hypothesis that oxytocin would increase positive feelings 
(Y ong, 2012).
On the other hand, a possible interpretation of these findings 
would be that OT facilitates the disclosure of one’s representations 
by enhancing a basic feeling of safety and comfort. This evidence is 
in line with our hypothesis that OT may be  an essential 
neuromodulator of a homeostatic system related to safety conditions  
reflecting the experience by the subject, without distinction of the 
fact these same experiences were positive or negative in terms of 
wellbeing. As well known in clinical practice, the feeling of safety is 
the prerequisite for sharing personal experiences and representing 
oneself and others. Indeed, considering that safety cuts across both 
social and non-social domains, this primal “common denominator” 
may help explain various paradoxical and fragile specific social 
effects seen with oxytocin ( Bartz et  al., 2011 ). Modern anti-
depressants have been employed in postpartum depression. Now 
that there are ways of administering exogenous OT via intranasal 
airways, which are medically approved in Europe, have no known 
addiction liability, and seem to be fundamentally free of side effects, 
there is a role for off-label use of neuropeptides in treating this type 
of depressions, with positive effects that can occur promptly as 
opposed to over several weeks of treatment with a classical 
antidepressant. Our group has started the evaluation of whether 
intranasal administration of oxytocin can alleviate feelings of 
despair in those mothers who experience depression soon after the 
birth of their children. Such a project, in the context of 
psychoanalytic therapy, has been initiated ( Ozkarar and Clarici, 
2008; Pellizzoni et  al., 2009 ; Clarici and Pellizzoni, 2013 ) with 
preliminary results showing a facilitatory role of OT in maintaining 
a positive therapeutic alliance in the course of a dynamically 
oriented psychotherapy in postpartum depressed mothers ( Clarici 
et al., 2015). OT’s pharmacologic properties make it most attractive 
as a potential antidepressant drug in postpartum depression, with 
the main aim of improving the quality of infant-mother interaction 
Clarici et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1395247
Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org
through natural endogenous substances and 
psychosocial interventions.
In depressed patients, the hyperactivation of HPA axis, and 
consequently, high cortisol level, is well established. Additionally, 
plasma oxytocin is negatively associated with scores of depression 
symptoms ( Scantamburlo et  al., 2007 ; Cyranowski et  al., 2008 ). 
Central OT administration has been shown to have anxiolytic 
properties on endocrine and behavioral systems. This seems to be due 
to the effect of the neuropeptide on the HPA system (Windle et al., 
1997; Bale et al., 2001). However, it is still unclear if it has a direct 
effect on the axis or an indirect effect through other structures, such 
as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Dunn, 1987) or the amygdala 
(Dunn and Berridge, 1990). OT does not decrease salivary cortisol 
levels in men with a history of early parental separation as in control 
males, indicating a possible abnormal HPA response to OT in these 
subjects ( Meinlschmidt and Heim, 2007 ). This study confirms a 
relation between the attachment system and possible dysregulation of 
these neural systems due to a premature loss experience. OT may exert 
its effects by directly inhibiting the amygdala (Davis, 1992; Adolphs 
et al., 1995). Further, recent contributions show that long-term anxiety 
and depressive states associated with development are associated with 
greater amygdala volume (van Elst et al., 2003). In the laboratory, the 
amygdala activation is reduced by intranasal administration of OT 
(Dębiec, 2005).
From this perspective, the role of the amygdala in major depressive 
and anxiety disorder is most interesting ( Pezawas and Meyer-
Lindenberg, 2005). Functional imaging studies observed an increased 
metabolism in the amygdala in subjects with major depressive 
disorder (Fales et al., 2009). Related to this, studies have shown that 
OT reduces both social anxiety ( Heinrichs and Domes, 2008) and 
amygdala responses to fearful faces (Kirsch et al., 2008), implying a 
possible trade-off of OT and amygdala responsivity and, in turn, a 
sensation to trust the other and to create a bond with people and 
possibly offspring.
Conclusion
This review delves into the intricate workings of various 
neuromodulators in regulating various physiological and 
psychological functions, including safety, social bonding, and 
affective processes. The paper pays particular attention to how the 
neuromodulator oxytocin impacts attachment and prosocial 
behaviors, providing in-depth insights into how this hormone 
shapes our relationships and emotional experiences in normal 
development and psychopathology. Panksepp’s work is cited to 
emphasize the connection between oxytocin and feelings of safety, 
suggesting that oxytocin and other neuromodulators play a crucial 
role in establishing an affective background of safety and security. 
The focus is on the oxytocin system’s involvement in various aspects 
of human development, from parent-infant attachment to adult 
relationships, suggesting a standard regulatory homeostatic system. 
The discussion extends to the overlap between oxytocin and 
dopamine systems, highlighting their implications for motivational 
states and affiliative behavior. Studies have shown that the rise in 
oxytocin levels in the brain can improve psycho-relational 
behaviors. This is believed to be due to the release of a primary 
affective signal that enhances comfort, which is associated with the 
fundamental feeling of safety. As a result, individuals experience a 
boost in social confidence and a decrease in feelings of panic or 
grief. Essentially, the release of oxytocin triggers a cascade of 
positive emotional responses that can lead to beneficial outcomes 
for individuals in social situations. The oxytocinergic system plays 
a crucial role in regulating emotions and behaviors such as trust, 
social cognition, empathy, love, and compassion. It has been 
observed that changes in the regulatory processes involving 
oxytocin and various neurotransmitters connected to it can 
contribute to the development and persistence of depressive 
disorders. It is important to note that this response should not 
be regarded solely as a disease, but also as an adaptive mechanism 
of the brain in response to predictive and false inferences that 
trigger depressive symptoms. One notable sentence that helps 
connect psychopathology with the predictive coding theories of 
Friston (2023) is as follows:
The narrative starts with the simple premise that if psychology— 
read as belief updating in the brain—can be cast as a computational 
process of inference, it follows that psychopathology just is false 
inference. [page 257]
The role of oxytocin is connected to social bonding, postpartum 
depression and the interrelation between social and physical pain 
systems, with evolutionary and clinical aspects. It is a potential 
modulator of affective and maternal urges, affecting emotional 
responses to panic and grief more strongly than physical pain. Even at 
high doses, oxytocin’s effects are subtle, but it is involved in 
maintaining emotional homeostasis. Overall, this review confirms that 
oxytocin plays a multifaceted role in regulating emotions, social 
behaviors, and mental well-being throughout various stages 
of development.

In memoriam
This paper was written with the mentorship and editing by late 
professor Jaak Panksepp, and it is one of the last works before 
he passed away, leaving the scientific community with a deep feeling 
of loss. Therefore, this work suffers from the loss of the scientist who, 
among us authors, possessed the vastest knowledge of the brain 
mechanisms of neuromodulation. We believe that, even if this work 
has inevitably been affected by this loss, we trust that Jaak Panksepp 
would have approved the hypotheses on the neuromodulatory 
processes, which, based on his guidance, have led us to extend his 
conclusions to the psychiatric, psychotherapeutic and 
psychopathological fields. The publication is thus posthumous (one 
of the authors, AC obtained written permission from Prof. Panksepp’s 
wife, Anesa Miller, anesam98@gmail.com), to maintain his name as 
one of the authors, as a sign and homage of our indebtment to Jaak 
Clarici et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1395247
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org
Panksepp for his great wisdom, vast knowledge, that he perfused to 
us with profound intellectual and scientific honesty.
