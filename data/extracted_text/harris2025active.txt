This paper introduces Active Intersubjective Inference (AISI), a novel framework
that integrates psychodynamic theory with predictive processing to explain self-
identity construction and psychopathology. AISI posits that the self emerges
from recursive inferences about how others perceive us (second-order self),
interacting bidirectionally with interoceptive processes. We map psychodynamic
phenomena (e.g., transference, projection) onto neurocomputational
mechanisms and apply AISI to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), hi ghlighting distor ted second-order
inference as a core dysfunction. Therapeutic implications include
psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and psychedelic-
assisted treatments to enhance inference ﬂexibility. AISI bridges
psychodynamic insights with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria, offering a
testable model for precision psychiatry and future clinical trials.

1 Introduction
Psychodynamic theories have long emphasized the centrality of relationships in
shaping the self. However, they have lacked a neurobiological framework. Conversely,
neuroscience and computational psychiatry have made substantial progress in modeling
brain function as predictive inference. This paper aims to bridge these domains by
introducing Active Intersubjective Inference (AISI), a framework that maps
psychodynamic concepts onto a formal model of recursive prediction.
The AISI framework proposes that the self is constituted through active inferences
about how others perceive us. We extract information about ourselves from the language
and behavior of others, and we refer to the resulting predictive model as the second-order
self. In contrast, theﬁrst-order model of self is derived directly from bodily sensations,
including proprioception and physiological data. These direct, ﬁrst-order models are
termed interoceptive selves (1–4).

We view personal identity as arising from bidirectional
interactions between the interoceptive and second-order selves.
Interoceptive states inﬂuence our perceptions of social cues. At
the same time, the threats, attitudes, and intentions of others,
processed through AISI, shape the second-order self, which
inﬂuences physiological responses (e.g., cortisol release) via top-
down modulation of the interoceptive self. Conversely, bottom-up
interoceptive signals (e.g., heart rate changes) update second-order
self-models.
The prior interpersonal experiences that shape the second-
order self are continuously updated through feedback from real
and imagined interactions with others. Constructing second-order
models from social, linguistic, and behavioral cues is complex and
error-prone. It relies heavily on Bayesian priors derived from
narrative memories that may date back to interpersonal
interactions of early childhood.
AISI is a highly active inference process in which our language
and behavior inﬂuence the inferences and behaviors of others in real
time. We use the term intersubjective to emphasize that it involves
the interactions of mental representations of self and other between
two or more individuals.
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) holds that organisms behave in
ways that minimize errors generated by active inference processes
(5, 6). In this paper, we observe that applying the FEP to AISI may
elucidate common psychodynamic processes such as projection and
splitting while addressing man y psychodynamic aspects of
depression and stress-related disorders.
This paper focuses on MDD and PTSD to illustrate AISI’s
applicability to trauma and depression. The paper is structuredﬁrst
to deﬁne the AISI model and its neuroanatomical underpinnings,
then to apply it to clinically relevant psychodynamic processes, as well
as to major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). Finally, we consider therapeutic implications and
outline a future research agen da grounded in computational
psychiatry and AI-enhanced psychodynamic assessment.
2 Theoretical framework
2.1 Overview of active inference
The active inference framework, developed by Karl Friston and
colleagues, extends predictive processing through the free energy
minimization principle (5). Here, “free energy” is a mathematical
concept that quantiﬁes the difference between the brain’s internal
model of the world and the actual state of the world as indicated by
sensory data. In simpler terms, free energy is a measure of surprise
or uncertainty.
According to this framework, biological systems are driven to
minimize free energy through motor and sensory mechanisms. The
brain constantly forms internal models that are updated to better
match sensory input. Additionally, the brain initiates actions to alter
sensory input in two ways: (1) changing perception, such as
redirecting gaze to clarify ambiguous social cues (e.g., observing a
facial expression), and (2) modifying the environment, such as
engaging in behaviors to elicit speciﬁc social responses (e.g., smiling
to evoke a positive reaction) (7, 8).
Precision-weighting is a key mechanism in active inference.
Prediction errors are assigned weights based on their estimated
reliability or “precision. ” High-precision errors drive model
updates, while low-precision errors may be effectively ignored.
This precision-weighting mechanism allows the brain toﬂexibly
balance reliance on prior mode ls versus new information,
depending on context and levels of uncertainty. For example, in a
noisy social setting (high uncertainty, e.g., a crowded party with
ambiguous facial expressions), the brain may assign low precision to
sensory data, relying more on priors (e.g., expecting friendliness
from known peers). Conversely, in a clear context (low uncertainty,
e.g., a one-on-one conversation with distinct cues), sensory data
receive higher precision, driving model updates (e.g., revising a
prior of rejection when a smile is clearly observed). Uncertainty
reﬂects the brain’s estimate of variability in sensory data or priors,
distinct from but inﬂuencing the size of prediction errors, which are
the mismatches between predictions and actual input (5). The
relevance of information for reducing uncertainty is determined
by its potential to minimize free energy, prioritizing reliable data
(e.g., consistent social cues like repeated smiles) and contextually
salient information (e.g., threat cues in dangerous settings or
afﬁliative cues in bonding scenarios). Attention ampliﬁes high-
precision signals to optimize model updates (9).
The predictive hierarchy refers to layered brain processes where
lower levels predict immediate sensory data (e.g., seeing a smile) and
higher levels predict abstract states (e.g., others’ approval). For
instance, in a social setting, low-level predictions about facial
expressions feed into high-level predictions about social acceptance.
Precision allocation across this hierarchy is understood as a form of
attention that directs the system’s resources toward information
considered most relevant for reducing uncertainty. Attention to
one’so w np r e d i c t i o n si sp o s s i b l e ,a si n d i v i d u a l sc a nr eﬂect on their
expectations (e.g.,‘I expect rejection’)a n da d j u s tt h e mb a s e do nn e w
evidence, a process central to second-order inference. Disruptions in
precision allocation are implicated in various psychological conditions,
ranging from hallucinations (overweighted prior beliefs) to heightened
anxiety (overweighted threatening prediction errors) (10, 11).
To ensure the AISI framework is empirically testable, its
predictions can be evaluated using computational models such as
the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF;12), which quantiﬁes belief
updating in social contexts, and neuroimaging techniques like fMRI
to measure activity in regions supporting second-order inference
(e.g., medial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula). Virtual reality (VR)-
based tasks can further simulate social interactions to assess
inference ﬂexibility, as detailed in Section 6.1.
2.2 From individual to intersubjective
prediction
In social contexts, the brain’s predictive architecture faces a
unique challenge. We must model the mental states and beliefs of
other agents who are actively forming predictions about us. This
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org02
creates a reciprocal system in which each person’s predictions and
actions provide sensory data for others’ predictions. Moreover, our
actions are shaped not only by our models of others but also by our
models of how others model us, creating nested, recursive prediction
hierarchies that are characteristic of human intersubjectivity.
2.3 First-order and second-order inference
2.3.1 First-order inference: modeling bodily
states and observable behaviors
First-order inference operates on data derived from internal,
physiological sources. It produces predictive models of autonomic,
neuroendocrine, and proprioceptive states. At the highest levels, these
models combine into a framework known as the interoceptive self (1–
3). The interoceptive self integrates information about energy levels,
appetite regulation, reward expectations, danger/anxiety signals,
libido, and other biological drives that collectively shape mood
states (13, 14). For example, in anxiety,ﬁrst-order inference might
amplify heart rate signals as predictions of imminent threat.
First-order inference is also e mployed to make predictive
models of others’ directly observable behaviors, including speech,
facial expressions, and actions. At this level, we model others as
complex agents, but do not attempt to understand the intentionality
underlying their behavior or comprehend their mental states. This
process predominates during early development before Theory of
Mind (ToM) emerges.
2.3.2 Second-order inference: modeling others’
perceptions of the self
Once ToM development begins, second-order inference allows us
to model others’ mental states, including how they perceive us— a
process we refer to as recursive self-modeling. This generates predictive
images of self and other (Figures 1A, B). In contrast toﬁrst-order
inference’s focus on observable actions (e.g., Person A predicts Person
B’s smile), second-order inference interprets underlying intentions
(e.g., Person A infers that Person B’ss m i l ei n d i c a t e sa p p r o v a l ) .D e t a i l s
of how Person B models Person A are disclosed through language and
behavioral cues. From this information, Person A can construct
inferential models of themselves. First-order and second-order
inference continue in parallel after ToM develops, withﬁrst-order
handling direct sensory and behavioral modeling while second-order
adds interpretive layers for mental states.
The socially constructed self (second-order self) must align with
other sources of information, such as interoception, which provides
data on mood states and biological drives (1–3). The interoceptive
components of self, such as physiological states and biological drives,
interact bidirectionally with the second-order self to produce mood
and affect, and to elicit physiological responses appropriate to social
contexts. For instance, a perceived social threat (second-order) might
trigger cortisol release (interoceptive), while physical fatigue
(interoceptive) could bias perceptions of social rejection (second-
order). This bidirectional loop operates as follows: top-down
modulation from the second-order self (e.g., negative social
feedback strengthens priors of rejection, increasing cortisol via the
hypothalamus); bottom-up signals from the interoceptive self (e.g.,
physiological arousal signals danger, reinforcing negative second-
order priors).
Self-experiences from activity, mastery, or situational performance
(e.g., succeeding in a task) are integrated into the second-order self
when interpreted through social feedback (e.g., praise from others) or
internalized as self-evaluation, a process akin to Kohut’sm i r r o r i n g
(Section 3.5). These experiences contribute to priors of competence,
distinct from but interacting with interoceptive signals.
As illustrated inFigure 2, these shared priors create a dynamic
feedback loop between bodily e xperiences and social self-
representations. Social interactions have profound effects on
interoceptive processes. Experiences of social threat, rejection, or
afﬁliative bonding trigger speciﬁc neuroendocrine cascades that
alter physiological parameters, including heart rate variability,
cortisol levels, and immune function (15, 16). These bidirectional
interactions, central to AISI, explain how social disruptions cascade
into physical symptoms in disorders like depression (see Section 4).
Actions to alter sensory input are central to AISI, as they test
predictions about others’perceptions (e.g., seeking clariﬁcation in a
conversation to resolve ambiguity in social cues).
2.4 The functional and evolutionary
signiﬁcance of higher-order inference
Cooperative activities— from hunting to childcare to cultural
learning— depend on predicting others’actions and understanding
their expectations of us. The emergence of second-order inference
capabilities likely created powerful selection pressures throughout
human evolution. Individuals who could accurately model how
group members perceived them would gain signiﬁcant advantages
in managing their social reputation, forming alliances, and
navigating hierarchies. These capabilities may have co-evolved
with language and ToM (see Section 2.6 for developmental
details). In psychopathology , disruptions in this process
contribute to relational instability (see Section 3).
2.5 Neuroanatomical substrate
The neuroanatomical basis of AISIinvolves interconnected brain
regions that support bidirectional information ﬂow between
interoceptive and second-order processes, as shown inFigure 2.T h i s
ﬁgure illustrates the recursive structure of AISI, where self-
representations are continuouslyshaped by social and physiological
feedback. The interoceptive self integrates signals related to drives,
reward, and homeostasis (e.g., motivation, libido, sleep, energy,
appetite), which in turn modulate the second-order self through
neuroendocrine pathways. A key assumption is that these regions
enable prediction generation and feedback integration to update models.
Several large-scale brain networks overlap with this
architecture, including the Default Mode Network (DMN), the
Salience Network, and components of the Mirror Neuron System.
Each region contributes to one or more functions necessary for
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org03
intersubjective infere nce: modeling others ’ mental states,
integrating social feedback, mapping bodily states onto emotion,
and maintaining narrative continuity of identity.
Table 1summarizes key regions implicated in AISI, focusing on
those relevant to depression and trauma (detailed in Section 4).
These include the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for self-
modeling, temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and posterior cingulate
cortex (PCC) for social feedback, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
for error monitoring, and anterior insula (AI) for interoceptive
bridging. Notably, these regions are densely interconnected with
subcortical structures (e.g., hypothalamus, amygdala), allowing the
second-order self to modulate physiological states and vice versa.
This substrate underpins the negotiation between internal drives
and social expectations in AISI.
2.6 Developmental trajectory of active
intersubjective inference
Building on the distinction in Section 2.3, AISI develops alongside
ToM. Through observation and interaction, toddlers (1–2y e a r s )b u i l d
predictive models of caregivers ’ behaviors. However, these are
FIGURE 1
(A) First-Order Active Interpersonal Inference. This schematic illustrates an agent engaged inﬁrst-order active inference within a dyadic social
interaction. The agent (left) uses sensory and contextual cues to generate predictions about the behavior, intentions, and emotional state of another
person (right). However, the model remains egocentric; the agent does not represent how it is itself perceived by the other. In neurocomputational
terms, this process recruits predictive coding hierarchies but does not yet involve higher-order recursive modeling. This form of inference supports
basic empathy, behavioral synchronization, and social coordination but does not fully capture the reﬂexive dynamics of self-consciousness or
interpersonal identity.(B) Second-Order Active Interpersonal Inference. Thisﬁgure expands the model to depict second-order AISI, wherein the
agent infers not only the other’s mental states but also how the other perceives the agent in return. This recursive loop— I model how you see me—
enables the emergence of complex interpersonal emotions such as shame, pride, embarrassment, and trust. The diagram highlights the closed-loop
architecture of second-order social inference, essential for self-conscious affect and reﬂective identity. Such modeling requires more complex
generative architectures and may depend on the integration of medial prefrontal, temporoparietal, and default mode networks in the brain.
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org04
primarily ﬁrst-order models. Theory of Mind (ToM)— the ability to
attribute mental states to others— develops through predictable stages
(30). The milestone of understanding false beliefs (ages 4–5) enables
children to build second-order models of themselves based on
caregivers’inferences. ToM and second-order inference likely co-
develop, with ToM enabling the shift to recursive modeling; more
research is needed to establish the precise time course.
Winnicott’s( 31) concept of play offers a psychodynamic parallel
to active inference. Play serves as a low-risk space for testing social
hypotheses. Mastery experiences in play contribute to second-order
priors by providing feedback on competence (e.g., succeeding in a
game elicits caregiver praise, reinforcing self-models of capability).
Winnicott’s( 32) “good-enough mother” aligns with AISI by providing
empathic feedback to calibrate inference during development.
Over time, the second-order self acquires greater stability and
autonomy as it becomes anchored by narrative memories. Bayesian
priors favor continuity in self-models. However, constructing an
autonomous self requires caregiver support; failures may lead to
pathology (Section 3.5).
2.7 Integration of personal identity
The information we use to construct second-order models of
ourselves comes from others, who may present the developing child
FIGURE 2
Interactions among interoceptive self, second-order self, and social others. Thisﬁgure presents a schematic model illustrating the dynamic interplay
among (1) the interoceptive self— which encodes bodily and affective signals such as hunger, fear, libido, and fatigue, (2) the second-order self,
which encompasses reﬂective models of one’s identity and how one is perceived by others, and (3) external social agents, whose feedback and
behavior recursively shape self-perception. Arrows depict bidirectional inﬂuences: neuroendocrine feedback (e.g., cortisol, oxytocin) modulates
interoception, interpersonal feedback shapes second-order models, and recursive predictions about others’perceptions regulate affective states.
The diagram emphasizes how identity, affect regulation, and interpersonal behavior co-emerge through predictive coding across interoceptive and
social levels of the self-model. To distinguish computational from anatomical elements (as per reviewer feedback), computational nodes (e.g., priors
such as“others see me as worthless,” predictions like anticipating rejection, error signals from mismatches like unexpected praise) are implied in the
ﬂows; anatomical correlates (e.g., mPFC for second-order modeling, anterior insula for interoceptive bridging) are referenced inTable 1. Bottom-up
ﬂows represent sensory data updating models (e.g., physiological arousal inﬂuencing self-perception via error signals), while top-downﬂows involve
priors shaping interpretation (e.g., expected rejection biasing neutral cues). For a detailed walkthrough with examples ofﬁrst-order inference and
trauma triggers, see Section 4. (Insert image3.png here).

with divergent or even contradictory images that must be integrated
into their self-model. The continuity and coherence of the child’s
second-order self are relative to the frame of reference provided by
their caretakers. The child’s sense of identity depends on the stable,
consistent presence of others. Th is relativity makes the child
vulnerable to changes in this frame of reference. While this may
be an unavoidable part of development, when it becomes extreme,
the child may experience distortions of self/other boundaries and
displacement of identity. Distortions and displacements of the
second-order self’s identity may manifest as projection, splitting,
and other psychodynamic phenomena discussed in Section 3.
Over time, the second-order self acquires greater stability and
autonomy as it becomes anchored by a growing body of narrative
memories. The FEP and Bayesian inference drive us to predict that
our next self will maintain continuity with our recent selves.
However, the construction of a fully autonomous, enduring self
may require considerable support from the child’s caregivers. If the
child is allowed to test their autonomy while consistently receiving
empathic, validating feedback, they can develop second-order
models with increasing independence. Failures at this stage may
lead to pathological development, as discussed in Section 3.5.
To some extent, the relativity of the second-order self persists
throughout life. For example, the common experience of feeling like a
different person in various social contexts or adopting collective
identities of race, ethnicity, and nationality manifests the malleability
of second-order identity (33). The nearly universal experiences of
empathy and compassion may reﬂect displacements of identity with
the transient, partial exchange of self with other. The integration of
s e c o n d - o r d e rm o d e l so ft h es e l fi n t ol a r g e rn a r r a t i v e si sap r o c e s st h a t
continues throughout the entire lifecycle (34).
3 Psychodynamic phenomena as
active intersubjective inference
AISI reframes psychodynamic processes as strategies for
managing social uncertainty via free energy minimization.Table 2
summarizes key phenomena, their AISI mechanisms, and examples,
reducing overlap in the text below.
3.1 Transference as Bayesian inference
Transference redirects past relational priors to current
interactions (35). In AISI, these act as Bayesian priors for second-
order models. Mismatches generate errors, but ingrained priors
resist updates due to: (1) strong developmental weighting, (2)
inﬂexibility, or (3) maladaptive error thresholds. For example, a
patient might transfer abandonment fears onto the therapist,
minimizing short-term uncertainty but perpetuating cycles. These
inﬂexible priors are rigid beliefs that fail to account for alternative
interpersonal scenarios (e.g., expecting hostility in all interactions,
unable to consider positive alternatives). Therapeutic co-creation
(36) minimizes dyadic free energy, sometimes reinforcing patterns.
3.2 Projection
Projection attributes unacceptable impulses externally (37). In
AISI, it resolves ego-dystonic errors by displacing them to others’
models, reducing internal free energy. For example, a depressed
individual projects self-loathing as others’ judgment, maintaining
self-coherence at interpersonal cost.
3.3 Splitting
Splitting divides experiences into extremes (38). AISI views it as
partitioning second-order self-models to avoid integration costs.
Under stress, binary categories reduce uncertainty short-term but
lead to oscillations (e.g., idealizing/devaluing in relationships).
Neurobiologically, it involves poor valence network integration.
3.4 Projective identiﬁcation
Projective identiﬁcation induces others to enact projections
(38). AISI breaks it into: disavowal, projection, active induction
via intersubjective loops, and identiﬁcation. This blurs self-other
boundaries, as in trauma where victims induce rejection to
conﬁrm priors.
3.5 Self psychology in the AISI framework
Kohut’s( 39) self psychology emphasizes self object needs in
narcissism. In AISI, developmental failures lead to reliance on
mirroring for second-order stability. Empathic therapy updates
priors, enhancing ﬂexibility. Neuroimaging shows altered insula/
mPFC in subjects with narcissistic traits (40, 41).

4 Major depressive disorder and post-
traumatic stress disorder through the
lens of AISI
Both major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) involve distortions in the modeling of the
second-order self, the predictive representation of how others
perceive one. As illustrated in Figure 2 and supported by the
neural structures listed in Table 1, the second-order self and
interoceptive self are engaged in recursive, bidirectional inference
loops. Dysfunction in either domain can cascade to the other,
producing the range of affective, somatic, and cognitive symptoms
observed in these conditions.
To clarify the model’s structure (as illustrated inFigure 2), let’s
walk through its key steps. The interoceptive self generates bottom-
up signals from physiological data (e.g., heart rate variability as
error signals indicating arousal), which update priors in the second-
order self (e.g., interpreting arousal as social threat). Conversely,
top-down ﬂows from the second-order self propagate predictions
(e.g., “others reject me”) to shape interoceptive interpretation,
minimizing overall prediction errors. First-order social inference
operates in parallel, such as a smile eliciting a reciprocal smile via
direct behavioral mirroring (e.g., mirror neuron activation) without
engaging second-order mental state attribution. In trauma, a trigger
like a sound can elicit both predictive processing (reactivating rigid
second-order priors of vulnerability, leading to re-experiencing)
and direct neuroendocrine changes (e.g., immediate amygdala-
driven cortisol release, bypa ssing full inference). These
bidirectional, recursive processes — grounded in free energy
minimization— highlight how distortions cascade across levels in
MDD and PTSD.
Table 3 summarizes these interactions in normal versus
pathological states, providing a quick reference for how ﬁrst-
order, second-order, and physiological responses align or diverge.
4.1 MDD and the self
From a predictive coding perspective, MDD involves maladaptive
models of the interoceptive self, including dysfunctions in systems
governing sleep, appetite, energy, libido, and reward-seeking (42). We
extend this account to incorporate distorted second-order self-
models, informed by psychodynamic theory.
Classic psychodynamic models of depression emphasize the
role of internalized object relationships. Freud’s “Mourning and
Melancholia ” (43) described depression as a response to
unconscious loss and identiﬁcation with a punitive object. Klein,
Bowlby, and Jacobson further elaborated on how object loss and
ambivalent attachment contribute to depressive states. Blatt (44)
distinguished between introjective depression, focused on self-
criticism and guilt, and anaclitic depression, centered on feelings
of abandonment and helplessness.
The AISI framework situates these perspectives within a
computational model of second-order inference. Vulnerability to
depression emerges from:
1. The loss of attachment ﬁg u r e so rs e l fo b j e c t sw h o
contributed positive second-order representations leads to
ad eﬁcit in afﬁrming self-models, producing symptoms
associated with anaclitic depression ( 44, 45). These
include feelings of abandonm ent, helplessness, and
interpersonal dependency.
2. Internalization of critical or punitive object representations
generates persistently negative second-order priors,
manifesting as introjective depression with themes of
guilt, inadequacy, and self-criticism.
These distorted second-order priors exert top-down suppressive
effects on interoceptive prediction, leading to diminished energy,
motivation, appetite, and reward-seeking. This state may serve an
adaptive function— minimizing energy expenditure in anticipation
of social futility, akin to a metabolic“hibernation” (46).
Mood emerges as a complex construct reﬂecting predictive
modeling across multiple domains. Depressive mood states
appear to represent the integration of predictions about energy
availability, sleep-wake cycles, appetite regulation, libido, reward
anticipation, anhedonia, and crucially, predictions of social
rejection and social defeat (47–49). The social defeat stress model
in rodents provides a compelling parallel to AISI dysfunction, where

repeated social subordination leads to lasting alterations in both
social behavior and physiological markers of depression (50).
Disruptions in interoceptive inference— due to chronic illness,
inﬂammation, or dysregulated neurochemistry — may inﬂuence
second-order models of the self. Low precision in interoceptive
prediction increases the likeli hood of misattribution (e.g.,
interpreting fatigue or somatic discomfort as signs of inadequacy
or failure), reinforcing maladaptive second-order predictions (51;
Gilbert et al., 2022). These bidir ectional prediction processes,
outlined in Section 2.3, demonstrate how disruptions in one
domain cascade to affect the other, creating self-perpetuating
cycles of dysfunction between the interoceptive self, the second-
order self, and relations with others.
The AISI framework provides a unifying account for various
depressive presentations. Melancholic depression, characterized
by severe anhedonia and psychomotor changes, can be
understood as pathologically rigid negative second-order priors
combined with substantially disrupted interoceptive prediction.
Atypical depression, with its altered mood reactivity and rejection
sensitivity, reﬂects hypervigilant second-order inference systems
that overweight potential social threats. These diverse
presentations emerge from different patterns of dysfunction in
the recursive loops between interoceptive and second-order
inference systems.
Functional neuroimaging studies of MDD support this
bidirectional model (52). Altered activity and connectivity have
been consistently observed in regions central to AISI, including the
mPFC, anterior insula, and ACC (52–54). In depression, positive
social feedback often fails to update negative second-order self-
perceptions, as they generate insuf ﬁcient prediction error to
override established negative priors.
In severe depression, suicide may represent a terminal outcome
of unbearably negative second-order inference. When an
individual ’s negative self-models become so rigid that no
corrective experiences can update them, the psychological pain
may become intolerable.
4.2 Trauma and the second-order self
Post-traumatic stress disord er (PTSD) is characterized by
exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual
violence, followed by distinct symptom clusters: intrusive
memories, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition/
mood, and heightened arousal/reactivity (55). Complex PTSD (C-
PTSD) includes additional distu rbances in self-organization,
emotion regulation, and interpersonal functioning (56).
Psychodynamic theories have long emphasized how trauma
alters self-experience, noting the internalization of the perpetrator’s
degrading view of the victim, the collapse of representational
boundaries, and the inability to integrate traumatic experiences
into a coherent self-narrative (57–59).
4.2.1 PTSD and predictive models of the self
The interoceptive self pl ays a central role in PTSD
symptomatology. Hyperarousal, sleep disturbances, and exaggerated
startle responses reﬂect dysregulated predictions at the interoceptive
level. These manifest physiologically through heightened sympathetic
activity, elevated baseline cortisol, and disrupted hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis functioning (60). Fear-potentiated startle— the
exaggerated acoustic startle response in threatening contexts —
provides a particularly well-documented example of altered
predictive processing, with robust evidence from both human and
animal studies (61, 62).
Within the AISI framework, trauma also produces enduring
distortions in second-order self-models. In many cases, trauma
involves a perpetrator who imposes a hostile and degrading image
of the victim. This model, transmitted through coercion, fear, or
shame, may override the victim’s preexisting second-order self-
model, particularly if the trauma occurs during critical
developmental stages. Once internalized, this hostile second-order
model becomes a rigid prior, generating persistent predictions of
vulnerability, worthlessness, and social rejection.
Triggering events in the present may reactivate these priors,
leading to an intrusion of traumatic memories and associated
affective states. Avoidance behaviors can be understood as active
inference strategies to minimize exposure to stimuli that would
generate high prediction errors against these trauma-informed
models. The chronic hypervigilance in PTSD re ﬂects an over
precision of threat-related priors in second-order inference, where
even neutral social cues are interpreted as conﬁrmatory evidence of
danger or rejection.
The bidirectional link between second-order and interoceptive
selves explains PTSD’s somatic symptoms. A second-order model of
the self as‘damaged/dangerous/worthless’ maintains chronic stress
system activation, perpetuating the physiological dysregulation
characteristic of PTSD.
Neuroimaging studies support this model. PTSD has been
associated with dysregulation in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, and
anterior insula— regions implicated in both interoceptive inference
and self-referential processing (63, 64). Reduced mPFC-amygdala
connectivity may impair updating of trauma-related second-order
priors, perpetuating hypervigilance and maladaptive threat
perception in social contexts (24, 65).
4.2.2 Complex PTSD and identiﬁcation with the
aggressor
Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) stems from prolonged, repeated
trauma exposure, particularly during developmental periods (56, 66).
Its distinctive features include profound disturbances in self-
organization manifesting as persistent negative self-concept, affective
dysregulation, and enduring difﬁculties in relationships. These identity
disturbances often involve feelings of emptiness, chronic shame, and
fundamental alienation from one’sa u t h e n t i cs e l f(67, 68). Therapeutic
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org08
approaches like prolonged exposure, while effective for uncomplicated
PTSD and some C-PTSD cases (69), may require adaptation for C-
PTSD due to its distinct disturbances in self-organization and
interpersonal functioning.
The disturbances in identity found in C-PTSD can be understood
through AISI as the internalization of the aggressor’s degrading second-
order model of the victim, a process Ferenczi ( 57)t e r m e d
“identiﬁcation with the aggressor.” In prolonged trauma, the victim’s
second-order self may incorporate the perpetrator’s hostile perceptions
to minimize free energy in an unpredictable environment. This
adaptive strategy during trauma becomes maladaptive post-trauma,
leading to fragmented self-models and relational instability.
5 Integration with research domain
criteria
The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims to
reconceptualize mental disorde rs in terms of brain-behavior
dimensions (70). While RDoC has advanced biological psychiatry,
it has struggled to incorporate the subjective experience and
meaning-making processes central to psychodynamic theories. We
propose that the AISI framework can bridge these perspectives,
demonstrating how traditional psychodynamic concepts can be
reformulated in terms of modern computational neuroscience.
5.1 RDoC and AISI: complementary
frameworks
RDoC organizes psychopathology along functional domains
(negative valence, positive valence, cognitive systems, social
processes, arousal/regulatory systems) examined across multiple
levels from genes to behavior. The AISI framework’s emphasis on
bidirectional interactions betwe en interoceptive processes and
social inference maps naturally onto these domains:
 Negative Valence Systems: AISI reinterprets sustained
threat and loss constructs as maladaptive second-order
inference patterns, where overly precise prior beliefs about
rejection or worthlessness drive affective disturbances.
 Positive Valence Systems: Reward processing disruptions
are viewed as predictive consequences of negative second-
order models, where anticipation of social rejection
diminishes reward-seeking behavior.
 Social Processes: Social communication and perception
dif ﬁculties re ﬂect distortions in recursive second-
order modeling.
 Arousal/Regulatory Syst ems: Emotion regulation
impairments may reﬂect maladaptive precision weighting
in predictive hierarchies, a computational reframing of
defensive mechanisms.
Recent work by Banaraki et al. (71) has similarly proposed
integrating predictive processing with RDoC domains, focusing on
cognitive systems. Our approac h extends this integration to
encompass psychodynamic insights about self-organization and
interpersonal functioning.
5.2 Depression through an integrated lens
As detailed in Section 4.1, depression involves distorted
modeling of both interoceptive states and social perceptions. The
AISI-RDoC integration offers new insights into traditional
psychodynamic depression subtypes, where positive- and negative
valence systems are involved:
Anaclitic depression — characterized psychodynamically by
dependency and abandonment fears ( 44)— can be reframed as
hypersensitive second-order in ference about social acceptance
coupled with low precision of in teroceptive prediction. This
computational proﬁle explains both the intense need for external
validation and difﬁculty regulating emotions independently.
Introjective depression — marked by self-criticism and
perfectionism in psychodynamic theory— represents rigid high-
precision second-order models of social judgment that resist
updating despite contradictory evidence. This corresponds to
RDoC’s sustained loss construct, where loss-related neural circuits
maintain persistent activation patterns (81).
Neurovegetative symptoms reﬂect the interoceptive consequences
of these maladaptive second-order models. Anhedonia emerges not
simply from reward circuit dysfunction (RDoC’sp o s i t i v ev a l e n c e
systems) but from active inference processes where:
1. Second-order predictions of social rejection increase the
expected free energy of reward-seeking behaviors.
2. This leads to adaptive withdrawal to minimize prediction
errors.
3. Consequently, dopaminergic signaling, which encodes the
precision of reward prediction, is downregulated.
This integrative view explains why pharmacological approaches
targeting monoaminergic systems may restore hedonic capacity
without addressing the underlying social prediction models driving
depression (72).
5.3 PTSD through an integrated lens
Building on Section 4.2, the AISI framework reinterprets PTSD
across multiple RDoC domains:
In the negative valence domain, sustained threat activation
represents rigid trauma-informed priors that chronically bias
perception toward danger detection. The “overgeneralization of
conditioned fear” described in RDoC can be reinterpreted through
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org09
AISI as overgeneralization of trauma-related second-order
inference to non-threatening interpersonal contexts.
The distinction between acute stress disorder and PTSD reﬂects
different stages of inferential adaptation:
1. Acute responses feature low precision of prior beliefs and high
precision of sensory/interoceptive errors— an adaptive state
that facilitates rapid model updating after unexpected danger.
2. Chronic PTSD develops whe n trauma-related models
become entrenched as high-precision priors that resist
revision, biasing percepti on toward threat detection
across contexts.
6 Future directions
The AISI framework opens up numerous opportunities for
exploratory research and clinical innovation. Here, we elect to
emphasize a signiﬁcant unmet need: the development of technologies
that can facilitate efﬁcacy studies of psychodynamic treatments.
Despite a long tradition of clinical observation and case-based
research, psychodynamic interventions remain underrepresented in
large-scale clinical efﬁcacy trials. Several challenges hinder progress:
the high degree of personalization in treatment, the lack of
consensus on therapeutic mechanisms, and the limited availability
of sensitive outcome measures.
AISI may provide a novel foundation for overcoming these
barriers. By positing recursive inference, particularly second-order
cognitive ﬂexibility, as a transdiagnostic mechanism underlying
various forms of psychopathology, the framework identi ﬁes a
common therapeutic target that can be implemented across
diagnoses and therapeutic modalities.
Several speciﬁc, testable hypotheses emerge from the AISI
framework that could guide future research:
1. Individuals with depression will show reduced second-order
inferenceﬂexibility, measurable through computational tasks
that assess belief updating about how others perceive them,
with greater rigidity correlating with depression severity.
2. PTSD symptoms will correlate with speciﬁc patterns of
second-order prediction errors, particularly overestimation
of negative social evaluation and underestimation of social
support availability.
3. Successful psychotherapy should demonstrate quantiﬁable
increases in second-order inference ﬂexibility, detectable
through pre- and post-treatment assessments using the
Hierarchical Gaussian Filter or similar computational tool.
4. Precision-weighting abn ormalities in second-order
inference can be pharmacologically modulated, with
serotonergic and dopaminergic agents showing
differential effects on different aspects of social
prediction updating.
5. Virtual reality-based social interaction paradigms will
reveal distinct second-order inference signatures for
different personality disorders, providing objective
biomarkers for treatment response.
Emerging technologies in computational psychiatry and AI
provide promising tools for testing and reﬁning this model. One
such tool is the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF), a generative
model that simulates belief updating under uncertainty (12). HGF
can be applied to behavioral data from social inference tasks to
estimate parameters like learning rates and precision weighting,
offering quantitative measures of second-orderﬂexibility.
We also propose that therapy can be understood as a coupled
inference system in which the therapist and patient recursively
update their models of each other. These models can be simulated
to test how various therapeutic stances (e.g., empathic mirroringvs.
interpretive confrontation) shape model convergence and
belief revision.
Recent advances in AI-based psychodynamic assessment offer
complementary approaches. Hoermann et al. (73) demonstrated
that natural language processing algorithms can identify patterns of
interpersonal reasoning and second-order perspective-taking in
clinical interviews. Similarly, Lié bana et al. (74) used interactive
AI systems to elicit and quantify social inferenceﬂexibility in real-
time simulated dialogues. Their ﬁndings showed a strong
correlation between AI-generated metrics and clinician ratings of
interpersonal functioning. Future research must address ethical
challenges, such as ensuring equitable access to AI-driven
assessments and minimizing risks in psychedelic trials, as
discussed in Section 5. Additionally, while AISI emphasizes social
and interoceptive contributions to self-experience, it could be
extended to incorporate non-s ocial sources like mastery or
performance in future work.
These developments suggest that the AISI framework may help
integrate diverse research programs — ranging from classical
psychoanalysis to contemporary computational modeling— into a
uniﬁed empirical project. By identifying second-order cognitive
ﬂexibility as a mechanistic target and linking it to quantiﬁable
parameters, AISI provides the groundwork for precision
psychodynamic psychiatry.
6.1 Empirical approaches to testing AISI
The AISI framework generates testable hypotheses that can be
evaluated using computational, behavioral, and neuroimaging
methods. Below, we outline speciﬁc experimental paradigms to
assess AISI’s predictions about second-order inference ﬂexibility
and its role in psychopathology:
1. Neuroimaging Studies: Functional MRI (fMRI) can be used
to measure activity and connectivity in AISI-related brain
regions (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], anterior
insula, temporoparietal junction [TPJ]) during social
feedback tasks. For example, participants could engage in
a task where they receive positive or negative evaluations
from virtual agents, allowing researchers to examine how
Harris 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630858
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org10
prediction errors in second-order inference correlate with
activity in these regions. Reduced mPFC-anterior insula
connectivity in MDD or PTSD patients would support
AISI’s hypothesis of disrupted social inference (63).
2. Computational Modeling with Hierarchical Gaussian Filter
(HGF) 80:T h eH G F(12) can quantify belief updating in
second-order inference. In a behavioral task, participants
could predict others ’ perceptions of them based on
ambiguous social cues (e.g., neutral facial expressions). HGF
parameters, such as learning rate and precision weighting,
could reveal reduced inferenceﬂexibility in MDD (e.g., rigid
negative priors) or PTSD (e.g., overestimation of threat).
Comparing these parameters across clinical and control
groups would validate AISI’s mechanistic claims.
3. Virtual Reality (VR)-Based Paradigms: VR environments
can simulate dynamic social interactions to test AISI ’s
predictions about recursive self-modeling. For instance, a
VR task could present participants with avatars delivering
ambiguous feedback, measuring how quickly participants
update their second-order self-models in response to new
information. Such paradigms, inspired by Lié bana et al.
(74), could quantify inference ﬂexibility and identify
biomarkers for treatment response in depression or
trauma-related disorders.
These paradigms, summarized in Table 4 ,o f f e rf e a s i b l e
approaches to test AISI ’s hypotheses. While large-scale
neuroimaging studies may be reso urce-intensive, pilot studies
using HGF or VR tasks provide accessible starting points for
empirical validation.
6.2 Treatment implications
While the therapeutic applications of AISI are promising, they
remain speculative and will require further empirical research to
validate their clinical utility. The AISI framework identiﬁes three
independent axes along which patients can be classiﬁed: second-
order inference ﬂexibility, interoceptive-social coupling strength,
and prior precision weighting. These axes, when integrated with
RDoC constructs, offer a mechanistic basis for diagnosis, severity
assessment, and treatment selection tailored to underlying
psychopathological processes.
For instance, psychodynamically oriented treatments— such as
empathic attunement, object relational approaches, transference
analysis, or interpersonal therapy— may be particularly indicated
for deﬁcits in second-order inferenceﬂexibility or maladaptive prior
precision weighting. These inte rventions provide corrective
interpersonal experiences that generate prediction errors,
facilitating the updating of rigid self-models.
In contrast, modalities like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),
exposure therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) could be
selected for disruptions in interoceptive-social coupling strength, as
they target the integration of bodily signals with social cognition
through structured behavioral experiments and emotion
regulation techniques.
Pharmacotherapies present additional opportunities.
Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and MDMA, show potential for
addressing second-order inference ﬂexibility and prior precision
weighting by temporarily reducing the rigidity of high-level priors
(75–77). Other pharmacotherapies, including serotonergic and
dopaminergic agents, should be investigated for their differential
effects on these three axes, potentially modulating precision
weighting in predictive hierarchies (78, 79).
For outcome prediction, AISI parameters— such as baseline
second-order inference rigidity— could forecast treatment response.
These might be measured through computational tasks (e.g., HGF-
based assessments) or AI-driven tools that quantify interpersonal
reasoning in clinical interviews ( 73). This approach supports
precision psychiatry by enabling mechanism-based interventions,
though prospective studies are needed to conﬁrm these predictions.
7 Conclusion
The Active Intersubjective Inference framework provides a
novel and integrative understanding of mental function and
dysfunction. By suggesting that the brain constructs not only
ﬁrst-order models of bodily and environmental states but also
second-order models regarding how one is perceived by others, it
links phenomenological experiences of self, affect, and identity with
the neurocomputational principles of predictive coding.

This framework sheds light on the pathogenesis of conditions
such as MDD and PTSD, where recursive self-models and
interoceptive processes become rigid, maladaptive, or fragmented.
It also explains the relational instability observed in personality
disorders, where second-order predictions lack coherence
or resilience.
Crucially, AISI suggests that treatment may enhance second-
order cognitive ﬂexibility— whether through empathic attunement
in psychodynamic therapy, corrective experiences in CBT, or
pharmacological modulation of precision weighting. Psychedelics
and AI-driven assessments ser ve as powerful adjuncts for
promoting plasticity and personalizing interventions.
By grounding psychodynamic insights in the formal logic of
inference, AISI creates a common language for dialogue between
clinicians, neuroscientists, and computational modelers. AISI
advances psychodynamic understandings of trauma and
depression by providing testa ble computational mechanisms,
bridging neurobiological and psychological perspectives in ways
that can inform both therapeutic practice and empirical research.
This may ﬁnally allow for a truly integrative psychiatry— one that
respects the depth of subjective experience while embracing the
rigor of mechanistic explanation.
