Background. Interpersonal problems are common in mental disorders like depression and social anxiety 9 
disorder. However, there is a lack of formal models to explain idiosyncrasies in patients' interpersonal 10 
functioning. Following modern computational accounts of perception and action, interpersonal experi-11 
ence and behavior results from implicit inference about hidden environmental properties. 12 
Methods. We simulate interpersonal decision-making in a “trust game” using a POMDP generative 13 
model and active inference. Simulated agents decide to either keep or invest an initial budget to a trustee. 14 
If the agents invests, the trustee can cooperate  with or exploit the agent’s trust. Agents perform active 15 
inference of the context (cooperative vs. hostile) and action selection. By introducing systematic biases 16 
to the generative model, we simulate several subtypes of depression and social anxiety.  We then col-17 
lected data of N=25 patients with diagnosed depressive disorders and fit the generative model to the 18 
data.  19 
Results. Agents with biased expectations or preferences showed idiosyncratic interpersonal inference. 20 
They more readily infer to be in a hostile context and avoid  investing with the trustee. Biases also af-21 
fected the total earned rewards, with socially anxious and depressed agents receiving higher average 22 
rewards in hostile contexts compared to "healthy" agents  (i.e., agents with an accurate -to-optimistic 23 
generative model), but “healthy” top optimistic agents showing superior performance in volatile envi-24 
ronments. Fitting the model to the data resulted in individual parameters for patients with low symptom 25 
scores compared to those with high symptom scores , with group differences particularly in transition 26 
dynamics 𝐵, outcome preferences 𝐶 and prior beliefs 𝐷.  27 
Discussion. Our simulations formalize complex interpersonal phenomena within Active Inference. In-28 
terpersonal biases in mental disorders can be formalized and investigated with respect to their functional 29 
role. The model has potential applications in psychopathological research, personalized diagnostics, and 30 
individualized treatment planning. Further empirical work is necessary to validate the empirical basis 31 
and clinical usefulness of formal models of interpersonal decision-making. 32

Introduction 2 
Impairments in interpersonal experience and behavior are highly prevalent in mental disorders and can 3 
cause tremendous suffering and social disadvantages (social anxiety disorder: Alden & Taylor, 2004; 4 
eating disorders: Arcelus et al., 2013; schizophrenia: Hooley, 2010; major depression: Kupferberg et al., 5 
2016; borderline personality disorder: Lazarus et al., 2014; post-traumatic stress disorder: Scoglio et al., 6 
2022). Determining whether interpersonal impairments are the cause or consequence of a mental health 7 
problem is challenging. It is likely that longitudinal bidirectional relationships exist (Beeson et al., 2020; 8 
Kirchner et al., 2022). Impairments in interpersonal experience and behavior predict important clinical 9 
outcomes and play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorder (Backs-Dermott et al., 10 
2010; Bell et al., 2018; Kirchner et al., 2022; Quilty et al., 2013; Tokuda et al., 2008; Woods et al., 2021). 11 
Upon closer examination, interpersonal symptoms tend to share significant similarities across diagnostic 12 
categories.  For instance, social withdrawal is common in depressed (Fernández-Theoduloz et al., 2019), 13 
and socially anxious individuals (Hudson & Rapee, 2000) ; but also in individuals with chronic pain 14 
(Harris, 2014) , post -traumatic stress disorder (Maercker & Horn, 2013) , or borderline personality 15 
disorder (Liebke et al., 2017) . It follows that a  breadth of different underlying causes may result in  16 
commonalities at the level  of observable behavior  (Gao et al., 2017) . These commonalities are of 17 
particular interest in light of generally high comorbidity rates among mental disorders (Conway et al., 18 
2022; Cuthbert & Insel, 2013; Dalgleish et al., 2020). However, meaningful differences in interpersonal 19 
experience and behavior can still be identified between- and within diagnostic categories. Joormann & 20 
Gotlib (2006) demonstrated differences between depressed and socially anxious individuals in terms of 21 
sensitivity to social stimuli. Also within the spectrum of depressive disorders , different “interpersonal 22 
subtypes” can be identified (e.g., “vindictive” vs. “socially avoidant”, Simon et al., 2015). 23 
There is a lack of formal theories or models that can effectively integrate and accurately operationalize 24 
the differences and commonalities in patients' interpersonal experiences and behaviors  across- and 25 
within disorders. We have previously described the theoretical structure and functional form of such a 26 
model (Kirchner et al., 2022) , where we conceptualized impairments in interpersonal experience and 27 
behavior as the result of biased implicit inferences about hidden properties (“states”) of the environment. 28 
Individual biases can stem from, for example, divergent probability estimates about the environment, 29 
differences in evaluating  interpersonal observations  or the  advantageousness attributed  to these 30 
observations. 31 
Promises of Computational Approaches in Mental Health 32 
The promise of applying formal, normative models to mental health conditions is to identify distinct 33 
behavioral or neural phenotypes, or computational assays (Karvelis et al., 2023; Montague et al., 2012). 34 
Formal computational models of clinical phenotypes, coupled with empirical data,  may open novel 35 
avenues for researching heterogeneity , developing personalized treatments  and predicting treatment 36 
outcomes (Schwartenbeck & Friston, 2016) . Bayesian accounts of behavior have gained substantial 37 
4 
 
momentum in psychiatry and clinical psychology, reframing mental disorders as caused by aberrant  2 
implicit inference (Pio-Lopez et al., 2022) . Bayesian inference has been applied to a wide range of 3 
mental disorders, including schizophrenia (Fletcher & Frith, 2009; Haarsma et al., 2022)  and autism 4 
(Palmer et al., 2017; Pellicano & Burr, 2012), panic disorder (Maisto et al., 2021), social anxiety disorder 5 
(Gerrans & Murray, 2020), post-traumatic stress disorder ( Linson & Friston, 2019) , anorexia nervosa 6 
(Barca & Pezzulo, 2020), and depression (Barrett et al., 2016; M. Berg et al., 2022). While conceptually 7 
attractive, many theoretical accounts suffer from two crucial limitations. First, they tend to be developed 8 
within the boundaries of a specific, categorical diagnosis. Research has shown repeatedly that 9 
traditional, categorical nosologies show limited predictive power, arbitrary boundaries between sub -10 
clinical and clinical expressions of a trait or symptom, and high levels of  comorbidity (Kotov et al., 11 
2018). Developments such as the HiToP (Kotov et al., 2018)  or RDoC (Cuthbert & Insel, 2013)  are 12 
moving away from a description of mental disorders by a set of distinct diagnostic categories  and 13 
towards dimensional perspectives on clinical symptoms and syndromes . Secondly, many studies lack 14 
rigorous mathematical operationalizations that allow for com puter simulations and a thorough formal 15 
evaluation of theoretical assumptions considering data. The Active Inference framework may help 16 
address these shortcomings, providing flexible and tractable algorithms for inference (Parr et al., 2022). 17 
Active Inference – A Framework to Model Mental Disorders 18 
Active Inference is a theoretical account of perception, action and learning in complex systems (Friston 19 
et al., 2016; Heins et al., 2022; Parr et al., 2022). It is commonly used to model decision-making under 20 
uncertainty in cognitive neuroscience, but its application now extend to a wide range of fields and 21 
disciplines, including clinical psychology and psychiatry (Benrimoh et al., 2018; Montague et al., 2012; 22 
Smith et al., 2021). Complex behavior under Active Inference results from the imperative to maximize 23 
a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence, or minimize variational free energy (VFE). In other words, 24 
Active Inference ensures that incoming sensory information is well -explained by an internal, formal 25 
model of the world.  To effectively navigate and interact with the (interpersonal) environment, agents 26 
need to infer its current state and decide what actions to pursue to resolve uncertainty about the 27 
environment and obtain preferred observations and outcomes. To accomplish this, it is crucial for the 28 
brain to entertain a generative model of its surroundings . A generative model  is a formal 29 
conceptualization of the processes that generate sensory observations (Friston et al., 2016) . The 30 
generative model is used to form predictions, such as expectations about an interpersonal environment, 31 
which are based on sensory information and prior beliefs. Deviations between sensory information and 32 
model predictions can be used to update the generative model. This iterative process ensures that 33 
predictions continue to minimize VFE over time. To achieve the optimal balance between trusting prior 34 
beliefs or the current sensory information, their respective precision needs to be estimated (Brown et al., 35 
2013). The process of minimizing VFE is thought to underlie perception. Beyond perception, Active 36 
Inference offers a solution for action selection that dynamically interacts with VFE -based perceptual 37 
inference. Desirable states or outcomes (preferences) are part of the agent’s generative model and can 38 
5 
 
be reframed as a type of prior prediction (Da Costa et al., 2020). Actions are selected in a way that makes 2 
these predictions more probable. In Active Inference, actions hence ensure that preferred outcomes or 3 
states are reached or maintained. Action selection requires minimizing the expected free energy (EFE) 4 
𝐸 over future states, given a sequence of actions. Policies that lead to preferred outcomes are more likely 5 
to be pursued by the agent. Agents are hence equipped to choose proximal actions that lead to the 6 
achievement of a distal goal state, i.e., planning -as-inference. Through this, Active Inference offers a 7 
computational strategy to solve the explore -exploit dilemma (Heins et al., 2022) . In Active Inference, 8 
the state of the environment is usually modelled as unobservable, or hidden, to the agent. The agent has 9 
to infer the hidden state from sensory observations, which are generated by the hidden state in a 10 
probabilistic manner (Da Costa et al., 2020) . An agent further needs a representation of how, 11 
probabilistically, their own actions alter environmental states. This ensures that only such actions are 12 
chosen that either resolve the agent’s uncertainty (explore)  or bring the agent closer to their preferred 13 
outcome (exploit). Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have proved to be a 14 
convenient choice for generative models in Active Inference (Da Costa et al., 2020; Heins et al., 2022). 15 
POMDPs model the environment in terms of hidden states, which change dynamically over time as a 16 
function of the current state and the agent’s actions. 17 
To summarize, agents perpetually infer the real-world causes of incoming sensory observations. Agents 18 
will choose policies, or action sequences, that resolve uncertainty and  maximize the likelihood of 19 
achieving preferred states. To do this, agents need to estimate how observations relate to hidden states, 20 
how hidden states evolve over time, and how their actions impact the evolution of hidden states.  21 
Neuroeconomic Decision-making and Interpersonal Behavior in Mental Disorders.  22 
Neuroeconomic games are complex and strategic, yet controlled experiments (Glimcher & Rustichini, 23 
2004; Robson et al., 2020) that have been utilized to study interpersonal decision-making in both healthy 24 
participants and clinical populations (King-Casas & Chiu, 2012). In the present work, we focus on trust 25 
games, where an agent needs to decide whether to keep or invest a small monetary wage with a trustee. 26 
If the agent decides to invest, the trustee can decide to cooperate, usually resulting in an increased payout 27 
for the agent ; or defect, resulting in a loss for the agent. Previous research suggests idiosyncrasies in 28 
gameplay behavior in mental disorders (King-Casas & Chiu, 2012; Robson et al., 2020) . In particular, 29 
gameplay behavior in individuals with depression and social anxiety disorder is well documented (Ong 30 
et al., 2017; C. Sripada et al., 2013; C. S. Sripada et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012) . Individuals with 31 
remitted major depressive disorder tend to defect less when in the role of the trustee compared to healthy 32 
controls, which has been related to a reduced ability to cope with the socio -emotional demands of the 33 
trust game (Ong et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2012) . In social anxiet y, functional imaging data suggests 34 
decreased processing of the opponent’s motivation (C. S. Sripada et al., 2009)  and decreased neural 35 
responses to a cooperative trustee compared to controls (C. Sripada et al., 2013). Additionally, decision-36 
making in neuroeconomic gameplay has been associated with important clinical variables. In an 37 
6 
 
exemplary study, individuals with a history of high-lethality suicide attempts were less sensitive to the 2 
costs of punishing their partner in a trust game compared to patients with a history of low -lethality 3 
suicide attempts (Szanto et al., 2014). Hence, interpersonal decision-making in gameplay allows us to 4 
model clinically relevant experiences and behavior (Hinterbuchinger et al., 2018; King-Casas & Chiu, 5 
2012; Robson et al., 2020; Tzieropoulos, 2013; Wang et al., 2015). 6 
Active Inference in Interpersonal Decision-making 7 
Interpersonal contexts are highly complex and recursive. An individual needs to constantly monitor the 8 
dynamic actions of another individual, and predict future actions based on prior experiences with this 9 
individual or situation to choose appropriate and timely reactions. Moutoussis and colleagues (201 4) 10 
equip simulated agents with  variational Bayesian message passing  and engage in a trust game. They 11 
demonstrate that the agents are able to iteratively update beliefs about an opponent and make decisions 12 
that maximize reward over time (Moutoussis et al., 2014). Similarly, Schwartenbeck et al. (2015) model 13 
behavior and neural activity in a neuroeconomic “limited offer” game using Active Inference. 14 
Participants had to decide whether they would accept a lower offer or wait for a higher one, at the risk 15 
of losing any offers if they waited for too long. Active Inference showed superior performance compared 16 
to classical utility maximization schemes in explaining participant behavior (Schwartenbeck et al., 17 
2015). Finally, Cullen and colleagues (2018) simulated agents equipped with Active Inference in an 18 
artificial game-play environment and demonstrate that agents are capable of forming representations of 19 
their environments that help guide research into neurobiological underpinnings of mental disorder  20 
(Cullen et al., 2018). 21

Methods 2 
Task 3 
We use a classical economic game to simulate interpersonal decision-making in depression (see Figure 4 
1A). In the trust game (J. Berg et al., 1995; King -Casas & Chiu, 2012) , the agent’s task is to play a 5 
multi-round investment-return game. In our simplified version, the agent receives a small amount of 6 
money in each trial, which they can either keep to themselves or invest their budget with a trustee. The 7 
artificial trustee can either keep or return half the multiplied wage invested by the agent. If the trustee 8 
decides to return half of the investment (return), the investment is multiplied by three, and split evenly 9 
between agent and trustee, leading to a surplus reward created by the joint venture (i.e., the agent invests 10 
0.5 and receives 0.75). If, in contrast, the trustee decides to keep the agent’s investment to themselves 11 
(defect), the agent loses  all their budget to the trustee . In other words, if the agent invests, he can 12 
encounter both a return of investment (win) or a loss of their investment (in case the trustee defects). In 13 
the simulation, there were two different interpersonal contexts (Figure 1B). In the cooperative context, 14 
the trustee collaborates (i.e., shares the agent’s investment) with a probability of 𝑝=0.8. In the 15 
exploitative, or hostile context, the trustee tends to keep the agent’s investment to themselves and shares 16 
with a probability of 𝑝=0.2. We simulated two games: a cooperative -to-hostile game, where a 17 
cooperative phase (t=20) was followed by a hostile phase (t=20), and a hostile -to-cooperative game 18 
(t=20 cooperative trials, followed by t=20 hostile trials) . To maximize rewards over time, the agent 19 
should frequently share with the trustee in cooperative contexts and keep their initial wage in the hostile 20 
context. For this, the agent requires an accurate representation of the  current context, which they need 21 
to infer from observing the trustee’s behavior over several rounds of the game. The agent hence needs 22 
to solve the dilemma of learning as much as possible about the trustee’s intentions (explore) on the one 23 
hand and maximizing reward (exploit) on the other. 24

A. The agent receives a budget of 0.50 at the beginning of each trial. The agent must decide to keep or invest their 6 
budget. If the agent decides to invest their budget with the trustee, the budget is multiplied by factor 3. The trustee 7 
can decide to collaborate with the agent  and return half of the tripled budget (0.75) , resulting in a larger overall 8 
payoff for the agent and the trustee. If the trustee, decides to keep the agent’s investment to themselves  (defect), 9 
the agent does not receive anything.  10 
B. There were t hree contexts: cooperative (trustee returns agent’s investment in 80% of trials) , hostile (trustee 11 
returns agent’s investment in 20% of trials); and random (50% return of investment when sharing with the trustee). 12 
In the simulations, we focused on the cooperative - and hostile context and switches between these two, with two 13 
types of games: a hostile-to-cooperative game (t=20 cooperative followed by t=20 hostile trials) and a cooperative-14 
to-hostile game (t=20 hostile trials followed by t=20 cooperative trials).    15

Model parameters ( 𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷) are shown in boxes. 𝐴 is the observation model, connecting observations 𝑜𝑡 to 18 
hidden states 𝑠𝑡. 𝐵 is the transition parameter, governing state transitions that depend on previous hidden states 19 
𝑠𝑡−1 and policies π. 𝐶 represents prior beliefs (or prior preferences) over outcome observations 𝑜. 𝐷 represents the 20 
agent’s initial beliefs about the hidden states 𝑠. Finally, 𝐺 is the expected free energy over policies, which depends 21 
on prior preferences 𝐶. Based on 𝐺, those policies with the highest probability of minimizing uncertainty over 22 
states 𝑠 and maximize the probability of the preferred rewards are assigned the highest probability.  23

Model 2 
The simulations were implemented in Python (v. 3.8.3) and the pymdp toolbox for Active Inference in 3 
discrete state spaces  (Heins et al., 2022) . The game’s context can be cooperative ( 𝑝(𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒)=0.8), 4 
hostile (𝑝(𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒)=0.2) or random (𝑝(𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒)=0.5). The agent’s task is to infer the current context 5 
and choose their actions accordingly. If, for example, the agent infers to be in a cooperative context, 6 
they should invest their money with the trustee for a n increased outcome. If, on the other hand, they 7 
infer to be in a hostile context, they should prefer to keep their money. We here simulate 40 trials t of 8 
the task, with one context switch after t=20. 9 
The agent’s generative model was determined by four parameters 𝐴,𝐵,𝐶 and 𝐷. For a graphical 10 
overview of the agent’s generative model, see Figure 2. The 𝐴 matrix, or likelihood, describes the 11 
agent’s beliefs about the mapping between observations 𝑜𝑡 (i.e., defection vs. cooperation) and the 12 
hidden state of the environment 𝑠𝑡 (i.e., cooperative vs. hostile). For example, an agent might expect to 13 
observe a cooperative reaction in a cooperative context with a probability of 𝑝=0.8. In this case, the 14 
agent’s belief is accurate, since the probability of observing a “share” in the cooperative environment is 15 
set to 𝑝=0.8 in the environment. However, the agent can hold inaccurate beliefs, which we assume to 16 
be a central mechanism underlying mental disorders.  17 
The 𝐵, or transition matrix, comprises the agent’s beliefs about the evolution of the hidden states over 18 
time, given the present state and their own actions. If, for example, the agent infers to be in a cooperative 19 
context, they may believe that this context is stable and expect to remain in a cooperative state in the 20 
next timestep with a probability of 𝑝=0.9. The 𝐵 matrix parameterizes all possible state transitions.  21 
The 𝐶 vector formalizes the agent’s prior preferences over outcomes. In the trust game, a “win” after 22 
engaging in a joint venture with the trustee may be the preferred outcome, whereas a “loss” of their 23 
investment after the trustee defects is the least preferred outcome. In the following, “win” here refers to 24 
the multiplied return on investment the agent receives when the trustee shares the amount previously 25 
invested by the agent. 26 
Finally, the 𝐷 vector contains the agent’s prior beliefs over hidden states, i.e., the agent’s beliefs about 27 
states at the start of the game. An agent may for example believe that the cooperative, hostile or random 28 
state are equally likely, assigning a probability of 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=𝑥)=0.333 to each context. We now 29 
introduce the first agent, a healthy -to-optimistic agent, with a detailed explanation of the underlying 30 
generative model. 31 
Healthy agent. We first developed a healthy -to-optimistic agent with a generative model close to the 32 
probability structure of the generative process (i.e., the environment). Their observation model consisted 33 
of three matrices: (1) the reward observation model 𝐴1, containing the agent’s expectations about reward 34 
outcomes associated with each context, (2) the behavior observation model 𝐴2, i.e. the agent’s internal 35 
10 
 
mapping between the context and the expected behavior of the trustee , and (3) the choice  observation 2 
model 𝐴3, which maps the agent’s executed action to the expectation about the sensed action. 3 
The healthy agent’s reward observation is here reported separately for observing a certain outcome given 4 
they have decided to share with the trustee:  5 
𝐴1 = (

 6 
For example, when sharing in the cooperative context (first row), the agent expects to observe a return 7 
of their investment (𝑤𝑖𝑛) with a probability of .9, and to observe a 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 as a consequence of the trustee 8 
defecting with a probability of .1.   9 
In contrast, w hen the agent decides to keep their budget, they deterministically observe their initial 10 
budget as outcome. Note that this relationship remains the same for all subsequent agents.  11

 12 
The agent’s behavior observation model is equivalent to the agent’s reward observation model above, 13 
with the exception that it connects context and trustee behavior. There are three possible trustee 14 
behaviors to be observed: return, defect, and unknown. The return and defect outcomes are distributed 15 
as follows for the healthy agent:   16

For all subsequent agents, their behavioral observation model 𝐴2 is equivalent to their reward 21 
observation model 𝐴1. For simplicity, we therefore only report all agent’s reward observation model 𝐴1.  22 
Finally, the agent’s choice observation model  𝐴3 maps the agent’s executed action to the expectation 23 
about the sensed action . Here, for all agents, this mapping is deterministic across all contexts, i.e.  24

The rows in the matrix refer to the three contexts [cooperative, hostile, random] in the current timestep, 5 
the columns reference the next timestep. The first column of the matrix hence contains the agent’s beliefs 6 
about transitioning from a cooperative context into a cooperative one in the next timestep (p=0.9), into 7 
a hostile one (p=0.02, middle column) or a random context (p=0.08, right column). 8 
The agent’s policy-dependent transition probabilities are set up in a way that the agent always transitions 9 
into the action state determined by the previous action. In other words, in the generative model, the agent 10 
transitions into the action state at 𝑡+1 given by the previous action at 𝑡. Context dynamics cannot be 11 
directly influenced by the agent’s action. The transitions between policies is deterministic over time, i.e. 12

This translates to a strong relative preference for observing a “win” outcome  (i.e. a return of their 17 
investment), a relative aversion to observe “loss” outcomes  (i.e. losing their investment to a defecting 18 
trustee), and a slight preference for observing a “ budget” outcome (i.e., keeping their initial budget) 19 
compared to the “ loss” outcome. Finally, the agent holds prior beliefs over hidden states, which are 20 
comprised in the 𝐷 matrix 21

The agent believes the cooperative state to be more probable a priori. At the same time, a hostile state is 23 
possible, but less likely than a cooperative state. A random environment is very unlikely to the agent. 24 
These beliefs were chosen in line with the literature on optimism biases in healthy individuals , where 25 
12 
 
positive outcomes are assumed to be more likely than negative ones (Dieguez et al., 2015; Galinsky et 2 
al., 2008; Sharot, 2011). 3 
Learning is implemented by updates to the model’s parameters after making observations. Learning in 4 
active inference is assumed to happen at a slower timescale compared to hidden state inference, but 5 
follows the same imperative of minimizing variational free energy ( Heins et al., 2022) . In our 6 
simulations, model parameters 𝐴,𝐵 & 𝐷 are updated using Dirichlet posteriors, which are computed 7 
from the Dirichlet prior over the parameter distribution, observations, and a learning rate (Heins et al., 8 
2022). The learning rate is used to scale the magnitude of the update to the posterior over each parameter. 9 
The learning rates for the healthy agent are 𝑙𝑟𝐴 =0.1,𝑙𝑟𝐵 =3.0,𝑙𝑟𝐷 =1.0. The observation model 𝐴 is 10 
updated only slowly since it contains stable beliefs about what types of observations expects under a 11 
certain context. In contrast, 𝐵 is updated with a large learning rate to achieve the flexible decision -12 
making characteristic for healthy individuals in dynamic environments.  In all simulations, 𝐶 is not 13 
updated, underlying which is the assumption that agents hold relatively stable reward outcome 14 
preferences over the course of a game.  Finally, 𝐷 is updated with a learning rate of 1.0 to achieve 15 
updating with observations, while not deviating from prior beliefs too quickly. For further details on and 16 
derivations of update rules, see Heins et al., 2022 (appendix: learning.py).  17 
The simulations reported in the next section are the result of deviations from this normative, or “healthy” 18 
agent’s generative model and should be understood in relation to the parameter settings introduced 19 
above. For a tabular overview of all agents, see Table 1.  20 
Between- and within-disorder simulations 21 
Depression. The depressed agents’ generative model comprises a range of pessimistic beliefs (Barkus 22 
& Badcock, 2019; Hames et al., 2013; Kupferberg et al., 2016) , which are formalized predominantly 23 
within the 𝐵 and 𝐷 matrices. Research suggests that individuals with symptoms of depression respond 24 
more strongly to unpleasant stimulation compared to controls (Gradin et al., 2015; Haley & Strickland, 25 
1986; Pulcu et al., 2015), which may be a consequence of more precise “pessimistic”  prior beliefs (𝐷) 26 
and more fatalistic transition probabilities (𝐵), where positive contexts are assumed to turn aversive with 27 
a high probability, and negative contexts are believed to remain more stable. Furthermore, patients with 28 
depression show difficulties adapting flexibly to changing contexts in neuroeconomic games (Pulcu et 29 
al., 2015), which we formalize by  introducing context switches throughout the game. Finally, there is 30 
some evidence for decreased reward sensitivity in depression (Radke et al., 2013; Scheele et al., 2013; 31 
Wang et al., 2014), which we operationalized in the depressed agent’s generative model via a slightly 32 
more ambiguous preference over outcomes (𝐶). Both agent’s observation model 𝐴 is equivalent to the 33 
healthy agent’s parameter. 34 
Reward-insensitive and pessimistic. The first agent is designed to model a loss-averse and pessimistic 35 
sub-type of depression. The generative model for this agent is hence given by  36

The agent believes the cooperative context to develop towards a more hostile context with a higher 5 
probability ( 𝐵, p(host.|coop)=0.7) compared to a cooperative ( p(coop.|coop) = 0.2) or random 6 
(p(random|coop) = 0.1) context. Furthermore, observing a return of investment, or “win” outcome, has 7 
lost utility for this agent compared to the healthy agent ( 𝐶, p(win)=.44); instead, they have a stronger 8 
preference for observing their initial budget (p(budget)=.53). Finally, the agent is more certain a-priori 9 
about being in a hostile context, as parameterized by their heightened prior ( 𝐷) on hostile contexts  10 
(p(hostile)=.8). 11 
The reward-insensitive and pessimistic agent shows only small updates to their observational model 𝐴, 12 
equivalent to the healthy -to-optimistic agent ( 𝑙𝑟𝐴 =0.1). However, to simulate rigidity in the face of 13 
dynamically evolving environments, this agent does not update their 𝐵 parameter considering new 14 
observations. 𝐷 is updated in a similar way to the healthy agent (𝑙𝑟𝐷 =1.0).  15 
Fatalistic. In another simulation of a depressed agent (fatalistic in the following), we aim at modelling 16 
treatment-resistant depression, marked by rigid fatalistic beliefs where a low probability is assigned to 17 
transitioning into a cooperative context when in a hostile or random context. The cooperative context is 18 
assumed to be the least stable context over time. The agent exhibits a stronger preference for the “win” 19 
outcome and a greater loss aversion than the healthy agent. Further, a low prior probability is assigned 20 
to the cooperative context a-priori, with a higher a-priori belief in a random (or unpredictable) context 21 
compared to the reward-insensitive and pessimistic depressed agent.  22

In this agent, parameters 𝐴 and 𝐷 are updated equivalent to the healthy -to-optimistic agent ( 𝑙𝑟𝐴 =2 
0.1,𝑙𝑟𝐷 =1.0). However, their learning rate over 𝐵 is reduced compared to the healthy agent (𝑙𝑟𝐵 =3 
1.0), modelling beliefs over the game’s dynamics that are less changeable in light of new observations.  4 
Social anxiety disorder. When modelling an agent with social anxiety, we assume perturbations to the 5 
preferred outcome matrix 𝐶, leading to a reduction in interpersonal exploration and increased avoidance 6 
behaviors. Specifically, an increased risk, ambiguity and loss aversion might be underlying social 7 
anxiety in the context of the trust game (Alden & Taylor, 2004; Hartley & Phelps, 2012). In empirical 8 
studies, individuals with social anxiety show increased risk aversion and avoidance behaviors 9 
(Charpentier et al., 2017; Lorian & Grisham, 2010) . Furthermore, studies suggest a decreased neural 10 
response to cooperative partners as a consequence of a deficit in social learning over time (C. Sripada 11 
et al., 2013)  and reduced mPFC activity, which may be related to reduced learning about and/ or 12 
exploration of the trustee’s intentions (Sripada et al., 2013). Such avoidant behaviors could be caused 13 
by an increased loss aversion ( 𝐶) and pessimistic prior beliefs about the social context (𝐷) (Taylor & 14 
Wald, 2003). 15 
Insecure-avoidant. The first socially anxious agent was designed to model an insecure-avoidant sub-16 
type. We first introduce some ambiguity to the agent’s observation model 𝐴: 17

The transition model is perturbed in a way that the agent is biased towards expecting an unpredictable, 19 
or random context in the next timestep when currently in a cooperative or random context. The hostile 20 
context is assumed to remain stable over time:  21

We furthermore manipulate the preference over outcomes 𝐶 in the insecure-avoidant subtype such that 23

), 24 
which leads to the agent’s relative inability to reliably connect observations to the hidden context. 25 
The insecure -avoidant agent assigns a very low preference to the loss outcome. Consequently, the 26 
agent’s priority is to avoid observing losses. The agent further holds idiosyncratic prior beliefs:  27

 2 
This choice was made to operationalize the agent’s indecisiveness with respect to interpersonal contexts, 3 
where most contexts are believed to be random and unpredictable a-priori. 4 
 Similar to the healthy-to-optimistic agent, the insecure-avoidant agent updates their observation model 5 
𝐴 only slowly, with a learning rate of 𝑙𝑟𝐴 =0.1; and their prior over contexts with a learning rate of 6 
𝑙𝑟𝐷 =1.0. Their transition model 𝐵 is not updated to model rigid, fatalistic beliefs of the game’s 7 
dynamics that are not changed by new observations.  8 
Trauma-and-defeat. We simulate an additional socially anxious agent. Like the insecure-avoidant type, 9 
the agent’s 𝐴1 parameter is characterized by observational ambiguity:  10

These parameters were chosen to simulate loss avoidance on the one hand, and a relative insensitivity 18 
to rewards on the other – note that here, the agent slightly favors keeping their initial wage over 19 
observing a win from the joint venture with the trustee.   20 
This agent is further characterized by pessimistic prior beliefs  (𝐷), e.g., a consequence of traumatic 21 
previous interpersonal experiences:  22

The agent’s learning is characterized by similar updates applied to the 𝐴 and 𝐷 parameters as the healthy-2 
to-optimistic agent ( 𝑙𝑟𝐴 = 0.1,𝑙𝑟𝐷 = 1.0). However, learning over the game’s course is reduced 3 
compared to the healthy agent with 𝑙𝑟𝐵 =1.0.  4 
For each agent type, their average earned rewards are computed by simulating a timeseries with T=40 5 
for 20 times per agent type, starting with the cooperative context and switching to the hostile context 6 
and vice versa.  7

Data collection.  2 
We collected behavioral data from patients with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder (ICD-10 diagnoses 3 
F32-F33) who are undergoing treatment in the outpatient clinic at Justus -Liebig-Universität Gießen. 4 
Patients gave written informed consent prior to participation. All procedures were in line with the 5 
declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review boards of the Philipps -Universität 6 
Marburg and Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen (reference number #2022-10k). The data reported here 7 
were collected as part of a larger study (pre-registration: https://aspredicted.org/see_one.php) A total of 8 
N=23 patients participated in the trust game and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In 9 
the hostile-to-cooperative condition, participants played with a trustee who returns their investment with 10 
a relatively low probability (p=0.2) for t=30 trials, followed by a cooperative phase in which the trustee 11 
returns the patients’ investment with a higher probability (p=0.8). In the cooperative -to-hostile 12 
condition, patients first interacted with cooperative trustee for t=30 trials, followed by t=30 trials of 13 
playing with more hostile trustees who return the patient’s investment relatively rarely. In a third 14 
condition, the trustee’s behavior was random, i.e. determined by coin-flip in each trial. Participants first 15 
received written instructions about the game. They were instructed that they will be playing with other 16 
participants who are currently online. The experimental paradigm was equivalent to the simulated task 17 
(Figure 1) with two exceptions . Firstly, participants were instructed that they are playing with a real 18 
trustee via an online platform, and jittered waiting times were introduced between trials and after a share 19 
action in line with the cover story. Secondly, participants played 60 trials of the trust game, each of 20 
which was with one of 10 possible trustees which were introduced with a code name. In the end, t he 21 
participant received 50% of the monetary amount earned in the game as a financial compensation for 22 
their participation.   23 
After completing the game, patients filled out several clinical and demographic surveys, including the 24 
Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck et al., 1988) which will be used in the current analysis to group 25 
patients into high- and low depressed individuals. 26 
Optimization. 27 
We fit the model to the behavioral data of pa rticipants playing the trust game using optimization, with 28 
the goal of obtaining a set of individual parameters 𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷 and 𝜀 for each participant. We introduced 29 
𝜀 as a free parameter which determines the weighting between hedonic (reward-oriented) and epistemic 30 
(information-oriented) drives by scaling the update especially to parameter 𝐴 after observations. This 31 
was done to obtain more behaviorally flexible strategies during the model fitting and initialization during 32 
the fitting. The parameters obtained through the optimization best capture actual participant behavior , 33 
yielding computational-level approximations of the participant’s generative model while performing the 34 
task.  35 
For the optimization, we defined a cost function 36 
19 
 
𝑐=∑𝑞𝑖 ∙𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑞𝑖
𝑎𝑠𝑖
)+(1−𝑞𝑖)∙𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−𝑞𝑖
1−𝑎𝑠𝑖
)
𝐼
𝑖=0
 2 
where 𝑞𝑖 are the normalized behavioral responses in trial 𝑖 (𝑞𝑖 =1 indicates a share action, or investment 3 
by the agent; and 𝑞𝑖 =0 indicates that the agent keeps their budget): 4 
𝑞= 
∑𝑟𝑡 =1
∑𝑇  5 
𝑎𝑠 are the probabilities of “share”, or invest, choices obtained from running the active inference model 6 
with optimized parameters. Minimizing 𝑐 is equivalent to finding parameters that yield simulated actions 7 
as close as possible to the observed actions  𝑟𝑡, which enter 𝑐 in normalized form 𝑞. In other words, 8 
minimizing 𝑐 identifies parameters of the generative model that result in the best possible match between 9 
simulated- and empirically observed actions.  10 
The objective function was used to find the optimum of 15 parameter distributions in total, with 3 11 
parameter values for 𝐴, six parameter values for 𝐵, three parameter values for 𝐶 and two parameter 12 
values for 𝐷, the exact number of parameters required for the simulation.  We furthermore introduced 13 
parameter 𝜀, which was used to weight hedonic (reward -oriented) vs. epistemic drives by scaling the 14 
update on parameters 𝐴 and 𝐵 after a new observation. 𝜀 was another free parameter that was included 15 
in the optimization. The optimization was performed using the Powell’s conjugate direction method of 16 
the module scipy-optimize (scipy version 1.11.4, Virtanen et al., 2020). Tolerance was set to 𝑡𝑜𝑙=1𝑒−8 17 
with the maximum number of iterations set to 200. The optimization started with a random initialization 18 
for all parameters that were bounded to psychologically plausible ranges  (in logit space, 19 
𝐴:𝑝(win|coop)=(1.0,4.0),𝑝(win|hostile)=(−4.0,−1.0),𝑝(win|random)=20 
(−1.0,1.0);𝐵:𝑝(𝑐|𝑐)=(0.0,4.0),𝑝(ℎ|𝑐)=(−2.0,0.0),𝑝(𝑐|ℎ)=(−2.0,0.0),𝑝(ℎ|ℎ)=21 
(0.0,4.0),𝑝(𝑐|𝑟)=(−2.0,0.0),𝑝(ℎ|𝑟)=(−2.0,0.0);𝐶:𝑝(win)=(1.0,4.0),𝑝(loss)=22 
(−4.0,−1.0),𝑝(budget)=(−1.0,1.0),𝐷:𝑝(cooperative)=(−2.0,2.0),𝑝(hostile)=23 
(−2.0,2.0),𝑝(random)=(−2.0,2.0); 𝜀=(0.0,1.0)). Learning rates were kept constant across all 24 
optimization runs and equivalent to the simulation (Learning Rate 𝐿𝑅(𝐴)=0.1,𝐿𝑅(𝐵)=3.0,𝐿𝑅(𝐷)=25 
1.0). The constraints on the parameters set by the nature of the game were maintained in the optimization 26 
(constraints on 𝐴; a zero probability to obtaining a return on investment when the agent chooses to keep 27 
their budget; 𝑝(win|keep−budget)=0 etc). The optimization algorithm hence looked as follows:  28 
1. Read participant dataset 29 
2. Randomly initialize the required 14 parameters in logit space within pre-defined bounds 30 
3. Softmax logit parameters and initialize the agent model with parameters and participant data 31 
4. Compute the cost function  32 
5. Reiterate and restrict the search for new parameter values towards minimizing the cost function 33 
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until change in objective is below tolerance levels 34 
20 
 
The whole procedure was performed 10 times per participant to account for the stochastic variance in 2 
the minimization scheme , and the run with the lowest cost is chosen for each participant.  The 3 
optimization was performed at the Marburg High Performance Computing Cluster 3 (MarC3).  Results 4 
of the optimization were used to analyze group differences  in generative model parameters  between 5 
patients scoring low on the BDI (mild depressive symptoms) and patients scoring high on the BDI 6 
(moderate to severe depressive symptoms; median split and minimal/ maximum score split, defined by 7 
scores that lie one standard deviation above - or below sample median score ). We furthermore 8 
investigated potential parameter differences between individuals who played a hostile -to-cooperative 9 
game vs. a cooperative -to-hostile game. Finally, we  ran a series of simulations with the optimal 10 
parameters of the patients with the least- and most severe depressive symptomatology, respectively. For 11 
this, the parameters obtained from the optimization were inserted in the agent model  and twenty runs 12 
each of a cooperative-to-hostile and a hostile-to-cooperative game were simulated.  13

Results 2 
Simulations 3 
Healthy interpersonal inference. Figure 3 shows exemplary results of an agent with an  accurate-to-4 
optimistic generative model (“healthy” agent, appendix Figure 28 for results averaged over N=20 runs). 5 
When starting in a cooperative context (Figure 3A, blue area), some initial defects on the trustee’s side 6 
are processed adequately and the hostile context becomes more likely. During a long series of observing 7 
returns on their investment, the agent forms a precise posterior belief about being in a cooperative 8 
context (max. 𝑝(context=cooperative)=0.95). After the context switches to hostile , th is agent 9 
accurately infers to be in a hostile context (max. 𝑝(context=hostile=0.89). Any individual returns 10 
on their investment leads to a large posterior belief to be in a cooperative context again, which  is 11 
reminiscent of an optimism bias (Bracha & Brown, 2012; Sharot, 2011). After observing several defects, 12 
the agent adopts a more careful behavioral strategy and starts avoiding the investment . However, the 13 
agent’s strong preference for win outcomes (return on investment) and their epistemic drive leads to 14 
recurrent probing of the trustee.    15 
When faced with the negative context first, the agent forms precise posterior beliefs about being in a 16 
hostile context (max. 𝑝(context=hostile=0.96). Here, the agent starts to adopt an avoidant 17 
behavioral strategy after t=13 timesteps, during which 10 defects were observed. Note that the posterior 18 
belief 𝑝(context=hostile) becomes less certain with each “keep” action, resulting in a drive towards 19 
exploration. When the context switches to a cooperative one, the agent quickly returns to precise 20 
posterior beliefs about being in a cooperative context and interacting with the trustee.  21

A. The healthy agent (i.e., an agent with a n optimistic-to-accurate generative model of the task) playing the trust 4 
game, first in a cooperative context (blue background, epochs 0-20), followed by a hostile context (red background, 5 
epochs 20-39). After observing returns from the trustee  (blue triangle), the agent is confident that they are in a 6 
cooperative context. When the switch to a more hostile context happens, the agent’s posterior belief switches and 7 
they believe to be in a hostile context, but their behavioral strategy switches relatively late in the time series.  8 
B. Similar as A, but the game starts with a hostile context, followed by a cooperative one. While the agent quickly 9 
believes to be in a hostile context and starts to adapt their behavior accordingly, they continue to explore, which 10 
allows them to detect the switch to a more cooperative context after 20 timesteps.  11

Depression in our models results from a combination of processes, comprising pessimistic prior beliefs 2 
about context ( 𝐷), pessimistic beliefs about the future ( 𝐵), and decreased reward sensitivity ( 𝐶). We 3 
simulated two sub-types of depression, simulating perturbations in the generative model that are in line 4 
with the literature on depression.  5 
Depression: reward-insensitive and pessimistic. The first model of depression (reward-insensitive and 6 
pessimistic) holds a generative model which compared to healthy 1) assumes cooperative contexts to be 7 
more volatile compared to hostile contexts; 2) a relative insensitivity to rewards, and 3) a higher prior 8 
belief to be in a hostile context. When first observing the trustee return their investment, the agent does 9 
not accurately infer a cooperative context (max. 𝑝(context=cooperative)=0.68). In the example of 10 
Figure 4A-B (averaged results suppl. Figure 29), the agent experiences one defect at t=3, after which 11 
their posterior belief to be in a cooperative context approaches zero. Subsequently, observing a series of 12 
cooperative interactions, the agent infers a cooperative context with a maximum posterior probability of  13 
𝑝(context=cooperative)=0.51. Few further defects (a total of t=3 in the cooperative context) lead 14 
to the agent adopting a rigid avoidant strategy from t=17 onwards. The context switch from a cooperative 15 
to a hostile context is hence not represented in the agent’s posterior beliefs. When faced with a hostile 16 
context first  (4B), the agent ’s poster belief to be in a hostile context approaches  𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=17 
ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.96 here and they stop investing with the trustee, while continuing to probe their behavior. 18 
After the context switch, the agent adopts an avoidant strategy after observing another defect. Thereafter, 19 
the agent stops exploring their trustee’s behavior for the rest of the time series.  20 
Depression: fatalistic. An agent with more rigid, fatalistic beliefs about the evolution of hidden states 21 
over time and pessimistic prior beliefs is shown in Figure 5C-D (averaged results supplementary Figure 22 
30). When faced with the cooperative context first, the  fatalistic agent comes to the precise posterior 23 
belief to be in the cooperative context (max.  𝑝(context=cooperative)=0.9), and they continue to 24 
interact with the trustee. After observing defects in the hostile context, the agent increasingly avoids the 25 
interaction with the trustee . Their belief to be in a cooperative context drops close to 𝑝(context=26 
cooperative)≈0.05. When in the hostile context first, they accurately infer to be the context’s nature . 27 
However, the agent continues to explore the trustee’s behavior and correctly infers a cooperative context 28 
to be more likely after observing returns on their investment. 29

Figure 4. Simulation of depression, reward-insensitive and pessimistic.  3 
A The insensitive-pessimistic (Type 1 depression) agent cannot identify the cooperative nature of the context as 4 
clearly as the healthy agent in Fig. 2.  Individual defects by the trustee cause spikes in the posterior belief to be in 5 
a hostile context. The agent here furthermore avoids the interaction before the context switch , and this behavioral 6 
strategy remains rigid for the rest of the time series.  7 
B When starting in a hostile context, the agent makes a few negative experience when investing with the trustee 8 
and as a consequence their posterior belief to be in a hostile context approaches p(context=hostile)=0.95. The agent 9 
shows a mixture of continued exploration of the trustee behavior and avoidance during the hostile context. After 10 
the context switches, rigid avoidance behavior is adopted after an individual defect by the trustee.  11

Figure 5. Simulation of depression, fatalistic. 
A shows the fatalistic agent  in a cooperative, then hostile context. During multiple cooperative interactions, the 3 
agent’s belief to being in a cooperative context p(context=cooperative) accumulates in line with observing returns 4 
of their investment. Upon transitioning into a hostile context, the agent’s beliefs rapidly shift to favor the hostile 5 
state. 6 
B The fatalistic agent, when first exposed to a hostile context, correctly infers its nature  and begins to avoid 7 
investing with the trustee. However, due to continued exploration, the agent registers the context switch. Individual 8 
defects in the cooperative context influence the agent’s posterior beliefs drastically compared to the healthy -to-9 
optimistic agent (Fig. 2)  10

Socially anxious interpersonal inference. The generative model s of the socially anxious agent s are 2 
characterized by  more ambiguous observation models  (𝐴), fatalistic beliefs in the dynamics of the 3 
context over time (𝐵), heightened loss aversion (𝐶), and/ or more pessimistic prior beliefs (𝐷) compared 4 
to healthy interpersonal inference. 5 
Social anxiety: insecure-avoidant (Type 1). Figure 6A-B shows the behavior of the insecure-avoidant 6 
social anxiety  agent in the trust game  (averaged results supplementary Figure 31). This agent ’s 7 
observational model is marked by a more ambiguous mapping between observations and the 8 
corresponding context (𝐴). The agent further believes that the context dynamics will develop towards 9 
random or unpredictable contexts ( 𝐵) and an increased focus on loss avoidance  (𝐶). A random and a 10 
positive context are believed to be more likely a-priori than a hostile context (𝐷). When first immersed 11 
in a cooperative context , the agent infers the random context to be the most likely cause of observing 12 
returns of investment (Figure 6A). When first exposed to the hostile context , the random- or hostile 13 
context are assumed to be the most likely cause of observing defects  (Figure 6B). The agent quickly 14 
retreats to an avoidant behavioral strategy. 15 
Social anxiety: trauma-and-defeat (Type 2). This agent is characterized by an ambiguous observation 16 
model (𝐴) and the belief that cooperative contexts are volatile than hostile or random contexts, which 17 
are assumed to be more stable (𝐵). The agent is further characterized by reward insensitivity (𝐶) and a 18 
increased prior belief to be in a hostile interpersonal context (𝐷) compared to the healthy-to-optimistic 19 
agent. This agent infers a hostile context to be the most likely when in a cooperative context first (Figure 20 
7A, averages appendix Figure 32). The agent does not deviate much from their high prior belief to be 21 
in a hostile context, despite observing a series of returns of their investment. Observing one defect in 22 
the cooperative phase leads the agent to adopt avoidance behaviors that are maintained until the end of 23 
the game. When in a hostile context first  (Figure 7B), the agent continues to believe to be in a hostile 24 
context and avoids investing with the trustee after observing a few defects for the rest of the time series.  25

Figure 6.  Social anxiety, insecure-avoidant 
A shows a socially anxious agent in a cooperative context, followed by a  switch hostile context. The agent infers 3 
a random context to be the most likely cause of observing returns of their investment. After the context switches, 4 
a hostile context is inferred as more likely than a random context and an avoidant behavioral strategy is adopted 5 
until the end of the game.  6 
B Similarly, when first immersed in a hostile context, the agent first infers a random- or hostile context to be the 7 
most likely causes of observing defects. After observing defects for t=3 out of t=4 timesteps, the agent avoids any 8 
investment with the trustee for the rest of the game.  9

Figure 7. Social anxiety, trauma and defeat. 
A the socially anxious (trauma and defeat) agent starts in a cooperative context, followed by a hostile context. The 2 
agent holds a relatively strong belief to be in a hostile context, but starts probing the trustee’s behavior. Observing 3 
a series of t=12 returns of their investment does not change the agent’s belief to be in a hostile context. One defect 4 
after a long series of returns of investment leads to the agent adopting a rigid avoidant strategy.  5 
B When starting in a hostile context, the agent observes few defects and adopts an avoidant behavioral strategy for 6 
the rest of the game. 7

Figure 8. Absolute earned rewards per agent type 
A shows average absolute earned rewards (i.e., 50% of the initial investment multiplied by factor 1.5; with standard 4 
deviation) per agent type over N=20 simulations of T=40 timesteps, starting with the cooperative context, then 5 
switching to the hostile context at t=20. Bars represent standard deviations.  6

Average reward statistics 10 
We computed the average earned reward , total number of wins and net wins (wins  - losses) per agent 11 
type in N=20 simulations of T=40 timesteps, where the agents first observed t=20 timesteps of 12 
cooperative behavior followed by t=20 timesteps of hostile behavior, or vice versa ( Figure 8). In a 13 
cooperative-to-hostile game, the maximum average reward is earned by the Type 2 - fatalistic depressed 14 
agent (mean reward: 31.82). Underlying this result is the quick switch to a more avoidant strategy when 15 
the context becomes hostile after the first twenty time steps. The least reward is earned by the Type 2 – 16 
trauma and defeat social phobia agent (mean reward = 24.2) as a result of rigid avoidance behaviors. In 17 
a hostile-to-cooperative game, reward is maximized by the healthy agent (mean reward = 29.42). The 18 
Type 1 – insensitive and pessimistic depressed agent received the lowest reward in this setting (mean 19 
reward = 18.47). We further investigate average rewards outcome of the healthy -to-optimistic agent 20 
compared to the depressed and socially anxious agents in a longer time series ( T=120 with 12 context 21 
changes; see supplementary Figure 33 for details). In a longer series (T=120) with more volatile context 22 
dynamics, the healthy agent outearns the depressed- and socially anxious agents (Figure 35). 23 
The healthy-to-optimistic agent further observes the highest overall number of win outcomes in both the 24 
cooperative-to-hostile game ( average total wins = 19.5; Figure 9A) and in the hostile -to-cooperative 25 
  
30 
 
game (average total wins = 16.5; Figure 9B). The least absolute number of wins is observed by the Type 2 
2 – trauma and defeat social phobia agent in both settings  (cooperative-to-hostile: 5.9 average total 3 
wins; hostile-to-cooperative: 0.4). Average net wins (i.e., absolute number of wins – absolute number of 4 
losses) in a cooperative -to-hostile context are maximized by the Type 1 – insensitive and pessimistic 5 
depressed agent (average net wins: 8.64) as a function of their lowered threshold to avoid investing with 6 
the trustee compared to the healthy agent (average net wins: 1.5). The Type 1 - depressed agent however 7 
also observes the worst win-to-loss ratio in a hostile-to-cooperative game (average net wins = -5.2). The 8 
healthy agent observes the most favorable win-to-loss ratio in the hostile-to-cooperative game (average 9 
net wins = -0.65).  10

Model fitting. 2 
Behavioral data. We collected data from N=23 participants with diagnosed depressive disorder, seeking 3 
treatment in a local outpatient setting, who played a 60-trial version of the trust game. Participants were 4 
randomly assigned to one of three game conditions which differed in the sequence of hidden contexts: 5 
a hostile-to-cooperative game (N=7), a cooperative-to-hostile game ( N=10; cmp. simulations) and an 6 
ambiguous/ random game (N=8). Exemplary data of four participants is shown in Figure 11, showing a 7 
range of different behavioral strategies in a hostile-to-cooperative game (A-B) and in a cooperative-to-8 
hostile scenario (C-D).  9 
On average, participants earned 39.97€ (standard deviation (SD): 5.84, range: min. 29.5 – max. 46.5) in 10 
rewards, of which 50% was paid out to them in €. On average, participants observed 20.58 returns upon 11 
investing with the trustee across all conditions (SD: 8.91, range: min. 0 – max. 30) and experienced -12 
0.64 net wins (i.e., number of wins – number of losses; SD: 3.88, range: min. -9, max. 6, see also Figure 13 
12).  Median BDI score in our sample was 𝑀𝐵𝐷𝐼 =22.0 (Mean: 24.28, standard deviation: 11.34, range: 14 
7-50; for distribution see supplementary Figure 36).   15

Figure 11. Examples of participants with depressive disorder playing the trust game. 
Four example participants playing a 60 -trial trust game, either a hostile-to-cooperative game ( A-B) or a 3 
cooperative-to-hostile game ( C-D). The black step line represents the participant’s behavior (0= keep initial 4 
budget, 1=invest with trustee). The trustee’s response is scattered in the plot (blue star = trustee returned 5 
investment, red cross = trustee defect).  Note that if the agent does not invest, the trustee’s decision to return or 6 
defect is not observed by the agent, but plotted here for completeness. The background color indicates the current 7 
game context (red= hostile, blue= cooperative).   8 
A. The participant alternates flexibly between investing and keeping their budget in the first phase of the game; 9 
however, the participant keeps their budget for a long period during and after the context switches to a cooperative 10 
context. B. The participant alternates quickly between behavioral responses. C. During the cooperative context, 11 
the participant invests their budget, whereas after the switch to a hostile context, the participant begins to keep 12 
their budget. D. After two investments, the participant decided to keep their budget for the rest of the game.   13

of evaluations of the objective functions and its Jacobian and Hessian matrix were 3761.608 4

For each participant , we obtained 15 parameters that best described their observable behavior in the 11 
game. For the observation model 𝐴, three parameter values needed to be optimized 12 
(𝑝(win|cooperative),𝑝(win|hostile),𝑝(win|random)). Results are shown in Figure 14. Participants’ 13 
behavior suggests that they correctly inferred a higher probability of observing a return on investment 14 
(win) in the cooperative context (average 𝑝(win|cooperative)=0.802) compared to the hostile  15 
(𝑝(win|hostile)=0.052) or random contexts (𝑝(win|random)=0.147). The parameters did not differ 16 
significantly between individuals with low - and high symptom severity ( Figure 14A). Analyzed 17 
separately for the three different game conditions (cooperative -to-hostile, hostile-to-cooperative and 18 
ambiguous, Figure 14B), the highest 𝑝(win|cooperative) can be observed for the cooperative -to-19 
hostile game. 𝑝(win|random) tended to be highest for individuals playing an ambiguous game.   20 
The average optimal transition dynamics 𝐵 for all participants is shown in Figure 15. Participants’ 21 
behavior was most consistent with the belief that hostile contexts remain stable over time ( 𝑝(ℎ|ℎ)=22 
0.495, Figure 15A), but also cooperative contexts are assumed to be more stable  (𝑝(𝑐|𝑐)=0.393). 23 
Furthermore, results indicate that on average, participants believed the hostile context would develop 24 

36 
 
into a random one  (𝑝(𝑟|ℎ)=0.431). Considering individuals with low vs. high symptom severity 2 
separately (Figure 15B), results suggest that individuals with high symptom severity tend to assume the 3 
cooperative context to be more stable (High severity: 𝑝(𝑐|𝑐)=0.403, Low severity: 𝑝(𝑐|𝑐)=0.384), 4 
and the hostile context to be less stable ( High severity: 𝑝(ℎ|ℎ)=0.481, low severity: 𝑝(ℎ|ℎ)=0.511). 5 
The behavior of patients with more severe symptom strength was furthermore consistent with a slightly 6 
increased belief that a cooperative context will transition into a hostile one (high severity: 𝑝(ℎ|𝑐)=0.294, 7 
low severity: 𝑝(ℎ|𝑐)=0.268) compared to participants with less severe symptoms. 8

Optimized prior preferences, or utility, of the different outcomes, governed by 𝐶, are shown in Figure 5 
16. Differences in preferences for the three outcomes of the game (return on investment, defect and loss, 6 
and keep initial budget) between patients with low vs. high symptom severity (as assessed by the BDI) 7 
are shown in Figure 16A. There is no clear distinction in the mean parameter values between individuals 8 
with high - vs. low symptom severity  (Low symptom severity: 𝑝(win)=0.810,𝑝(loss)=9 
0.048,𝑝(budget)=0.142; high symptom severity: 𝑝(win)=0.795,𝑝(loss)=0.055,𝑝(budget)=10 
0.149). This pattern is strengthened when considering individuals with minimum and maximum BDI 11 
scores separately ( Figure 16B). The effect of the game sequence on 𝐶 are shown in  Figure 16C. 12 
Individuals in the ambiguous game assign lowest utility to observing a return on investment, and highest 13 
to keeping their budget. The cooperative-to-hostile game participants assigned the largest utility to the 14 
return on investment (Ambiguous: 𝑝(win)=0.479,𝑝(budget)=0.479, hostile -to-cooperative: 15 
𝑝(win)=0.510,𝑝(loss)=0.046, cooperative -to-hostile: 𝑝(win)=0.524,𝑝(loss)=0.042). For 16 
violin distribution plots of 𝐶 across participants, see supplementary Figure 37.  17

The average optimal prior over context ( 𝐷) is shown in  Figure 17 (for distribution plots, see 2 
supplementary Figure 38). Individuals with lower symptom severity show a slightly decreased prior 3 
belief to be in a cooperative context, and an increased prior on the hostile context compared to patients 4 
with more severe depressive symptoms ( low symptom severity: 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)=5 
0.298,𝑝(ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.387; higher symptom severity: 𝑝(cooperative)=0.355,𝑝(ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=6 
0.320, Figure 17A). The pattern is similar when considering individuals with minimal and maximum 7 
BDI scores separately (Figure 17B). Furthermore, in a hostile-to-cooperative game, results suggest an 8 
increased prior on the hostile context and a decreased prior belief in a cooperative context compared to 9 
the cooperative -to-hostile or ambiguous game ( hostile-to-cooperative game: 𝑝(coop.)=10 
0.285,𝑝(hostile)=0.412,𝑝(random)=0.304; cooperative-to-hostile game: 𝑝(coop.)=11 
0.321,𝑝(hostile)=0.346,𝑝(random)=0.332; ambiguous game: 𝑝(coop.)=0.362,𝑝(hostile)=12 
0.316,𝑝(random)=0.321,𝐅𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝟏𝟕C).  13 
Interindividual differences in 𝜀 indicate that most participants were strongly reward -driven, with an 𝜀 14 
approximating zero (n=20 participants, Figure 18). Two participants’ behavior was best described by 15 
stronger weighting of information over hedonic reward (n=2 participants), while n=3 participants 16 
showed a more nuanced weighting between hedonistic and epistemic drives. There were no differences 17 
in the distribution of 𝜀 between individuals with mild vs. moderate to severe symptoms. 18 
Finally, we inserted the optimized parameters of two patients, representing the low - and high levels of 19 
depressive symptomatology, into the generative model and simulated twenty games with these 20 
parameters. Results are shown in Figure 19. The simulations with parameters derived from the patient 21 
with milder depression (patient md, subsequently) is shown in Figure 19A (BDI score = 11). Compared 22 
to the more severely depressed (patient sd) patient (BDI score =50, Figure 19B), patient md forms 23 
stronger posterior beliefs to be in a cooperative context in the initial cooperative phase. In contrast, 24 
patient sd forms stronger beliefs to be in a hostile context in the second phase of the game.  25

Discussion 2 
In this study, we repor t a series of simulations in which an artificial agent engages in a classical trust 3 
game and fit this model to behavioral data from outpatients with depression playing the game . Using 4 
Active Inference, the agents infer the interpersonal context from the trustee’s behavior. We developed 5 
agents in which several biases  are combined  to simulate depression and social anxiety  and finally 6 
inverted the model onto behavioral data of patients to retrieve individually optimal parameters of the 7 
generative model.  8 
In simulations, we demonstrate d how the combination of different parameter perturbations may 9 
approximate behavioral strategies of individuals with social anxiety disorder and depression. Depression 10 
here resulted from the  combination of outcome devaluation and pessimistic prior beliefs ( reward-11 
insensitive and pessimistic ), or rigid beliefs about context dynamics in combination with pessimistic 12 
priors (fatalistic). Social anxiety disorder resulted from an increased risk aversion in combination with 13 
a high prior belief to be in a random, unpredictable interpersonal context  (insecure-avoidant) or an 14 
increased loss avoidance in combination with pessimistic prior- and state transition beliefs (trauma-and-15 
defeat).   16 
Pessimistic priors and fatalistic beliefs about the temporal dynamics of hidden states were at the core of 17 
the depressed agents’ generative models. In line with this, individuals with depression show a variety of 18 
pessimistic interpretation biases (Everaert et al., 2017) , pessimistic tendencies such as learned 19 
helplessness and low self-efficacy (Seligman, 1972) and potentially a lack of interpersonal skills (Segrin, 20 
2000). A lack of reward valuation and pessimistic prior beliefs may also relate to a reduced motivation 21 
to engage with their environment in patients (Fernández-Theoduloz et al., 2019). In the trust game, the 22 
depressed agents earned significantly less compared to healthy agents during a hostile-to-cooperative 23 
series. However, the depressed agents outcompete the healthy agent in a cooperative-to-hostile series. 24 
Here, the depressed agents switch to an avoidant behavioral strategy soon after the context switch. The 25 
healthy agent’s optimistic beliefs about their environment and their strong motivation to win a joint 26 
reward keeps them from adopting an avoidant strategy, even after observing a series of defects. In the 27 
trust game, avoiding the trustee’s decision is an intelligent strategy in a hostile context. However, this 28 
strategy comes at the expense of potentially missing a switch to a cooperative context, explaining why 29 
the depressed agents earn significantly less compared to the healthy agent in the hostile-to-cooperative 30 
series. Our simulation supports the idea that in some environments, depression may be an adaptive 31 
response that protects the individual from exploitation (Prins et al., 2015) . However, the optimistic 32 
(healthy) agent is best equipped to flexibly navigate dynamically changing contexts over longer time 33 
periods, as indicated by a simulation with more volatile context dynamics (appendix 2). Meanwhile, 34 
individuals with depression or anxiety may show less flexible behavior as a consequence of e.g. learned 35 
helplessness (Seligman, 1972) , aberrant reward processing (Lewinsohn, 1974)  or cognitive 36 
immunization (Rief & Joormann, 2019) . Further, some research suggests that individuals with 37 
44 
 
depression show a more realistic interpretation of action-outcome contingencies (depressive realism, 2 
Dunning & Story, 1991; Moore & Fresco, 2012) . In line with this, the depressed agent s adapt their 3 
posterior beliefs over contexts more quickly and accurately and their behavioral strategy switched 4 
quicker in hostile contexts, compared to the more optimistic agent in our simulation. 5 
Depressive symptoms often manifest episodically, with patients experiencing alternating phases of 6 
severe and relatively mild symptoms . In Active Inference, episodic courses may be a function of the 7 
transition model (or 𝐵 matrix). If individuals believe for example that both hostile and cooperative 8 
contexts are relatively stable, then a few negative interpersonal triggers may be sufficient for the agent 9 
to infer a stable, hostile state, which can be updated through repeated exposure to positive interpersonal 10 
exchanges.  11 
The “socially anxious” agents focused on risk aversion and showed increased avoidance behaviors. 12 
Avoidance is a defining feature of social anxiety disorder (Bögels & Mansell, 2004) , which could be 13 
mediated through the combination of loss aversion and pessimistic prior beliefs in Active Inference. The 14 
distinction between the two subtypes of social anxiety disorder lies in their prior beliefs about initial 15 
states, the temporal dynamics of these states, and the degree to which they are motivated to achieve a 16 
positive outcome (i.e., observing a successful collaboration vs. keeping the initial budget and not taking 17 
the risk ). The avoidance behavior of the  insecure-avoidant socially anxious agent is driven by the 18 
insecure belief that the environment is random  and unpredictable. In contrast, t he trauma-and-defeat 19 
agent avoids collaborating with the trustee because they hold strong beliefs to be in a hostile 20 
environment. The two agents are similar with respect to their behavioral strategies and earned rewards, 21 
but the differences in model perturbations may be of crucial importance during treatment. It can be 22 
conjectured that cognitive restructuring and social competences training may be the most beneficial to  23 
insecure-avoidant agents, while, for example, interpersonal trauma may need addressing in trauma-and-24 
defeat-type patients first.  25 
In the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiToP, Kotov et al., 2018), social anxiety disorder 26 
and depression are part of the internalizing spectrum, but while social anxiety disorder loads on the 27 
“fear” subfactor, depression loads on the “distress” subfactor. In terms of computational transdiagnostic 28 
processes, this difference may lie in the preference over outcomes, or the 𝐶 vector. In one of our models 29 
for depression ( reward-insensitive and pessimistic ), social anhedonia is modelled via  a reduced 30 
preference for positive social rewards. Social anxiety disorder, in contrast, is a function of high levels 31 
of risk avoidance, where a disproportionately large weight is placed on risk and loss avoidance. 32 
Fitting our model to the  behavioral data of patients with diagnosed depressive disorder of varying 33 
symptom severity yielded optimal values for all parameters of the generative model 𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷 and 34 
weighting parameter  𝜀. We considered the resulting generative model parameters separately for 35 
individuals with high- and low symptom severity and the game sequence they played. Both symptom 36 
severity and game sequence affected the parameters of the generative model in a subtle way. The 37 
45 
 
observation model 𝐴 did not differ between individuals with low vs. high symptom severity, indicating 2 
that both groups did not differ in their ability to relate a specific outcome to the corresponding context. 3 
The transition dynamics 𝐵 differed very subtly. More severe symptoms were associated with an 4 
increased belief in the stability of the cooperative context, and less stability of the hostile context. 5 
Furthermore, higher symptom severity was associated with a slightly increased belief of transitioning 6 
into a hostile context when the current context was cooperative, and a decreased belief in a transition 7 
from a hostile into a cooperative context. Outcome preferences 𝐶 did not differ between median -split 8 
patient groups. When considering individuals with minimum- and maximum symptom severity, a slight 9 
tendency emerged, suggesting higher symptom severity is associated with lower utility assigned to the 10 
social reward (return on investment), slightly more risk aversion, and higher preference for keeping their 11 
budget compared to individuals with milder symptoms. Counter -intuitively, more severe depressive 12 
symptoms were associated with a heightened prior belief (𝐷) to be in a cooperative context, and a lower 13 
belief to be in a hostile context. Finally, weighting parameter 𝜀 was introduced to govern the weighting 14 
of epistemic vs. hedonic drives in the generative model. While 𝜀 differed inter-individually, this variance 15 
was not related to symptom severity.  16 
When equipping the agent -model with the optimized parameters derived from patient data, we could 17 
simulate the patient’s behavior over several games. We identified idiosyncrasies in the patient’s 18 
respective decision-making, with mildly depressed patients forming more precise posterior beliefs over 19 
the cooperative context, whereas more severely depressed individuals formed higher posterior beliefs 20 
over the hostile context. Our approach demonstrates that data -inspired agent models can be useful in 21 
simulating patient behavior efficiently for a large number of games and different contexts.  22 
Limitations and future research 23 
The model presented here provides starting points for explaining heterogeneity in social experience and 24 
behavior among individuals with mental health problems. For the simulations , the parameter 25 
specifications were chosen so that they align with the literature, but are ultimately based on theoretical 26 
considerations. By fitting the model to behavioral data of patients with depression, we show that 27 
parameter distributions can slightly differ between individuals with low- vs. high symptom severity. Of 28 
note, these results need to be interpreted with caution. An important goal of the optimization procedure 29 
was to demonstrate its feasibility in the context of relatively sparse behavioral data and complex 30 
generative models such as POMDPs. We cannot yet determine if these changes in model parameters are 31 
unique to depression or similar to those in, e.g., social anxiety , and whether they can account for 32 
substantial variance when comparing clinical with non -clinical samples . More data from diverse 33 
diagnostic categories (ICD -10 social anxiety, depression) or symptom spectra (HiTOP internalizing 34 
spectrum, subfactors fear vs. distress) is required to draw conclusions about the specificity of parameter 35 
changes. A limitation is the relatively small sample size, and the lack of a non-clinical control group in 36 
the dataset used for model fitting. Future work should aim at collecting data from both diagnosed- and 37 
46 
 
undiagnosed individuals to represent the entire spectrum from mental well-being- to disorder. On the 2 
other hand, heterogeneity in model parameters emerged despite the lack of a non-clinical control group, 3 
and the boundaries between non-clinical sadness in the general population and depressive disorders are 4 
fluent (Tebeka et al., 2021). 5 
Of note, finding clear and distinct computational phenotypes within a diagnostic category has proven to 6 
be extremely challenging (Karvelis et al., 2023 ; Robson et al., 2020) . The test-retest reliability of the 7 
generative model parameters identified in this task is rather unclear. We nonetheless argue that there is 8 
value in understanding how changes to the parameters of a generative model  influence behavior to 9 
inform etiological concepts, instead of basing computational phenotypes on nosological categories. In 10 
case transdiagnostic affiliations can be derived from computational models of behavior, there is still 11 
very limited research into the reliability and validity of computational markers. A recent meta-analysis 12 
suggests that cognitive tasks and computational markers derived from task behavior shows relatively 13 
poor psychometric properties (Karvelis et al., 2023) . Longitudinal task batteries may be  necessary to 14 
equip researchers with the data to disentangle measurement errors, practice effects and state- and trait-15 
like changes in behavior. Further empirical validations of our model may need to consider multiple 16 
experiments of interpersonal behavior in tasks with varying degrees of similarity.  17 
Conclusion 18 
We simulated complex interpersonal experiences and behaviors in mental disorders as Active Inference 19 
of interpersonal context within a neuroeconomic game. We fit our agent model on behavioral data of 20 
participants with diagnosed depressive disorders  of varying severity. Our model allows for the 21 
simulation of complex interpersonal experiences and behaviors, and enables the operationalization of 22 
transdiagnostic and disorder -relevant processes, as well as heterogeneity in social functioning across 23 
individuals. Fitting the model to behavioral data can provide more mechanistic insights into biased 24 
expectations and assumptions in clinical populations, with implications for personalized diagnosis and 25 
treatment. 26 
Our simulations yield three fundamental insight s: (1) different generative models of the environment 27 
can result in similar interpersonal strategies, (2) avoidant interpersonal behavior s are adaptive  and 28 
functionally sensible in exploitative environments  and (3) exploration, which appears to be a crucial 29 
characteristic of healthy interpersonal behavior, can lead to losses in some environments; however, on 30 
average, it produces the most robust outcome rates in dynamically changing environments. Developing 31 
computational phenotypes based on observable behaviors is an important cornerstone of personalized 32 
diagnostics and tailored interventions.  By fitting our model to the behavioral data of patients, we can 33 
obtain approximations to the computations underlying patient’s behavioral strategies.  Neuroeconomic 34 
games offer a relatively naturalistic, yet well-controlled experimental framework. Future research needs 35 
to further provide empirical validation of these ideas, ideally within longitudinal, multi-task studies.  36

Appendix 2 
1. Simulations: Transdiagnostic Processes 3 
In a supplementary series of simulations, the individual parameters of the agent’s generative model 4 
(Figure 2) are perturbed in isolation. With this, we aim to simulate clinically relevant parameter regimes 5 
of the inferential process, specifically observational uncertainty (𝐴), fatalistic expectations (𝐵), 6 
heightened loss aversion (𝐶), and pessimistic priors (𝐷).  7 
Observational uncertainty (𝐴). An inaccuracy in the agent’s 𝐴 matrix corresponds to an inability to 8 
“connect the dots” between the trustee’s behavior and the hidden state. While a healthy agent confidently 9 
expects a positive outcome, or win, in a cooperative context, perturbations in the observation model 10 
could lead to e.g., a positive interaction being connected to a hostile context. We hence perturbed 𝐴 so 11 
that (simplified) 12

 13 
Now, the agent’s uncertainty when mapping observations to hidden states is very high. A cooperative 14 
response by their trustee is related to the cooperative context with 𝑝=0.5, but also to the hostile context 15 
with 𝑝=0.5. In clinical psychology, this may relate to perceptual disturbances (Horga & Abi-Dargham, 16 
2019) or “cognitive immunization” (Panitz et al., 2021; Rief et al., 2022), where alternative explanations 17 
are found for interpersonal experiences that violate the patient’s beliefs about their social surroundings 18 
(e.g., “He was nice to me because he thinks that I am a pathetic l oser.”). It may further relate to a lack 19 
of social and emotional skills. In this simulation (observational uncertainty (𝐴)), we further set the prior 20 
over hidden states to be maximally uninformative (𝐷:𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=𝑦)=0.333 per context).  21 
Fatalistic expectations (𝐵). For the next simulation, fatalistic expectations (𝐵), the generative model is 22 
manipulated such that  23 
𝐵= (

 24 
Now, the agent believes the cooperative state to be less stable over time 25 
(𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑡|𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑡−1 =0.5). Instead, the hostile state has increased in stability 26 
(p(hostile|hostile) = 0.9). This could translate to  an interpersonal pessimism bias, which is frequently 27 
observed in patients with depression (Liu et al., 2015; Niu et al., 2022; Panitz et al., 2021). Good things 28 
are believed to be futile, whereas negative or uncomfortable situations are assumed to be more stable, 29 
as e.g. suggested by research into low self -efficacy or learned helplessness (Maier & Seligman, 2016) 30 
or biased expectations in depression (Gamble et al., 2019; Lüdtke & Westermann, 2023). Deviations in 31 
55 
 
𝐵 may further be related to aberrant beliefs about the dynamics of interpersonal situations (Nestor et al., 2 
2022). 3 
Heightened loss aversion (𝐶). The 𝐶 vector determines the agent’s preferred observations by placing a 4 
high prior probability over desired outcomes and a low prior probability over undesirable ones. For the 5 
simulation heightened loss aversion (𝐶), the preferences over outcomes are set to  6 
𝐶=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(

) 7 
An excessive negative weight is placed on losses, compared to a relatively low preference given to the 8 
“win” outcome. An agent with such outcome preferences shows inappropriate loss aversion, which may 9 
prematurely tip the exploration -exploitation balance towards missing out on valuable epistemic 10 
information to avoid a loss. These parameter settings may approximate rejection sensitivity (Gao et al., 11 
2017) and risk aversion (Hartley & Phelps, 2012). The agent was further equipped with uncertain, i.e., 12 
equiprobable prior beliefs over hidden states (𝐷). 13 
Pessimistic priors (𝐷). In a final simulation ( pessimistic priors (𝐷)), we manipulated the 𝐷 matrix, or 14 
prior over hidden states so that  15 
𝐷=(

 16 
Here, the agent believes the cooperative context to be highly unlikely, whereas the negative or random 17 
contexts are assumed to be more likely. Perturbing the 𝐷 matrix may formalize transdiagnostic processes 18 
such as interpersonal distrust (Poggi et al., 2019) or interpersonal trauma (Mauritz et al., 2013), leading 19 
to pessimistic interpersonal prior beliefs. For an overview of all transdiagnostic generative models, see 20

Table 2. Overview of parameter settings for the simulation of transdiagnostic processes.  
In bold font are all parameters that were changed compared to the “healthy” agent (top row, for 2 
comparison).  3 
 
1.1 Results: parameter-based simulations.  4 
Observational uncertainty (𝐴). When introducing an uninformative distribution as the 𝐴 parameter of 5 
the generative model as a proxy for high inferential uncertainty, the agent is unable to form precise 6 
posterior beliefs about any specific context (Figure 20A; averaged: Figure 24). Their posterior beliefs 7 
deviate only slightly from the uninformative prior as a consequence of the agent’s inability to connect a 8 
specific observation to a context. Any slight deviations from the prior can be attributed to the remaining 9 
parameters of the generative model ( 𝐵,𝐶,𝐷) which are equivalent to the healthy -to-optimistic agent. 10 
The switch to a more hostile context after t=20 leads to a slight decrease in P(context=cooperative), and 11 
an increase in p(context=random), but no change in the agent’s observable behavior. When starting in a 12 
hostile context (Figure 20B), the agent’s beliefs to be in a hostile context similarly do not deviate much 13 
from the uninformative prior  (max. 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.33). Shortly before the context 14 
switches, the agent shows rigid avoidance behavior despite their imprecise posterior beliefs. Because of 15 
this, the agent does not register the context switch from epoch 20 onwards.  16

Figure 20. Observational uncertainty (𝑨 parameter)  
A. An agent with a biased 𝐴 parameter forms only imprecise posterior beliefs about being in any specific 3 
context, compared to an agent with a more accurate generative model (comp. Fig. 2). Negative 4 
experiences have a relatively smaller weight to alter the posterior belief compared to a healthy agent. 5 
The context switch is barely reflected in the agent’s posterior beliefs about context.  6 
B. In a hostile context, the agent’s posterior belief to be in a hostile context does not deviate much from 7 
the uninformative prior p(context=hostile)=0.33. However, the agent here avoids interacting with the 8 
trustee after 13 timesteps. 9

Figure 21.  Fatalistic expectations (𝑩 parameter) simulations. 
A. In a cooperative context, the agent with fatalistic expectations (biased 𝐵 parameter) shows a relatively 3 
strong posterior belief to be in a hostile context after observing some interspersed defects. The switch 4 
to the hostile context after t=20 timesteps is reflected in the agent’s posterior beliefs, but this belief does 5 
not lead to an avoidant behavioral strategy.  6 
B. In the negative context, precise posteriors are formed over the hostile context. While the agent refrains 7 
from investing their budget with the trustee after observing a series of defects, they continue to probe 8 
the trustee’s behavior. The switch to a more cooperative context leads to alternating spikes in the beliefs 9 
to be in a cooperative- or hostile context.10 
 
 
59 
 
Fatalistic expectations (𝐵). Results from an agent with fatalistic expectations, i.e., a perturbed 𝐵 2 
parameter, are shown in Figure 21A,B (averages in Figure 25). When starting in a cooperative context 3 
(Figure 21A), the agent’s posterior belief to be in a cooperative context form slowly  compared to the 4 
healthy-to-optimistic agent.  Individual defects by the trustee impact the agent’s beliefs much more 5 
strongly than longer series of cooperative observations  (e.g. defect in t=4, t3 6 
p(context=cooperative)=.78; t4 p(context=cooperative)=.04) . The agent is more uncertain about the 7 
context compared to the healthy agent, even after observing a longer series of cooperative actions (max. 8 
𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)=0.81). When the context switches, this is reflected in the agent’s 9 
posterior beliefs (max. 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.83). However, this belief is not reflected in a more 10 
avoidant behavioral strategy . This lack of behavioral adaptation can be attributed to the intact 𝐶 11 
parameter, which assigns a high utility to observing the “win” outcome . When first seeing a hostile 12 
context (Figure 21B), the agent accurately believes to be in a hostile context (max.  𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=13 
ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.94), and starts avoiding the transaction  with the trustee.  Nevertheless, they continue to 14 
probe the trustee’s behavior, which is why the context switch at t=20 is registered . However, the agent 15 
subsequently is unable to form precise posterior beliefs about any particular context, with max. 16 
𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)=0.81.  17 
Heightened loss aversion (𝐶). Figure 22A-B illustrate results from an agent with a biased preference 18 
over outcomes compared to the healthy agent, the transdiagnostic process of heightened loss aversion 19 
(averaged results Figure 26). When starting in a cooperative context, the agent accurately infers its 20 
nature and continues investing with the trustee. After the context switches in t=20, observing the trustee 21 
defecting leads to large updates in the agent’s posterior beliefs and the agent begins to avoid interacting 22 
with the trustee. In a hostile-first game (Figure 22B), the agent quickly infers to be in a hostile context 23 
and flexibly avoids interacting with the trustee. After the context switches, the agent observes one defect 24 
and adopts a rigid behavioral strategy that lasts until the end of the game. 25 
Pessimistic priors (𝐷). An agent with pessimistic priors, i.e., a biased 𝐷 parameter, is shown in Figure 26 
23(averaged results, see appendix  Figure 27). Upon observing a series of returns of their investment, 27 
the agent quickly forms an accurate belief to be in a cooperative contex t (max. 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=28 
𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)=0.94, Figure 23A). The context switch at t=20 towards a hostile context is reflected 29 
in the agent’s beliefs  (max. 𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.90), but this does not lead to avoidance 30 
behaviors. In the hostile -to-cooperative game (Figure 23B), precise beliefs about being in a hostile 31 
context are formed (𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡=ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒)=0.90) and the agent flexibly avoids interacting with the 32 
trustee. However, the agent’s pessimistic priors are updated and eventually overridden after observing 33 
more returns on their investment after the context switch. Since the transition parameter 𝐵 is equivalent 34 
to the healthy agent’s parameter, the Markov chain of latent states would converge to the “healthy” 35 
steady state even without observations.  36 
60

Figure 22. Heightened loss aversion (𝑪 parameter)  
A The agent with a simulated heightened loss aversion ( 𝐶) forms precise beliefs about being in a 3 
cooperative context at first, but the agent’s belief is strongly impacted by observing few defects 4 
interspersed within a majority of returns on investment (e.g. t=8: p(context|cooperative)=0.97, after one 5 
defect in t=9: p(context|cooperative)=0.28). The agent’s belief to be in a cooperative context changes 6 
slowly after the context switch at t=20, with some avoidant behaviors emerging from t=29 onwards.  7 
B. When starting in a hostile context, the agent forms a precise belief to be in a hostile context and 8 
avoids the transaction with the trustee while continuing to probe the trustee’s behavior. After the context 9 
switches, one defect in t=23 is observed, after which the agent avoids the trustee until the end of the 10 
game. 11

Figure 23. Pessimistic priors (𝑫 parameter) 
A Agent pessimistic priors is characterized by a heightened a -priori belief at t=0 to be in a hostile 3 
context. When interacting with the environment, their posterior beliefs are updated in accordance with 4 
the observations and close to the generative process.  After t=20, the hostile context is not clearly 5 
identified by the agent and no avoidance is observed. 6 
B Starting in the hostile context, the nature of the context is reflected in the agent’s posterior beliefs and 7 
the agent begins to avoid the transaction with the trustee while continuing to probe the trustee’s behavior. 8 
Upon the context switch, the cooperative context is registered by the agent and their posterior beliefs 9 
adjust accordingly.  10

2. Average posterior beliefs 2 
An additional analysis was performed to determine the average posterior beliefs over contexts per agent 3 
type. The time series (T=40, context switch after t=20) was run 20 times for each agent type. Results are 4 
shown in the subsequent plots ( Figures 15-23). The plots show a verage posterior beliefs over the 5 
cooperative (blue) and hostile (red) contexts. The thick blue and red lines represent mean posterior 6 
beliefs, averaged over 20 runs of the simulation (pale lines  represent one game). For convenience, the 7 
posterior belief to be in a random state is not shown.  8

A. Posterior beliefs of the agent type with fatalistic expectations (biased 𝐵) in the cooperative-to-hostile 3 
game. The posterior belief to be in a cooperative context accumulates slower compared to the healthy 4 
agent. After the context switch, the agent forms more accurate beliefs about the context.  5 
B. In the hostile -to-cooperative game, the agent quickly arrives at a precise belief to be in a hostile 6 
context. While the cooperative context is recognized by the agent in most instantiations of the game, the 7 
posterior belief to be in a cooperative context does not reach the same precision as the belief about the 8 
hostile context in the first twenty trials.     9

first twenty trials. After the context switch, the agent is more certain to be in a hostile context.    4 
B. During the hostile-to-cooperative game, the agent believes to be in a hostile context. After the context 5 
switch, the agent does not form a precise belief to be in a cooperative context – many instantiations of 6 
the game result in rigid avoidance behavior (horizontal pale lines), where the trustee behavior is no 7 
longer sampled.   8

A. The reward-insensitive, pessimistic agent is exposed to the cooperative-to-hostile game. The agent’s 3 
belief to be a in a cooperative context is weakened and develops towards believing to be in a hostile 4 
context during the cooperative phase in almost all instantiations of the game. During the hostile phase, 5 
the agent shows fixed avoidance behaviors and quits sampling the trustee’s behavior. 6 
B. In the hostile-to-cooperative game, the agent forms precise posterior beliefs about the nature of the 7 
context in the hostile phase of the game. In most instantiations, this agent shows rigid avoidance 8 
behavior (horizontal line). The average belief to be in a cooperative context after the context switch 9 
never exceeds p=0.3.    10

A. During a cooperative-to-hostile game, the depressed (fatalistic, type 2) agent does recognize the true 3 
context dynamics, albeit the belief to be in a cooperative context is weakened compared to the healthy-4 
to-optimistic agent. The switch to the hostile context after t=20 is reflected in the agent’s posterior 5 
beliefs.   6 
B. In the hostile -to-cooperative game, the agent accurately infers the hostile context during the first 7 
phase of the game. In many instantiations, this agent shows rigid avoidance behaviors (horizontal pale 8 
lines), but in some cases, the agent successfully infers the context switch. However, the mean 9 
p(context=cooperative) never exceeds p=0.5.  10

A. The social-phobia agent (type 1, insecure -avoidant) does not reliably infer a cooperative context 3 
during the first cooperative phase of the game. In many instantiations of the game, the agent shows rigid 4 
avoidance behaviors. After the context switches to hostile, the agent forms more precise posterior beliefs 5 
about being in a hostile context.  6 
B. In a hostile -to-cooperative game, the agent shows brief exploration behavior, before stopping to 7 
interact with the agent in all instantiations. The context switch to cooperative is not recognized in any 8 
agent instantiation.   9

A. The trauma-and-defeat (type 2 social phobia) agent in a cooperative -to-hostile game. This agent 3 
deviates only slightly from the biased prior settings in almost all instantiations. In almost all games, the 4 
agent shows rigidity in their behavioral avoidance of interacting with the trustee and stops exploring 5 
their behavior during the cooperative phase of the game.  6 
B. In the hostile-to-cooperative game, the agent barely deviates from their prior and explores interactions 7 
with the trustee for a maximum of 5 trials before adopting a rigid avoidance strategy. 8

Discussion: transdiagnostic processes 2 
In the first agent, we targeted the observation model ( 𝐴, observational uncertainty), by decreasing the 3 
certainty with which observations are connected to a specific  context. As a consequence, the  agent 4 
struggled making precise context inferences. Biases to the observation model could be related to 5 
“cognitive immunization” techniques, where a friendly interaction is connected to a hostile context 6 
(Kube, 2023; Panitz et al., 2021; Rief & Joormann, 2019) . This thought pattern is frequently observed 7 
in patients with depression or social anxiety (Everaert et al., 2017; Rief et al., 2022) . The inability to 8 
draw “correct” conclusions from a given observation may  also be the consequence of a lack of soci o-9 
emotional skills, a common impairment in clinical populations (Nestor et al., 2022; Segrin, 2000; 10 
Wolkenstein et al., 2011) . Many patients  further connect positive interpersonal experiences to 11 
randomness rather than true benevolence (Ewen et al., 2022). In conclusion, perturbations to the agent’s 12 
𝐴 matrix have the consequence that observations do not have a systematic or sensible effect on state 13 
inference. 14 
Next, we perturbed the agent’s transition parameter ( 𝐵), introducing fatalistic beliefs. The transition 15 
matrix comprises beliefs about the evolution of contexts over time and the  agent’s action-dependent 16 
state transitions . Believing that a hostile context will likely develop into a cooperative one is a 17 
computational approximation to the optimism bias in healthy adults (Bracha & Brown, 2012; Sharot, 18 
2011). In contrast, believing that hostile contexts are the norm while cooperative contexts are futile is in 19 
line with e.g., hopelessness (Liu et al., 2015), learned helplessness (Seligman, 1972), low self-efficacy 20 
(Maier & Seligman, 2016; Niu et al., 2022), or interpersonal distrust (Kim et al., 2012). Empirical data 21 
suggests that individuals with depression and social anxiety show deficits in social cognition, 22 
mentalization and theory of mind (Baker & Edelmann, 2002; Nestor et al., 2022) , which may be a 23 
consequence of  inaccurate beliefs about the dynamics of interpersonal situations  – for example, 24 
believing that interpersonal situations will inevitably end in hostility  (Lüdtke & Westermann, 2023; 25 
Segrin, 2000). Supporting the relevance of expectations, recent data suggest that negative expectations 26 
drive subclinical depression to a larger degree than actual negative experiences (Lüdtke & Westermann, 27 
2023). Furthermore, biases in the transition model 𝐵 may be an appropriate operationalization for altered 28 
future thinking in depression. A recent meta -analysis suggests a link between depression and the 29 
difficulty to imagine specific positive events in the future , which may reduce motivation to engage in 30 
any activities, especially given that the ability to imagine negative future events is unaltered in 31 
depression (Gamble et al., 2019). 32 
Gaining a joint win is the preferred outcome in healthy individuals. To simulate psychopathological 33 
behavior, we manipulated the 𝐶 parameter such that the agent puts an increased weight on avoiding 34 
losses instead of maximizing wins. Consequently, the agent explores the trustee’s behavior less, and 35 
starts avoiding any transactions with the trustee quicker compared to the healthy -to-optimistic agent, 36 
which may be a useful method to simulate social anhedonia (Barkus & Badcock, 2019). Several studies 37 
73 
 
suggest aberrant reward valuation and - responsiveness in depression (Alloy et al., 2016). On the other 2 
hand, perturbations in the 𝐶 parameter could be a proxy for rejection sensitivity (Gao et al., 2017) and 3 
risk aversion (Hartley & Phelps, 2012) , by placing an overly strong weight on avoiding the “loss” 4 
outcome.  5 
Finally, we manipulated the agent’s prior beliefs over contexts (𝐷, pessimistic priors). Particularly, the 6 
agent’s generative model comprised the belief that a hostile context is more likely compared to a 7 
cooperative context a-priori. Individuals with depression expect to experience higher rates of  negative 8 
events, and lower rates of positive events (Thimm et al., 2013). Specifically, studies suggest that a lack 9 
of positive expectations may be more central to depression than the presence of negative expectations, 10 
which is in line with a reduced prior on positive experiences  (Horwitz et al., 2017) . In psychological 11 
terms, perturbations to the 𝐷 parameter may be related to interpersonal distrust (Poggi et al., 2019) or 12 
trauma (Mauritz et al., 2013) . In the simulation, a biased prior belief  was overridden by the agent’s 13 
observations because the other parameters of the generative model (i.e., observation model, transition 14 
matrix, preference over outcomes) were intact. Pessimistic prior beliefs may effectively model 15 
experience-dependent negative beliefs that normalize in more favorable environments. Deviations in the 16 
𝐷 vector may nevertheless be of relevance for clinical phenotypes, especially in combination with 17 
perturbations to other parameters of the generative model. 18 
  19 
74 
 
A healthy-to-optimistic agent is most flexible in a longer time series. 2 
An additional supplementary analysis was performed to determine which agent would earn more 3 
absolute rewards in a longer simulation with more volatile contexts. The healthy agent outearns all other 4 
agents (reward-insensitive and fatalistic depression, and both social phobia agents, see Figure 8 in main 5 
text). More detailed analyses of exemplary time series reveal that the healthy -to-optimistic agent 6 
remains capable of detecting context changes throughout the longer time series, unlike the agents with 7 
depression and social phobia. This allows the healthy/ optimistic agent to flexibly maximize rewards, 8 
also in a situation with very volatile context dynamics. Exemplary developments of three agent’s 9 
posterior beliefs during the long time series are shown in Figure 33. A healthy-to-optimistic agent 10 
updates beliefs to be in a hostile environment quickest.  11 
Cooperative-to-hostile games reward loss avoidance; hostile-to-cooperative scenarios 12 
reward flexibility. 13 
We computed total earnings in a game with T=40 trials, averaged over 20 games per agent type. Results 14 
are shown in Figure 34. In a cooperative-to-hostile game, the agent with increased loss avoidance, but 15 
an otherwise intact generative model earns the highest absolute rewards. This may be attributed to their 16 
quicker adopting of an avoidant behavioral strategy (see also Figure 22) compared to other agents. In 17 
contrast, in a hostile-to-cooperative game, the healthy agent maximizes total earned rewards due to their 18 
unique ability to update a precise posterior belief to be in a hostile context compared to all other agent 19 
types.  20 
In a longer time series with more volatile context dynamics, a healthy agent maximizes total earned 21 
rewards compared to both agents with depression (type 1 depression: insensitive and pessimistic, type 22 
2 depression: fatalistic) and social phobia (type 1 social phobia: insecure and avoidant, type 2 social 23 
phobia: trauma-and-defeat). This can similarly be attributed to the agent’s continued exploration despite 24 
having formed a precise posterior belief to be in a hostile context (see also Figure 33).  25
