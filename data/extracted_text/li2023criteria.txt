Abstract 
Agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction in dispersed multiphase systems are ubiquitously encountered 
in biological systems, energy industry, and medical science. In this work, a novel lattice model is extended to 
the three-component complex systems and criterions based on the determinant ,i i ci FK∆= −  are accordingly 
proposed to predict the aforementioned behaviors based on a Helmholtz free energy formulation. Here, three 
characteristic factors iF ’s are introduced to describe the internal energy effect, i.e.,

ijA  denotes the conservative potential coefficient between liquid particles in phase i and j, while the entropy 
factors ,ciK ’s in the determinants  depend on the local structure of the liquid. To verify the theoretical 
criterions, many-body dissipative particle dynamics ( mDPD) are employed to simulate the  phase transition 
phenomena in various many-body dissipative systems, including agglomeration in a binary system, adsorption 
on solid surfaces from the liquid phase, and extraction-adsorption around an immiscible liquid-liquid interface. 
The simulation results show the notable dependence of the dispersed phase distribution transition on the quasi-
order parameters i∆ ’s, which indicates  the great potential of our model  to analyz ing various dispersed 
multiphase systems. The criterions are expected to be  extended to study the  structure effect induced by the 
temperature and dispersed particle shape on the phase transition phenomena in those complex systems.

I Introduction 
Dispersed multiphase systems are mixtures consisting of immiscible phases with at least one component 
existing as discrete phase [1,2]. These mixtures are ubiquitous in biological systems, energy industry, and 
medical science. T he distributions of the dispersed components in the mixtures such as blood cells and 
platelets, nanoparticles in nanofluids, nano-micelles in nano-emulsions have substantial impacts on human’s 
cardiovascular system  [3], oil recovery efficiency  [4], and dermatological treatment [5]. Among various 
distributions of dispersed particles, agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction between different phases have 
drawn an increased interest among researchers.  For example, i t have been  revealed that the shape, surface 
property, and charge of nanoparticles, as well as the chemical structure and polarities of solvent molecules are 
influential in the interaction between particles and continuous phases, hence the adsorption rate and structure 
at liquid-liquid interfaces [6-8] and solid surfaces [9]. In addition to the adsorption processes, the particle 
extraction through liquid- liquid interface, which is crucial in nanotechnology such as quantum dots  and 
nanoparticles, has been intensively investigated [10-12]. Extractors with different size s, structure s and 
functional groups were synthesized to adjust the interaction at the solid- liquid interface, inducing the phase 
transfer of nanoparticles [10,12,13]. Although plenty of efforts have been devoted to the study of three typical 
distributions in multiphase systems, most of the existing theories and models are limited to specific systems  
[7,9,14-17], resulting in the  limitation of lacking universal applicability. A  general theory of dispersed 
multiphase system including analysis for all the three distributions is thus needed.  
In essence, a dispersed multiphase system is a thermodynamic system consisting of interacting particles 
of different types, based on which an adsorption theory that is applicable to multiple binary mixtures including 
water-sulfuric acid, hydrogen-palladium, argon-graphite, etc., was proposed by Hill in 1949 [18], enabling the 
calculation of thermodynamic functions of the systems from experimental data. Despite its ability to 
quantitatively describe the thermodynamic properties of the system, this theory does not provide enough 
insight into the relationship between microscopic interactions and macroscopic distributions of particles, 
which is critical for the design of novel nanomaterials  [4,8,10]. Theoretically, the equilibrium distribution of 
the dispersed phases can be determined by  locating the minimum free energy point in the phase space  of the 
whole system when all the particle interactions are known. Nevertheless, due to the unstructured nature of the 
mixture, it is impracticable to obtain the free energy of the system analytically. 
Certain approximation methods have been adopted by previous researchers to construct simplified models 
for theoretical analysis of complex systems, among which the lattice model is a competitive candidate, such 
as Ising model describing the phase transition of physical systems and lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA) 
describing the emergent behaviour of fluid transport  [19-21]. An idealized lattice model for binary mixtures 
was first constructed by Meyer, assuming a lattice structure in the liquid with lattice constants independent of 
composition [22], from which the correct entropy of mixing for two ideal liqu ids of different species with 
same number densities was derived [23]. Further modifications of Meyer’s model, including regular solution 
theory and Flory-Huggins theory, were proposed and succeeded in explaining phase separation phenomena in 
nonideal solutions and polymer mixtures  [22-24]. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the available 
lattice models are confined to binary systems and thus not applicable to investigate interfacial adsorption and 
phase transfer process of particles, which indeed constructs a ternary mixture. In the present work, we extend 
the lattice model to describe multicomponent systems  in thermodynamic equilibrium and propose a method 
for approximating the free energy of the real system, whereby semi -quantitative criterions of phase change 
including the three typical distribution above  expressed in interparticle potential parameters are derived in a 
general form. Further, many- body dissipative particle dynamics  (mDPD) is employed to model binary and 
ternary mixtures for the verification of our approximation method. 
The paper is organized as follows . In Sec. II, our extended lattice model is presented  and the three 
relationships between interparticle interactions and particle distributions, i.e., agglomeration, adsorption, and 
extraction, are derived under different assumptions. Sec. Ⅲ combines our lattice model with mDPD system 
and presents three criterions of the phase transition for the three distributions. Sec. Ⅳ  shows the simulation 
settings and results to verify our theoretical analysis, with discussions about our model , following by the 
conclusion in Sec. Ⅴ. 
II Theoretical Formulation: An Extended Lattice Model 
In this section, a novel lattice model  with a global representation of the system free energy is presented 
as an extension of Meyer’s model. Further, under the assumption of locality, the general form of Helmholtz 
free energy formulation  is applied to obtain the criterions of three typical phase transition phenomena, i.e.,  
agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction. T he influence of the assumptions on the locality criterion is then 
carefully discussed , followed by a simplified version of the criterions , which will be verified in the next 
sections. 
II.A Global Helmholtz free energy formulation 
Consider an equilibrium system composed of M types of particles similar in size with the particle number, 
volume, and absolute temperature being constant. Conforming to Meyer’s model, each particle is assumed to 
occupy one lattice site without overlapping  on a hypothetical simple cubic lattice . While being a relatively 
independent quantity in Meyer’s model, here the lattice constant  a is uniquely determined by the average 
number density 𝑛𝑛 of the real system as a geometrical correspondence, satisfying 
 3
1 ,na =   (1) 
which is analogous to the treatment of the cell model in colloid science [25,26]. Instead of restricting the 
interparticle interactions to neig hboring particles as Meyer did , we consider the interactions of all particle 
pairs in our model. Since the lattice structure of the system is locally assumed, the distance between particles 
is discretely distribute d and thus can be ordered. In the following, w e denote the α -th closest distance 
between lattice sites by rα , and the corresponding number of neighbors at that distance for each site by cα . 
If a particle pair consists of a type i particle and a type j particle with spacing rα , we call it an “i-j type α -
neighbor”, the interactional energy and total number of which are denoted by 
ijuα  and 
ijNα , respectively.  
The total interaction energy potU  can then be written as 
 
pot

= = =
= ⋅∑∑∑   (2) 
which indicates that potU  is determined by both the number 
ijNα  and the energy 
ijuα  of each type of pair. 
In contrast, the entropy of the system  { }( )
ijSSN α≡ , as a geometric quantity, is only dependent on the set 
{ }
ijNα . Defining two different configurations A and B by giving different sets, 
ijNα  and 
ijNα

we obtain the difference between their total interaction energies and entropies, namely

In the canonical ensemble, the preferrable configuration of the system is determined by the sign of F∆ ; if 
0F∆< , configuration A is preferred, and vice versa.  
As shown in Eq. (5), the system configuration is resulted from the competition between the energy effect 
and the entropy effect, determined by the interaction potential set { }
ijuα  and the configurations  { }
ijNα . 
Although the exact form of S∆  is difficult to obtain, it will be presented in subsequent sections that 
significant information can still be provided by Eq. (5) to give rather simple determinants consisting of 
potential parameters to predict and control the particle distribution. In this contribution, we focus on the energy 
effect and aim to correlate the complex phase transition phenomena in multicomponent system with explicit 
criterions. 
II.B General criterion of phase transition under locality assumption 
To move on, we need to adopt some assumptions on the  locality and interparticle potential.  In this 
subsection, we neglect all the interparticle interactions between α -neighbors ( 0 1αα>= ) as in the Meyer’s 
model for simplicity (which we call a “ 0α -locality” assumption and 0α  is named the “locality index”), and 
this restriction will be relaxed in the next subsection. 
Under the 1-locality assumption, Eq. (5) is simplified into the following form

which is then  employed to investigate the criterions of phase transition for three types of distributions: 
agglomeration, adsorption and extraction. Following the statistical treatment in [23], the interaction potential 
term is reorganized as the function of independent variables under the constraints of certain geometric relations. 
The Helmholtz free energy differences for binary and ternary systems can be rewritten as

respectively, where 1 11
mn mn mnN NN ′∆=− . It is noteworthy that in the latter two types of phase transition, we 
have adopted the additional assumption of dilute dispersed system and the existence of 1- 1 type 1-neighbors 
is neglected, which reduces the degree of freedom in the analysis. The results are listed in Table 1,  and the 
detailed calculations can be found in Appendix A.1-3. 
As shown in Table 1, t he determinants 
000
,i i ci FK∆= −  are accordingly proposed to predict the 
aforementioned behaviors, behaving as the order parameters which we called the “quasi -order parameter”. 
Here, three characteristic factors 
0
iF ’s are introduced to describe the internal energy effect represented by the 
linear combinations of conservative potentia l coefficient between liquid particles in phase i and j, while the 
entropy factors 
0
,ciK ’s in the determinants depend on the local structure of the liquid. When the quasi-order 
parameters 
0 0i∆ < , the corresponding phenomena will happen  remarkably. Note that the two -phase 
agglomeration factor for a binary mixtures here is consistent with the previous studies [22,23], while the latter 
two factors for adsorption and extraction are proposed for the first time. T he mathematical form is quite  
physically intuitive, consistent with the operational thermodynamic considerations [27], but has a more solid 
statistical foundation with the flexibility for further extension. For example, the enabled parameter controlling 
and distribution prediction in the numerical modeling based on the estimation of the energy factor, as well as 
the theoretical prediction of the collective behavior in various dispersed systems with different local structures 
based on the explicit calculation of the entropy factors.

II.C Relaxed locality assumption: conformal interparticle potential 
Seldomly only the 1-neighbor interparticle interaction matters in the dispersed systems, taking the solvent 
particle in a nanoparticle suspension for example. To relax the 1 -locality assumption, i.e., to increase the 
locality index 0α , we need to impose certain assumption on the form of interparticle potential as a balance. 
Mean-field approximation is usually encountered in various fields of physics, especially in the condensed 
matter physics. Here, we introduce a conformal interparticle potential form, which could be recognized as a 
natural extension from the mean -field potential. In fact, it will be seen that  once the conformal potential is 
supposed, the assumption of locality is no longer required to obtain a simple and elegant determinant in the 
criterion of phase transitions, i.e., 0α =∞. 
To be specific, the interparticle potential is assumed in the following form (which we called a “conformal” 
one) 
 () () () ,ij iju r Awr vr= +  (9) 
where 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the conservative potential coefficient between particles in phase i and j, 𝑤𝑤(𝑟𝑟) and 𝑣𝑣(𝑟𝑟) 
are the identical weight functions  for all particle pairs . T he free energy differences between different 
configurations A and B of binary and ternary systems are then expressed as

 Following a similar statistical treatment in the previous subsection, the results are  obtained and listed 
below in Table 2. For the agglomeration phenomena, the calculation is quite straightforward in the same 
manner as the case under 1-locality assumption, while the detail calculations of the latter two could be found 
in Appendix A.4. The energy factors iF ’s here share the isomorphic forms with the ones in Table 1, which 
is the natural corollary by the conformal form of the interparticle potentials. As we will see in the next section, 
this formulation plays an important role in modeling and predicting the behaviors of the mDPD systems.

III Application of Extended Lattice Model: mDPD systems 
In this section, our lattice model and the above analysis are applied to many- body dissipative particle 
dynamics (mDPD) systems. A brief introduction to mDPD systems is first given, following by the translation 
of c riterion of phase transition phenomena to the mDPD interaction coefficients . The criterions of 
agglomeration, adsorption and extraction derived here will be verified through mDPD simulations in Sec. IV.

systems, which is the prerequisite for the application of our lattice model. 
III.B Extended lattice model of mDPD systems 
In most mDPD models constructed in previous studies, the average number density n ranges from 5 to 
10. According to Eq. (1), the corresponding lattice constant a is in  the range of 0.45 to 0.6. Given that 
conventionally the cutoff distance r c is set to the unit of length in mDPD studies [32], namely, 12cra=  , 
{ }rα  and { }cα  are thus determined as

Following the discussions in Appendix A , it can be inferred that ,1cK  and ,2cK  are all negative constants, 
while the sign of ,3cK  is determined by the ratio (2) (3)/NN . The analyses above provide important guidance 
for particle distribution control in mDPD systems. In other words , the occurrences of agglomeration, 
adsorption, and extraction should be determined by the combination of coefficients , which will be verified 
soon. 
IV MDPD Simulation: Results and Discussions 
In this section, three different mDPD systems corresponding to the three extended models introduced in 
Sec. III are constructed. For each system, numerous simulations with different sets { }ijA  are conducted to 
examine the relationships between particle distribution and interparticle interactions predicted by our model. 
I V. A Agglomeration 
A binary mDPD system composed of 600 type 1 particles as dispersed phase and 7200 type-2 particles as 
continuous phase was constructed, with the simulation box of size 23.6 2.0 23.6××  in reduced units. The 
total particle density is about 7, satisfying the approximation condition 2cra . Periodic boundary conditions 
are applied in three dimensions. In the initial state, all type 1 particles were uniformly dispersed in phase 2 as 
shown in FIG. 1. Then, the system evolved to the equilibrium state. 
 The degree of agglomeration is quantified in a similar way as in  a previous work [33], dividing the 
simulation box into 10 1 10××  blocks and calculating the relative standard deviation D of the number density 
of type 1 particles in each block

where M is the number of blocks, in  is the number density of type 1 particles in block i  and aven  is the 
average number density of type 1 particles. Then, simulations were conducted for 104 different models, where 
F1 ranges from -30 to 30 with an interval of 5. 
 
FIG. 1. The particle distribution: (a) without agglomeration; (b) with agglomeration. 
 

 
FIG. 2. The degree of agglomeration as a function of the agglomeration factor 1 12 11 222F AA A− += + . It is seen that when 
1 10F <− , the relative standard deviation D of the number density of type 1 particles is scattered in the high -level range of 
1.5 to 2.3, while when 1 0F > , D decreases and converges to about 0.5. F or the transition zone where 110 0 F−< < , D is 
distributed over a wide range from 0.6 to 2.0. 
 In FIG. 2, it is indicated that the transition of the particle distribution from significant agglomeration to 
uniform dispersion happens as F1 increases, which is consistent with the predictions of our model . The 
transition point Kc is in the interval [-10,0] and therefore negative, as estimated before. However, when F1 is 
close to Kc, for example 1 5F =− , accurate predictions of the distribution become impossible, for which there 
are several possible reasons. The first is that in this situation, the difference in free energy  F∆  between 
different distributions could be comparable to the thermal energy  and no stable distribution can exist due to 
the random motions of particles.  The inaccuracy could also be caused by the errors introduced by the 
simplifications in our model, and when F∆  is close to these errors, the prediction loses its accuracy. 
I V. B Adsorption on Solid Surfaces 
In our extended lattice model, the adsorption of particles at the liquid-liquid interface and on the solid 
surface is considered as the same process from the perspective of the Helmholtz free energy. However, in the 
real situation, adsorption of particles at the liquid-liquid interface may result in the phase transfer of particles 
and be coupled with the extraction process. Therefore, in this section, only adsorption on the solid surface is 
considered to investigate the adsorption process independently and adsorption at the liquid -liquid interfaced 

would be discussed together with extraction in the next section. 
Here a ternary mDPD system composed of 600 type 1 particles as dispersed phase, 6400 type 2 particles 
as liquid phase and 7056 type 3 particles as solid phase, with the simulation box of size 33.0 2.0 33.0××  in 
reduced units, was constructed. Like the setup in Sec. Ⅵ .A, the approximation condition is fu lfilled and the 
periodic boundary conditions are applied. After equilibrium, all solid particles were simultaneously attached 
to their respective sites by spring forces at a given moment and an additional linear repulsive force field was 
applied to all non-solid particles entering the solid region, as in the literature [34]. Initially, all type 1 particles 
were uniformly dispersed in phase 2 as shown in FIG.  3. Then, the system was allowed to evolve to the 
equilibrium state. 
All the type 1 particles  with a distance less than cr  from the solid surface were regarded as being 
adsorbed. And the proportion of type 1 particles  adsorbed on the solid surface X was used to quantify the 
degree of adsorption  
 
S
(1) ,NX N=   (26) 
where SN  is the number of type 1 particles adsorbed on the solid surface and (1)N  is the total number of 
type 1 particles. The degrees of adsorption X in 112 models with F2 ranging from -100 to 30, satisfying 1 0F >  
to avoid agglomeration in phase 2, were calculated. 
 
FIG. 3. The particle distribution: (a) without adsorption on solid surface; (b) with adsorption on solid surface. 

 
 
FIG. 4. The degree of adsorption on solid surface as a function of adsorption factor 2 22 13 12 23FA AAA+−−= . It is seen that 
when 2 40F <− , the degree of adsorption is diffusely distributed at a high level with an overall monotonically decreasing 
relationship to F2, while when 2 0F > , X sharply reduced and approaches to 0. In the transition zone between -40 and 0, X 
fluctuates in a wide range from 0.013 to 0.69. 
 From FIG. 4, it is shown that as F2 increases from -100 to 30, the particle distribution varies from the state 
with significant adsorption on the solid surface to the state without considerable adsorption, which agrees with 
our theory. As predicted before, the transition point Kc within the interval [-40,0] is negative. In our analysis, 
the dilute dispersion condition is employed and it is assumed that no neighboring type 1 particle s exist. 
However, FIG. 3(b) shows that on the solid surfaces , type 1 particles aggregate and stack  with each other , 
which does not satisfy our assumptions and may be one of the reas ons for inaccurate predictions within the 
transition zone. Generally, the above results demonstrate the validity of our theory in controlling the particle 

adsorption on solid surfaces, indicating that the additional force fields introduced to construct the solid model 
did not influence the thermodynamics of adsorption processes. In the next section, the adsorption process  at 
liquid-liquid interfaces will be investigated.  
I V. C Extraction and Adsorption at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces 
In contrast to the solid- liquid interface in Sec.  IV.B, here a ternary mDPD  system with a liquid-liquid 
interface was constructed, consisting of 600 type 1 particles as dispersed phase, 6401 type 2 particles and 6399 
type 3 particles as two immiscible liquid phases. The simulation box was of size 33.8 2.0 33.8××  in reduced 
units and p eriodic boundary conditions are applied in three dimensions. In this section , the system was 
successively employed to investigate extraction and adsorption processes. 
To be specific, simulations on 130 different models with 1 0F >  and F3 ranging from -55 to 45 were first 
conducted to reveal the relation between the degree of extraction and F 3, . Then, 85 models with F2 ranging 
from -40 to 50 and 1 0F > , 3 10F >  to prevent agglomeration and extraction were constructed to investigate 
the adsorption at liquid-liquid interface. As in Sec. IV.B, all type 1 particles in the initial state were uniformly 
dispersed in phase 2 as shown in FIG. 5(a), after which the system evolved to the equilibrium state. 
The degree of adsorption at liquid-liquid interface is quantified in the same way as in the last section, by 
calculating the proportion of type 1 particles with a distance less than cr  from the liquid-liquid interface 
 
L
(1) ,NX N=   (27) 
where LN  is the number of type 1 particles adsorbed at the liquid -liquid interface and LN  is the total 
number of type 1 particles. To quantify the degree of extraction, the proportion of type 1 particles immersed 
in phase 3 is calculated 
 
E
(1) ,NI N=   (28) 
where EN  is the number of type 1 particles extracted into phase 3. 
 
FIG. 5. The particle distribution: (a) without extraction; (b) with extraction. 
 
 
FIG. 6. The degree of extraction as a function of the extraction factor 3 22 13 33 12 22FA AA A=+ −− . It is seen that I stays at 
a high level when 3 20F <−  and converges to 0 when 3 10F > , while sharply decreasing with F3 in the interval [-20,10]. 
The pattern presented in FIG. 6 is similar to those  in previous sections, i.e., This pattern indicates the 
phase transfer of type 1 particles from phase 2 to phase 3 as F3 decreases, as expected based on our model . 
Due to the close volume of phase 2 and phase 3, the sign of Kc is indeterminate, which is compatible with our 
theory.  

 
FIG. 7. The particle distribution: (a) without adsorption at liquid-liquid interface; (b) with adsorption at liquid-liquid interface. 
 
 
FIG. 8. The degree of adsorption at liquid-liquid interface as a function of the adsorption factor 2 22 13 12 23FA AAA+−−= . 
When 2 0F > , 0.2X <  and decreases to 0, in accordance with the pattern in solid surface adsorption, indicating no 
significant adsorption at liquid-liquid interface when 2 0F > . When 240 0 F−<< , X is scattered in a wide range from 0 
to 0.39, consistent with the distribution in the transition zone in Sec. Ⅳ.B. 
It is indicated from FIG.  8 that 0cK < , as predicted by our theory. Whereas, here only models with 
2 40F >−  were constructed and the distribution transition of the system was not fully presented. Th is 
limitation is caused by the fact that under the premise of no extraction, if we reduce F2 to below -40, A23 will 

be increased to greater than 10 due to the coupling between F2 and F3, resulting in a significant decrease in 
the particle number density near the liquid -liquid interface and contradicting the assumption of an 
approximately uniform system density in our theoretical model. Hence, when investigating the adsorption at 
liquid-liquid interface, the range of F2 is limited, in contrast to solid surface adsorption, where no restriction 
of the particle phase transfer is needed. 
V Conclusions 
In this work, we extended Meyer’s lattice model to describe three -component dispersed multiphase 
systems and proposed a general approximate form for the Helmholtz free energy of the system. Criterions 
based on the determinants  ,i i ci FK∆= −  are accordingly proposed to predict the aforementioned behaviors 
based on a Helmholtz free energy formulation, with the energy factors iF ’s describing the internal energy 
effect and the entropy factors ,ciK ’s depending on the local lattice configuration. To verify our prediction, a 
binary mDPD system, a ternary mDPD system with liquid-solid interface, and a ternary mDPD system with 
liquid-liquid interface were constructed  to simulate the phase transition phenomena in va rious many-body 
dissipative systems, including agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction, quantified by the relative standard 
deviation of the number density of dispersed particles, the proportion of dispersed particles adsorbed at the 
interface, and the proportion of dispersed particles extracted by another continuous phase, respectively . The 
simulation results show the notable dependence of the dispersed phase distribution transition on the quasi -
order parameters. 
The good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the mDPD simulation results shows great 
potential of our model to further applications in dispersed multiphase systems. For example, the entropy effect 
is qualitatively included in the  phase transition criterions, which are expected to be extended to study the 
structure effect induced by the temperature, phase density, and dispersed particle shape on the phase transition 
phenomena in those complex systems. Considering the feature of locality in our model due to the assumption 
of a uniform number density across the system , modeling of systems with a significant number density 
fluctuation or great particle size difference is fascinating and challenging. Besides, as a widely used simulation 
method, molecular dynamics (MD) is also widely-used in modeling multi-component particle systems similar 
to mDPD. Thus, applying our model to MD systems will potentially contribute to simulation studies in biology, 
chemicals, materials, and so on [35].

Appendix: Detailed Calculation on the Explicit Form of the Criterion in 
Table 1 and 2 
In this appendix, the detailed calculations on the explicit forms of the criterion of the agglomeration, 
adsorption, and extraction in Table 1 and 2 in Sec II.B-C, are presented successively. 
A. Table 1: Agglomeration 
The agglomeration process can be investigated simply in binary systems. Consider the extended lattice 
model of a mixture which comprises  a dispersed phase of (1)N  type 1 particles  and a continuous phase of  
(2)N  type 2 particles, where ( ) ( )12
NN   is satisfied. The individual components in { }1
ijN  are not 
independent of each other but constrained by certain geometric relations, so the independent variables should 
be determined.

1 /2cN N +  and the components of each pair must 
be either 1 -1, 2-2 and 1 -2. It’s worth noting that the boundary effects are neglected because ( ) ( )12
NN +  is 
large. Consider each particle pair with distance 𝑟𝑟1 has two “ends” belonging to the two invol ved sites. The 
total number of the “ends” that pertain to the (1)N  sites of type 1 is 
(1)
1cN . Alternatively, this number can 
also be calculated by summing the contributions from 1-1 type pairs and 1-2 type pairs, namely

Eq. (7).  
Consider that the configuration A  corresponds to the uniform distribution of type 1 particles in the 
continuous phase, while the configuration B  representing the state of agglomeration. It can be inferred that 
12
1N∆  is positive because more contact is formed between sites of type 1 and type 2 in configuration A.  
Meanwhile, the higher degree of mixing in configuration A  causes a greater entropy, indicating that S∆  is 
also positive. Then after defining the transition point ,1 12

B. Table 1: Adsorption 
The adsorption process involves adsorbent particles and the interface of two immiscible phases. Consider 
the extended lattice model of a mixture which comprises a dispersed phase of ( )1

continuous phases composed of  ( )2

 in the same way. Based on the Eq. (6), the 
Helmholtz free energy difference is rewritten as Eq. (8). 
We specify that the configuration A corresponds to the uniform distribution of type 1 particles in 
continuous phase 2, while configuration B representing the state when all type 1 particles are adsorbed on the 
interface between phase 2 and phase 3. Consider the adsorption process of a single particle, which can be 
described by exchanging a type 1 particle within the phase 2 with a type 2 particle at the 2-3 interface, during 
which the variations of each 1

FIG. 9. Adsorption process of a single particle: (a) before adsorption; (b) after adsorption. 
By repeating the above process ( )1
N  times, all type 1 particles are adsorbed and we obtain 1
ijN∆  between 
configuration A and B, namely ( )1
1 01
ij ijNN N∆= ∆ . Here the dilute dispersion condition, ( ) ( ) ( )1 23
~N NN , is

22 13 12 23 (1)
1 111()F u N TSuuu∆ −−= − −∆+ . (36) 

It can be inferred that  S∆  is positive because the lower degrees of freedom of type 1 particles when 
confined at the interface in configuration B, leading to a lower entropy. Hence in this case the transition point 
( ),2 1c

∆=−  is also a negative constant, and it can be predicted from Eq. (36) that when

22 13 12 23
1 1 1 1 ,2 cuuuu K+−−< , massive 
type 1 particles will adsorb on the interface. 
C. Table 1: Extraction 
Same as adsorption, extraction process involves a ternary system with one dispersed phase and two 
continuous phases. The same extended model in the last subsection is reused and hence Eq. (8) is also 
applicable in this section. 
Here we specify that the configuration  A corresponds to the uniform distribution of type 1 particles in 
continuous phase 2, while configuration B representing the state when all type 1 particles are dispersed in 
phase 3. Consider the extraction process of a single particle, which can be described by moving a type 1 
particle within the phase 2 into the interior of the phase 3, during which the variations of each 1
ijN  are

FIG. 10. Extraction process of a single particle: (a) before extraction; (b) after extraction. 
By repeating the above process ( )1
N  times, all type 1 particles are extracted into phase 3 and we obtain 1
ijN∆  
between configuration A and B, namely ( )1
1 01
ij ijNN N∆= ∆ . Again, the assumption that no neighboring type 1 

pair exists is made. Based on Eq. (8), we have 
 
22 13 12 (1)
1 11 1
33223( )F u N TSuu u∆ −−= − −∆+ . (38)

be observed, while 
22 13 33 12
1 1 1 1 ,322 cu uu u K+ −− < , massive type 1 particles will be extracted into phase 3. 
D. Table 2: Adsorption and extraction 
Consider a ternary mixture  with a liquid-liquid interface. For adsorption process, consider that a type 1 
particle within the phase 2 far from the interface is exchanged with a type 2 particle at the 2-3 interface, during 
which the variations of each 
ijNα  satisfy the following relationship 
 
12 13 23
0 00 .N NNα αα ∆=−∆=∆  (39) 
Hence, 
 
12 13 23 .N NNα αα =−∆ ∆=∆  (40) 
Combine Eq. (14) and Eq. (40), the free energy change for the adsorption process is obtained
