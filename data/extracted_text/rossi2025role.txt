Background: Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), including functional 
neurological disorders (FND), chronic pain, and other neurological conditions 
[e.g., Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), and psychosis], present substantial challenges for healthcare 
systems due to their complex and multifaceted nature. These disorders often 
involve maladaptive sensory processing and heightened sensory perception, 
contributing to disability and psychological distress. Sensory attenuation (SA) 
is a neurophysiological mechanism that helps differentiate self-generated 
from external sensory stimuli, filtering irrelevant sensory input. Altered SA has 
been implicated in the pathophysiology of FND, chronic pain, and PPS, where 
impaired sensory modulation contributes to symptom persistence.
Aims: This scoping review aimed to explore the role of SA in healthy individuals 
and those with FND, neurological disorders, and chronic pain. A secondary 
objective was to examine SA measurement techniques and their clinical 
relevance.
Methods: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and PRISMA-
ScR guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google 
Scholar identified studies published between 2013 and 2023. Inclusion criteria 
encompassed investigations of SA in both symptomatic and healthy populations, 
focusing on FND, neurological disorders, and chronic pain. Data extraction 
highlighted SA mechanisms, assessment methods, and clinical implications for 
manual therapy and musculoskeletal (MSK) care.
Results: A total of 62 studies involving 3,344 participants were included. 
Findings indicated that SA is essential for sensorimotor integration and the 
sense of agency in healthy individuals. However, disruptions in SA were 
consistently observed in FND, chronic pain, and neurological disorders, leading 
to sensory hypersensitivity, impaired motor control, and a distorted sense of 
agency. SA was assessed using methods such as the force-matching paradigm, 
electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), providing insights into neurophysiological 
alterations.
Conclusion: This review highlights the critical role of SA in adaptive sensory 
processing and its disruption in conditions like FND and chronic pain. Integrating 
SA-based interventions, such as sensorimotor retraining and affective touch, 
into manual therapy and MSK care may help recalibrate sensory processing 
and improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on standardizing

1 Introduction
Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), also known as persistent 
somatic symptoms, are distressing complaints—such as chronic pain, 
fatigue, or dizziness—that last for at least 6 months and often lack a 
clear medical explanation (Kube et al., 2020; Löwe et al., 2024; Van den 
Bergh et al., 2017 ). They may develop after infections, injuries, or 
stressful events, or arise without an obvious trigger. PPS are closely 
linked to significant disability and healthcare burden, and as 
symptoms persist, their connection to identifiable pathology tends to 
weaken, making diagnosis and treatment more difficult (Henningsen 
et al., 2018; Löwe et al., 2024). These symptoms overlap with functional 
neurological disorder (FND), as both conditions involve disabling 
physical experiences without structural pathology and share common 
underlying mechanisms, including dysfunctions in brain networks 
and psychological contributors (Gilmour et al., 2020).
FND presents with genuine neurological symptoms—such as 
seizures, movement abnormalities, or sensory disruptions—in the 
absence of structural brain damage. It is now understood as a disorder 
of brain function, with diagnosis based on identifiable clinical features 
rather than exclusion of other conditions (Gilmour et al., 2020; Mishra 
and Pandey, 2022 ). Research shows that FND is as prevalent in 
neurological clinics, with 5–15% of patients requiring assistance 
(Finkelstein et al., 2025), as multiple sclerosis and involves disruptions 
in attention, brain connectivity and predictive processing.
PPS, which include conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome, 
fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome, often co-occur with or 
resemble FND. These disorders can range in severity from mild to 
debilitating, significantly affecting patients’ lives and representing a 
large portion of healthcare referrals (Chalder et al., 2023; Swainston 
et al., 2022). The chronic nature and complexity of these conditions 
are associated with disability, unemployment, and psychological 
distress, reinforcing the deep interconnection between mental and 
physical health ( Broddadóttir et  al., 2021; den Boer et  al., 2022 ). 
Managing PPS and FND requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary 
care strategies to address their multifactorial nature ( Husain and 
Chalder, 2021; Kube et al., 2020; Rask et al., 2023).
The relationship between PPS and FND is shaped by psychological 
factors such as stress, trauma, and emotional strain, which can 
intensify symptoms and hinder recovery (Löwe et al., 2024). These 
influences may lead to the development of maladaptive coping 
strategies and maintain illness behaviours. Some individuals may 
transition from PPS to FND under sustained psychological and 
functional strain, while others may experience FND symptoms 
without any identifiable pathology. This complexity highlights the 
importance of a biopsychosocial approach to both diagnosis and 
treatment. FND, as a spectrum disorder, is influenced by chronic pain, 
anxiety, depression, and diagnostic uncertainty (Hallett et al., 2022). 
Given the burden of these conditions—especially among 
women—early, targeted interventions addressing neurobiological, 
psychological, and social domains are urgently needed (Milano et al., 
2023; Palmer et al., 2023).
Effective treatment for PPS and FND often involves a 
multidisciplinary approach, integrating cognitive-behavioural therapy, 
physical therapy, and patient education to enhance coping strategies, 
symptom management, and overall functioning (Löwe et al., 2024). 
Importantly, patients’ beliefs and expectations play a pivotal role in 
symptom perception and management, underscoring the necessity of 
open communication and collaboration between patients and 
healthcare providers to ensure effective treatment (Löwe et al., 2024).
Emerging models, such as predictive processing and active 
inference, offer valuable insights into understanding the mechanisms 
underlying PPS and FND by conceptualising the brain as a 
hierarchical, multilevel predictive machine. Predictive processing 
posits that the brain continuously generates models to anticipate 
sensory inputs and minimise prediction errors by integrating feedback 
loops between different neural layers of the cortex (Bubić et al., 2009). 
This process involves the interplay of top-down predictions from 
higher brain areas and bottom-up sensory information to refine these 
predictions, resulting in an adaptive and dynamic internal model 
(Teufel and Fletcher, 2020; Friston, 2009). At lower levels, the brain 
predicts interoceptive (internal bodily), proprioceptive (body position 
and movement), and exteroceptive (external sensory) inputs. When 
discrepancies arise between predicted and actual sensory inputs, 
prediction-error signals are generated, prompting adjustments to the 
generative model to improve future predictions (Clark, 2013; Friston, 
2005; Smith et al., 2019). Importantly, the ability for prediction errors 
to update the generative models is dependent on precision-weighting; 
briefly, only those errors that have low-variance (high precision) 
produce alterations in neural circuitry and function (see for full 
description Haarsma et al., 2018). This process enables continuous 
appropriate learning and adaptation, where perceptual inference 
(updating the internal model) and active inference (acting on the 
environment to align it with predictions) minimise prediction errors 
and optimise behaviour (Esteves et al., 2022; Venter, 2021).
Active inference (AInf) extends this framework by explaining 
how organisms adapt their behaviour and beliefs to reduce 
discrepancies between internal models and the external world, thereby 
integrating processes such as perception, action selection, attention, 
and emotion regulation (Parr et al., 2022). AInf is grounded in the 
principle of minimising variational free energy through Bayesian 
inference, where organisms modify their beliefs (perceptual 
adaptation) or alter the environment (behavioural adaptation) to 
reduce uncertainty (Parr et al., 2022 ). This process is guided by a 
generative model that predicts sensory inputs and physiological states, 
enabling both reactive and proactive regulation of behaviour and 
internal states. The concept of expected free energy plays a crucial role 
in evaluating potential outcomes of different actions, while the

Frontiers in Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org
Markov blanket offers a degree of autonomy by separating internal 
and external states, allowing for greater self-regulation (Parr et al., 
2022). Additionally, AInf extends to interoceptive and emotional 
regulation, elucidating how the nervous system and associated systems 
predict and manages physiological conditions and their associated 
emotional responses, which is vital for maintaining homeostasis and 
adaptive functioning. Through AInf, Bayesian information flow can 
be  mapped onto cortical neurobiological computations through 
constant-time (predictive coding) or discrete-time (Markov decision 
processes) formulations. In this context, the dopaminergic (ventral 
tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta), cholinergic (Nucleus 
basalis) and noradrenergic (locus coeruleus) neuromodulator systems 
have gained importance. Due to their location in the brainstem, they 
influence the accuracy of sensory signals, action/control activities and 
model predictions with respect to the surrounding environment. In 
particular, the dopaminergic system has been associated with both the 
genesis of movement and the selectivity of action. Instead, the 
cholinergic system would appear to be  implicated in top-down 
mechanisms of cortico-sensory regulation and attention selectivity. 
Finally, the noradrenergic system would seem to encode the accuracy 
of the model’s predictions with respect to the variability of the 
environment, allowing the model to learn and update itself 
(Limanowski et al., 2024).
Within this conceptual framework, sensory attenuation emerges 
as a crucial mechanism for modulating sensory information and 
maintaining an accurate sense of self and agency (Esteves et al., 2022). 
Sensory attenuation refers to the nervous systems ability to selectively 
filter and downregulate the intensity of internally generated sensory 
signals, distinguishing them from externally generated stimuli. This 
process ensures that self-generated actions, such as movements or 
thoughts, do not overwhelm the sensory system (Harrison et al., 2021; 
Parthasharathy et al., 2022). However, when sensory attenuation fails, 
as seen in conditions like FND and chronic pain, patients experience 
an exaggerated awareness of bodily sensations, contributing to 
symptom persistence and discomfort ( Esteves et al., 2022 ; Palmer 
et al., 2023).
For example, individuals with FND often exhibit impaired sensory 
attenuation, resulting in difficulties differentiating self-generated 
movements from external stimuli, which may contribute to their 
symptoms (Harrison et al., 2021). Similarly, in chronic pain conditions, 
the breakdown of sensory attenuation leads to an amplified perception 
of nociceptive signals, perpetuating hypervigilance and discomfort 
(Esteves et al., 2022). Understanding sensory attenuation, therefore, 
offers a pathway to deciphering how predictive processes become 
disrupted in these conditions, making it a critical target for 
therapeutic intervention.
Clinicians, particularly manual therapists, can leverage principles 
of predictive processing and active inference to modify patients’ 
generative models and recalibrate sensory attenuation. This involves 
engaging patients in person-centred and dyadic therapeutic 
relationships that facilitate recalibration of sensory processing, using 
techniques such as affective touch, guided movement, and verbal 
communication to help patients re-learn how to filter and modulate 
sensory input effectively via the AInf processes outlined previously 
(Esteves et  al., 2022 ). By guiding patients through this process, 
clinicians can help restore the body’s ability to “disappear” into the 
background of conscious experience, thereby reducing symptom 
intensity and improving functional outcomes (Vasil et al., 2020).
Digital health interventions, particularly virtual reality (VR), 
present a promising modality for recalibrating sensory attenuation in 
individuals with PPS and chronic musculoskeletal pain. VR creates 
immersive, multisensory environments that provide congruent 
proprioceptive, visual, and auditory stimuli—ideal for guiding 
predictive coding processes by stabilising prior expectations and 
minimising prediction errors (Pretat et al., 2025). For example, virtual 
embodiment training protocols have shown efficacy in reducing pain 
perception and enhancing motor engagement by simulating body-
related experiences under controlled, low-threat conditions. These 
interventions align with predictive processing models where altered 
interoception and disrupted sensory attenuation contribute to pain 
chronification (Darnall et al., 2020). Furthermore, recent reviews and 
pilot studies highlight how VR can support long-term sensorimotor 
retraining and attentional redirection without the physical constraints 
typical in conventional rehabilitation (Saby et al., 2024). By allowing 
therapeutic exposure to graded activities, VR not only enhances 
accessibility and efficiency in clinical care, but also empowers patient 
self-management in ecologically valid settings. These capabilities make 
VR an increasingly relevant tool for both clinicians and researchers 
exploring the neural mechanisms of pain and sensory integration 
(Guerra-Armas et al., 2023).
Despite the growing understanding of sensory attenuation’s role 
in these conditions, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding 
its manifestation in symptomatic versus healthy individuals, 
particularly within the context of musculoskeletal and person-centred 
care. This scoping review aims to address this gap by exploring the role 
of sensory attenuation in healthy individuals, FND, other neurological 
disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and psychosis), and chronic pain. 
Additionally, it seeks to investigate how sensory attenuation is 
measured in both healthy and symptomatic subjects, assessing the 
implications and applicability of these tests.
By examining sensory attenuation through the lens of predictive 
processing and active inference, this review aims to inform clinical 
practice, enhance patient-practitioner communication, and lay the 
groundwork for future research in musculoskeletal care. Ultimately, 
this exploration will contribute to the development of innovative 
therapeutic strategies grounded in predictive processing models, 
supporting a more holistic and person-centred approach to managing 
complex conditions like PPS and FND.

including those related to manual and non-manual clinical medicine.
2.3.1 Types of sources
This review considered all types of studies, including: experimental 
and interventional studies [randomised controlled trials (RCTs), N-of-1 
trials], observational studies (case reports, case series, cross-sectional, 
cohort, and case–control studies), systematic reviews, scoping reviews, 
and narrative reviews, qualitative studies, grey literature that meets the 
inclusion criteria. Only studies published in English between 2013 and 
2023 were included to ensure the most current evidence.
2.3.2 Exclusion criteria
Studies were excluded if they were: not published in English, published 
before 2013, conducted on animals, in vitro, or on robots, pre-prints not 
certified by peer review and undergraduate or doctoral dissertations and 
did not analyse the variable of interest (sensory attenuation).
2.4 Information sources
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across the 
following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect and 
Google Scholar.
Additional sources included grey literature and contacting authors 
to request full-text articles for two publications related to sensory 
attenuation that were not open access.
2.5 Search strategy and selection process
The research methodology for this scoping review consisted of the 
following steps:
2.5.1 Databases searched and search filters
The databases used for the screening of the English-language 
scientific literature were PubMed, ScienceDirect, Semantic Scholar, 
and Google Scholar, with a time span from 2013 to 2023. No registries 
or websites were utilised.
2.5.2 Keywords and search strings
The search strings were structured by combining “Sensory 
attenuation” with each of the other keywords using the Boolean 
operator AND. Table 1 shows the specific search strings used.
2.5.3 Selection process
During the research process, reports (electronic or paper 
documents) identified and corresponding to the selection criteria of 
the scoping review were saved and catalogued by an individual 
reviewer using Zotero reference management software. To be saved in 
Zotero, the records (titles and abstracts) of the reports indexed in 
these databases had to contain all keywords of the search string in at 
least one of them.
After the article selection process, two independent reviewers 
examined the studies. Any exclusions of scientific articles (e.g., 
duplicates, studies not meeting the inclusion criteria) were recorded 
and reported in the scoping review.
2.5.4 Data management
The identification process of the articles considered eligible for the 
study was systematically and sequentially reported. This process was 
presented within a flowchart following the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping 
reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (see Figure 1).
2.6 Selection of sources of evidence
All identified citations were collated, and duplicates were removed. 
Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers

against the inclusion criteria. Potentially relevant studies were 
retrieved in full text and assessed in detail against the inclusion 
criteria. Reasons for exclusion of sources at the full-text screening 
stage were recorded and reported in the scoping review. Any 
disagreements between the reviewers (LR and JE) were resolved 
through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer (FC).
3 Results
3.1 Selection of sources of evidence
The literature search across PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google 
Scholar identified a total of 2,799 records. After removing 352 
duplicates, 2,447 records remained. Applying the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria resulted in the removal of 2,315 records.
A total of 132 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Seventy 
articles were excluded for the following reasons: variable of interest 
not analysed (n = 24), dissertations or doctoral theses (n = 18), other 
reasons (n = 16), preprints not certified by peer review (n = 10), under 
minor revision (n = 1), and language not in English (n = 1).
Ultimately, 62 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included 
in the scoping review. These articles were analysed to address the 
primary review question: “What is the role of sensory attenuation in 
healthy individuals, FND, neurological disorders, and/or chronic 
pain?” and the secondary question: “How is sensory attenuation 
measured in healthy and symptomatic individuals, and what are the 
implications and applicability of these tests?”

flow diagram (Figure 1).
3.2 Characteristics of included studies
The 62 included studies encompassed a total of 3,344 participants, 
comprising 1,372 men, 1,738 women, two non-binary individual, one 
participant who identified as neither man nor woman, and 231 
participants whose gender was not specified, with a mean age of 27 years.
Ten studies were excluded from demographic calculations due to their 
design: six literature reviews ( Hughes et  al., 2013b ; Boehme and 
Olausson, 2022; Brown et al., 2013; Kearney and Brittain, 2021; Ciaunica 
et al., 2022; Adams et al., 2013), one mini-review (Kiepe et al., 2021), one 
observational study (Porciuncula et al., 2020), one experimental study 
without demographic data (Gentsch et al., 2015), and one hypothesis and 
theory article (Windt et al., 2014).
3.2.1 Study designs
The included studies comprised various designs: Experimental 
studies (n = 51), including two within-subject designs (Burin et al., 
2017; Lubinus et al., 2022) and one randomised block design (Orepic 
et  al., 2021); Reviews ( n = 6) (Hughes et  al., 2013b; Boehme and 
Olausson, 2022; Brown et  al., 2013 ; Kearney and Brittain, 2021 ; 
Ciaunica et al., 2022; Adams et al., 2013); Mini-review (n = 1) (Kiepe 
et al., 2021); Observational study (n = 1) (Porciuncula et al., 2020); 
Cross-sectional study (n = 1) (McNaughton et al., 2022a); Proof-of-
concept study (n = 1) (Fritsch et al., 2021); Hypothesis and theory 
article (n = 1) (Windt et al., 2014).
3.2.2 Geographical distribution
The studies were conducted across various countries (Figure 2).
3.2.3 Participant characteristics
Most studies recruited healthy participants ( n = 46). Of these, 
seven studies included participants with normal or corrected-to-
normal vision ( Orepic et al., 2021 ; Fritz et al., 2022 ; Lubinus et al., 
2022; Storch and Zimmermann, 2022 ; Schwarz et al., 2018 ; Vasser

3.3 Synthesis of results
Figure  4  and Supplementary material  provides a visual 
representation of the clinical areas and phenomena investigated in the 
studies included in this review. Other data visualisations are available 
in the Supplementary material.
3.3.1 Sensory attenuation in healthy individuals
3.3.1.1 Visual domain
Ten studies investigated sensory attenuation (SA) in the visual 
domain among healthy individuals. These studies utilised methods 
such as virtual reality (VR), saccade paradigms, and discrimination 
tasks of visual stimuli (Dong and Bao, 2021; Vasser et al., 2019; Kiepe 
et  al., 2023; Schwarz et  al., 2018; Storch and Zimmermann, 2022 ; 
Csifcsák et al., 2018; Richter and de Lange, 2019; Mifsud et al., 2018; 
Roussel et al., 2014; Lubinus et al., 2022).
Research findings in this domain are varied. Some studies suggest 
that SA occurs in the visual domain and is influenced by internal 
predictive signals, such as proprioception and attention (Storch and 
Zimmermann, 2022; Kiepe et al., 2023 ). For instance, Kiepe et al. 
(2023) found that the ability to discriminate stimulus intensity is 
modulated by internal predictive cues, potentially associated with 
proprioceptive attention. Storch and Zimmermann (2022)  
demonstrated that temporal attention, guided by temporal 
predictability, can modulate the strength of SA.
Conversely, other studies indicate that SA does not automatically 
occur for all foreseeable consequences of a voluntary action in the 
visual domain ( Schwarz et  al., 2018 ). The variability in findings 
suggests that SA in the visual domain is complex and may depend on 
factors such as task requirements, stimulus predictability, and the 
temporal relationship between action and perception (Csifcsák et al., 
2018; Richter and de Lange, 2019).
3.3.1.2 Auditory domain
Nineteen studies explored SA in the auditory domain. These 
studies examined neural responses to self-generated versus externally 
generated sounds, often using electroencephalography (EEG) to 
measure event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the N1 and P2 
components (Cao et al., 2017; Abbasi and Gross, 2019; Stenner et al., 
2014a; Mifsud and Whitford, 2017 ; Klaffehn et al., 2019 ; van Elk 
et al., 2014; Harrison et al., 2021; Hughes et al., 2013a; Dogge et al., 
2019; Han et al., 2021; Orepic et al., 2021; Weller et al., 2017; Stenner 
et  al., 2014b ; Cao and Gross, 2015 ; Loehr, 2013 ; Bolt and 
Loehr, 2021).
Findings generally indicate that SA manifests as attenuation of 
neural responses to self-generated sounds compared to externally 
generated sounds. This attenuation is thought to result from predictive 
mechanisms in the brain that anticipate the sensory consequences of 
one’s own actions (Cao et  al., 2017; Abbasi and Gross, 2019 ). For 
example, Abbasi and Gross (2019)  highlighted the role of beta 
oscillations in regulating top-down interactions between motor and 
auditory cortices, supporting the predictive coding framework.
Some studies explored SA in joint action contexts. Loehr (2013) 
and Bolt and Loehr (2021)  investigated whether SA occurs when 
individuals jointly produce sounds with others. They found that SA 
can help individuals distinguish between self-generated and partner-
generated sounds during coordinated activities.
3.3.1.3 Tactile-proprioceptive domain
Seventeen studies investigated SA in the tactile-proprioceptive 
domain, using methods such as force-matching paradigms, gentle 
touch, and nerve stimulation (Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017; Palmer et al., 
2016; Lee and Schmit, 2018; Parthasharathy et al., 2022; Knoetsch and 
Zimmermann, 2021; Lalouni et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2021; Windt 
et  al., 2014; Hughes, 2015; Burin et  al., 2017; Nuruki et  al., 2019; 
McNaughton et  al., 2021; Fritz and Zimmermann, 2023 ; Gentsch 
et al., 2015; Boehme et al., 2019; Pyasik et al., 2021; Fritsch et al., 2021).
Results suggest that SA leads to reduced perception of self-
generated touch compared to externally generated touch. This 
phenomenon is attributed to internal predictive models that anticipate 
sensory consequences of voluntary actions, leading to attenuation of 
expected sensations (Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017; Palmer et al., 2016). 
SA in this domain is spatially specific (Knoetsch and Zimmermann, 
2021) and can be influenced by factors such as age (Parthasharathy 
et al., 2022) and the presence of pain (Lalouni et al., 2021).
FIGURE 3

Rossi et al. 10.3389/fnins.2025.1590127
Frontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org
For example, Parthasharathy et al. (2022) found that older adults 
exhibited higher levels of SA compared to younger adults, potentially 
due to age-related proprioceptive deficits. Lalouni et  al. (2021)  
demonstrated that SA occurs for self-generated pressure pain 
conditions, which could have clinical implications for 
pain management.
3.3.2 Sensory attenuation in functional 
neurological disorders and neurological disorders
Ten studies examined SA in populations with FND and other 
neurological conditions, including PD, HD, ASD, and individuals at 
high clinical risk for psychosis (Macerollo et al., 2015; Pareés et al., 
2014; Wolpe et  al., 2018; Kearney and Brittain, 2021 ; Porciuncula 
et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2023; Adams et al., 2013; Ciaunica et al., 2022; 
Finnemann et al., 2021; van Laarhoven et al., 2019).
3.3.2.1 Functional neurological disorders
In studies focusing on FND, patients exhibited reduced SA 
compared to healthy controls. Pareés et al. (2014) found that patients 
with FND did not overestimate the force to be  used in a force-
matching task, indicating a significant loss of SA. This reduction in SA 
may be  related to an altered sense of agency, suggesting why 
individuals with FND perceive abnormal movements as unintentional.
Macerollo et al. (2015) corroborated these findings, showing that 
patients with functional movement disorders exhibited decreased SA, 
potentially linked to impaired motor control and agency.
3.3.2.2 Parkinson’s disease
In PD, Wolpe et al. (2018) investigated the effects of dopaminergic 
treatment on SA. They found that medication increased SA and 
improved the accuracy of sensory and motor predictions. This 
suggests that bradykinesia in PD may be associated with impaired 
sensory and motor anticipation, which can be  modulated 
by dopamine.
Kearney and Brittain (2021)  discussed the role of SA in PD, 
highlighting that patients may have difficulty integrating sensory 
stimuli, which affects movement production and perception.
3.3.2.3 Autism spectrum disorder
Studies on ASD revealed mixed results. Finnemann et al. (2021) 
found that individuals with ASD showed intact predictive and 
postdictive mechanisms of SA, suggesting that a general deficit in 
predictive processing is unlikely. However, van Laarhoven et al. (2019) 
reported that individuals with ASD exhibited impaired SA for self-
generated sounds, indicating deficits in motor-auditory prediction and 
supporting the notion of atypical sensory processing in ASD.

connecting them are indicators of a strong correlation.

3.3.2.4 High clinical risk for psychosis
Hua et  al. (2023) examined SA deficits in individuals at high 
clinical risk for psychosis and those with a first episode of psychosis. 
They found alterations in SA-related brain activity in auditory and 
thalamic regions, suggesting that early stages of psychosis are 
characterised by impaired ability to predict sensory consequences 
of actions.
3.3.2.5 Sensory attenuation in chronic pain
McNaughton et al. (2022a) compared SA between individuals 
with chronic pain and healthy controls using a force-matching task. 
While no significant differences were found in the magnitude of SA 
between groups, patients with chronic pain exhibited greater 
variability in SA, indicating altered sensory processing and potential 
disruptions in predictive mechanisms.
3.3.3 Measurement of sensory attenuation
A more granular understanding of the measurement techniques 
for sensory attenuation is essential for translational application in 
clinical contexts. The force-matching paradigm remains the most 
widely used behavioural method, offering simplicity, low cost, and 
ecological validity. It enables quantification of sensory prediction 
errors by comparing externally versus self-generated force perception 
(Hughes et  al., 2013b). However, its reliance on voluntary motor 
output limits use in patients with motor deficits or paediatric/
geriatric populations. In contrast, neurophysiological methods such 
as EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) provide time-sensitive 
indices of SA via ERPs or frequency band modulations ( Sakkalis, 
2011). These modalities are highly sensitive to millisecond-level 
cortical dynamics, making them ideal for capturing prediction error 
signalling (Geukes et al., 2013; Sharon et al., 2007). Nonetheless, they 
require specialised equipment and expertise, and are less portable. 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while offering 
excellent spatial resolution, is limited by low temporal sensitivity, 
high cost, and constrained ecological validity ( Warbrick, 2022). 
Therefore, while EEG and force-matching offer potential for clinical 
adaptation, particularly with mobile EEG and tablet-based interfaces, 
fMRI and MEG remain best suited for mechanistic and research 
purposes. Future research should prioritise the development of 
portable, multimodal assessments that combine behavioural and 
electrophysiological indices to track SA in diverse patient populations.
SA has been measured using various methods across the included 
studies (Figure 5).
3.3.3.1 Implications and applicability
Understanding SA measurement techniques is crucial for 
elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying sensory processing in 
both healthy and symptomatic individuals (Figure 6).
3.4 Characteristics of included studies

in Supplementary Table 1 . This includes information on authors, 
year, origin, study design, aims, population demographics, 
intervention types, and key findings relevant to the scoping 
review questions.
4 Discussion
4.1 Interpretation and applications
The primary objective of this scoping review was to explore the 
role of SA in healthy individuals, FND, neurological disorders, and 
chronic pain. The secondary objective was to investigate how SA is 
measured in both healthy and symptomatic subjects and to assess the 
implications and applicability of these tests, particularly in individuals 
with PPS.
Our findings confirm that sensory attenuation is a fundamental 
neurophysiological mechanism by which the brain filters self-
generated sensory information, prioritising externally generated, 
potentially salient stimuli. In healthy individuals, SA facilitates the 
differentiation between self-initiated actions and external events, 
playing a crucial role in the development of a sense of agency (SoA) 
and efficient sensorimotor integration ( Csifcsák et  al., 2018 ; 
Parthasharathy et  al., 2022 ). This process allows for seamless 
interaction with the environment, wherein irrelevant self-generated 
stimuli are filtered out, enabling efficient and adaptive responses to 
non-self-generated stimuli.
In contrast, in individuals with FND and other neurological 
disorders, such as PD and HD, alterations in sensory attenuation have 
been observed. For example, patients with FND demonstrate reduced 
SA, potentially impairing their ability to recognise self-generated 
movements, which may contribute to the development and persistence 
of their symptoms ( Pareés et  al., 2014 ; Macerollo et  al., 2015 ). 
Similarly, research has shown that dopaminergic treatment in PD can 
modulate SA, potentially enhancing sensory and motor prediction 
accuracy (Wolpe et al., 2018). These findings suggest that deficits in 
SA play a critical role in the functional and perceptual abnormalities 
observed in these conditions.
Chronic pain represents another domain where alterations in 
SA are particularly relevant. The evidence indicates that individuals 
with chronic pain exhibit disruptions in SA mechanisms, which is 
likely to lead to heightened pain perception and increased sensory 
sensitivity ( McNaughton et al., 2022a ; Lalouni et al., 2021 ). When 
SA is compromised, the nervous system’s ability to filter out 
irrelevant sensory inputs is diminished, resulting in an exaggerated 
awareness of nociceptive and even non-nociceptive signals leading 
to symptoms such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, respectively. This 
over-attention to sensory input perpetuates the experience of pain, 
reinforcing a maladaptive cycle of hypervigilance and symptom 
fixation (Esteves et al., 2022 ). Thus, chronic pain and other PPS can 
be understood as a consequence of the brain’s impaired capacity to 
modulate sensory information, making SA a crucial target for 
therapeutic intervention.
In terms of measurement, various techniques have been 
employed to assess SA, offering insights into how this process 
functions across different conditions. The force-matching paradigm, 
a widely used behavioural task, has consistently demonstrated that 
individuals tend to overestimate self-generated forces compared to 
externally applied ones ( McNaughton et  al., 2021 ). Additionally, 
neurophysiological techniques such as EEG, ERPs, fMRI, and MEG 
have been utilised to measure SA by examining brain responses to 
self-generated versus externally generated stimuli across multiple 
sensory modalities, including auditory, visual, and tactile domains

(van Elk et al., 2014; Lubinus et al., 2022; Stenner et al., 2014b). These 
methods provide valuable insights into the supraspinal 
neurophysiological alterations associated with SA, especially in 
symptomatic subjects, such as those with PPS.
In patients with FND, altered SA may reflect disrupted predictive 
processing, contributing to the persistence of their symptoms (Pareés 
et al., 2014). Similarly, assessing SA in chronic pain patients could help 
identify maladaptive sensory processing patterns that perpetuate pain 
experiences (Lalouni et al., 2021). This has significant implications for 
clinical practice, particularly in the management of chronic pain and 
PPS, where interventions that aim to normalise sensory processing 
can be highly beneficial.
4.2 Implications for practice
A comprehensive understanding of sensory attenuation and its 
underlying neurobiological mechanisms is essential for clinicians 
FIGURE 5
Measurement of sensory attenuation (Larsson and Smith, 2011; Itthipuripat et al., 2019; Bowyer et al., 2020).

involved in musculoskeletal care, including osteopaths, 
physiotherapists, and chiropractors. Sensory attenuation refers to 
the brain’s ability to selectively filter and modulate sensory input, 
prioritising stimuli that are most relevant for generating further 
cognitive processing while ignoring less pertinent signals. In 
healthy individuals, this process allows the body to “disappear” 
from conscious awareness, maintaining a state of effortless 
interaction with the environment ( Leder, 1990 ). However, in 
individuals with PPS, such as chronic pain, this sensory attenuation 
process becomes compromised, leading to an overwhelming influx 
of sensory information that the brain struggles to manage effectively 
(Esteves et al., 2022 ). This breakdown in sensory gating lies at the 
heart of many chronic musculoskeletal conditions and serves as a 
critical target for therapeutic intervention.
The failure of sensory attenuation in PPS manifests as an inability 
to filter out irrelevant sensory inputs, resulting in an exaggerated 
awareness of bodily sensations that would normally remain 
subliminal. For example, signals related to interoception, such as 
heartbeats, muscle tension and proprioceptive joint movements, 
become amplified, contributing to the perception of pain or 
discomfort even in the absence of an ongoing physical threat. This 
over-attention to sensory input not only intensifies the experience of 
pain but also disrupts the individual’s ability to engage with their 
environment, reinforcing a maladaptive cycle of vigilance and 
symptom fixation (Esteves et al., 2022). Thus, PPS can be understood 
as a breakdown in the nervous system’s capacity to effectively attenuate 
and regulate sensory information.
From a neurobiological perspective, sensory attenuation is 
mediated by processes such as synaptic gain control, neuroplasticity 
and altered neuromodulatory mechanisms that adjust the precision or 
weighting of sensory signals (Friston, 2009). When these mechanisms 
are impaired, the brain’s ability to filter out irrelevant sensory 
information is diminished, leading to a state of constant vigilance and 
discomfort. This impairment can explain why individuals with chronic 
pain are unable to attend away from their symptoms or “turn down” 
the volume of sensory input, as their nervous (and associated systems 
see Kiverstein et al., 2022) fail to gate sensory evidence appropriately. 
This breakdown in sensory attenuation often results in an 
overwhelming and distressing influx of sensations, leading to 
heightened sensitivity, hypervigilance, and the perpetuation of PPS 
(Friston and Frith, 2015; Edwards et al., 2012).
In this context, the dyadic therapeutic relationship plays a 
pivotal role in helping patients recalibrate their sensory processing. 
By engaging in a shared therapeutic space, clinicians can facilitate 
the process of re-learning how to attenuate sensory inputs. The 
therapist-patient interaction serves as an opportunity to synchronise 
attentional focus and sensory processing, enabling the patient to 
regain control over their sensory experiences. This synchronisation 
is not merely a metaphorical connection but a tangible interaction 
involving physical touch, posture, verbal communication, and 
affective engagement, which are all crucial components in guiding 
the patient’s attention away from maladaptive sensory patterns 
(Esteves et al., 2022 ).
The dyadic therapeutic process offers a unique opportunity to 
restore effective sensory attenuation by creating a shared narrative and 
sensorium. This means that, within the therapeutic relationship, both 
the patient and the therapist contribute to a synchronised experience 
where sensory evidence can be reinterpreted and re-weighted. For 
example, through affective touch and other forms of hands-on therapy 
aided by careful language and demonstrated empathy, the therapist 
can help the patient experience sensations in a different, less 
threatening context. This process allows for the exploration of 
alternative narratives around pain and discomfort, thereby facilitating 
the re-establishment of sensory attenuation. By experiencing their 
bodily sensations in the presence of a trusted therapist, patients can 
begin to understand that not all sensory input requires heightened 
FIGURE 6

Frontiers in Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org
attention or response, gradually learning to filter out unnecessary 
signals once again (Vasil et al., 2020).
Moreover, this dyadic engagement aligns with predictive 
processing and active inference models, where the deployment of 
attention is understood as a form of covert action that adjusts the 
weighting of sensory evidence (Friston and Frith, 2015). Within this 
framework, chronic pain can be seen as a hypothesis that is repeatedly 
verified by selective attention to interoceptive and nociceptive signals. 
The role of the therapist, therefore, is to help the patient challenge this 
hypothesis by directing attention towards alternative sources of 
sensory evidence. This process helps to shift the patient’s perception 
of their symptoms, enabling them to develop a more adaptive sensory 
attenuation mechanism.
Engaging patients in active therapies that involve movement and 
sensory feedback, such as sensorimotor retraining, graded motor 
imagery, and attentional modulation techniques, can further support 
the recalibration of altered SA processes. For example, mirror therapy 
and virtual reality can provide congruent visual and proprioceptive 
feedback, allowing patients to recalibrate sensory predictions and 
improve the balance between expected and actual sensory input 
(Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017 ). These methods can help modify 
maladaptive generative models by providing patients with 
opportunities to experience congruent and non-threatening sensory 
stimuli, which over time can contribute to reducing prediction errors 
and improving functional outcomes.
The breakdown of sensory attenuation in PPS also underscores 
the importance of incorporating physical touch and interaction in 
musculoskeletal care. When patients experience pain, they frequently 
become hyper-focused on specific body parts, leading to a narrowing 
of their attentional field. Engaging in affective touch, such as gentle 
palpation or rhythmic movement, provides a form of sensory input 
that is less threatening and more predictable. This allows the patient 
to experience their body in a way that is not dominated by pain, 
facilitating the recalibration of sensory attenuation. For instance, by 
synchronising touch with the patient’s breathing or heart rate, the 
therapist can help the patient establish a more balanced and regulated 
sensory experience, promoting the attenuation of irrelevant or 
distressing sensory signals (Esteves et al., 2022).
Furthermore, educating patients about the role of sensory 
attenuation and its impact on their symptoms can empower them to 
take an active role in their rehabilitation. Understanding that altered 
sensory processing contributes to their experiences can help to 
alleviate anxiety and improve adherence to therapeutic interventions, 
ultimately supporting the restoration of effective sensory gating. This 
educational component reinforces the idea that sensory experiences 
can be  modulated, offering patients a sense of agency over 
their symptoms.
Ultimately, this dyadic approach to sensory attenuation and PPS 
enables a more holistic and effective form of treatment. By leveraging 
the therapist-patient relationship to foster a shared sensory experience, 
clinicians can guide patients towards regaining control over their 
sensory processing, thereby addressing the core dysfunctions that 
sustain chronic pain and other related conditions. This integrative 
approach aligns with modulatory theories of pain but extends beyond 
it, offering a comprehensive framework that addresses the root of 
sensory dysregulation. As Esteves et  al. (2022)  emphasise, the 
therapeutic process should focus not only on altering the patient’s 
sensory input but also on transforming their capacity to modulate and 
attenuate these inputs, ultimately restoring the body’s ability to 
“disappear” into the background of conscious experience.
By emphasising sensory attenuation within the context of a dyadic 
therapeutic relationship, clinicians can address the fundamental 
challenges of PPS. This approach provides a pathway for patients to 
re-learn how to gate sensory information effectively, ultimately 
reducing their experience of pain and discomfort and restoring a more 
adaptive engagement with their bodies and environment. It is this 
shared therapeutic journey, grounded in sensory synchronisation and 
attenuation, that offers the most promising avenue for fostering long-
term recovery and well-being in individuals with chronic 
musculoskeletal conditions. This integration of sensory attenuation 
strategies into manual therapy and musculoskeletal care practices 
stands as a critical and innovative approach for improving 
patient outcomes.
Integrating SA-based interventions into manual therapy offers 
a novel pathway to modulate predictive coding mechanisms and 
improve clinical outcomes in patients with PPS. Manual therapy 
inherently provides controlled tactile and proprioceptive input, 
making it an ideal platform for modifying sensory precision 
estimates and reducing prediction error within sensorimotor 
systems (Esteves et al., 2022 ). Techniques such as affective touch, 
passive joint mobilisation, or rhythmic soft tissue work may 
enhance sensory attenuation by providing consistent, low-threat 
input that aligns with patient expectations and reinforces adaptive 
sensorimotor models ( Kim et  al., 2022 ; McParlin et  al., 2023 ). 
Additionally, coupling manual therapy with explicit attentional 
guidance or verbal reappraisal can further engage top-down 
mechanisms that regulate sensory filtering ( Cerritelli and Esteves, 
2022). Emerging approaches suggest that layering manual therapy 
with technologies like virtual reality (VR) or real-time feedback 
from wearable sensors may further amplify SA by reinforcing 
sensory congruency. This integrative framework aligns with active 
inference principles and could help “retrain” the predictive brain 
toward more adaptive interpretations of bodily signals in functional 
and chronic pain syndromes ( Bohlen et al., 2021 ).
4.3 Strengths and limitations
This review offers a comprehensive examination of SA across 
different populations and sensory domains, providing a broad 
perspective on its role in health and disease. By including both healthy 
and symptomatic subjects, we have highlighted how SA functions 
across a continuum and how disruptions in this process can contribute 
to various conditions, particularly FND and chronic pain.
While our review acknowledges the considerable heterogeneity 
in study populations, experimental paradigms, and measurement 
techniques used to assess sensory attenuation (SA), we recognise 
that this variability complicates the synthesis of findings and limits 
generalisability. To address this, we  now propose a structured 
synthesis framework that stratifies findings across three axes: (1) 
clinical population (e.g., FND, chronic pain, PD), (2) sensory 
modality assessed (e.g., tactile, auditory, visual), and (3) 
methodology used (e.g., force-matching, EEG/ERP , fMRI). This 
approach allows for a clearer mapping of consistencies and 
Rossi et al. 10.3389/fnins.2025.1590127
Frontiers in Neuroscience 13 frontiersin.org
divergences within and between domains. For instance, force-
matching studies consistently reveal reduced SA in chronic pain 
populations but are less frequently applied in psychiatric cohorts, 
while EEG paradigms often highlight attenuated N1 components in 
FND but with differing baselines across tasks ( Wolpert et al., 2011). 
By structuring the literature along these axes, researchers can better 
identify gaps, methodological biases, and candidate targets for 
standardisation. This strategy aligns with recent calls to adopt 
transdiagnostic research frameworks and modality-specific 
mappings to overcome the limitations of small, siloed datasets and 
foster cumulative science in SA research. The complexity of SA and 
its underlying neural mechanisms suggests that interpretations 
should be  approached with caution. Additionally, practical 
applications of SA assessments in clinical settings remain a 
challenge, as many techniques, such as fMRI and MEG, are not 
readily accessible in routine practice. Although the force-matching 
paradigm offers valuable insights into SA, its application in clinical 
settings is limited due to the need for specialised equipment and 
time constraints.
Future research should focus on developing accessible and reliable 
clinical tools to assess SA that can be  readily integrated into 
therapeutic settings. This would allow clinicians to more effectively 
identify and address disruptions in SA among individuals with 
chronic pain and other PPS, enhancing the efficacy of 
treatment interventions.
5 Conclusion
This scoping review highlights the pivotal role of SA in filtering 
self-generated sensory inputs from external stimuli, particularly in 
chronic pain and PPS. Altered SA significantly contributes to 
symptoms by leading to heightened sensitivity and maladaptive 
fixation on symptoms.
Understanding SA offers valuable insights for manual therapy 
and MSK care. Recognising that disruptions in SA underlie many 
chronic pain experiences, clinicians can adopt person-centred 
approaches to recalibrate sensory processing through interventions 
like sensorimotor retraining, attentional modulation, and hands-on 
therapies leveraging affective touch. These strategies align with active 
inference models to update maladaptive generative models and 
re-establish effective SA.
The therapeutic relationship is crucial in addressing sensory 
dysfunctions. By fostering a shared therapeutic space, clinicians guide 
patients in modulating sensory inputs, helping them regain control 
over their sensory processing and reduce symptom burden.
Future research should focus on standardising clinically feasible 
SA measurement techniques and exploring how therapeutic 
interventions can modulate SA to refine treatment approaches. 
Investigating SA ’s role across different PPS populations may lead to 
innovative, evidence-based strategies within the active inference 
framework, enhancing the efficacy of MSK care.
To enhance the translational value of sensory attenuation 
research, we  propose several concrete avenues for future tool 
development and standardisation. First, the adaptation of force-
matching paradigms into app-based platforms using haptic-feedback-
enabled tablets or wearable sensors would facilitate bedside and 
remote assessments. These technologies can quantify sensorimotor 
prediction errors with high ecological validity and minimal training. 
Second, portable EEG systems, increasingly used in neurofeedback 
and brain-computer interface research, hold promise for 
implementing low-cost SA-related ERP markers (e.g., N1 
suppression) in outpatient settings. Third, multimodal integration 
frameworks that combine behavioural (e.g., reaction time, force 
perception) and physiological (e.g., EEG, EMG) measures could 
improve both diagnostic precision and inter-subject comparability. 
Developing consensus protocols for these hybrid models will 
be crucial for reproducibility. Finally, clinical trials should evaluate 
these tools not only as diagnostic endpoints but as therapeutic 
probes—assessing whether SA-targeted interventions (e.g., active 
inference-informed sensorimotor retraining, VR immersion) induce 
measurable changes in SA and symptom severity. Standardisation of 
SA assessments, including normative data across populations, will 
be  critical to integrating SA markers into stratified care and 
neurorehabilitation models.
In summary, integrating SA strategies into manual therapy and 
MSK care presents a promising approach for improving patient 
outcomes. By addressing sensory dysregulation and fostering 
collaborative therapeutic relationships, clinicians can provide more 
effective treatments, enabling individuals with chronic musculoskeletal 
conditions to achieve long-term recovery and well-being. This 
approach not only reaffirms the importance of SA in health and 
disease but also opens avenues for advancing patient-centred care, 
ensuring that therapeutic interventions are grounded in an 
understanding of the complex interplay between sensory processing, 
perception, and the experience of pain.
