We examine the neurobiology of intuition, a term often inconsistently deﬁned in scientiﬁc literature.
While researchers generally agree that intuition represents“an experienced-based process resulting
in a spontaneous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis,” we establish aﬁrmer neurobiological
foundation by framing intuition evolutionarily as a pathﬁnding mechanism emerging from the brain’s
optimization of its relationship with the environment. Our review synthesizes empiricalﬁndings on
intuition’s neurobiological basis, including relevant brain networks and their relationship to cognitive
states like insight. We propose that unsolved problems dynamically alter attractor landscapes, guiding
future intuitions. We investigate“opportunistic assimilation” through nonlinear neurodynamics and
identify hippocampal sharp wave ripples as potential neural correlates of intuition, citing their role in
creativity, choice, action planning, and abstract thinking. Finally, we explore intuition through two
complementary perspectives: the free energy principle, which models brains as minimizing
uncertainty through predictive hierarchical coding, and metastable coordination dynamics, describing
the brain’s simultaneous tendencies toward regional cooperation and functional autonomy. Together,
these principles provide a comprehensive neurodynamical account of intuition’s
neurophenomenology.
This is a paper about intuition. Over theyears, researchers have used a series
of deﬁnitions for this term, but Zanders, Olinger and Volz1–3 have argued
that the consensus is“an experience-based process resulting in a sponta-
neous tendency toward a hunch or hypothesis.” As such, intuition often
f u n c t i o n sa si n f o r m e dj u d g m e n ti nt h econtext of discovery, guiding indi-
viduals from tacit recognition of coherence to explicit insights, possibly
highlighting a continuum rather than a dichotomy between nonconscious
and conscious processes2.W h i l et h ed eﬁnition might only be“a general
consensus,” it does capture an interesting phenomenological aspect of the
experience: that it includes a subjective sense of knowledge (the“hunch” or
“hypothesis” to which Zanders refers), as though facts have been gathered
and a decision made— although the actual decision-making process remains
hidden from view, both objectively and subjectively. This sense of knowl-
edge also arises as a bodily sensation: a gut instinct or hunch3.
While intuition is a celebrated aspect of human experience, the lack of a
rigorous, operationalized deﬁnition for the term (Abernathy and Hamm4,
for example, identiﬁed at least twenty different deﬁnitions) stems from
disagreements about the neurobiological and neurodynamical processes
underlying intuition, and questions about varieties of intuition. Is intuition a
singular experience, wherein the same structures and processes involved in,
for example, Albert Einstein’s mathematical intuition, are also involved in
William Butler Yeats’poetic intuition?
Recent research has begun to address these issues, clarifying some of
the neurobiological mechanisms of intuition, especially as they relate to
emotion, reasoning, perception, insight, and decision making

open questions remain: How is intuition distinct from other cognitive
processes, such as memory? Is there a neurobiological signature that cor-

moods impairing the ability to intuitively make coherent judgments8.L a s t l y ,
in what way is intuition an embodied process, and what role does inter-
oception play in this process? In this paper, we will address these questions
from the perspectives of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy to
explore the neurodynamics of intuition and elucidate possible answers,
testable hypotheses, and experimental models.
From a neuroscientiﬁc perspective, Zander’sd eﬁnition spotlights three
essential components of intuition. First, it suggests the involvement of
nonconscious processes and, from an information-theoretic perspective, the
transfer of information. It is worth mentioning that we consistently use the
term information in this paper ina Shannonian sense, as an entropic
reduction of uncertainty. Second, this information is brought quickly
into conscious awareness. Third, a strong sense of agency and
veracity accompanies the arrival of this information
1.T h u s ,a n yc o m p r e -
hensive examination of intuition mustexplain the neurobiology and neu-
rophenomenology of these three elements. In this paper, we intend to do
just that.
Before diving into the details, it is helpful to discuss these ideas from a
broader evolutionary perspective. Intuition, insight, and analysis are three
processes that humans use to solve problems and make decisions. This raises
a question: What kinds of decisions did these systems evolve to make? Here,
we propose an answer. It is well-established that brains evolved to control
movement
9,10.A d d i t i o n a l l y ,m o v e m e n tr e q u ires prediction, which Llinas
and Roy11 termed the“prediction imperative,” stating that:“the intelligence
component of motricity requires, for successful wheeling, a prediction
imperative to approximate the consequences of impending motion.” Seth
12,
Buzsáki and Draguhn13,B u z s á k i14, Freeman15,K e l s o16,a n dF r i s t o n17 have all
argued that broader mental states, including agency, cognition, and con-
sciousness, derive from prediction. Thus, it is likely that all three cognitive
processes— intuition, insight, and analysis— originated as ways to predict
the consequences of impending motion.In this paper, we consider motricity
and the predictive imperative as crucial to the enactive and embodied
neurobiology of intuition.
To explore this concept further, we introduce the term“pathﬁnding.”
In robotics and computer science, pathﬁnding commonly refers to the
process an agent uses toﬁnd the most efﬁcient or optimal path through an
environment
18–20. Typically, pathﬁnding algorithms process a sizable
number of variables, spanning from spatial location to route selection to goal
hierarchy assessment. Here, we aim to expand that deﬁnition to account for
biological pathﬁnding necessities, including how an organism perceives and
processes its environment, encodes spatial information, and tests environ-
mental predictions via action, in what has been called the action-perception
cycle
21,22.I nt h i ss e n s e ,p a t hﬁnding is closely related to the use of affordances,
landmarks, path integration, cognitive maps, social information, and
movement through the action-perception cycle23,24.A d d i t i o n a l l y ,w ea l s o
use the term pathﬁnding to refer to the cognitive processes, both conscious
and unconscious, that organisms use to navigate their environment in
accordance with their goals, which includes intuition. We use the term
pathﬁnding not merely as a metaphor borrowed from robotics, but as a
conceptual bridge linking embodied movement, spatial inference, and
nonconscious decision-making. To clarify its use, consider the following
thought experiment: an organism faces a novel problem with no clear
solution or precedent, such as a scientistencountering an unfamiliar dataset.
There is no pre-learned script to follow, yet a directional“sense” emerges,
guiding them toward the next step. This guidance cannot be reduced to rule-
based analysis or associative memoryrecall alone. Instead, it resembles a
form of intuitive navigation through a high-dimensional cognitive space,
akin to pathﬁnding through an uncertain terrain. From a technical stand-
point, this form of intuitive navigation can be approximated as paths of least
action through a belief space— where, under the free energy principle, such
paths are modeled as minimizing the integral of variational free energy over
time, effectively optimizing posterior beliefs about the causes of sensory
input
25. We propose that such intuitive directional signals emerge from
dynamic, embodied inferences over possible future states, thus justifying the
term pathﬁnding as central to our hypothesis. Without it, we believe we lack
a language for describing how intuition moves not just toward correctness,
but toward coherence and action.
Functionally, then, we see intuition as an embodied, nonconscious
pathﬁnding mechanism, that helps an organism decide where and how to
move next— wherein, in cases like mathematical intuition or metaphorical
intuition, we are considering the“solution” (that is, the answer to a math
problem or the meaning of a metaphor) as a destination, theﬁnal step in a
path. Mathematically, in terms of the Bayesian mechanics that attends the
free energy principle, the notion of a path can be generalized to mean the
path of least action; namely, the trajectory or narrative that minimizes the
path integral of expected free energythat in turn minimizes expected sur-
prise or uncertainty
25.W en o t et h a tw h i l et h ep r oposed frameworks in this
paper draw on the free energy principle and metastability 26,27,w e
acknowledge that many real-world pathﬁnding problems faced by organ-
isms— such as selecting among vast, complex alternatives— are computa-
tionally intractable (especially in a Bayesian sense, see discussion below).
Classic problems like the Traveling Salesman28 and Knapsack29 problems
offer useful analogues here, emphasizing the complexity of real-world
decision-making30,31. However, rather than computing exact probabilities,
we propose that biological systems employ neurodynamical heuristics that
approximate solutions efﬁciently.
This means that the result of this search, the minimization of the path
integral, can be considered in terms of“uncertainty” about the destination.
With intuition, as Zhang
32 has shown, the signal itself is binary: yes/no, go/
no-go, approach/avoid. The signal isdirectional, providing the organism
with pathﬁnding information. Yet, this same signal still leaves much
uncertainty about the nature of the path itself. With insight, the signal
becomes clearer and contains more external information about the path, but
there is still uncertainty about the details. With analysis, uncertainty is
reduced further, as every step in the path is now understood (for details
about insight and analysis, see Kounios and Beeman
33). In line with Walter
Freeman’s argument about the“intentional arc” (see discussion below;
Freeman34), which also suggests a tentative order to this process— with
intuition evolvingﬁrst, as a kind of proto-directional signal, and insight and
analysis coming later, once organisms evolved the neural capabilities to
process more complex information. This raises two critical details about
intuition: one theoretical, the other speculative. Theoretically, as we explore
below, intuition is about reducing uncertainty in a Bayesian sense of the
term. More speculatively, intuition isto agency what insight and analysis are
to consciousness, with“agency” being the term that evolutionary neuro-
biologists use to describe theﬂexible decision-making abilities found in
almost all living organisms, from cells to human infants
35,36. We will revisit
these concepts as we move along.
To explicate these ideas, we examine what researchers have learned to
date about the neurobiology of intuition. Next, we separate and examine
three overlapping phenomena: intuition, insight, and analysis
32,33,37,w h i c h
extends our discussion from the neurobiology of intuition into its under-
lying neurodynamics. To expand further upon the neurodynamics, we
consider the work of Colleen Seifert. In her psychological research into
insight, Seifert38 built upon earlier work by Chase and Simon39,a n dp r o -
posed a distinct mechanism for storing important, yet unsolved problems.
These problems serve as guides for future intuitions and insights. Here, we
explore Seifert’s hypothesis from a systems neuroscience perspective,
arguing that rather than being stored in anatomical structures, these
unsolved problems form an“attractor landscape” that is subject to the laws
of nonlinear dynamical systems, including the free energy principle and
metastability (more on this below).
Building atop these foundations,we further propose hippocampal
sharp wave ripples as neural correlates of intuition. Research shows that
sharp wave ripples are involved in combining preexisting knowledge with
recently acquired information to inﬂuence creativity, choice, action plan
selection, and abstract thinking
40–42. These short-lasting fast oscillatory
patterns, which are the most synchronous neuronal-populationﬁring pat-
tern in the brain, occur during“off-line”states such as sleep, and also during
waking states and are associated with compressed replay of spiking that
https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08612-9 Perspective
Communications Biology|          (2025) 8:1214 2
occurred during waking experience40,43,44. However, this replay is often
mixed with patterns that reﬂect the combination of previous experiences or
“preplay” potential future choices. We will examine how sharp-wave ripples
are involved in pathﬁnding and how the information they generate is
processed by task-relevant neuronal structures and networks and then
brought into awareness via interoceptive processes, the“gut instinct” or
hunch (For more details, see Buzsáki14,40).
Finally, we attempt to answer a key question: Which modern theory of
b r a i nf u n c t i o nb e s te x p l a i n si n t u i t ion? To accomplish this, we draw upon
the two aforementioned theories: the free energy principle 45,46 and
metastability16,26,47,48, utilizing components from both to provide a neuro-
dynamical account of the neurophenomenology of intuition. The free
energy principle is based on the concepts of Bayesian updating and offers a
modeling framework in which the brain is cast as relying on predictive
hierarchical coding. It posits that brains, and potentially all living systems,
use prediction to minimize uncertainty (as quantiﬁed by free energy) and
resist disorder. This concept is equivalent to entropy, or expected surprise
49
in the Shannonian sense. Essentially, all brains have beliefs about what
causes particular incoming sensory information (priors, in Bayesian terms).
These beliefs are continually updated via the action-perception cycle and the
process known as“active inference”50, helping an organism optimize its
internal representation of the external world and better navigate it. This is
also why the free energy principle has been discussed as a modeling fra-
mework for understanding potential neurobiological mechanisms under-
lying creativity and insight
51,52. Here, we extend this work to intuition. Now,
although we frame intuition partlyin terms of Shannonian information
theory, we acknowledge that real-world environments are far too complex
for organisms to acquire complete information about all relevant variables.
In practice, intuitive judgments likely emerge from selective sampling of
salient information, with intrinsic or epistemic value, rather than exhaustive
information acquisition. This perspective aligns with ecological and
embodied accounts of cognition, in which organisms optimize behavior
under constraints, using limited but relevant information to motivate action
(e.g., Schwartenbeck
53).
Metastability47 p l a y sac e n t r a lr o l ei nc o r t i c a lc o o r d i n a t i o nd y n a m i c s .I t
refers to the simultaneous tendency for individual components of a system
to couple together while also remaining autonomous. In cognitive neuro-
dynamics, for example, different regions of the cortex, composed of distinct
neuronal populations, can simultaneously coordinate their behavior to
produce cognitive functions, while also expressing their own individual
oscillatory behavior. This allows the brain to rapidly shift its functionality to
make sense of the external world. Metastability is critical for cognition
54,
especially in situations that require sensitivity to both novelty and possibi-
lities for action55, which are two processes involved in intuitive pathﬁnding.
We argue that metastability can help explain intuition in several ways. First,
the metastable brain might balance various cognitive processes dynamically,
allowing intuitive judgments to emerge without overt analysis. Moreover, as
we explore below, intuition relates to past experiences and pattern recog-
nition. In the metastable brain, large-scale brain networks are quickly
accessed and interconnected, allowing for the subjective felt-sense of a
solution before slower processes take over. Second, for intuition to occur, the
brain might rapidly andﬂexibly integrate disparate pieces of information
from various sources, crucially, in a non-linear fashion. Third, intuitive
judgments may be transient, i.e., arising and fading suddenly. This is aligned
with metastability as a description of transient tendencies— that is, those
that exist between fully stable states. As aﬁnal thought, both free energy
minimization and metastability have adaptive value, meaning they have
b e e ns e l e c t e df o ri na ne v o l u t i o n a r ys e n s e
55.
The free energy principle and metastable coordination dynamics could
be conceptually viewedas two sides of the same coin, although further

the fact that the free energy principle casts internal (e.g., neuronal) dynamics
as a gradientﬂow on variational free energy, thereby furnishing paths of least
action. Variational free energy provides an upper bound on surprise.
Therefore, minimizing variational free energy minimizes surprise and
uncertainty. This can also be expressed as maximizing the evidence for
generative models of the lived world, or self-evidencing

principle is dual57.T h i sm a yh e l pe x p l a i nf e a t u r e so fm e t a s t a b i l i t ya n d
related neuronal dynamics, such as criticality17. Heuristically, this means
that to self-evidence is to keep an open mind (cf., Occam’s principle),
through coordinatedﬂows on variational free energy landscapes that— by
construction— feature metastability.
An overview of intuition neuroscience
While research into the neural correlates of intuition is sparse, especially
when measured against other aspects of decision-making, there have been
attempts to examine its phenomenology and neurobiology. One important
avenue of research has been a series of imaging studies of intuitive judg-
ments of coherence
2,6,7,58–61. In these studies, participants made spontaneous
judgments about “coherence,” determining whether a certain object or
sound or word shared patterns, structure or meaning with others in a given
set, or what vision scientists sometimes call“gist perception”
62,63.T h e yf o u n d
that a judgment of coherence correlated with early activation in the orbi-
tofrontal cortex (OFC), an area that receives input from all sensory mod-
alities and is crucial for emotionally-driven decision-making. Furthermore,
this activity also correlated to the phenomenological experience of intuition,
and could be separated from the characteristics of the stimulus, the
requirements of the task, and the participant’s explicit recognition of the
object, sound or word
60,61,64,65. Research has identiﬁed several brain regions
consistently involved in intuitive processes (summarized in Fig.1). For
instance, the orbitofrontal cortex plays a key role in emotionally-driven
decision-making and coherence judgments, while regions such as the
anterior insula and hippocampus contribute signiﬁcantly to the embodied
and predictive aspects of intuitivejudgments (see discussion below).
For instance, in their 2006 fMRI work on intuitive judgments of visual
coherence, Volz and von Cramer
6 presented participants with pixelated
drawings of everyday objects. These were rated as either coherent (those dots
look like a violin) or as incoherent (those dots don’t look like anything).
Drawings judged as“intuitively coherent” correlated with activity in the
medial OFC. Thisﬁnding was in line with earlier work by Bar
66 that suggests
the OFC provides an initial guess at coherence, and that this guess serves a
gating function, thereby limiting the number of object representations that
need to be considered. Importantly, Volz and von Cramer do not see this as
an example of top-down processing, stating:“The gist information is rea-
lized on the basis of the observer’s implicit knowledge rather than being
consciously extracted on the basis on the observer’se x p l i c i tk n o w l e d g e”
6.
(See below for further discussion).
Horr60 harnessed the superior temporal resolution of magnetoence-
phalography (MEG) to show that the OFC is an early integrator of
incomplete stimulus information. Using a semantic coherence task, they
f o u n dt h a tO F Ca c t i v a t i o ni n c r e a s e sa ss o o na ss t i m u l ip r o d u c eap h e -
nomenological, subjective feeling of coherence, before any activation occurs
in temporal object recognition areas. Moreover, this activity appears even
earlier for coherent stimuli than incoherent stimuli. They also found that
when words were presented sequentially over time, rather than all at once,
there was a dramatic change in neuronal activation patterns. These changes
in patterns involved a shift from the left OFC to the right OFC, and suggest
that there may be a second system designed to handle information that is
accumulated gradually.
In an fMRI study of a semantic coherence task, Zander
61 extended this
research in a number of important ways.I nt h i ss t u d y ,p a r t i c i p a n t sw e r e
shown three words and asked if they were related or unrelated to a fourth
word shown after a slight delay. Researchers found that intuition emerges
gradually, through a process of“spreading activation,” wherein judgments
result from“the activation of remotely linked semantic concepts that do not
yet lead to full conscious retrieval”
60. These nonconscious perceptions are
similar to priming-based judgments in their ability to inﬂuence subsequent
behavior, and resemble, the authors state:“the deﬁnition of implicit

memory3.” The fact that researchers have consistently linked intuition to
implicit memory implicates the basal ganglia as another relevant region of
interest, as this structure has been repeatedly linked to that process67–69.T h i s
idea receives further conﬁrmation from Wan70,71, who found that activation
in the caudate nucleus, a part of the basal ganglia, correlated with the
development of skills-expertise and intuitions about that expertise. Addi-
tionally, Remmers
72 discovered that the accuracy of intuition was negatively
inﬂuenced by anxiety, which also corresponds to anxiety’si m p a c to n
implicit memory, or what is sometimes termed“implicit memory bias”73.
Finally, Mega74 used fMRI to investigate intuitive versus deliberate
judgments during an emotional facialrecognition task. They speculate that
their results argue against populardual system accounts, which hold that
intuitive and deliberate judgments aresupported by two distinct cognitive
processing mechanisms75. Importantly, this study represents one of theﬁrst
attempts to investigate the underlying neural architecture of these two
systems, wherein the dual systems model would predict distinct neural
activation patterns. In this study, participants were asked to judge the
authenticity of an emotional facial expression. One group was asked to go
with their initial“gut” feeling, while the other was asked to take their time
and be deliberate. In general, the researchers found similar neural activation
patterns in both tasks, supporting a uniﬁed decision-making model wherein
both intuitive and deliberate judgments rely on similar neural processes.
However, some distinctions were alsofound. In the intuitive condition,
there was activation of left OFC, precuneus, intraparietal lobula, and bilat-
eral anterior insula. The bilateral anterior insula is intricately connected with
the OFC, and is known to be involved with interoception
76 and the accuracy
of interoceptive feelings77. They believe that these connections may
instantiate the feeling of intuition. In other words, these somewhat dis-
tinctive activation patterns reﬂect two of the deﬁning features of intuition:
nonconscious processing and phenomenological signaling.
An overview of insight research: a systems neu-
roscience perspective
In addition to these coherence studies, researchers have also examined the
similarities and differences between intuition and insight. In this work— and
in line with the aforementioned research— intuition is seen as coherence, or
the ability to create nonconscious links between information. Insight,
meanwhile, is the process by which the sudden comprehension and reso-
lution of a situation arises into consciousness
78. Thus, one major distinction
between intuition and insight is the transition of information into conscious
awareness6,w i t ht h ef o r m e rb e i n gi m p l i c i tand the latter explicit. Zander1
consider the explicit part of this process an integrative or second stage of
intuition. Zhang32 take this further, seeing intuition and insight as distinct
processes, with key neuronal, behavioral, and phenomenological differ-
ences. During intuition, for example, unconsciously activated neural
information guides the subject toward a binary (yes/no) decision, with little
concern for the results of that decision. This is contrasted with insight,
wherein the concern is with the nature of the solution, not with a binary
judgment about its coherence. Interestingly, intuition and insight differ
signiﬁcantly in problem-solving, with intuition often guiding noninsight
problem-solving through a gradual recognition of coherence, whereas
insight involves a sudden realization and explicit understanding of the
solution
79.
Another difference between intuition and insight is how each process
starts. Drawing upon the entropic brain hypothesis and the free energy
principle, Carhartt-Harris and Friston52 clariﬁed the mechanics of insight,
arguing that“insight often occurs as part of a process, the initial phase of
which involves an intention or plan, e.g., to discover something new.”When
viewed through the lens of predictive hierarchical coding, this urge to dis-
cover something new causes the brain to relax its conﬁdence in previous
assumptions or, in Bayesian terms, “high-level priors.” According to
Friston
46, the relaxation of high-level priors manifests behaviorally as open-
minded curiosity, or what’s sometimes called the“beginner’sm i n d”80.W i t h
insight, the relaxation of high-level priors reﬂects conscious decision-
making and an ongoing search process— ap l a nt od i s c o v e rs o m e t h i n gn e w .
With intuition, we propose that the relaxation of high-level priors is trig-
gered (or cued) by novel information in the environment or as the result of
internal neuronal events. In either case, this information is both noticed and
processed nonconsciously.
A related distinction between intuition and insight involves theﬁnal
step in the process, or the nature of the“solution signal” itself. With insight,
the solution can be expressed verbally, marking the point at which a solution
becomes linguistically expressible. From an information-processing per-
spective, this transition into language can be seen as a signiﬁcant reduction
of uncertainty, in line with the free energy principle
46.I nB a y e s i a nt e r m s ,t h i s
may correspond to model selection and reduction: pruning less likely
hypotheses in favor of a parsimonious explanation
52, which has been cor-
related with goal-directed behavior50. In contrast, intuition also involves a
reduction of uncertainty, but it doesso below the threshold of linguistic
expression. The intuitive signal,such as a hunch or gut feeling, may reﬂect an
implicit or embodied registration of coherence that remains inaccessible to
conscious verbalization32. Thus, from a Bayesian standpoint, intuition could
be framed as a sub-personal form of model updating that has yet to con-
solidate into explicit knowledge.
On this view, intuition could be regarded as a sub-personal exploration
of plausible hypotheses through short-term plasticity and synaptic replay81,
until an“Aha! moment”is reached and a suitably simple explanation for the
sensory evidence at hand is encountered (see Friston51 for a numerical
illustration). At this point, uncertainty is resolved, and the conﬁdence or
precision ascribed to various (Bayesian) beliefs increases in a way that can be
recognized, leading to insight and (propositional) beliefs that can be
reported. Interestingly, the increase in the precision of beliefs about
path plans has been associated empirically with phasic dopaminergic
discharges
53,82,83, which speak to the affective valence of insight84,85 and
thereby the possible implications for interoceptive inference and realization
of ‘gut feelings’
86–89.
A ﬁnal group of studies has attempted to tease apart the neural
underpinnings of insight versus analysis33,90. These studies have utilized
fMRI, EEG, and the Remote Association Test (RAT), which is similar, yet
different from the semantic coherence tasks used in intuition research.
Similarly, both tasks present a triad of words to participants. In semantic
coherence, a fourth word is shown that coheres or does not cohere (in
meaning, structure, or pattern) with the already presented triad. In the
Remote Association Test, a triad of words is shown to participants, and the
task is toﬁnd a fourth word that can modify all three. For example,“apple,
grass, sand” is the triad, with“crab” being the insightful solution. In general,
Fig. 1 | The neural networks of intuition.The ﬁgure illustrates the
distributed neural architecture underlying intuitive cognition, characterized by
metastable coordinated activity across multiple brain regions. Key structures
include: orbitofrontal cortex (red) integrating sensory-emotional inputs for
coherence assessment; anterior cingulate cortex (blue) regulating cognitive transi-
tions; anterior insula (green) processing interoceptive signals; basal ganglia (purple)
facilitating implicit pattern recognition; hippocampal-entorhinal complex (orange)
mediating experience replay via sharp-wave ripples; amygdala (yellow) incorpor-
ating emotional valence in risk evaluation; and precuneus (teal) supporting self-
referential processing. Together, these regions form a dynamic network that
oscillates between integration and segregation states, with intuition emerging as a
product of neurodynamical coordination that minimizes uncertainty through rapid
action-path prediction and selection.

insight is correlated with greater activity in the right hemisphere than in the
left, as the former has been linked to coarser semantic coding and is more
likely toﬁnd broader and less obvious solutions
33. Interestingly, during the
“preparation for insight” phase, these studies also showed activation in the
bilateral temporal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the hippo-
campus. While the role of the hippocampus will be explored below, these
results raise questions concerning the OFC. If intuition is a gradual process
with insight being the end of that process, why was there no OFC activity
during the remote association test? Likewise, in the semantic coherence task,
it is unclear why no activity was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, the
very region previously associated with conﬂicting solutions or strategies
91,92.
Lastly, right before the arrival of an insight solution, researchers also found a
burst of activity in the alpha band inthe occipital cortex that was imme-
diately followed by a burst of gamma activity over the right temporal lobe.
They argue that this pre-insight alpha burst reﬂects“transient sensory gating
that reduces noise from distracting inputs to facilitate retrieval of the weakly
and unconsciously activated solutions represented in the right temporal
lobe”
76,90. Thus, these results may be partially indicative of the nature of the
task itself— RAT versus semantic coherence— but they also highlight the
neuronal differences between intuition, insight, and analysis. Moreover, the
role of processingﬂuency and affect in intuitive judgments has been studied,
showing that increasedﬂuency and positive affect can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the perceived coherence of word triads, independent of their actual semantic
relationship
93. Last, research indicates that intuitive judgments of semantic
coherence can be made swiftly and reliably, even under tight response
protocols, suggesting that such judgments rely heavily on nonconscious
processes64.
Taken together, we propose that thesestudies provide initial evidence
for a neurodynamical approach to intuition. Theirﬁndings are consistent
with multiple theoretical frameworks,including the free energy principle,
which may contribute to explaining intuitive judgments. Theirﬁndings also
suggest roles for several brain regionsin the intuitive process, including the
orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, basal ganglia,
hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.
The neurodynamics of opportunistic assimilation
In the foregoing sections, we reviewed prior neurobiological research into
intuition, insight, and analysis. Methodologically, these phenomena were
tested in the laboratory with a seriesof contrived problems, wherein par-
ticipants were consciously aware that there was a task to complete in a short
time span. However useful these experiments are, they can be markedly
different from the real world situations that produce intuition and insight. In
the real world, individuals are not always aware that there is a problem to
solve, where to hunt for solutions, nor what kind of solution would be most
useful. Additionally, when solutions do arrive, many show up after a con-
siderable delay— that is, a long time after the original problem was
encountered.
Seifert
38 explored a scenario where an individual encounters a critical
problem, which they fail to solve, yet their brain recognizes the importance
of the problem and stores all the details. Later, if the individual comes across
a piece of information that can complete the puzzle, it is rapidly recognized
and utilized to create a solution. A hypothetical example might be useful: A
neuroscientist is frustrated by a problem in the lab and decides to take a
break and walk down a tree-lined street. Along the way, she passes a majestic
o a k .F i v em i n u t e sl a t e r ,s h eh a sa ni n tuition: a gut instinct that tells her to
stop walking and look at the trees. She doesn’t understand this feeling— its
meaning remains opaque. Yet the sensation is powerful enough that she
stops walking to stare at the trees. Some minutes later, while still staring at
the trees, the scientist experiences an Aha! Moment wherein she realizes the
tree’s branches resemble the structure of a dendrite, and her observation of
this branching structure solves a problem she has been working on in the lab
— an idea she then rushes back to the lab to test. In other words, awareness of
the problem remains nonconscious until the solution itself arrives. This
raises another essential distinction between intuition and insight. Insight is
characterized by feelings of unexpectedness, elation, satisfaction, and
conscious awareness— the phenomenological characteristics of an Aha!
moment
33.I n t u i t i o n ,m e a n w h i l e ,i sa nembodied sensation marked by
uncertainty about its origin and meaning.
The above scenario is an example of Wallas’s94 classic four-stage“cycle
of creativity”: preparation, incubation, illumination, and veriﬁcation.
Poser95 called this the“prepared-mind perspective.” Seifert38 attempted to
formalize this model, proposing that the mind cycles through a series of
information processing stages that begin withpreparation,o rt h ee x p l i c i t
consideration of a problem. This is followed byincubation, which entails
setting the problem aside and thinking about something else for a while.
Next are the third and fourth stages:illuminationand veriﬁcation— that is,
the arrival of the insight itself, followed by its validation. More importantly,
the authors propose that, during the preparation stage, when the mind fails
to ﬁnd a solution to the problem, these failures get stored in long-term
memory where they can help steer the individual toward a later insight— a
phenomenon they term opportunistic assimilation. In opportunistic
assimilation, the memory of an unsolved problem guides future information
processing by nonconsciously preparing the brain to recognize potential
solutions. This process, it is worth mentioning, is similar to how the brain
approaches unmet goals
42, and appears to work much like priming96, except
over considerably longer time scales.
To understand how opportunistic assimilation functions over longer
time scales, it’s helpful to consider the process from the perspective of
cognitive neurodynamics. Theﬁeld of neurodynamics emerged partially
from work in coordination dynamics97,98, which examines coordinated
behavior at every level of scale, from the coordination of neuronal activity
that leads to an intuition, to the coordination of bees in a swarm, to the
coordination of stars in a galaxy. As framed by Kelso16 and Kelso and
Engstrom99,t h eﬁeld asks the question:“H o wd oi n d i v i d u a le l e m e n t so fa n y
system at any level of description come together to form coherent patterns of
behavior, along with the form that such coherence takes?”These coherent or
— to use the more common term—“ stable” patterns are referred to as
“attractors.”When an individual has an intuition and/or an insight, this is an
example of a stable attractor, or a solution to a problem that is a temporary
point of stasis in an otherwise dynamic environment. When viewed through
the lens of the free energy principle, this solution can be modeled as a path of
least action toward a free energy minimum, corresponding to a metastable
set of neuronal states.
One of the central discoveries of coordination dynamics
47,54 is
metastability, a basic property of any system of coupled oscillators, including
neuronal oscillators. As mentioned, a system is metastable when its
dynamics tend toward a stable attractor(coordination pattern) but are never
entirely trapped by that attractor. Metastability allows a system to remain
poised on the edge of criticality, where it has remarkable information pro-
cessing capabilities
100 and maximum cognitive and behavioralﬂexibility,
without descending into disorder101,102. Intuition and insight, in order to
yield useful information for an organism, may require this level ofﬂexibility.
In this sense, metastability can be considered a kind of“enabling mechan-
ism” for both the prepared mind hypothesis and the process of opportu-
nistic assimilation.
Importantly, in metastable corticalcoordination dynamics, informa-
tion can be“meaningful”— in that it helps the brain coordinate behavior—
but without being consciously recognized as so48. This is what happens
during opportunistic assimilation. The storage of the unsolved problem in
long-term memory changes an attractor landscape, allowing the brain to
move closer to the edge of criticalityand, ultimately, a single attractor— that
is, the solution. Thus, rather than being stored in distinct anatomical
structures, we propose that these indices of failures to solve problems form a
multistable attractor landscape
98 that may reﬂect heightened uncertainty
(i.e., excess of free energy), which the system tends to resolve through
unconscious processes. Thus, when any potential solution to either a part or
the whole of this unsolved problem is discovered— or in situations high in
novelty, where a solution ismost likely to be discovered— we see a dynamical
shift in the brain, and this marks the beginning of the process we call
intuition. And, in the fullness of time, insight.

This shift, we propose, represents a relaxation of high-level priors, a
move toward increasing entropy in the hopes of obtaining“optimal grip”— a
term coined by philosopher Merleau-Ponty103. Normally, optimal grip refers
to an organism’s attempt to understand and then maximize the potential
beneﬁts of all of the available affordances in an environment— with affor-
dances referring to J.J. Gibson’s description of objects as“opportunities for
action”104. In their work on skilled intentionality and Gibsonian neu-
roscience, Bruineberg and Rietveld (2014) draw upon a minimal inter-
pretation of the free energy principle to position cognitive neurodynamics
within the larger dynamics of the self-organizing brain-body-environment
system, which, they posit, allows for a formalization of optimal grip.
Applying this to intuition, we go one step further; While Merleau-Ponty’s
use of word“environment” refers to the external, physical world
103,105,h e r e
we argue that there is also a form of“cognitive optimal grip,” where
internally-generated thoughts, especially partial solutions to important
unsolved problems, can also be included in the search. The resulting cog-
nitive optimal grip, which, in the termsof traditional intuition research,
could be termed“coherence”, is then broadcast to the rest of the system via
interoceptive mechanisms and, possibly, for validation purposes (see dis-
cussion below), corollary discharges
34.
From the perspective of coordination dynamics, this“coordination”
can be read as generalized synchrony or synchronization of chaos (inherent
in nonlinear neurodynamics). This ensures maximum mutual information
(and information transfer) across distributed neuronal systems, with a deep
hierarchical structure. Generalized synchrony of this sort emerges as neu-
ronal dynamics are drawn to synchronization manifolds that constitute the
attracting sets with a low variational free energy
106,107.S e eF r i s t o na n dF r i t h108
for numerical studies of generalized synchrony and the emergence of
optimal grip in the context of hermeneutics and communication.
Yet, to obtain an optimal grip, oneﬁrst needs to relax one’sg r i p .T h i s
implies a shift from the quasi-optimal grip that characterizes the attractor
landscape of unsolved problems to a state of increased entropy— the
relaxation of high-level priors— in order to introduce novelty and the pos-
sibility of new solutions (or therestoration of actual, no longer“quasi,”
optimal grip). This is in line with Carhartt-Harris and Friston’sa p p r o a c ht o
insight52,b u ta p p l i e dt oi n t u i t i o n .I ns h o r t ,w h e na nu n s o l v e dp r o b l e m’s
attractor landscape precludes the resolution of uncertainty, the brain moves
towards the edge of criticality, in order to obtain an optimal grip, and reduce
free energy51,53.
We note, however, that cognitive optimal grip does not rely on an
exhaustive analysis of all environmental variables. Instead, it emerges
through interaction with structured regularities— intrinsically motivated
(i.e., epistemic) affordances, heuristics or priors, and salient cues— within
high-dimensional and dynamically shifting environments. In this view,
intuitive behavior reﬂects an embodied engagement with both environ-
mental and internal constraints, enabling adaptive responses in computa-
tionally challenging, real-world contexts.
Taken together, both the free energy principle and metastable coor-
dination dynamics provide explanations of how the brain uses prediction,
uncertainty, surprise, andﬂexibility to produce intuition. But questions
remain. Does the brain index critical unsolved problems, such as survival or
long-term unmet goals, as failures? After all, ongoing survival is not only the
most critical problem an organism needs to solve; the problem itself cannot
be solved— thus, are existential threats considered unsolved problems? Can
this help explain why gut instincts— don’tw a l kd o w nt h a ta l l e y— happen so
quickly? Do failure indices get established in a single swoop (like our fru-
strated neuroscientist who goes for a walk), or can they be established by
open-loop problems or existential threats that cannot be solved?
The neurobiology and neurodynamics of intuitive
pathﬁnding
To begin to answer these questions, we expand upon a previously discussed
idea, which is the evolutionary argument that intuition is a pathﬁnding
mechanism, helping an organism determine where and how to move next.
In this sense, pathﬁnding is closely related to using affordances, landmarks,
path integration, cognitive maps, social information, and moving through
the action-perception cycle
23,24. Additionally, we also use pathﬁnding to refer
to the cognitive processes, both conscious and unconscious, that organisms
use to navigate their environment in accordance with their goals, and this
includes intuition. We attempt to do this by introducing empirical and
theoretical evidence showing that intuition correlates to activity in the
hippocampal-entorhinal system, which are the two main neurological
structures associated with pathﬁnding and many of the subcomponents that
make path-ﬁnding possible: space, time, intentionality or agency, and
action-planning14,34.
Speciﬁcally, the hippocampus contains place cells, which specialize in
tracking discrete locations, while theentorhinal cortex contains grid cells,
which specialize in tracking possible paths between these locations.
Importantly, this same pathﬁnding architecture forms the basis of episodic
and semantic memory, wherein events and facts are processed as discrete
locations, while all the associationsbetween them are processed as paths.
Importantly, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex not only store loca-
tions, events, and facts from the past (memory); they also use those loca-
tions, events, and facts to chart possible paths forward (action planning).
Buzsáki and Llinas state:“Navigation and memory are deeply connected.
Analogous to map- and path-based navigation, there are two forms of
hippocampal system–dependent memories: memorized facts (or semantic
memory) and one’s personal experiences (episodic memory). To reexperi-
ence egocentric episodes, we project ourselves back in space and time
(episodic recall), whereas traveling into the imagined future represents
planning (prediction).”
109 This aligns withﬁndings on the preselection effect
in short-term motor memory, where planned movements are more accu-
rately reproduced than passive or constrained ones, likely due to corollary
discharge signals that predict the sensory consequences of intended
actions
110.
Both of these ideas are furtherbolstered by the work of Walter
Freeman34, who noted that intentional action— or what could be considered
the source of“causal agency”— begins with future goals and the actions
required to reach those goals34. This is the aforementioned“intentional arc.”
Additionally, Kelso and Fuchs36 proposed a computational model of Rovee-
Collier’s mobile conjugate reinforcement of a prelinguistic baby interacting
with the world36. In their model, the sense of self emerges from the coupling
between the baby and its environment, and they demonstrated that a sense
of self emerges; a sense of agency is experienced, i.e., the Aha! moment of
“making something happen in the world.” Closely related to this, Freeman’s
work also shows that action demands prediction, and characterizes emotion
as a kind of prediction, or what he called the“stretching forth of inten-
tionality” and the“anticipation of future action.”
In this framework, intuition is a predictive emotion representing the
expected outcome of a particular path of action. This emotion may be
considered a “summary signal,” combining predictions about multiple
action-planning issues. For example, the risk-level of an impending action
and the energetic requirements of that action do not arise into conscious
awareness as separate signals, and are instead summarized by a single
predictive phenomenological sensation— an intuition. Equally critical,
Freeman also argued that this signal originates in the hippocampus. As he
states:“The global interaction of the motor, sensory and associational areas
create a spatiotemporal pattern that isconceived to express the present brain
state
111. Emergence of the pattern requires participation of the allocortex, in
particular the hippocampus. The present state evolves into a prediction of a
future state that contains within it aplan of action to achieve that state:“the
corollary discharge signals to the parietal cortex, resulting in covert‘actions,’
would allow the brain to evaluate the potential consequences of future plans.
Without any overt behavior, the mirror and corollary discharge systems can
then inform the brain’so w n e rt h a ts h ei st h eagent of this covert activity.”
14
(emphasis ours). Thus, whenever anindividual with an unsolved problem
encounters a potential solution, that solution can be tested against the
predictions captured in the attractor landscape and represented by those
corollary discharges, and this mechanism might be involved in the forma-
tion of a sense of agency.

Given the preponderance of evidence pointing toward the hippo-
campus as a crucial structure in intuition as pathﬁnding, we can now extend
this argument to hippocampal sharp wave ripples— a neurodynamical
process— which we propose as another neural correlate of intuition.
Research shows that sharp wave ripples are a pathﬁnding mechanism that
combines preexisting knowledge with recently acquired information to
inﬂuence creativity, decision-making, action-plan selection, and abstract
thinking
40–44. Sharp wave ripples have beenobserved in every mammalian
species examined thus far, including humans. They are comprised of a
“sharp wave”— that is, a negative polarization in the hippocampal CA1
layers— and the“ripple”: a short-lived fast oscillation (140–200 Hz) of the
local ﬁeld potential. These waves are the most synchronous neuronal-
population ﬁring pattern in the brain. They occur during“ofﬂine” states
such as sleep, but also during waking states. In both cases, they facilitate the
replay of spatial and temporal waking neuronal sequences, but in a short,
compressed manner. This compressed information can be replayed forward
(in the order the experience occurred) or backward
112, and then transferred
to other brain regions that support learning, memory consolidation, and
action planning. Essentially, sharp wave ripples are a subconscious
mechanism that allows an organism to explore options. They search
memory for stored sequences of past events to predict future outcomes.
They also compress information from the past and predictions to aid
problem-solving and augment path-planning. In their empirical work on
memory in rats, Fernando Ruiz
42 states, “sharp wave ripples can be con-
ceived as an internalized vicarious trial-and-error process thatﬂexibly
‘imagine’real orﬁctive alternatives to select an optimal path or construct
novel inferences without the need for movement-based exploration.”
Meanwhile, the failure to replay the appropriate trajectory sequence before a
choice is made can predict behavioral errors.
Additionally, sharp wave ripples help unite and explain a number of
unresolvedﬁndings about intuition. For example, Norman113 used a visual
learning paradigm to discover that both the successful encoding of infor-
mation and the successful recall of that information were preceded by higher
incidences of ripples, arguing that“hippocampal ripples may thus boost
recollections during episodic memory retrieval.” This ﬁnding may explicate
the phenomenological sensation of intuitive accuracy (that a gut instinct is
correct) and uncertainty (that the origin of this gut instinct is unclear) that
accompanies the conscious perception of an intuition. If the brain uses
ripples to increase recall precision, it makes sense that this extra neuronal
processing step would be represented in phenomenological experience as a
signal that the information is accurate. Yet, since ripples are a nonconscious
process, we would not be able to detect why we feel this information is
accurate (or, in neurodynamic terms, why uncertainty has been reduced—
only that it has). In a relatedﬁnding, Cox
114,115 found that there are also sharp
w a v er i p p l e si nt h ea m y g d a l a ,w h i c hcoordinate with the hippocampus
during NREM sleep. This may explain the powerful emotional quality of
intuition and how the signal itself contains both pathﬁnding information
(normally localized in the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex complex14)a n d
risk-assessment information (normally localized in the amygdala116).
Finally, the notion that sharp waveripples are key neurophysiological
components of intuition is in line with the literature on naturalistic decision
making, which deﬁnes intuition as decision making based on“situational
pattern recognition”117. In this framework, intuition requires a comparison
between a current situational pattern and situational patterns stored in
memory from previous experiences, or what is termed the“recognition-
primed decision model
118 ”. In short, a metastable attractor landscape that is
created by unsolved problems and activated by sharp wave ripples is a
putative mechanism for situational pattern recognition— an intuition.
Finally, intuition can be visualized within a neurodynamical frame-
work (see Fig.2), where sensory inputs and motor outputs interact dyna-
mically within the perception-action cycle. The sharp wave ripples
illustrated in Fig.2 highlight the crucial hippocampal contribution, inte-
grating past and present information to inform intuitive judgments and
facilitate effective pathﬁnding.
The neurodynamics of intuition: a theoretical outlook
In this section, we return to metastability and the free energy principle,
exploring both as powerful theoretical frameworks for intuition. Metast-
ability, as described above, refers to the co-existence of stability andﬂex-
ibility in neurodynamics, whereby brain regions simultaneously integrate
and segregate local and global oscillatory activity
47,98,119. More speciﬁcally,
the brain is highly dynamic, with different regions constantly interacting
and forming transient networks. Metastable coordination dynamics allow
for the rapid integration and processing of information across these
networks
120.K e l s o48 demonstrated that these dynamics underlie slower
conscious thought processes, suchas decision-making by analysis. We
hypothesize that metastability also underpins the rapid decision-making
required by intuition. By facilitating the formation ofﬂexible networks,
metastability allows for the seamless integration of information from both
conscious and nonconscious processes, leveraging implicit knowledge
structures and past experiences to create intuitive judgments.
More formally, intuition requires the activation of relevant associations
— the attractor landscape. To make use of that landscape, both pattern
recognition and pattern prediction are necessary
121. Because intuitive
judgments can arise quickly, all three processes must occur at high speeds.
Through metastable dynamics, the brain can operate on the edge of criti-
cality, allowing rapid access to its repository of learned patterns, and the
ability to use these patterns to generate real-time predictions about current
circumstances
122,123.R e c e n t l y ,H a n c o c k124 provided a comprehensive review
of the thirty-plus-year history of the concept of metastability, emphasizing
its signiﬁcance in understanding brain function and its role in optimal brain
function. Metastable coordination dynamics, originating in dynamical
systems theory, are characterized by a balance between integrated brain
activity and bursts of desynchronization for specialized functions. It has
applications in cognitive performance, aging, meditation, and the treatment
of various neurological conditions. Challenges exist, however, particularly in
measuring metastability; they are primarily due to the process’sm a t h e -
matical complexity and the need for heuristic markers. Of course, further
research is required. Additionally, metastability allows the brain to swiftly
generate these coordinated responses without the need for explicit reasoning
Fig. 2 | A neurodynamical framework of intuition within the action-
perception cycle.The schematic depicts how intuitive cognition emerges through
the dynamic integration of sensory and motor hierarchies. The central dynamic
attractor landscape represents the internal model that integrates sensory input and
motor output to facilitate intuitive judgments and decision-making. The sharp wave
ripple inlet symbolizes hippocampal contributions, combining past experiences with
present stimuli to shape predictions and pathﬁnding. The framework is grounded in
the interaction with the external environment, highlighting the embodied and
predictive nature of intuition.

or analytical thinking— an idea in alignment, we argue, with intuition as
rapid nonconscious information processing.
Meanwhile, the free energy principle is a theoretical framework rooted
in Bayesian inference and prediction. The principle states that the brain
continuously updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors (i.e.,
surprise, quantiﬁed as “variational free energy”) in order to optimize its
relation to, and interaction with, the external world46,125. It accomplishes this
by attempting to reduce the uncertainty, or prediction error, between
external sensory information and internally generated models. Funda-
mentally, the free energy principle is a statement about a situated agent’s
interaction with its environment, whether those interactions are perceived
consciously or not.
Importantly, as the entire body-brain system subserves the agent’s
interactions,“embodied cognition”also plays a crucial role in the free energy
principle
126. Embodied cognition refers to the fact that cognitive processes
are integrated with an agent’sp h y s i c a lb o d ya n di t si n t e r a c t i o n sw i t hi t s
environment, and that this combination shapes cognition. This is a causal
relationship. Many features of cognition are deeply dependent on the
physical body— meaning the body plays a causal role in cognitive
processing
127–129. The free energy principle builds on this idea, stating that an
agent continuously optimizes the relationship between its physical body and
the environment via“active inference,”or the brain’sc o n t i n u o u sg e n e r a t i o n
of predictions and the action adjustments needed to minimize prediction
errors
108. In the context of intuition, active inference involves the brain
rapidly (via metastability) generating predictions based on implicit
knowledge and past experiences, and using those predictions to guide
decision-making without conscious deliberation. It is worth noting that this
description of intuition is in line withhow the brain utilizes active inference
to process affordances, or what might be described as proto-intuitive
pathﬁnding
55.
Active inference is an application of the free energy principle to sentient
behavior that foregrounds embodied action upon the world, in the spirit of
active sensing and learning. A key aspect of active inference— that speaks to
a universal kind of pathﬁnding— is that agents entail a generative model that
includes the consequences of their own action
14. This immediately casts
overt and covert action in terms of planning as inference92,130,131. In active
inference, the likelihood that an agent will commit to a given plan rests on
the free energy expected if the organism were to follow that plan. The
expected free energy can be decomposed into expected information gain
and expected cost, where cost is justthe prior surprise associated with
uncharacteristic outcomes. The key point here is that to evaluate the
expected free energy of a path into thefuture, it is necessary to rehearse that
path; speaking to phenomena such as (p)re-play activity and the putative
importance of sharp wave ripples: e.g., Stoianov
132. The expected informa-
tion gain is clearly an important aspect of intuition, which lends any plan an
epistemic affordance
53,133–135.
We note here a distinction between intuition and inference. We argue
that intuition can be understood as a form of active inference operating at
sub-personal, nonconscious levels. It reﬂects the rapid deployment of prior
expectations encoded in hierarchical generative models, triggered by
environmental cues. While fast and feedforward, it still contributes to
uncertainty minimization, though often in a coarse manner rather than
through deliberative model updating. Thus, the difference between intuition
and inference, in the language of the free energy principle, is not categorical
but a matter of degree and temporal resolution. Intuition reﬂects fast,
heuristic inference operating at lower levels of the hierarchy, typically
without top-down cognitive access or reﬂective goal modulation. In con-
trast, deliberate inference engages slower, higher-level loops that allow for
the ﬂexible revision of priors and explicit planning. Still, both are enacted
through the same underlying imperative: to reduce expected free energy and
optimize agent-environment coupling.
Embodied cognition emphasizes the fact that the brain’s internal
models are built upon sensorimotor contingencies, or the law-like regula-
rities in the relationship between bodily action and the resulting sensory
feedback
136,137. As the brain moves through the action-perception cycle,
sensorimotor contingencies formthe basis for predictive models138.B y
integrating sensory information with motor signals and bodily states, the
brain predicts the consequences of the organism’s actions, in line with the
predictive imperative discussed in theprevious section. If intuition is rooted
in motricity, then sensorimotor contingencies play a crucial role in the
process
137. This means intuitive pathﬁnding is a form of nonconscious
embodied cognition, with active inference as an underlying mechanism,
which is also in line with how the brain processes affordances
55,139.
The role of interoception in intuition is also underpinned by embodied
cognition and the free energy principle. It is well known that interoceptive
signals, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, and visceral sensations like
gut movements, impact cognitive processes
140,141. By providing valuable
information about internal states, these signals also contribute to the brain’s
predictive imperative, helping to optimize the body-brain-environment
system by reducing uncertainty. Kandasamy142,f o re x a m p l e ,f o u n dt h a tt h e
interoceptive abilities of London stocktraders (their ability to listen to gut
instincts) predicted their relative proﬁtability and how long they survived in
ﬁnancial markets. Another line of evidence for this comes from Allen, Levy,
Parr, and Friston25, who used a computational model based on emerging
empirical data to show that an agent’s beat-to-beat heart rhythm contributes
to their affective perceptual beliefs. Then, by“lesioning” the model, the
researchers showed that perception changes and belief models get updated
(more formally, uncertainty) as posterior entropy increases.
Finally, the free energy principle states that all internally generated
models are hierarchical
25. This matters here, as intuition demands accurate
predictions made in short timeframes and based on implicit knowledge and
prior experiences. Hierarchical models allow for the rapid integration of
information across different levels ofabstraction, providing a rich context
for generating the accurate predictions that underlie intuitive judgments.
This also helps explain why Kahneman and Klein143 found that having
expertise about a subject improves the accuracy of intuitive judgment.
Expertise involves building better hierarchical models, which minimize
prediction error.
In summary, both metastability and the free energy principle offer
useful theoretical frameworks for explaining how intuition might operate in
the brain. Of course, these two approaches should be considered alongside
other theoretical perspectives as theﬁeld continues to develop. Aligned with
the strong currents in modern systems neuroscience, we argue that self-
organized dynamics play an essential role in the neural basis of intuition.
Metastability allows for the rapid integration of information and the acti-
vation of relevant associative networks. The free energy principle empha-
sizes the generation of accurate predictions, the reﬁnement of internal
models, the reduction of uncertainty, and active inference. While we note
that the intimate relationship between metastability, brain state shifts, the
free energy principle, and intuitionis only conceptual at this point, we
emphasize the preliminary explanatory power of this theorizing when
applied to the phenomenon.
Alternative interpretations
While we have proposed a neurodynamical framework that positions
intuition as an embodied, predictive, and metastable path ﬁnding
mechanism, operating under active inference, it is important to
acknowledge that alternative interpretations remain viable. Traditional
dual-process theories, for instance, distinguish between fast, automatic
(System 1) and slow, deliberative (System 2) processes, often assigning
intuition to the former
144,145. Our account does not reject this dichotomy
but instead reframes it within a continuous dynamical systems perspective,
wherein both intuition and analysis emerge from shared underlying
principles— speciﬁcally, hierarchical predictive coding and the resolution
of uncertainty across time scales. In this view, the difference lies not in
categorical systems but in the speed, accessibility, and neurodynamical
proﬁle of the cognitive state.
Moreover, some may interpret intuition as the byproduct of associative
learning mechanisms, particularly in domains where expertise has been
developed. From this perspective, intuitive judgments may not require the
https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08612-9 Perspective
Communications Biology|          (2025) 8:1214 8
dynamics of attractor landscapes or hippocampal sharp wave ripples, but
rather emerge from conditioned patterns of recognition and response.
While our framework accommodates this by proposing that such heuristics
are encoded within the same generative models that support active infer-
ence, we recognize the need for empirical work that can disentangle these
explanations. Whether hippocampal replay uniquely contributes to intui-
t i v ed e c i s i o n so rr eﬂects general memory consolidation and planning
remains an open question. Our goal here is to provide a generative, testable
framework that can integrate these perspectives, rather than to
exclude them.
Conclusion
In this paper, we have attempted to establish a neurobiological and neu-
rodynamical framework for intuition. Our work suggests that metastable
coordination dynamics and the free energy principle offer complementary
theoretical frameworks for approaching the phenomenon of intuitive
judgments. We also propose hippocampal sharp wave ripples as a putative
neurophysiological mechanism for this process, with the orbitofrontal
cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, basal ganglia, amygdala,
hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex all appearing to play key roles. Fur-
thermore, the work emphasizes intuitive pathﬁnding as nonconscious
embodied cognition— that is, a decision-making process rooted in motricity
and agency. We have also argued that intuition, insight, and analysis are
underpinned by distinct neurodynamical processes, which should include
changes in cortical functional connectivity. Particularly, although intuition
and insight do share some overlap, theyare phenomenologically different,
and some aspects of insight, such as conscious retrieval, Aha! Moments and
opportunistic assimilation may beexplained from the perspectives of
computational neuroscience andnonlinear dynamics. (See Table1 for a
succinct overview of these various concepts and theories.)
While our primary focus has been on the neurodynamical mechanisms
underpinning intuition, it is important to acknowledge that intuitive
judgments are not always accurate. Theprocess of intuition, like all pre-
dictive processes, is inherently probabilistic and therefore susceptible to
error. In certain contexts, especially under conditions of ambiguity or
novelty, intuitions may yield maladaptive or suboptimal inferences. This is
evident in reversal learning paradigms, where prior associations must be
rapidly unlearned, and intuitive responses can persist despite environmental
change
50,143,146. Nonetheless, such outcomes do not disqualify the process as
intuitive. Rather, they reﬂect the broader adaptive function of intuition as a
fast, resource-efﬁcient mode of navigating uncertainty. This process trades
precision for speed and operates below the threshold of conscious delib-
eration. As such, even erroneous intuitions remain part of the same
underlying pathﬁnding mechanism. Overall, we hope our proposal con-
tributes to the ongoing effort to develop a neurobiological account of
intuition and offers testable hypotheses for future investigation.
