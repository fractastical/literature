ABSTRACT
We argue here that the Origin of Life (OOL) problem is not just a chemistry problem but is also, 
and primarily, a cognitive science problem. When interpreted through the lens of the Conway- 
Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex 
dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to 
some – perhaps only minimal – extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or 
are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, 
and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude 
that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse 
embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the 
OOL problem.

1. Introduction
The Origin of Life (OOL) problem is ordinarily thought 
of as a chemistry problem [ 1 ]: how can the right mole -
cules, under the right conditions, be compartmenta -
lized in a way that initiates an autocatalytic process 
that maintains not just the right molecular concentra -
tions, but also the enabling conditions and the requisite 
compartmentalization? Many ideas have been sug -
gested, typically focused on either autocatalysis or com -
partmentalization as the primary problem. It is widely 
believed that multiple OOL events could have occurred 
on the early Earth, with only one lineage – that of the 
last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all known 
life – surviving [ 2–4 ]. It is also widely believed that 
OOL events could occur elsewhere, prompting searches 
for evidence of extraterrestrial life by various means.
The OOL event leading to LUCA and its lineage is 
important in a number of related fields. First, it repre -
sents an originating singularity that must back-stop the 
reproductive cycle that is a cornerstone of evolutionary 
biology. Second, by effectively defining “synthetic” life, 
it sets a boundary condition on synthetic biology and 
bioengineering, both efforts to create and study life-as- 
it-could be [ 5 ] in novel implementations. Third, it is 
a critical fixed point for exo-biology, pushing us to 
define what it is that we are looking for on worlds 
beyond our planet, and to construct models of what 
different origin stories would mean for the further 
development of complexity and intelligence. Most cru -
cially, it strongly impacts the very definition of “life”: 
a standard account in which life is a distinct category 
set apart from non-living matter is challenged by the 
need to identify and explain a sharp phase transition in 
which life arose from non-life. Related to this are ques -
tions of the relationship of life and mind. Whatever 
theories we formulate for the minimal dynamics 
needed to create minds, it is imperative to understand 
their relationship to the OOL. The conventional view is 
that cognition arose at some point during life’s expan -
sion along an axis of complexity, i.e. that cognitive 
beings are a subset of living beings [ 6 ].
Here, we review an alternative way of thinking about 
the OOL problem that is motivated by the Conway- 
Kochen (CK) theorem [ 7 , 8 ], a result in fundamental 
physics, and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), 
a theoretical framework that originated in neuroscience 
[ 9 , 10 ] and has been extended over the past decade into 
a description of generic physical systems [ 11–16 ]. The 
CK theorem characterizes all physical systems as agen -
tic in the specific sense of displaying behavior that is 
not, even in principle, predictable from local causal 
influences. The FEP characterizes all physical systems 
as inferential in the specific sense of behaving as 
Bayesian satisficers. Together, the CK theorem and

the FEP suggest a view of cognition that is substantially 
broader than mainstream views in biology, e.g. as 
represented in [ 6 ], and may even surprise advocates 
of basal cognition in, e.g. plants or microbes [ 17–21 ]. 
They suggest, in particular, that all complex systems are 
organizations of agential materials that perform 
Bayesian satisficing on multiple scales [ 22–24 ]. This in 
turn suggests that the OOL problem is not, or at least 
not just, a chemistry problem, but is rather a cognitive 
science problem: the problem of characterizing the level 
or type of cognition at which it becomes meaningful for 
a system to be considered living. It raises the questions 
of whether life and cognition are co-extensive, as many 
have argued [ 25–28 ], and of what specific attributes 
distinguish living cognitive systems from non-living 
cognitive systems if they are not. It suggests that devel -
oping methods to both identify and communicate with 
diverse intelligences with diverse embodiments that 
exhibit behavior in diverse state spaces [ 22 , 29–31 ] will 
be required to fully address the OOL problem.
We first review the CK theorem in x 2 and the FEP in x
3. We then consider the fundamental question of whether 
life is co-extensive with cognition in x 4. We discuss the 
extraordinary range of possible embodiments, over essen -
tially arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, that become 
available when the materials available in the universe are 
considered agential. We also consider the variety of state 
spaces that such systems may traverse over their “life -
spans”, some of which may be only minimally coupled to 
our familiar three-dimensional (3d) embedding space in 
which the overt behavior of familiar organisms unfolds. 
We formulate typical criteria for life, including reproduc -
tion with variation and autopoietic metabolism, in ways 
that can be applied to diverse embodiments inhabiting 
diverse state spaces. We then turn in x 5 to Enrico 
Fermi’s famous “Where are they?” question, and discuss 
the kinds of communication capabilties we might expect 
diverse cognitive systems – which we may or may not 
consider to be “alive” – to be capable of employing.
2. The Conway-Kochen theorem as a generic 
characterization of agency
In 2006, John Conway and Simon Kochen published their 
“free will theorem”; they published a more general, and 
hence stronger, version in 2009. The CK theorem concerns 
interactions between an observer and some system of inter -
est that comply with both Special Relativity (SR) and 
Quantum Theory (QT). The former requires that interac -
tions between system and observer are causal, in the spe -
cific sense of transferring information between systems i) 
forward in time and ii) at no more than the speed of light; 
indeed compliance with these two conditions define “caus -
ality” in SR. Figure 1 shows an interaction meeting these 
conditions. At every point on the “world line” depicting 
either system’s trajectory through spacetime, here for sim -
plicity drawn vertically to indicate the passage of time with 
no (relative) motion in space, possible past causal influ -
ences on either system are contained with that system’s 
“past light cone”, which is the region of spacetime, extend -
ing arbitrarily into the past, from which a signal propagat -
ing at no more than the speed of light could reach the 
system. As shown in Figure 1 , the past light cone of the 
system of interest at time t
2
, when it receives an action by 
the observer, entirely contains the past light cone of the 
observer at t
1
, when action on the system was initiated. 
Likewise, the past light cone of the observer at t
3
, when it 
receives an observational outcome from the system, 
entirely contains the system’s past light cone at t
2
.
The CK theorem in its original form states that in any 
observational situation compliant with SR and QT, if the 
actions of the observer at some time t
1 
are not completely 
determined by the events in the observer’s past light cone at 
that time, then the observed system’s response, at some 
t
2
> t
1 
to the observer’s actions at t
1
, are not completely 
determined by the events in the system’s past light cone at 
t
2
. The proof is somewhat involved, and depends on the 
earlier Kochen-Specker theorem [ 32 ] showing that obser -
vations compliant with QT exhibit non-causal dependen -
cies on context. The underlying intuition, however, is 
straightforward: the evolution of the quantum state of 
part of the universe can only be fully understood as 
a projection of the evolution of the quantum state of the 
entire universe. Local information, e.g. the information 
available from a past light cone, is never sufficient to 
completely specify a quantum state; this insufficiency of 
local information also underlies the Wootters-Zurek “no- 
cloning” theorem [ 33 ]. This is particularly clear in the case 
of spatially extended systems in entangled states, in which 
spacelike-separated components of a single system appear, 
in the laboratory reference frame of an observer, to have 
distinct past light cones. The insufficiency of local informa -
tion for quantum state specification applies to both the 
observer and the observed system, replacing the “if – 
then” formulation of the original theorem with the stronger 
formulation of the 2009 version.
The CK theorem shows us that, at least in the context of 
current fundamental physics, all systems exhibit one of the 
typical hallmarks of living systems: their resistance to local, 
causal determination of behavior, and hence their ability to 
act in ways that are surprising. It is possible to write this off 
as “randomness” or “stochasticity” and hence to view it in

essentially thermodynamic terms, but we note that doing 
so already provides the minimal requirement – a degree of 
autonomy – for a system to exist on the spectrum of 
agency, which can then be scaled up into higher forms of 
intelligence (with greater historicity, metacognition, etc.) 
by the processes of evolution or engineering. Here, we 
follow Wheeler [ 34 ], Fuchs [ 35 ], and others in interpreting 
the CK theorem, and indeed QT generally, as implying that 
all systems have a fundamentally agentic character. We will 
describe one way of formulating this in the next section: if 
two systems are distinguishable – formally, if their joint 
state is not entangled – they have independent and hence 
“free” choice of computations to perform on, and hence 
semantics to assign to, their inputs [ 36 ]. That such freedom 
of interpretation is the basis of agency is a key tenant of 
2nd-order cybernetics [ 37–39 ].
3. The FEP as a generic characterization of 
cognition
The FEP describes the behavior of physical systems that 
can be distinguished from the environments in which they 
are embedded, and provides a criterion that such systems 
must satisfy in order to remain distinguishable from their 
environments over some period of time. It can be stated, in 
obviously tautological form, as the claim that any system 
that is distinguishable from its environment must behave 
in a way that maintains its distinguishability from its envir -
onment, from the perspective of an external observer, and 
possibly from its own perspective [ 11 ]. More technically, 
any such system must behave in a way that maintains the 
conditional statistical independence of its states from the 
states of its environment. The FEP describes the mainte -
nance of conditional statistical independence as the asymp -
totic minimization of a variational free energy (VFE) [ 40 ] 
measured at the system – environment boundary, and 
describes the minimization of VFE as Bayesian satisficing. 
Intuitively, VFE is a measure of the system’s uncertainty 
about what its environment will do to it next; hence VFE 
can be interpreted as a measure of the stress imposed on 
the system by its environment, and Bayesian satisficing can 
be interpreted as deciding how best to relieve this stress. 
The FEP can thus be viewed as providing a dictionary for 
translating descriptions of behavior in the languages of 
either classical dynamical systems [ 11–14 ] or QT [ 15 , 16 ] 
into the languages of the cognitive, and when many agents

are involved, the social sciences. We will, in what follows, 
consistently use the term “agent” to refer to a system com -
pliant with both the CK theorem and the FEP, recognizing 
that the scope of this usage comprises all physical systems 
that remain distinct from their environments over some 
time period of interest, and that this scope is considerably 
broader than that of some other usages of this term; see 
[ 41 ] for a general review and [ 42 ] for a review specific to 
biology.
To see how the FEP works, let U (for “universe”) be 
some collection of physical degrees of freedom that is 
large enough to be considered isolated, and consider 
factorizations U ¼ SE of U into a system S and its 
environment E , by definition everything other than S . 
Note here that the relevant state space for the FEP, the 
state space of U , comprises all possible states of U as 
a whole, not just the possible states of S . The FEP 
describes the behavior of the two factors, or compo -
nents, S and E of U if and only if their states – which 
can be viewed as orthogonal projections of states of U – 
are conditionally statistically independent of each other. 
Conditional statistical independence of S from E and 
vice-versa requires i) that S and E are both sufficiently 
large components of U , i.e. that they are large enough 
to have “internal” or “bulk” states not directly affected 
by their interaction, and ii) that the interaction is suffi -
ciently weak, i.e. that the coupling between their 
degrees of freedom is sufficiently sparse. Both classical 
and quantum physics provide precise criteria for meet -
ing these conditions. Classical dynamical systems factor 
into two conditionally statistically independent compo -
nents if and only if a Markov blanket (MB) – a “small” 
set of states through which all interactions flow – can 
be defined between them [ 43 ]; see [ 11 ] for a definition 
in a generic classical setting. Quantum systems factor 
into two conditionally statistically independent compo -
nents if and only if the joint state can be factored into 
individual component states, i.e. if and only if 
U i ¼j j SE i ¼ S ij j E i in Dirac’s notation. If this 
condition fails, S and E are, by definition, entangled. 
If this condition holds, a holographic screen can be 
defined through which all interactions flow [ 36 ]; this 
holographic screen plays the same role in the QT 
description that an MB plays in the classical 
description.
Given this description of S and E , the distinction 
between S and E persists through time if and only if the 
MB, or in the QT case, holographic screen, that defines 
their mutual boundary B persists through time. Note 
that this B is a boundary in the state space of U as 
shown in Figure 2 , which may or may not correspond 
to a boundary in our familiar 3d embedding space. The 
boundary B is preserved, in turn, if and only if the 
interaction between S and E , which we will denote by 
the Hamiltonian operator H
SE 
that implements the 
interaction in QT, remains within bounds that i) permit 
sufficient thermodynamic free energy flows between S 
and E to power their respective internal processes [ 44 ], 
and ii) prevent any decrease in the number of “inter -
nal” states that constitute the respective “bulk” of S or 
E . The first of these conditions sets a lower bound on 
variation of H
SE
, while the second sets an upper bound. 
Such bounds on interactions are familiar in biology; 
they correspond to the bounds within which home -
ostasis (or allostasis or homeorhesis) can be main -
tained. If the size of the boundary B is allowed to 
vary slowly with respect to the “natural” timescale of 
H
SE 
while always maintaining homeostasis, these 
bounds correspond to bounds for allostasis or home -
orhesis. Minimizing variation of H
SE 
within these 
bounds is minimizing VFE and hence stress. The FEP 
describes systems as generically preferring minimal 
stress, i.e. states that are as close as possible to optimal 
homeostasis.
The FEP is based on the recognition that the internal 
processes implemented by S and E – which we will 
denote by the Hamiltonian operators H
S 
and H
E
, 
respectively, that implement these processes in QT –

into components S and E , with internal dynamics H

and

respectively. The interaction H
SE 
between S and E is defined at the decompositional boundary B between them, and must be 
weak relative to H
S 
and H
E 
to maintain separability. Consistent with Figure 1 , B has a temporal width set by the characteristic time of 
H

; with a lower (i.e. high-energy) limit of twice the Planck time [ 36 ].

 C. FIELDS AND M. LEVIN
can be viewed as representations, or in statistical lan -
guage, generative models, of the interaction H
SE
. Each 
of S and E can, in this case, be regarded as continually 
predicting, by executing their internal processes H
S 
and 
H
E
, respectively, that their mutual interaction H
SE 
will 
remain within its homeostatic bounds, which are the 
bounds within which S and E remain separable and the 
internal processes H
S 
and H
E 
remain well defined. This 
mutual dependence between H
S
, H
E
, and H
SE 
is parti -
cularly clear in the QT representation, where by defini -
tion, the internal process of the total system U is 
H
U
¼ H
S
þ H
E
þ H
SE
, and since U is by definition 
isolated, we can set H
U
¼ 0. We then have 
H
S
þ H
E
¼   H
SE
, so that if H
S 
and H
E 
remain within 
bounds required to maintain separability, H
SE 
must 
remain within a corresponding bound. Intuitively, if 
the dynamics of the internal bulks of a system and its 
environment are bounded, then their exchange must 
also be bounded. In this bounded condition, in which 
the bulk dynamics are individually well-defined and so 
can be viewed as implementing well-defined functions, 
S can be viewed as predicting the influence of E on its 
states, and vice versa [ 11 ].
For any system that implements a generative model 
of its interaction with its environment – effectively, 
a generative model of its expected inputs and available 
outputs – departures from model expectations can be 
represented by a variational approximation, namely 
a VFE [ 40 ]; again see [ 11 ] for a formulation in the 
current setting. The maintenance of H
SE 
within homeo -
static bounds by the actions of H
S 
and H
E 
can, there -
fore, be represented as minimization of this VFE. 
Minimization of VFE over inputs can, however, be 
represented formally as Bayesian satisficing; hence the 
actions of H
S 
and H
E 
can be viewed as Bayesian satisfi -
cing, and the systems S and E can be viewed as 
Bayesian agents. In FEP language, S and E engage, at 
all times, in active inference , both adjusting their gen -
erative models to account for incoming data and acting 
on each other to maintain their incoming data within 
model-expected bounds, i.e. within the bounds 
required to maintain separability [ 45–47 ].
Treating physical interactions between separable 
agents as active inference, with the outputs (“actions”) 
of one being the inputs (“sensations”) of the other, 
redescribes such interactions as communication. How 
each party responds to communicative interactions 
depends on its internal process, i.e. on H
S 
and H
E
, 
respectively, for systems S and E . These processes gen -
erate actions from sensations, and hence encode, typi -
cally implicitly, the “differences that make a difference” 
to each system, and hence the semantics, in Bateson’s 
[ 48 ] sense, that they assign to their sensations [ 49 , 50 ]. 
As H
S 
and H
E 
are conditionally independent in separ -
able systems, these semantics can be regarded as “freely 
chosen” in the sense of not locally determined, as 
employed in the CK theorem. Asymptotically, the FEP 
drives systems toward mutual predictability and hence 
a shared language, with generalized synchrony (i.e. 
synchronization of chaos) and entanglement as the 
asymptotic limits in classical and quantum treatments, 
respectively [ 15 ].
4. Life ¼ Cognition, or Life � Cognition?
By recasting fundamental physics in agentive language 
in a way that applies to all time-persistent systems, the 
CK theorem and the FEP erase any “bright lines” 
separating cognitive systems from the “merely physical” 
while providing a natural association between dynamic 
and cognitive complexity. Relatively simple, intuitively 
“dumb” systems like electrons or rocks are negligibly 
cognitive, complex, multicomponent systems like 
macromolecules, biochemical pathways, or cells are 
significantly cognitive, exhibiting features such as 
error correction, learning, and memory [ 22 ], while 
even more complex systems like octopi, humans, or 
ecosystems are even more cognitive; in all cases, to 
a kind and degree that must be determind by experi -
ment [ 51 ]. Indeed without further limiting assump -
tions, the CK theorem and the FEP are consistent 
with the radical panpsychism proposed by philosophers 
such as Galen Strawson [ 52 ] or Philip Goff [ 53 ]; see 
[ 54 ] for a cross-cultural historical review and [ 22 , 50 ] 
for specific discussions. However, since neither the CK 
theorem nor the FEP are themselves theories of con -
sciousness per se , they by no means require it (Fields, 
Albarracin, Friston, Kiefer, Ramstead, and Safron, in 
review).
Erasing the line between the “merely physical” and 
the cognitive immediately raises the question of where 
life fits in. Are we justified in identifying the living with 
the cognitive, as argued by Maturana and Varela [ 25 ] 
or Pattee [ 26 ], if doing so extends the meaning of 
“living system” to include everything that persists 
through time? How important are often-cited functions 
such as replication, metabolism, or compartmentaliza -
tion to the definition of “life” [ 55 ]? How important is 
organic chemistry – is it the exclusive source of com -
plex systems, or can other chemistries also generate 
complex systems autonomously? Is it even worth trying 
to define life in general terms, given just the single 
COMMUNICATIVE & INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY
 5
example of the lineage of LUCA [ 56 ]? It is worthwhile 
to consider the use of terminology in asking these 
questions. It is often held that applying cognitive 
terms to unconventional substrates (biochemical path -
ways, cells, organs, “machines”, etc.) is useless wordplay 
at best, and a category error at worst. We propose an 
instrumentalist stance, where ontological categories are 
not taken as inviolable philosophical givens, but instead 
must be updated with the progress of science, and the 
degree of utility of terms comes from the interaction 
protocols they enable or suppress. For example, the 
statement that a system is roughly in position X on 
the spectrum of agency cashes out via the degree of 
empirical benefits provided by using tools from cogni -
tive and behavioral science on that system. We have 
covered elsewhere [ 57–61 ] numerous examples of how 
such erasure of boundaries facilitates novel research 
programs and leads to new practical capabilities and 
discoveries, for example, in biomedicine and bioengi -
neering. Thus, the idea that cognition is extremely 
widespread does not devalue the concept, but instead 
suggests experimental testing, in new systems, of tools 
and concepts that have proven useful for understanding 
conventional embodied minds
The FEP originated as a theory of living systems, and 
it generates many identified features of life from its 
minimal physical assumptions. All separable systems, 
for example, must be compartmentalized, although as 
noted, they may be compartmentalized in a space other 
than our 3d embedding space. Gene regulatory net -
works, for example, are compartmentalized in a state 
space of molecular concentrations, while execution 
traces of computer programs are compartmentalized 
in state spaces of possible encodings on finite data 
structures. As noted above, the FEP generically repro -
duces the preferences of living systems for low envir -
onment-induced stress. The FEP generically reproduces 
three of the four “pillars” advanced as definitive of life 
(or in their terminology, “lyfe”) by Bartlett and Wong 
[ 55 ], dissipation, homeostasis, and learning, though 
some systems display these functions only in some 
minimal-complexity limit. The fourth pillar, autocata -
lytic reproduction, is not required by the FEP; however, 
any persistent, bounded system that interacts with its 
environment must, by construction, be autocatalysic. In 
particular, the dynamics of an open system that is both 
bounded and persistent must have both dissipative and 
non-dissipative components that, in classical formula -
tions, correspond to nonequilibrium steady-state solu -
tions that break detailed balance. Systems in which 
dissipative fluctuations average to zero appear conser -
vative, i.e. behave as classical objects, while systems in 
which dissipative dynamics remain significant are 
chaotic, exhibiting familiar characteristics of life, such 
as electrophysiological oscillations, biorhythms, life -
cycles and reproduction [ 13 ]. Reproduction is, more -
over, a natural strategy for any system attempting to 
reduce its local VFE, as putting a copy of yourself into 
your environment typically increases its predictability 
[ 62 ]. The FEP generically induces systems of sufficient 
complexity to develop neuromorphic morphologies to 
maximize information gain from their environments 
[ 63 ]. It generically induces compartmentalization and 
hierarchical information processing [ 14 , 64–66 ]. It 
induces communication and collective problem solving 
in groups of similar agents exposed to a shared envir -
onment, and hence provides natural descriptions of 
multicellular development, swarm behavior, and evolu -
tion at the population scale [ 67–70 ].
An obvious riposte to the claim that the FEP gener -
ically describes life is to point to complex artifacts with 
known structures, such as human-built computers, and 
to claim that they are obviously not alive. While such 
systems are compartmentalized, dissipative, and cap -
able of learning, this argument goes, they cannot be 
alive because they do not maintain homeostasis and are 
not autocatalytic. We must ask, however, whether this 
is merely an intuition pump. Organic-chemistry based 
systems exist to which we supply a designer-perfect 
environment, arbitrarily-large supplies of thermody -
namic free energy, and assisted kinematic replication 
with externally-supplied parts; examples include geno -
mic DNA, proteins, and viruses. If we constructed 
computers from organic parts and maintained them 
inside our bodies, would we still regard them as non- 
living artifacts? Many organisms, including not only 
obligate human parasites and pathogens but also most 
domestic animals, rely on human-supplied environ -
mental services to maintain homeostasis and repro -
duce – does this dependence on us render them any 
less alive? We ourselves are dependent on our microbial 
endosymbionts, as they are on us. All organisms are 
reliant on their environments; this lack of indepen -
dence from the environment could be considered defi -
nitional. Historically, “we know it when we see it” has 
not been a reliable approach to life or mind. We would 
argue that it is even less so now [ 22 , 31 ].
If the FEP does generically describe life, where does 
this leave the OOL problem? Was there just one origin 
of life, at the Big Bang? Or are OOL events ubiquitous, 
occurring wherever organic or any other chemistry is 
available to generate complexity? If the FEP does not 
generically describe life, i.e. if living systems are some 
proper subset of agentive, cognitive systems, what must 
be added to the properties and capabilities that the FEP 
does render generic to produce a definition of life, and 
6
 C. FIELDS AND M. LEVIN
how can such additions be squared with the increas -
ingly blurry lines between naturally-evolved systems 
and bio-engineered constructs [ 22 , 31 ]? Is, in other 
words, “life” an ontological category, or an interpreta -
tive construct [ 71 ]? One could, following [ 56 ], argue 
that such questions do not and even cannot matter. 
What clearly does matter is whether we can identify 
and communicate with the diverse intelligent systems 
that the FEP tells us will be ubiquitous, whenever we 
come across them.
5. Where are they?
The Fermi Paradox – why we have never observed evi -
dence of intelligent extraterrestrial life even though the 
observable universe is large enough that we might expect 
to – has been widely discussed since [ 72 ]. Webb [ 73 ] 
reviews 75 proposed solutions, while Gray [ 74 ] advances 
a general critique of the discussion. As Webb points out, 
however, both the statement of the paradox and its pro -
posed solutions implicitly model extraterrestrial life as 
similar to human life, psychologically and culturally even 
if not biologically [ 75 ]. This assumption adds drama, and 
lends much of the discussion an air of science fiction. The 
FEP models all systems as having a psychology that mini -
mizes VFE, and hence experienced stress, a psychology that 
even individual cells can have [ 26 ]. It associates psycholo -
gical complexity with system complexity, provided the 
bandwidth of the system’s boundary permits it [ 66 ]. 
Additional assumptions would, however, be necessary to 
predict a psychology similar to that of humans; hence the 
FEP tells us nothing about how prevalent a human-like 
psychology, let alone culture, might be. While we do not, 
moreover, have access to truly alien life, we do now have 
the opportunity to study synthetic and hybrid beings that 
have not been subject to the typical evolutionary selective 
forces across the tree of life. Cyborgs, hybrots, biobots, 
minimal active matter, and AI all present a unique chal -
lenge to the task of being able to predict emergent form and 
function when environment and heredity do not tell the 
whole story [ 23 , 76 ].
The FEP does, however, tell us that a cognitive system 
much more complex and intelligent that we are exists here 
on Earth. Phylogenetic evolution and individual morpho -
genetic development have the same formal structure when 
described by the FEP, differing only in spatial and temporal 
scale [ 77 ]; the entire lineage of LUCA can, therefore, be 
described as the morphogenesis of a single organism, Life 
as we know it [ 78 ]. We can characterize this organism 
genetically [ 4 , 79 ], and describe how its development has 
altered its environment [ 80 ], but our communications even 
with parts of it to which we are closely related are clumsy, 
and we have essentially no understanding, beyond the 
abstraction of VFE minimization and hence stress reduc -
tion, of its overall psychology. We are not equipped to “see” 
the environment of all of Life as we know it, and we cannot 
tractably model its overall interaction with its environment 
in any detail. Expanding the system of interest to the 
planetary Gaia of Lovelock and Margulis [ 80 ] – see [ 81 ] 
for a exobiological generalization – yields an even more 
complex system, some processes in which have been mod -
eled as active inference [ 82 ], but to which the above com -
ments about full or detailed models apply. What would it 
be like to communicate with this system? Can tools be 
developed to assist the mapping from theoretically pre -
dicted perceptual and goal spaces of systems such as these 
to our own – a kind of augmented reality to enable the 
understanding or even co-existence of highly diverse 
minds? Can a partial lifting of our innate mind-blindness 
be driven in the same way that a good theory of electro -
magnetism and its resulting technology enabled us to oper -
ate across an EM spectrum of whose existence we were not 
even aware? We do not know. The difficulties we have in 
recognizing perception-action loops, problem-solving 
behavior, and intelligent navigation of unconventional 
spaces of even our own natural organs [ 30 ] underscore 
the narrow filters that our evolutionary firmware provides.
A model of a physical system as an information 
processor – a computer – is a mapping from observable 
physics to a computable function [ 83 ]. The FEP is one 
way of specifying the general form of such mappings. 
Maps from observable physics to computable functions, 
including maps of the form specified by the FEP, can be 
constructed at any scale, with computational complex -
ity decreasing as the scale over which events are coarse- 
grained increases. Within a given scale, many distinct 
maps are possible. Any physical system can, therefore, 
be viewed as simultaneously computing many distinct 
functions, with which function it is “seen” as comput -
ing depending on the perspective taken and the mea -
surements made [ 84 ]. The FEP, therefore, not only 
describes generic systems as VFE minimizers at every 
scale [ 14 ]; it allows multiple such descriptions. Whether 
a description supports productive interactions with the 
system depends on how well it captures the way that 
the system itself measures and acts on its world – the 
“reference frames” that it employs to make sense of 
what its world is doing to it [ 15 ]. To understand, and 
especially to influence, how systems behave, it works 
best to communicate with them in their own languages. 
This is the phenomenon of scale- and description- 
dependent “causal emergence” [ 85 ], which we grasp 
intuitively with other people and, to some extent, with 
other mammals, can approach experimentally in the 
case of model organisms [ 86 , 87 ], but have only 
a theoretical grasp on in the case of generic systems.
COMMUNICATIVE & INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY

The FEP thus suggests that the solution to the Fermi 
Paradox is to drop our anthropomorphism about intel -
ligent life; see [ 88 ] for a similar conclusion from differ -
ent reasoning. It suggests that we are surrounded by 
intelligent life, some much more intelligent than we are, 
that we cannot yet detect, or do not understand and 
cannot yet communicate with. It suggests that intelli -
gent life pervades the universe, but that we should not 
expect it to resemble us in structure, embodiment, or 
habits. Supposing that we will encounter technological 
artifacts of a kind we might imagine someday building, 
or receive signals of a kind we might imagine someday 
sending, is supposing that intelligence implies 
a psychology, and a manipulative body, functionally 
similar to ours. The FEP suggests that life, and psychol -
ogy, are far more diverse even than the lineage of 
LUCA, let alone the sublineage leading to mammals, 
and to us.
Even given such expectations, however, Earth-bound 
life provides sufficient diversity to challenge our abil -
ities to construct models and conduct experiments. As 
[ 6 ] reveals, only a minority of life scientists accept that 
organisms are in general intelligent. We do not yet 
understand the sensory and behavioral capabilities of 
microbes in sufficient detail to adequately predict beha -
vior in novel environments; our understanding of 
eukaryotic cells, e.g. human cancer cells, is even more 
limited. Comparative genomics continues to reveal 
novel, apparently lineage-restricted functions, and 
genomic sequence diversity is large enough that lateral 
contributions from non-LUCA lineages, as illustrated 
schematically in [ 4 ], cannot be ruled out. Synthetic 
biology and biorobotics are, moreover, now construct -
ing living systems that have both no evolutionary his -
tories in their current embodiments and apparently 
novel problem-solving capabilities [ 89–91 ]. On the 
more macroscopic side, ecology remains largely 
a science of observations and phenomenological mod -
els, and we have little appreciation of even eusocial 
insect colonies as cognitive individuals. We struggle 
with finding ways to communicate with collective intel -
ligences, such as ant colonies (vs. the individual ants) 
[ 68 ], and are rarely aware that we ourselves are likewise 
examples of collective intelligence. We find it hard to 
recognize our cognitive kin at unfamiliar spatio- 
temporal scales or operating in unfamiliar problem 
spaces, and many scientists seem to work hard to main -
tain all manner of distinctions as a bulwark against 
losing what is left of anthropocentric ideas. Even the 
most basic aspect of being a real agent – having physi -
cal embodiment – is not nearly as solid as it once was. 
We can now understand ourselves as temporarily per -
sistent, dynamical patterns – not objects – like solitons, 
hurricanes, etc. Our nature as self-modifying patterns 
within metabolic [ 92 ] and cognitive [ 93 ] media forces 
us to confront the question of what other patterns are 
actually agents? The tenuous distinction between pat -
terns and objects – thoughts and thinkers – opens 
roads to recognizing an increasingly wide class of 
unconventional agents to which we had been comple -
tely blind [ 71 ]. We are, in other words, still only mini -
mally prepared to confront the other living systems 
present on our own planet. Intelligent life originating 
on other planets, or its artifacts, may be unrecognizable 
by us.
6. The Drake Equation in light of the FEP
The Drake Equation estimates the number N of extra -
terrestrial intelligent systems detectable from Earth as 
N ¼ Rf
p
n
e
f
l
f
i
f
c
L , where R is the rate of star formation, 
f
p 
is the fraction of stars with planets, n
e 
is the number 
of life-supporting planets per such star, f
l
; f
i
; and f
c 
are 
the fractions of such planets that develop life, intelli -
gent life, and technological cultures respectively, and L 
is the average time a technological culture is detectable 
[ 73 ]. The uncertainties in all of the factors except R 
and f
p 
are very large, and published estimates of N 
vary by many orders of magnitude. Implicit in the 
Drake Equation is the assumption that detectable 
extraterrestrial intelligent systems have undergone 
evolutionary, cultural, and technological developments 
comparable to ours; such systems are, for example, 
often assumed to be intentionally broadcasting infor -
mation about themselves or to be actively engaged in 
colonizing planets other than their own. Hence the 
Drake Equation is primarily concerned with the detec -
tion of artifacts – EM signals, material objects, or other 
information-bearing patterns that cannot be attributed 
to “natural causes” given known physics and chemis -
try. This focus on artifacts, and hence on finding 
evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence that is “tech -
nological” in roughly the way we are, but presumably 
more advanced, aligns the Drake Equation with its 
inspiration, the Fermi Paradox, but distances it from 
the primary concerns of exobiology. The relevance or 
even the meaningfulness of the terms appearing in the 
Drake equation have all been criticized; for a large 
sample of such criticisms, see [ 94 ]. For an alternative 
to the Drake Equation that estimates abiogenesis 
events instead of extraterrestrial intelligent systems, 
see [ 95 ].
The FEP suggests that the number of extraterrestrial 
intelligent systems is very large, but says nothing about 
their detectability. By characterizing all physical 
8
 C. FIELDS AND M. LEVIN
systems as Bayesian agents, moreover, it erases any firm 
distinction between “artifacts” and “products of nat -
ure”; any information-bearing pattern – anything dis -
tinguishable from noise – could be a “signal” s from 
a system with some level of intelligence. It suggests, 
therefore, that the actually important number is the 
conditional probability P ð r j s Þ that a extraterrestrial sig -
nal s , whatever its form, is recognized as such, via 
Bayesian satisficing, by us. In this it roughly agrees 
with Gertz [ 94 ], who argues that the only important 
number is f
d
, the probability of detecting intelligent 
extraterrestrial life by any means.
Humans are constantly bathed in large-scale infor -
mation-bearing patterns, from the non-uniform distri -
bution of visible stars to anisotropies in the cosmic 
microwave background [ 96 ], that we regard as “nat -
ural” and hence of no interest from a biological or 
cognitive-science perspective. Viewing nonrandomness 
at the Solar System scale as communicative similarly 
fails the test of utility discussed above. What, then, 
would be the utility of regarding a piece of space junk 
of clearly non-human manufacture as 
a communication, or as biologically meaningful? On 
the one hand, such a discovery would shatter our 
anthrocentrism, making it clear that we are not “alone 
in the universe” as many either fear or hope. On the 
other, it would confirm our anthropocentrism, by con -
firming our deep assumption that any beings out there 
are “like us” in significant ways. The utility of regarding 
such a discovery as not “natural”, in other words, lies 
not in how it allows us to better deal with our environ -
ment, but in what it tells us about ourselves. It would 
tell us that we are not unique, but rather in some sense 
inevitable. The Drake equation assumes, by including 
the term f
c
, these poles of uniqueness or inevitability. 
The FEP, in contrast, challenges us to imagine 
a universe full of intelligent systems, the vast majority 
of which are nothing at all like us. It re-interprets 
Gertz’s f
d 
as the probability that humans become 
smart enough to recognize intelligent extraterrestrial 
life when it presents itself.
A more radical take on the FEP is that it sets N ¼ 1 , 
by definition, for any observer, whether an individual 
human, all of humanity, the lineage of LUCA, Gaia, or 
any other system, large or small. The one other intel -
ligent system that is detectable is the detecting system’s 
total environment. Any system’s challenge is to under -
stand what its total environment is trying to tell it. 
One thing that its total environment cannot tell it is 
the origin of the boundary B between them, since this 
event is the OOL for both the system and its total 
environment.
7. Conclusions
The OOL problem has been framed against a background 
of classical physics operating in classical spacetime, and 
assumes an abiotic environment that operates as a classical 
mechanism. The Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free 
Energy Principle challenge these assumptions, the former 
by showing that local determinism conflicts with known 
physics, and the latter by providing a formal interpretation 
of even classical dynamical systems as Bayesian agents. 
Taken together, the CK theorem and the FEP characterize 
physical systems as at least minimally agentive at every 
scale, and suggest that life, cognition, and complexity are 
both inseparable and ubiquitous. If this is the case, the 
OOL problem is replaced, in practice, with the problem of 
recognizing and successfully interacting with diverse intel -
ligences in diverse embodiments, which may, but may not, 
involve familiar biochemistry.
