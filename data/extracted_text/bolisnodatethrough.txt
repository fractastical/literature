Abstract  
Thinking Through Other Minds (TTOM) creatively situates the free energy principle within real-life 
cultural processes, thereby enriching both sociocultural theories and Bayesian accounts of cognition. 
Here, shifting the attention from thinking to becoming, we suggest complementing such an account by 
focusing on the empirical, computational and conceptual investigation of the multiscale dynamics of 
social interaction. 
 
We applaud Veissière and colleagues for pursuing the ambitious goal of situating the free energy 
principle within the context of sociocultural processes (cf. TTOM; 2019). This is, indeed,  a much needed 
undertaking, which has only recently started developing, holding promise for advancing  not only 
relevant sociocultural research fields, but also computational psychiatry (cf. Friston and Frith, 2015; Bolis 
and Schilbach, 2017; 2018b; Gallagher and Allen, 2018; Constant et al., 2019). In fact, human cognition 
and culture have often been studied in isolation. For instance, the field of computational psychiatry has 
been de veloping rigorous experimental protocols and mathematical toolbox es to mechanistically 
explain  human cognition and action . Yet, until recently a rather individualistic perspective  has been 
adopted, which neglects levels of description beyond the individual ( cf. De Jaegher and Di Paolo, 2007; 
Schilbach et al., 2013; Kirmayer and Crafa, 2014; Bolis et al., 2017).  On the other hand, sociocultural 
fields, such as cultural anthropology,  have rightfully adopt ed a more holistic perspective to com plex

phenomena of life, yet frequently lacking formal descriptions of cognitive and biological mechanisms (cf. 
Seligman and Brown, 2009).   
An artificial dichotomy between the individual and the collective has inevitably led to  a ‘chicken-egg’ 
paradox (cf. Dumas et al., 2014). However, s uch causality dilemma s dissolve  once one considers the  
dialectical nature of human -becoming, which is multiscale, reciprocal, dynamic, cumulative and 
inherently contradictory  (cf. Vygotsky 1930–1935/1978; Dumas et al., 2014; Bolis and Schilbach, 2018b; 
Di Paolo et al., 2018) . Processes from evolution  and culture to individual development, learning and 
sensorimotor activity, can all be viewed as mutually interacting adjustments between the species and 
the environment. Here, reciprocity is deep, as “it is not only humans who change the environment, but 
the environment in turn changes them in face of their impact on it ” (Levins and Lewontin, 1985; Bolis 
and Schilbach, 2018b). TTOM, therefore, constitutes an important development because it addresses 
how human agents learn shared expectations and how they construct their own social niches in complex 
interaction between the individual and the environment.  
We concretely appreciate the consideration of predictive coding and active inference within a 
framework of ci rcular causality. Indeed, an organism can be viewed as embedded within the dialectic 
between the two above -mentioned processes, which in order to survive obeys a simple , but 
fundamental  rule: “adjust yourself to reality or change the reality itself ” (Friston, 2010; Bolis and 
Schilbach, 2018b). When it comes to TTOM, it is not only the agent which learns environmental 
regularities and adjusts accordingly, but the environment in turn ‘learns’ the agents’ ‘beliefs ’ through 
repeated and culturally regula ted actions. TTOM resonates well with the dialectical attunement 
hypothesis  (Bolis and Schilbach, 2018 b), which views human -becoming as the interplay between 
internalization and externalization  primarily within and due to culturally mediated social interaction, 
internalization being the “co-construction of bodily hierarchical models of the (social) world and the 
organism” [cf. predictive coding], while externalization the “collective transformation of the world” [cf. 
active inference] . In a nutshell , “ interpersonal statistical regularities shape multiscale hierarchical 
models on an individual level and vice versa”. 
To offer a formal description of how environment ‘learns’, the authors interestingly suggest twisting the 
modeling equations  by inverting relevant quantities across actions and sensations. This offers various 
potential modeling scenarios about the degree of interactivity within the system of brain-body-
environment-body-brain (cf. Froese et al., 2013). Here, a multiscale meta-Bayesian scheme might nicely

lend itself for modeling not only individual processes, but also collective and environmental interactions 
(Bolis and Schilbach, 2017; Brandi et al., 2019; Ramstead et al., 2019).     
Not only are we in line with the authors on conceptual and computational grounds, but also concerning 
the need for empirical studies.  To make this more concrete, we describe certain  experimental 
directions: Systematically varying s ocial structure, cultural and socioeconomic background, affective 
bonds and interpersonal similarity  across interacting individuals will enable  the mechanistic study of 
interpersonal attunement. With regards to psychiatric disorders, construed as disorders of social 
interaction (Schilbach, 2016), two-person (or indeed collective) psychophysiology allow s to move 
beyond the individual  (cf. Bolis and Schilbach , 2018a). Taking autism as a paradigm example, t he 
dialectical misattunement hypothesis has put forward a research line, which , moving away from an 
exclusive study of individual differences, considers types of interacting groups: i.e. autistic, neurotypical 
and mixed groups, expecting smoother interactions within the more homogenous groups or dyads (Bolis 
et al., 2017). Taken together, such experiments will not only inform TTOM within the ‘neurotypical social 
world’, but also open up avenues for evaluating and updating the ontological status of conditions, such 
as autism, as relational and interactional (cf. double empathy problem; Milton, 2012). 
Apart from praising TTOM, we would also like to point out a fundamental aspect which, in our opinion, 
would benefit from further elaboration. We feel that the potentially constitutive role of real-time social 
interaction in sense-making and human-becoming was not sufficiently taken into account  within the 
model (cf. De Jaegher and Di Paolo, 2007 ; Vygotsky 1930–1935/1978). It has been suggested that 
thinking about and with others might be fundamentally different in real -time interactive scenarios, as 
compared t o passive observational situations (cf. second -person perspective; Schilbach et al., 2013 ; 
Redcay and Schilbach, 2019). Crucially, such interactive interpersonal processes have been thought of as 
dialectically preceding the individual both in evolutionary and developmental regards  (cf. Bolis and 
Schilbach, 2018b; Tomasello, 2019). As Vygotsky proclaimed almost a century ago, “through others we 
become ourselves” (1931/1987). Yet, to do justice to the authors, the field today has not yet reached a 
conclusive consensus. For instance , while Di Paolo and colleagues  (2018) suggest that “interactive 
situations present a richer, more complex set of possibilities ” and “the key to our sociality is not in our 
heads or in our genes” , Schönherr and Westra (2017) claim to have (conceptually)  shown that “ersatz 
interactivity works just as well as the real thing ”, by ‘real thing ’ denoting genuine, real -time social 
interaction. We, therefore,  conclude our commen tary with a question  still  desperately begging for a 
definite  empirical answer . Does (real-time) social interaction matter… or is it all in our heads?
