While the ubiquity and importance of narratives for human adaptation is widely 
recognized, there is no integrative framework for understanding the roles of 
narrative in human adaptation. Research has identified several cognitive and 
social functions of narratives that are conducive to well-being and adaptation 
as well as to coordinated social practices and enculturation. In this paper, 
we  characterize the cognitive and social functions of narratives in terms of 
active inference, to support the claim that one of the main adaptive functions of 
narrative is to generate more useful (i.e., accurate, parsimonious) predictions for 
the individual, as well as to coordinate group action (over multiple timescales) 
through shared predictions about collective behavior. Active inference is a 
theory that depicts the fundamental tendency of living organisms to adapt by 
proactively inferring the causes of their sensations (including their own actions). 
We review narrative research on identity, event segmentation, episodic memory, 
future projections, storytelling practices, enculturation, and master narratives. 
We  show how this research dovetails with the active inference framework 
and propose an account of the cognitive and social functions of narrative that 
emphasizes that narratives are for the future—even when they are focused on 
recollecting or recounting the past. Understanding narratives as cognitive and 
cultural tools for mutual prediction in social contexts can guide research on 
narrative in adaptive behavior and psychopathology, based on a parsimonious 
mechanistic model of some of the basic adaptive functions of narrative.

1 Introduction
The ubiquity and importance of narratives has been recognized by many disciplines 
(Sarbin, 1986; Turner, 1996; Angus and McLeod, 2004; Boyd, 2010; McAdams and McLean, 
2013; Taylor, 2016), but an integrative model of the mechanisms linking narrative to human 
adaptation is lacking. Narratives are reports of real or imagined events, which can be presented 
in language (verbally or textually) or through sequences of images or other symbols. The

narrativity of these reports lies not just in their content, which may 
point directly to specific events, but also in their structure: that is, the 
ways in which the linguistic or other symbols convey a set of 
relationships among events, especially temporal relations (Bal, 2017). 
In addition, narrative has both social-interactional and cognitive-
representational functions ( McAdams, 2006; Hutto, 2007; Hutto, 
2017); however, the extant literature tends to focus only on one of 
these two related aspects.
This paper proposes a model of the adaptive mechanisms at play 
in the production and use of narratives that can account for key 
aspects of both their cognitive and social functions. We are concerned 
with the structure of narrative rather than with their content, and as 
such focus on the implications of the ability to produce narratives 
rather than what is told through them (Adler et al., 2016). Hence, our 
account is relevant to understanding structural features of narratives, 
such as coherence ( McAdams, 2006; Adler et  al., 2016) and their 
socio-cultural status as master narratives (McLean and Syed, 2015), 
rather than with the impact of specific narrative themes (Adler et al., 
2016) or fine-grained analysis of modes of narrativity through which 
experience is given story-form (Abbott, 2014; Bal, 2017).
To motivate our model, we  re-examine work approaching 
narratives from complementary perspectives: as cognitive schemas in 
personality and developmental psychology (Nelson and Fivush, 2004; 
Singer, 2004); as cultural tools in social psychology (i.e., master 
narratives; McLean and Syed, 2015), and as storytelling practices in 
anthropology and philosophy (e.g., Hutto, 2017). We argue that many 
of the functions associated with structural aspects of narrative can 
be understood in terms of the principles of active inference (see Table 1 
for a summary of the main claims). This perspective shows the 
complementarity of cognitive and social functions and points the way 
to novel directions for research.
Active inference is a theory of perception, learning and action, 
which aims to provide a unified explanation of these basic cognitive 
functions, as all operating under the same imperative to minimize the 
difference between what was expected and what was experienced (i.e., 
prediction error). Originally developed in computational neuroscience 
as a theory of the structure, function, and dynamics of the brain 
(Friston, 2010), active inference provides a broad framework that has 
been extended to explain cognitive systems across multiple scales 
(Friston, 2013; Ramstead et al., 2021; Parr et al., 2022). Recently, active 
inference has been applied to the study of social and cultural dynamics 
in humans, including: the enculturation of agents through immersion 
in cultural practices (Ramstead et al., 2016), the tendency to conform 
to social norms and abide by shared values in decision making 
(Constant et al., 2019), and the capacity for implicit cultural learning 
(Veissière et al., 2020).
Narrative capacity likely emerged in human evolution as a form 
of information exchange and knowledge sharing in response to 
specific adaptive challenges associated with living in groups 
(Sugiyama, 2001; Boyd, 2018). Narratives offered cognitive and social 
adaptive advantages for early humans by enabling more efficient 
storage and transmission of information among members of a group. 
This included the ability to convey information about the environment, 
inform others about potential dangers and resources, plan and 
coordinate collective activities, and pass down knowledge to offspring. 
The evolution of narrative is a complex process that spans the course 
of human history from early forms of communication in Homo erectus 
(e.g., gestures, mimetic expressions, and simple vocalizations) to the 
efflorescence of narrative forms in contemporary societies. 
Dissanayake (2012) suggested that the first narratives were musical, 
just as we can exchange information with toddlers using only sounds. 
The emergence of language ( Boyd, 2018 ) and preliterate poetics 
(Dissanayake, 2011; Collins, 2014) were pivotal steps that allowed 
humans to convey more information, as well share more complex 
experiences, and plan more complex activities. Language enabled the 
efficient expression of narratives, and narratives in turn provided a 
context for language development, in a bootstrapping process. Finally, 
the combination of cognitive predispositions for play, imagination, 
and linguistic skills allowed for the invention of narratives that 
extended beyond immediate reality, exploring a broader range of 
human possibilities through counterfactual, subjunctive, and fictional 
modes of cognition (Dor, 2017). Narrative practices of storytelling 
serve multiple social functions, including transmitting survival-
relevant information, regulating social relationships, and establishing 
the identity and social status or position of the speaker (Bietti et al., 
2019). The evolutionary approach has been expanded by examining 
the dynamics of the novel modes and media of narrative at play in our 
contemporary societies as vehicles for both local and large-scale 
coordination of groups, and as generators of increasingly complex 
identities and life trajectories for individuals and communities (e.g., 
Stubbersfield et al., 2017; Sugiyama, 2019).
In this paper, we  contribute to the evolutionary approach to 
narrative capacity by applying the framework of active inference to 
outline an integrated theory of the cognitive and social adaptive 
functions of narrative as concerned with generating and managing 
predictions. In effect, we argue that narratives are for the future. In 
what follows, we first present a succinct account of active inference. 
Then, we  present our argument through a selective review of the 
literature on relevant aspects of narratives. We illustrate the utility of 
the approach with examples. Of course, narratives come in many 
forms and are used in very diverse ways and detailed consideration of 
how each of these might benefit from an active inference view is 
beyond the scope of this paper. Further, we do not believe that active 
inference can account for all functions and purposes of narrative. 
We propose an approach to narrative that leverages the resources of 
active inference to account for some key features of narrative relevant 
to their evolutionary emergence and adaptive function. An active 
inference model of narrative can clarify some mechanisms at play in 
the use of narrative in adaptation and everyday functioning at both 
individual and group levels. This can guide novel research on narrative 
inquiry and inference as well as on potential maladaptive consequences 
of certain forms of narration.
2 Active inference
What follows is a brief, non-technical overview of active inference. 
More extensive and technical presentations of active inference are 
available (e.g., Parr et al., 2022).
2.1 Perception and action
Active inference emerged from predictive processing, an umbrella 
term referring to several related approaches to modeling brain 
function (e.g., Rao and Ballard, 1999 ; Clark, 2015 ). The basic 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org
assumption in these approaches is that the brain uses predictive 
coding algorithms to process sensory information more efficiently. 
These algorithms are more efficient because they limit information 
processing to predictions and prediction-errors. Instead of analyzing 
the entirety of sensory data from the bottom up, the brain uses its best 
model of the world to predict what the sensations in a forthcoming 
event will be, and only processes signals that track divergences 
between expected and actual sensory data. Such models are called 
‘generative models’ because they are models of what ‘generates’ the 
observable sensations from unobservable causes (which are variously 
called states of affairs in the world, hidden states, latent states, etc.)
The strategy of prediction error minimization can lead to a major 
economy in information processing because sensations that were 
accurately predicted need not be further processed. In addition, the 
prediction errors are used to constantly improve the generative model 
in an iterative process. Of course, the perfect model can never 
be  obtained, both because we  live in dynamic, ever-changing 
environments and because we  never have complete access to our 
environment through our senses. Thus, the current best model is not 
the “true” representation of the environment, but the one that yields 
the least prediction error relative to one’s adaptive goals or necessities.
According to active inference, perception, learning and action 
selection are the “internal” solutions an agent has for keeping track of 
and modeling an ever-changing world. Active inference can be viewed 
as an extension of the predictive coding framework to account for action, 
using the same processes as those pertaining to perception under 
predictive processing (Parr et al., 2022). To extend this logic to action, it 
is posited that predictions are made about body position and an action 
is a process of matching bodily state to prediction, in a self-fulfilling 
prophecy of sorts. By incorporating action as a prediction-error 
minimization process, active inference addresses the problem of 
evolutionary adaptation to ever-changing environments. On the sensory 
side of the loop, action is cast as the process whereby the agent proactively 
and selectively samples sensory data that conform to its expectations 
about the kinds of outcomes and events that it should encounter, and on 
the motor side of the loop, the production of movements conform to its 
expectations serves to further minimize prediction error.
More formally, action, or the selection of one among competing 
plans or courses of action (which are called policies in the active 
inference literature) is based upon a generative model of the 
consequences of action (e.g., ‘What will my action lead me to see if 
I look over there?’). Active inference provides a formalism for the 
tautology that active agents, like humans, usually select courses of 
action that lead them to outcomes that they prefer. Perception and 
learning correspond, respectively, to making inferences about what is 
causing an agent’s sensory data, and about the parameters of their 
probabilistic representations of the world. Agents are modelled as 
acting by selecting courses of action that get them closer to outcomes 
which they expect, and which are characteristic of “the kind of agent 
or person that they are. ” These two sets of basic processes are 
important for our account of narrativity: (i) perception and learning, 
which refers to the error minimizing updates of expectations about 
states and outcomes of the world, and (ii) action or policy selection, 
which refer to the proactive sampling of sensory entries that confirm 
our expectations about “what will happen next. ”
2.2 From action to culture
Human adaptation, survival, and everyday functioning involve 
not just individual cognitive agents but coordinated, cooperative 
action in social groups. Recent applications of active inference to the 
study of group action in humans focus on the social construction of 
niches that provide cultural affordances, that is, culturally specific 
possibilities for action (Ramstead et al., 2016; Constant et al., 2019; 
Veissière et al., 2020; Constant et al., 2022). This work suggests that the 
social-ecological niche—namely, the set of persons, material 
structures, institutions, norms, and culturally patterned practices that 
structure social life for a given group—participates in the error 
minimization process described above (Constant et al., 2018).
TABLE 1 Functions of narrative in cognitive and social adaptation from the active inference perspective.
Section Main claim
3. Narrative as active inference Narratives can function to create and manage predictions at various levels of representations.
3.1.2 Event narratives as active 
inference
Memory. Narrative can serve as a means to represent information about past events. They segment specific events, allowing us to 
build and maintain a pool of information about these events. This pool of information is used to make more useful predictions about 
the world.
3.1.2 Event narratives as active 
inference
Episodic future projection. Narratives can play a vital role in episodic future projection. They structure the imagination of the future 
by integrating past experiences into future scenarios. This function enables us to simulate and anticipate potential future events.
3.2 Narrative identity as active 
inference
Coherent identity and prediction. Narratives contribute to maintaining integrity in the representations of our experiences. They help 
minimize internal contradictions and provide expectations of future events and life trajectories. This coherence function ensures that 
our predictions remain consistent with each other.
3.2 Narrative identity as active 
inference
Meaning-making and model updating. Narratives facilitate meaning-making by allowing us to draw new connections between 
different facets of our experiences. They help in incorporating changes in representations (model updating) and assimilating 
unexpected information.
3.3.2 Socio-cultural narratives as 
active inference
Sociocultural practices. Narrative storytelling practices can be understood as providing immersive regimes of attention and cultural 
cues. They prompt individuals to react in culturally prescribed ways and engage with their social and cultural environment. This 
function is crucial for social coordination and mutual prediction.
3.3.2 Socio-cultural narratives as 
active inference
Master narratives. Narratives serve to synchronize the predictions that group members generate for their own and others’ future 
states, behaviors, and relationships. This also makes it easier to predict each others’ behavior.
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
Human beings become encultured, learning the shared 
expectations that define a given cultural milieu, through immersive 
participation in specific (socially and culturally constructed) 
environmental niches (Lende and Downey, 2012). Thus, enculturation 
occurs through engagement in patterned cultural practices that 
indicate what is salient and what is not in a given niche—this includes 
attention (Ramstead et al., 2016 ). These accounts focus on shared 
patterns of attention and attribution of salience. The hypothesis is that 
these shared attentional styles result from immersive participation in 
patterned cultural practices that have the function of enculturating 
human agents through selective learning. This enculturation via 
implicit social learning, in turn, is enabled by the involvement of 
human agents in forms of joint and shared attention and intentional 
activities (Tomasello, 2014). The socio-cultural niche—as a set of 
collectively constructed, externalized, and materialized expectations 
about adaptive and normatively appropriate behaviors—functions as 
a repository for action-guiding cues. These cues are leveraged by 
individuals in performing perception, learning and action and, in so 
doing, help shape or fine-tune synchrony or conformity to the cultural 
milieu (Constant et al., 2019).
Accordingly, to better infer current states and predict future states 
(especially those of other group members), humans make use of 
shared expectations provided by culturally constructed niches. These 
provide a ready-made set of predictions that are more likely to 
be accurate because they were tried-and-true by past and current 
generations. For instance, humans regularly share narratives of the 
expected life course in their niche (e.g., get a job, get married, buy a 
house, and have children; Berntsen and Rubin, 2004), which yield 
expectations that become goals and hence are accurate in a self-
fulfilling manner. Shared expectations are also an efficient way to 
convey the intentions and behaviors of multiple agents (Veissière et al., 
2020). In sum, according to active inference models of culture, cultural 
affordances and shared expectations benefit human agents because 
they provide information about the everyday behavior of people in 
one’s cultural and social niche or milieu. This, in turn, is useful because 
it enables humans to mutually predict each other’s behavior.
Of course, recycling inferences that were useful in the past is not 
the only strategy used to generate accurate predictions. There is no a 
priori, historical, normative or encompassing set of predictions that 
can reduce all uncertainty about the future, simply because we live in 
dynamic environments that are inevitably subject to change. Human 
adaptation requires exploring these changing environments and 
learning how to respond adaptively. The ability to integrate novelty is 
essential to formulate accurate inferences and predictions in a 
changing environment. Indeed, all personal or cultural predictive 
models are bound to eventually be updated, refined, or replaced.
Importantly, active inference can also account for the spontaneous 
and creative processes involved in exploration, novelty-seeking and 
the generation of new modes of actions ( Parr and Friston, 2017 ). 
Exploration of new meaning can be cast as serving an underlying 
conservative principle: that of minimizing unexpectedness and 
uncertainty. Information gain quantifies the amount of uncertainty 
resolved by making an observation; and so, it makes sense that 
humans would seek to resolve uncertainty by actively seeking novel 
(and information-rich) experiences, which allow us to make longer-
term predictions about changing environments.
The ability to integrate novelty is essential to formulating and 
testing accurate predictions in a changing environment. Exploration 
and novelty-seeking can be used as pre-emptive strategies to avoid the 
surprises that will eventually arise. Effective predictions may mostly 
be repetitions conserved from the past experiences as part of a shared 
cultural repertoire. However, it is possible for anyone to imagine the 
future in novel ways and be confronted with surprises, which can lead 
to more accurate models. As such, exploration is an essential part of 
our predictive strategies, and narratives are especially useful in such 
imaginative exploration, entertaining counterfactual situations, 
binding together sequences of events in long temporal arcs, and 
extrapolating far into the future (Suddendorf and Corballis, 1997).
3 Narratives as active inference
Our thesis is that narratives evolved in part because they provide 
humans with an improved capacity to proactively, and collectively, 
formulate, share, and revise their inferences and predictions. Our 
account was developed, in part, as an attempt to enrich and expand 
the approach of Hirsch et al. (2013), who proposed that narratives 
exist at the most integrative hierarchical level of the generative models 
of agents. We contend that the ability to use narratives (compared with 
the inability, or reduced ability to do so) enhances the capacity for 
active inference in human individuals and communities. The main 
reason for this is that narratives are reports of real or imagined events 
(or relationships), and the ensuing ability to represent and predict 
events (and their contingencies), instead of only decontextualized 
elements (e.g., objects, people, places), enriches the repertoire of 
predictions in a way that serves human adaptation and everyday 
functioning. More specifically, we will argue that narratives improve 
the capacity for predictive processing because they (1) can represent 
a wide array of distinct types of events (e.g., specific past and future 
events, life stories, and socio-cultural routines and rituals), (2) can 
represent several events and their interconnections or 
interdependencies, especially concerning their temporal sequence and 
causal structures (e.g., linking one’s past with one’s future) and (3) can 
represent events and their interrelationships in a way that can be easily 
shared within a large community, as elaborated in the literature on 
master narratives (e.g., McLean and Syed, 2015 ) and storytelling 
practices (e.g., Hutto, 2016; Smith et al., 2017; Bietti et al., 2019).
To be clear, our account does not aim to explain all aspects and 
functions of narrative. Indeed, narratives have been with humans, in 
one form or another, since our distant past (Dissanayake, 2012; Boyd, 
2018). This basic capacity has been elaborated in ways that have 
become a very rich and complex facet of our social world, serving a 
wide variety of functions that active inference does not in itself 
explain. For instance, narrative can be used as a technology in politics 
and marketing to persuade others (e.g., Dahlén et al., 2009; De Graaf 
et  al., 2012). They are deployed through rhetoric to gain political 
power or influence (Brooks, 2022). Narratives are among the most 
widely available vehicles for entertainment in the world and create 
aesthetic pleasure in multiple ways. Narratives can be used to self-
regulate emotional states (Schaeffer, 1999) and to relieve or prevent 
stress (Martin et al., 2018).
Active inference can shed light on each of these uses of narrative 
but does not fully account for them. For example, Kukkonen (2020, 
2024) suggests that in reading literature, we engage with the text in 
ways that are similar to our engagement with the world through 
predictive processing. Some of the aesthetic qualities of literary 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
narratives and other art forms can be understood in terms of active 
inference (Van de Cruys et  al., 2024 ). While active inference can 
model facets of each of these uses, we do not contend that all the 
functions that narratives serve in our contemporary world fit under 
the umbrella of active inference. Our account is limited to the ways 
that narrative help individuals and groups to predict and thereby 
adapt to a changing environment.
It is also important to recognize that many of the common uses of 
narrative are not adaptive and these harmful effects may involve 
processes that are also not fully captured by the active inference 
account—which may nonetheless explain some of their dynamics. For 
example, while narratives can contribute to adaptive fitness because 
they convey knowledge that guides behavior (e.g., Sugiyama, 2001), 
some of the uses and abuses of contemporary narrative in 
entertainment are clearly not adaptive (i.e., binge watching, Forte 
et al., 2021 ). Dubourg and Baumard (2022) suggest that narrative 
fictions in entertainment technologies may be  akin to ethological 
superstimuli (Tinbergen, 1969; Barrett, 2010). This process can be cast 
in active inference terms to capture some of its individual and social 
dynamics (Ciria et al., 2022).
In the remainder of this paper, we unpack the argument that a key 
function of narratives in human adaptation and everyday functioning 
is their use as a tool for inference and predictions and for larger-scale 
group-level coordination, based on the active inference framework. In 
particular, we  propose a multi-level account of narrative in which 
many cognitive and social functions of narrative can be understood 
in an active inference model. We proceed by reviewing key aspects of 
narrative established in the literature, followed by an account of how 
each aspect can be  recast in terms of active inference, thereby 
providing proposing a cohesive (if necessarily incomplete), testable 
theory of the functions of narrative as prediction. In the conclusion, 
we outline empirical and conceptual implications.
3.1 Narratives as cognitive schema
In many domains of psychological research, especially personality 
and developmental psychology (e.g., Nelson and Fivush, 2004; Singer 
and Blagov, 2004; McAdams, 2006), narratives are understood as a 
type of cognitive schema, representation, or form of thought 
instantiated in the brains of individuals, and used to imagine, 
interpret, reason about, plan, and evaluate actions and situations in 
their personal lives. These personal narratives have been the focus of 
two distinct lines of research examining narratives of specific events 
related to one’s personal life (e.g., Singer and Salovey, 1993 ), and 
autobiographical narratives or life stories that organize events and 
information about personal lives into meaningful themes, 
developmental arcs, scripts, and self-depictions, thereby increasing the 
coherence of our identity (McAdams, 2006).
3.1.1 Event narratives: review of theory and 
research
Narratives contribute to our capacity to represent specific events 
(past, future, or imaginary) as distinct episodes (Labov and Waletzky, 
1967; Nelson and Fivush, 2004 ; Habermas and Diel, 2013 ). 
Experimental evidence suggests that narratives are involved in the 
parsing of experience into distinct events by determining their 
beginning and their end (e.g., Speer et al., 2007; Ezzyat and Davachi, 
2011). For instance, the narrative binding of experiences into coherent 
units facilitates their recall ( Speer et  al., 2007; Wang et  al., 2015). 
Narrative segmentation is central to the representation of specific past 
events, i.e., to episodic memory (Tulving, 1985), and should likewise 
be central to the representation of future events or future projections 
(D’ Argembeau and Van der Linden, 2004).
Episodic memory involves the recollection of distinct, cohesive 
past events ( Tulving, 1985 ). Some have argued that narratives 
provide basic structure to episodic memory (e.g., Rubin, 2006) and 
are important for its development, in large part through their role 
in the temporal segmentation of information into events with 
beginnings and ends ( Speer et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2015 ), the 
arrangement of events on a temporal arc or trajectory ( Nelson and 
Fivush, 2004 ; Singer, 2004 ; Reese and Newcombe, 2007 ; Keven, 
2016), and internal relationships that link events by causality or 
other generative mechanisms that can bridge non-contiguous 
events ( Cohn-Sheehy et  al., 2021 ). This internal predictive or 
generative structure of narrative allows great efficiency in 
information storage because the trajectory can be reconstructed 
from the events and the generative process ( Gemici et al., 2017 ). 
Although episodic memories are sometimes described as discrete 
‘snapshots’ of experience, they are generally reconstructions based 
on narrative templates ( Kirmayer, 1996; Nelson and Fivush, 2004 ; 
Rubin, 2006; Wang et al., 2015; Keven, 2016). Indeed, while episodic 
memories seem to provide the building blocks for narrative 
accounts, some scholars have argued that all episodic memories can 
be understood as forms of narrative ( Hoerl, 2007). Narratives may 
bind together more rudimentary forms of event memory to produce 
human episodic memory ( Nelson and Fivush, 2004 ; Keven, 2016). 
The importance of this capacity is supported by evidence that 
individuals who have difficulty providing narratives of their lives 
using detailed accounts of specific events are more likely to have 
difficulties in adaptive functioning ( Williams, 1996 ; Angus and 
McLeod, 2004 ; Conway, 2005; Dimaggio et al., 2016 ). Implicit in 
these accounts is a kind of ‘coarse graining’ into discrete events that 
scaffold episodic memories.
Future projections involve representations of specific events that 
could realistically happen to someone in their future (D’ Argembeau 
and Van der Linden, 2004). These projections have been found to 
share a striking similarity with episodic memories in behavioral and 
phenomenological characteristics and underlying cognitive processes 
(D’ Argembeau and Van der Linden, 2004 ), and seem to involve 
activation in the same or overlapping brain circuits (Schacter et al., 
2012). In line with these findings, Schacter and Addis (2007) proposed 
that an important function of episodic memory is to help individuals 
create adaptive projections to specific future events and they have 
provided extensive empirical support for this hypothesis (Schacter and 
Addis, 2020) This perspective—that memories are essentially for the 
future—has been advanced in anthropology ( Y oung, 1996) and 
philosophy (De Brigard, 2014) as well. In this view, episodic memories 
provide a pool of information, based on previous experiences, from 
which elements can be  selected and recombined to create more 
accurate representations of future events. In the same way that 
narrative operates to segment past events in terms of beginnings and 
ends and array them along a trajectory, it may be involved in the 
segmentation of future events into steps or sequences along a 
trajectory (Nelson, 2007)—although experimental evidence of this 
process is still needed.

Episodic memories and future projections are most often 
operationalized as event narratives (e.g., D’ Argembeau et al., 2012). In 
addition to temporal sequences, there are other processes involved in 
the formation of episodic memory and future projections, for instance 
scene construction (Hassabis et al., 2007; Race et al., 2011), and causal 
emplotment (Cohn-Sheehy et  al., 2021), to which narratives may 
contribute. Through temporal structure, scenario building and 
emplotment, narratives are centrally involved in the recollection and 
representation of specific past and future episodes and events.
3.1.2 Event narratives as active inference
We can appeal to active inference to explain the efficacy of 
narratives of specific past and future events. As noted above, a recent 
perspective on memory and future projection argues that the adaptive 
function of future projections is increased by the incorporation of 
information provided by memories of specific past events. This 
constructive episodic simulation hypothesis suggests that the basic 
adaptive function of episodic memories is to guide, inform, structure, 
and constrain the representation of future events (Schacter and Addis, 
2007, 2020). The idea that reliance on past event narratives can 
increase the accuracy of predictions and the adaptive value of future 
projections has received much empirical support (e.g., Suddendorf 
and Corballis, 1997; Wheeler et al., 1997; Atance and O'Neill, 2001; 
Klein et al., 2002; De Brigard, 2014; Conway et al., 2016). Narratives 
are crucial for this process in that they organize past and future 
experience into units, connect them in sequences, and tag them in 
ways that make them accessible in situations in which similar cues or 
sequences of events occur.
Under active inference, a function of specific past event 
narratives can be understood as providing a pool of information 
made of past specific episodes, within which regularities can 
be extracted and leveraged to predict situations which are similar 
in certain respects to relevant remembered episodes, thereby 
avoiding the cognitive burden of excessive updating of one’s 
probabilistic expectations ( Schank, 1980 , 1990). Agents can draw 
from a pool of available possibilities that constitute the legacy of 
personal experience as well as the vicarious experience inherited 
from others that is encoded in shared cultural narratives. As noted 
above, individuals who have difficulty recounting rich narratives of 
their lives using detailed accounts of specific events tend to have 
difficulties in adaptive functioning (e.g., Williams et  al., 1996 ). 
Furthermore, because the future is never simply a repetition of the 
past, multiple past events usually need to be combined to generate 
accurate inferences about a specific upcoming event ( Schacter and 
Addis, 2007 ). Even repeated events that have a similar structure 
over time (e.g., holidays at the grandparents, weekly basketball 
practice) may have a substantial degree of novelty that can 
be addressed by incorporating information from other episodic 
memories or schemas ( Conway and Pleydell-Pearce, 2000 ).
A recent line of research on memory provides evidence consistent 
with this proposal. Congleton and Berntsen (2020, 2022) have shown 
that experiencing surprising stimuli tends to increase memory for the 
event that preceded the surprise. In other words, the novelty of the 
situation increases the salience of recent events. This functional 
increase of memory for the context of surprising information was 
found in one recent study to involve hippocampal activity, which may 
be  an important contributor to updating memory in the case of 
prediction error (Sinclair et al., 2021).
Taken together, these results are consistent with, and provide at 
least indirect evidence for, our contention that narratives partly 
function to implement active inference. Specifically, we propose that 
narratives of specific past events function as a pool of information 
aimed at guiding the generation of effective predictions. Well-
predicted events (i.e., routines) quickly become forgotten (Conway 
and Pleydell-Pearce, 2000) because they do not contribute relevant 
information for predictions (Philippe, 2022). When prediction-errors 
arise, they lead to the encoding of new memories, because they carry 
highly relevant information to improve the accuracy of predictions in 
the future. The formation of new memories, which necessarily involves 
narratives (Rubin, 2006), can be understood as a process of model 
updating. Active inference at the level of event narratives involves a 
conservative process of replicating elements of past events into future 
events that are closely similar to those past events (e.g., habits) which 
maintains coherence and continuity between past and future, and a 
creative or constructive process that involves the flexible recombination 
of past events into future events (Schacter and Addis, 2007). Narratives 
are particularly useful for active inference because they can contribute 
to both the conservative processes that maintain old memories and 
use them as models for new events, as well as generating new models 
through their recombination or projection to produce new stories 
(Mar and Oatley, 2008).
In summary, event narratives are ideally suited for predictive 
processing because of their ability to represent past and future events 
in segmented event sequences, to provide structured information 
about the past (episodic memories) that can help predict future events, 
and to project these inferences in the form of cohesive imagined 
scenarios of future events (future projections). This occurs, first, 
through an expectation-confirming conservative process, a strategy 
for prediction that involves a replication of the aspects of future events 
that should be identical or similar enough to the past, and second, 
through an expectation-updating, constructive process that involves 
recombining elements of multiple past events (Schacter and Addis, 
2007) or reinterpreting memories in counterfactual thinking to update 
and create new expectations for the future (De Brigard and Parikh, 
2019). In the active inference approach, these two distinct functions 
of narrative are integrated into a single predictive mechanism that 
aims to find the optimal balance between conservation and change, 
which is necessary to adapt to an environment that evinces both 
continuity and change. This balance instantiates aspects of Piaget’s 
broader notions of cognitive assimilation and accommodation (Piaget, 
1976; Block, 1982; Hanfstingl et  al., 2022) and provides a way to 
understand the coordination of these complementary and 
interdependent processes.
3.1.3 Narrative identity: review of theory and 
research
A second key line of research on narrative schemas involve the 
broader depictions of one’s life themes, chapters, and recurrent events, 
ultimately giving rise to what has been called narrative identity 
(McAdams, 1988, 2018). McAdams (1988, 2018) has argued that 
identity can be  conceived as an ever-evolving internalized global 
narrative that situates the self in time by broadly reconstructing its 
past and imagining its future. Narrative identity functions to bring 
meaning and coherence to one’s life (McAdams, 1995, 2001; McLean 
et  al., 2007 ). Research suggests a moderate positive association 
between narrative meaning making and coherence with psychological 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org
well-being (Adler et  al., 2015 , 2016; Habermas and Köber, 2015 ; 
Mason et  al., 2019 ). The mechanism explaining this positive 
relationship is postulated to be that a coherent identity provides a 
sense of personal continuity and identity integration ( Syed and 
McLean, 2016).
In the context of autobiographical narratives, ‘meaning’ consists 
of the relations we draw between salient aspects about our experience 
(e.g., people, places, events, concepts) (Baumeister, 1991; Heine et al., 
2006; Park, 2010 ; Proulx and Inzlicht, 2012 ). Meaning, on this 
account, resides in relationships between simple aspects of our 
experience (e.g., an object and a smell) or complex ones (e.g., an 
emotion and a familiar location), that often entail a network of 
associations among multiple elements. Heine et al. (2006) add that 
meaning concerns the iterative construction and restoring of 
expected relations  between relevant information that humans 
construct about aspects of the world, and as such, it entails 
establishing, maintaining, and restoring a sense of familiarity (or 
predictability) with the world. Of course, simply linking salient 
elements of our experiences does not necessarily result in the 
construction of coherent ensembles. This requires overarching 
structures like self-schemas or identity that confer consistency and 
coherence in a top-down fashion. Another key function of narrative 
is to integrate our various representations of self with the multiple 
past and future life events in ways that provide a coherent identity 
(McAdams, 1995).
Many researchers have explored the possibility that narratives can 
be used to help support the meaning-making processes centered on 
the self (Habermas and Bluck, 2000; Singer, 2004). Singer and Bluck 
(2001) suggest that two processes occur sequentially to facilitate the 
construction of meaning. First, individuals engage in narrative 
processing of their life experiences, a type of information-processing 
that organizes information into an event unit by transforming it as a 
story. The resulting storied accounts of life events open possibilities 
for further meaning making by subsequently using these narratives of 
the events of our lives for self-reflection and finding narrative links or 
associations among them. Once information about our lives is 
organized in the form of storied past events, it becomes easier to 
reflect on and link to more, and more varied, aspects of experience by 
narrating them in relation to the self. This autobiographical reasoning 
(Habermas and Bluck, 2000; Staudinger, 2001) involves drawing on 
past experiences to explore linkages to other past events, current 
concerns and actions, and future objectives. This process can lead to 
new interpretations of past events, and new knowledge about the self 
(Staudinger, 2001), which may help to predict novel future events. 
Insofar as the meaning making process involves the creation and 
maintenance of links between disparate aspects of our experience, a 
coherent self or identity can be seen as a culmination of this narrative 
process. It should be noted that the relationship between narrative and 
meaning-making is generally bi-directional, such that a circular 
process is at play in which basic forms of embodied and enacted 
meaning-making underlie narratives and narratives in turn provide a 
scaffolding for more elaborate meaning making (Singer, 2004).
Narratives can be used to foster consistency among self-related 
expectations that are temporally recent and distant ( Berntsen and 
Rubin, 2004 ), grounding the ever-evolving facets of identity in 
accounts of the personal past and extrapolating them forward in a life 
trajectory that links stories of origins with current circumstances, and 
future aspirations or possible selves ( Carver and Scheier, 2001 ; 
McAdams, 2001; Conway, 2005; Erikson, 2007). This process can 
integrate temporally local or focal narratives into longer accounts. 
Longer narratives can lend coherence to shorter narratives by 
providing a context or frame in which different sub-stories can coexist.
In sum, narratives function to establish expected relations in an 
iterative process with different phases. First, narratives are involved in 
stabilizing established cognitive expectations, which is part of the 
coherence-making function of narrative. Then, narratives are involved 
in the posterior explanation and interpretation of unexpected or 
surprising events, updating schemas so that events can be expected in 
the future (e.g., Habermas and Köber, 2015 ). Narratives are thus 
centrally involved in two distinct phases in the process of meaning-
making (Park, 2010).
Narrative serves to construct and maintain a coherent identity. A 
coherent narrative identity is characterized by the fact that it connects 
past experiences and future plans in ways that can be understood by 
others in one’s local social world. Narrative coherence is not simply a 
matter of logical consistency or non-contradiction but follows cultural 
templates that incorporate local norms and modes of explanation, 
including the temporal sequences of causality ( Howard, 1991). A 
narrative is deemed coherent, in this sense, when it can be understood 
in a specific social context (McAdams, 2006), in relation to particular 
modes of culturally grounded personal interpretation and sense-
making (Habermas and Reese, 2015). The coherent grounding of the 
future in the past also helps to ensure the maintenance of goal pursuit 
(Conway et al., 2004 ). In this sense, narrative identity can help to 
maintain oneself within one’s viability sets – the modes of adaptation 
that are conducive to continued existence —which include 
environmental states, social niches, and social roles ( Di Paolo and 
Thompson, 2014).
In summary, narrative identity processes provide individuals with 
the means to efficiently produce, maintain, and change the global 
relationships among the different facets of their experience and 
identity: this includes creative processes of narrative construction that 
generate new facets and configurations of identity, and conservative 
processes of narrative recollection and retelling that reproduce and 
stabilize these facets in an internally coherent account of events 
pertinent to self, personhood and biography.
3.2 Narrative identity as active inference
Research has linked narrative identity coherence and 
meaningfulness with adaptive functioning (Adler, 2012; Adler et al., 
2015, 2016; Mason et al., 2019 ; McLean et al., 2020b ). This link is 
generally explained by the fact that narrative identity coherence and 
meaning give rise to a sense of personal continuity and identity 
integration ( McLean and Syed, 2015 ). This adaptive value can 
be  understood in part because coherent and meaningful identity 
narratives are conducive to improved predictive processing; that is, 
they better scaffold the generative model of the person in the world 
and the social world and thus provide a way to generate more accurate 
predictions to effectively navigate socially constituted and encultured 
worlds (see Figure 1). Identity coherence and meaningfulness also 
serve to organize personal and social actions in a more predictable 
way for ourselves (i.e., making one’s own behavior more predictable to 
oneself) as well as for others (making one’s behavior more predictable 
to others). Both features of identity can contribute to adaptation: 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
individually, because if we are more predictable to ourselves (e.g., if 
we have a clearer identity and long-term goals), we can more readily 
meet our own expectations and achieve our goals; and socially, 
because if we are more predictable to others, they may find us easier 
to cooperate with and get along.
First, coherent narratives link aspects of experience together in 
ways that decrease the contradictions among choices, values, and 
goals. Coherent identity narratives can thus reduce dissonance among 
the more complex and over-arching expectations we have about our 
lives, thus minimizing complexity and keeping things simple by acting 
like heuristics for cognition (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011) that 
concerns the individual’s global life course. A coherent narrative 
identity functions to reduce uncertainty about future states because it 
provides predictions about the events that are likely to occur in a 
‘normal’ (i.e., culturally sanctioned and expectable) life trajectory over 
the course of development (Habermas and Bluck, 2000; Berntsen and 
Rubin, 2004). Narrative identity can also provide a set of consistent 
expectations with regard to an individuals’ idiosyncratic goals and life 
trajectory, which can help the individual be  predictable to both 
himself and others. In contrast, vaguely determined or contradictory 
global identity narratives provide blurred, contradictory, and 
imprecise expectations, which entail a greater degree of uncertainty 
that may increase the cognitive demands or burden of predictive 
processing and, by extension, impede adaptive functioning. This can 
occur, for instance, by generating prediction-error when the model 
fails to predict what will happen next. This effect of increasing 
prediction-error could partly explain why a coherent narrative identity 
is positively related to well-being, and why a diffuse or vague identity 
is a well-known correlate of serious psychological and behavioral 
problems (e.g., Dimaggio et al., 2016).
The function of narratives as a basis of the meaning making 
process can also be seen through the lens of active inference. Meaning 
making involves creating and exploring new links between elements 
of our experiences, which generates change in representations 
(McLean et al., 2020b). In a similar vein, Staudinger (2001) proposed 
that narrative has epistemic functions, in that narratives are used to 
actively reflect on and evaluate events to identify and integrate new 
knowledge about the self. This process can be seen as important for 
the exploratory phase of active inference, also known as epistemic 
foraging (Parr and Friston, 2017), where surprising or new facets of 
environments are encountered and new, updated models of future 
events need to be constructed. The meaning-making process is seen 
in the literature as an adaptive response to the occurrence of 
unexpected circumstances, when expectations are not met, and an 
imaginative reorganization of our representations of ourselves and our 
environments is needed (Heine et al., 2006; Park, 2010; Proulx and 
Inzlicht, 2012). As such, the meaning making process that is at play in 
narrative self-fashioning can be cast as active inference insofar as it 
involves resolving uncertainty by ascribing new meaning to unfamiliar, 
ambiguous, or disruptive events and integrating them with the known, 
familiar aspects of our experience to update what is now to be expected 
in the future.
There is evidence that the meaning-making process is especially 
associated with well-being when participants have recently 
experienced unexpected events that challenge their sense of identity 
(Habermas and Köber, 2015 ). Consistent with our proposal, this 
suggests that it is because meaning making restores our sense of 
narrative coherence and continuity, thereby increasing one’s 
predictability for oneself and for others. While the most common 
explanation for the positive relationship between narrative coherence 
FIGURE 1
The framework of active inference allows us to combine different conceptions of narratives under one set of dynamics that we here depict in non-
technical terms (for a technical description of these dynamics in the context of similar agents-environment interaction dynamics, see: Veissière et al., 
2020; Constant et al., 2022). The model depicted in the figure corresponds to the iterative process through which narratives function to establish and 
engage with expectations through the construction of a coherent narrative identity, social self-presentation, and engagement with cultural master 
narratives. The model is of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) under active inference which follows several iterative steps: (a) 
Narratives are involved in the explanation and interpretation of unexpected or surprising events, updating schemas so that these new events can 
be predicted in the future; (b) Narratives are used to foster consistency among specific event predictions to yield a coherent narrative identity and plan 
coherent action. The coherent narrative identity enables the person to generate actions that are consistent with each other; (c) Narrative self-
presentation refers to how individuals present themselves to others through the narratives they construct about their own lives. This involves the ways 
that people tell stories about themselves, their experiences, beliefs, values, and identity, to the external world; (d) the actions of each person change 
the structure of the external world and thereby contribute to the formation of social practices and deontic cues, which may constitute a form of 
master narrative or provide alternative narrative templates.
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org
and well-being is that coherence provides a sense of continuity and 
integration (Pasupathi et  al., 2007; McLean and Syed, 2015 ), our 
account provides a complementary explanation of the mechanisms at 
play. First, the association between integrative identity and well-being 
follows from the way that an integrative identity provides a set of 
predictions that is more efficient because it contains fewer 
contradictions, leading to less prediction-error, which thereby 
improves predictive processing. Secondly, our active inference model 
of narrativity is consistent with the possibility that a coherent narrative 
identity helps foster the sense of being the same person across time 
(i.e., personal continuity). However, it provides a more precise context 
to understand why this sense of continuity is associated with well-
being; namely, that a coherent narrative identity increases well-being 
and adaptive functioning because it offers a stable and consistent 
framework from which agents can project themselves into the future 
with more accurate predictions, which also helps to maintain a sense 
that the past identity is related to the future identity. Thus, we suggest 
that a key factor leading from narrative coherence to increased well-
being is the fact that a coherent narrative leads to improved predictive 
processing capacity in individuals.
This is consistent with work by Pasupathi et al. (2007)  who 
describe the role of self-event connections in maintaining a sense 
of identity through stability and change. They frame identity as a 
developmental problem, especially in adolescence, and note the 
challenge of maintaining a sense of personal continuity during the 
inevitable changes induced by development. The argument suggests 
that the task of constructing a sense of personal continuity through 
the inevitable changes is concerned with integrating the past with 
the present, that is, to “construct both a stable sense of self as well 
as a sense of how the self has changed over time” ( Pasupathi et al., 
2007, p. 104, emphasis added). They also suggest that the continuity 
of identity needs to be resolved before it is possible to commit to 
future selves. Finally, past events are key in constructing the sense 
of self and identity. Again, an active inference reading suggests that 
a diametrically opposed emphasis is warranted to really understand 
the dynamics at play. From the point of view of active inference, 
personal continuity is especially concerned with how one will 
remain the same over time in the future. An active inference view 
of narrative identity suggests that creating narratives of the future 
is a key process in organizing the self. A crucial purpose of building 
a narrative identity is to orient ourselves towards the future, to 
predict it and adapt to it. Of course, narratives are used to make 
connections between the self and the past, as the past contains 
information necessary to construct and make sense of identity; 
however, identity is not simply built from the ‘ground up’ from 
memory to project the self into the future. Expectations of the 
future (as well as aspirations, goals or plans) constrain what 
information about the past is relevant to identity. As such, identity 
continuity can be the result of a narrative built in two directions: 
from the present to the future and to the past, each of which can 
modify the other. From an adaptive point of view, much more than 
historians of our own lives, we are first and foremost actors in an 
unfolding story that we extend into the future.
Relatedly, another potential role of narrative coherence in active 
inference may lie in its ability to improve ones’ predictability to others 
(McLean, 2019 ); that is, having a coherent narrative identity, 
displaying a continuous, predictable, stable (narrative) identity might 
be  valued by others who find one more predictable, reliable, and 
consistent (hence, easy to cooperate with) or because it serves to 
maintain specific valued traits or roles.
Finally, we must clarify a crucial point. While we have argued 
that coherence and meaning (which are structural elements of 
narratives) facilitate active inference and adaptation, they may not 
always lead to psychological well-being, because it is not the mere 
fact of having a narrative of identity but also the content of such 
narratives that matters for psychological well-being. A coherent and 
meaningful set of narratives optimally reduces uncertainty and 
facilitates active inference by providing consistent expectations of 
various future events. However, this is also true of coherent and 
meaningful narratives with negative content that fuel negative 
expectations (e.g., failure, rejection, disappointment, inefficacy), 
which might in some contexts represent the most probable events or, 
in other contexts, impede adaptation and even sabotage favorable 
circumstances. Such negative narratives may lead to psychological 
distress, as is seen for example in the way that negative self-statements 
and expectations contribute to low self-esteem, depression 
(hopelessness) and anxiety (Beck, 1979). Indeed, research has shown 
that narratives with positive and negative content are, respectively, 
associated with psychological well-being and ill-being (McLean and 
Lilgendahl, 2008 ; Lilgendahl and McAdams, 2011 ; Banks and 
Salmon, 2013; Lilgendahl and McLean, 2020 ). However, they may 
still be  beneficial in so far as they provide a means to enhance 
predictive accuracy. This is consistent with recent active inference 
models of the etiological pathway from allostatic load to depression 
that highlight the possibility of acquiring maladaptive expectations 
when faced with environments that chronically thwart one’s attempts 
to act effectively in the social world, resulting in learned helplessness 
(Arnaldo et al., 2022).
The active inference account can also help us understand the 
remarkable resistance to change of some negative narratives (e.g., 
Singer, 2019). This inertia suggests that there are processes that 
maintain negative narratives, despite the distress they cause. From the 
point of view of active inference, what one gains from a negative 
narrative is simply the ability to reduce prediction error and prevent 
future (unpleasant, unfamiliar, dangerous, and ego-dystonic) 
surprises. Negative narratives can provide accurate expectancies with 
respect to current and future negative circumstances. Unfortunately, 
this gain in coherence and prediction may also have maladaptive 
consequences when the negative narratives are the source of a broader 
negative sense of self. In effect, the negative expectation may set up a 
self-fulfilling prophecy that maintains itself through accurate 
prediction (and production) of negative outcomes.
This raises an important set of empirical questions regarding the 
adaptive value and consequences of negative narratives. From the 
perspective of active inference, it should be better to hold a more 
accurate model of the world, even if it is negative in its evaluation of 
the self, rather than an inaccurate but more positive model, because it 
keeps one adapted to the environment (i.e., generates a flow of 
expectations that reduce prediction error) despite the associated 
psychological ill-being resulting from pessimism, negative self-views, 
and so on.
Such maladaptive consequences or trade-offs in active inference 
could account for other important clinical phenomena. For example, 
some researchers have observed that victims of childhood abuse tend 
to re-enact trauma later in their lives, which can result in 
revictimization (Van der Kolk et al., 1994; Gladstone et al., 2004). The 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org
mechanisms underlying this re-enactment are still the object of 
debate, and explanations have invoked notions of dissociation, 
complex motivational theories, and even “addiction to trauma” (Levy, 
2000). A straightforward account can be  given in terms of active 
inference (Linson and Friston, 2019; Linson et al., 2020). Quite simply, 
trauma victims expect and enact negative narratives because, given 
their past experiences, these are the most plausible, coherent, and 
meaningful possibilities—i.e., those that reduce prediction-error the 
most (Holmes, 2020). These embodied and enacted expectations are 
elaborated through the overarching process of establishing a sense of 
personal continuity and integration by creating, maintaining, and 
enacting coherent and meaningful narratives. The narratives then 
guide the interpretation of novel situations in ways that may impede 
learning new patterns of interaction and adaptive expectations. Of 
course, nonverbal, embodied expectations also influence interpersonal 
interactions and may help maintain maladaptive narratives, but the 
narrative component may be particularly amenable to therapeutic 
challenge and change.
In summary, we  propose that the involvement of identity 
narratives in individual active inference involves two processes. 
First, identity narratives lead to the creation and conservation of 
global coherence among representations in a process that can 
be seen as a form of active inference about the person in their 
local world. Second, identity narratives allow the integration of 
new possibilities to eventually restore a renewed sense of self-
continuity and familiarity, to restore a coherent set of expectations 
and integrate environmental or situational changes. However, the 
(active inference based) pull towards coherence and meaningful 
narratives does not preclude the possibility of negative narrative 
generalization. In fact, it can partly explain why anxious, 
depressed, or traumatized individuals hold on to negative 
narrative expectancies so firmly. An understanding of this process 
of inertia or resistance to change in terms of active inference could 
be leveraged to develop targeted therapeutic interventions ( Linson 
and Friston, 2019 ).
3.2.1 Socio-cultural narratives: review of theory 
and research
In addition to their role in cognition, identity, and memory, 
narratives have crucial social functions that depend on culture and 
context. More than just residing in individuals, narratives also reside 
in cycles of narration – they are constituted through communicative 
action and hence are not only located in the brain but in embodied 
loops with local socio-cultural environments (Di Paolo et al., 2018), 
or cultural affordances ( Ramstead et  al., 2016 ). In this section, 
we review two distinct approaches that understand narratives as social 
practices or enactments: the Narrative Practice Hypothesis (Hutto, 
2016) and the master narrative framework (MNF; Hammack, 2008; 
McLean and Syed, 2015) to illustrate how an active inference approach 
to narratives can integrate the internalist cognitive account with a 
more externalist focus on social practices of narration.
The Narrative Practice Hypothesis (NPH) argues that storytelling 
and other ways of giving narrative accounts of experience (to oneself 
and to others) are fundamentally social practices (Hutto, 2012). In this 
framework, narratives derive their meaning from particular social 
contexts and have instrumental functions: generating or conveying 
expectations, regulating self-presentation, negotiating relationships, 
and generally serving to position the narrator vis-à-vis others in the 
environment or social system (Gallagher and Hutto, 2008; Hutto and 
Kirchhoff, 2015; Hutto, 2016).
The NPH suggests that human agents learn to explain and justify 
themselves (to others and to themselves) by telling stories about why 
they and others do what they do. This includes the ability to give 
reasons for one’s own and others’ actions . According to the NPH, 
human agents learn to provide reasons for their own and others’ 
actions over the course of their development, mostly by participating 
in a special kind of narrative practice, namely, folk-psychological 
narrative practices (Hutto, 2012). Folk psychological narratives are 
stories that center on accounts of the mental states of other persons as 
explanations, causes or outcomes of action. Many (indeed, perhaps 
most) types or genres of stories (e.g., fairy tales and myths) that adults 
tell children over the span of development involve the mental states of 
characters involved. Learning to use and understand these narratives 
requires that children learn how to make (sometimes explicit, mostly 
implicit) inferences about agents’ reasons and motives (Taylor, 2012; 
Taylor, 2016).
The narratives that are produced in acts of storytelling, insofar as 
they are tangible cultural artefacts, can be seen as anchors of joint and 
shared forms of attention ( Tomasello, 2014; Hutto and Kirchhoff, 
2015). The act of storytelling itself occurs in specific social settings and 
in socially prescribed forms that convey information above and 
beyond the particular stories being exchanged. Stories and storytelling 
provide structures and ways of organizing experience and of reading 
the environment in terms of cultural affordances ( Ramstead et al., 
2016). In telling and listening to stories, both storyteller and listener 
are not merely focusing on the story as such, but also on the elements, 
relationships and narrative structures within the story and their 
relationships to the larger context of the telling. In doing so, all 
participants become more predictable to each other.
According to the NPH, ‘folk psychological stories’ or ‘person 
stories’ provide children with developmental anchors through which 
they acquire the ability to provide reasons for the way they (and 
others) acted. In the cultural practice of everyday storytelling, agents 
participate in narrating ordinary events and experiences of self and 
others. Participation in such practices leads agents to acquire the folk 
psychological skills necessary for more elaborate cognition through 
self-narration and self-presentation. These claims of the NPH are 
consonant with, and find support in, empirical work on narrative in 
developmental and social psychology. For example, based on 
observational, longitudinal, and experimental studies, Nelson and 
Fivush (2004) advanced a social-cultural developmental theory of the 
origins of narrative skills and autobiographical memories. They argue 
that these two capacities (narration and the capacity for 
autobiographical thinking) emerge in large part as the result of the 
cultural scaffolding provided by caregivers. More specifically, they 
contend that the involvement of the child in social interactions, in 
which the caregiver recounts narratives about shared past events to 
the child, is crucial for the child’s development of the capacity to use 
narrative structure and content in cognition, and eventually in 
autobiographical memories. In doing so, the adult provides the child 
with a format and organization in terms of which past events can 
be  efficiently encoded and remembered. The structure and 
characteristics of these storytelling interactions thus give rise to 
important features of the content, structure, and organization of 
autobiographical memory. Storytelling interactions vary greatly 
among individuals and across cultures. Developmentally, everyday 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org
storytelling is shaped by characteristics of both parent and child as 
well as family and larger social contexts (Sahin-Acar and Leichtman, 
2020). This variability in conversation gives rise to differences in the 
number, types, emotional quality, and narrative coherence of 
remembered events. Further, conversations about shared past events 
are constrained by sociocultural views about what characteristics of 
events are salient, worth discussing, and worth remembering (Nelson 
and Fivush, 2004). For instance, studies have found that mothers who 
narrated past experiences to their children using more orienting 
information (i.e., when and where), asking questions and providing 
hints and details about the recounted event, had children who later 
reconstructed more coherent narratives that included this information 
(Haden et al., 1997). This cultural variability suggests that there will 
be differences in the developmental course of narrative capacities and 
autobiographical memory across cultures (Howard, 1991). Research 
has demonstrated that cultures provide different master narratives and 
different ideas about what makes a “good story” and this influences 
the ways that individuals narrate their lives ( Fivush et  al., 2011), 
articulate social roles and facets of identity like gender (McLean et al., 
2020a), and extends to the ways that individuals maintain a sense of 
continuity of identity (Becker et al., 2018).
The Master Narrative Framework (MNF) is another important 
approach to understanding our embeddedness in culture through 
narrative (Hammack, 2008; McLean and Syed, 2015). While similar 
in some respects to the NPH, the MNF is less concerned with how 
cultural narratives guide actions in specific contexts than with their 
implication in forming identity representations, focusing especially on 
the interrelations between cultural and agentic influences. Since 
master narratives have been inconsistently defined in the literature 
(Hammack, 2008), we  adopt the framework of McLean and Syed 
(2015), which proposes a more precise characterization of master 
narratives according to five principles. First, master narratives have 
many uses for members of a group (utility principle), such as providing 
relevant information to understanding the group’s rules and 
characteristics (e.g., its history, values, social norms). As such, master 
narratives facilitate belonging and social integration through the 
synchronization of referents across group members. They also support 
personal identity development, by serving as a source of information 
upon which group members draw to define their identity, as well as to 
understand the identity of others. Relatedly, master narratives provide 
information about the typical life course that is expected of a cultural 
group’s members. Secondly, master narratives are shared by the 
majority of the members of a culture (ubiquity principle), because they 
are only useful for social cohesion to the extent that they are widely 
adopted. Third, most members of a culture effectively accept and 
internalize master narratives without recognizing them explicitly as 
such ( invisibility principle). The fact that master narratives are 
unconsciously internalized as ready-made guides for how to live a life 
and understand the lives of others facilitates adaptation by alleviating 
the necessity for effortful reflection on everyday choices, actions or 
events. The fourth principle refers to the fact that master narratives are 
not value-neutral from an ethical standpoint; that is, master narratives 
reflect social norms and expectations. Adopting master narratives may 
be enforced by social pressure and associated with moral approval or 
disapproval (compulsory principle). As such, master narratives tell us 
how to avoid criticism, conform to social expectations, and 
be accepted as ‘good’ members of the group. Finally, master narrative 
are hard to change (rigidity principle), because they are woven into 
many aspects of the social system, including structures, institutions 
and routines, but also because those who benefit the most from master 
narratives are also in power, and use their influence to maintain and 
enforce the master narratives.
In accord with the principles described above, individuals will for 
the most part assimilate the master narrative’s ready-made life-course 
depiction into their personal narratives, usually without being 
explicitly aware of using it as a model or template. However, because 
we  live in dynamic environments, master narratives eventually 
become outmoded or obsolete, and alternative narratives are needed 
for adaptation. Ironically, master narratives may become conscious at 
such moments of culture change and for individuals who come to 
reject the master narrative to adopt (and sometimes invent) 
alternative narratives.
Finally, although the central role of narrative in constructing the 
self is widely acknowledged, some have argued against its importance 
(e.g., Strawson, 2004). It seems likely that there are facets of the self 
that do not depend on narrativity, and these may be developmentally 
prior, and in some sense, more basic structures on which the narrative 
self can be  scaffolded ( Gallagher, 2000). However, there is much 
empirical evidence that narrative self-construals and organizations of 
autobiographical memory play important roles in adaptation and, 
while initially acquired in childhood, these self-narratives continue to 
change in response to life challenges and transitions (McAdams and 
McLean, 2013; Fivush, 2022).
3.2.2 Socio-cultural narratives as active inference
What distinguishes human beings from other animals is the 
temporal scale, scope, complexity, flexibility and inventiveness of 
cooperative activity, guided by cultural history and practice to fashion 
a niche constituted of social practices, norms and institutions 
(Veissière et al., 2020; Henrich and Muthukrishna, 2021).
Storytelling has been an important social process in human 
cultural co-evolution (Boyd, 2010; Smith et al., 2017). We suggest that 
narrative practices can be understood under active inference in terms 
of these uniquely human forms of extended phenotype. Integrating 
the NPH, we suggest that narrative storytelling practices can be viewed 
through the lens of active inference as socially shared patterns that 
prompt human beings to act in culturally prescribed ways—provided, 
of course, that they are enculturated in contextually appropriate ways 
to engage in specialized forms of niche construction through 
coordinated cooperative action that are specific to the human 
adaptation and everyday functioning. To the extent that shared 
narratives govern collective behavior, narrative can facilitate the 
process of predicting the behavior of other members of the group, as 
well as making oneself more predictable to others.
Our proposal is that the engagements of an agent or group of 
agents with their cultural niche through narrative practices enable the 
acquisition of expectations that conform to local regimes of attention. 
A social niche, environment or context presents many cultural 
affordances for action. A pattern of shared attention conveyed by 
bodily, linguistic and contextual cues (patterns of eye movements, 
pointing gestures, etc.) guides learning, by biasing the attributions of 
salience of the child, and thereby conditioning specific, culturally 
sanctioned or normative behaviors involving when, where and how to 
engage with the cultural affordances of an environment (Roepstorff  
et al., 2010 ; Ramstead et al., 2016 ). These patterns of engagement 
include ways to listen to and produce stories, some of which may 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org
be ephemeral but others of which can become cognitive and social 
artifacts that carry much of the weight in predicting future sensory 
outcomes generated by causes like other person’s intentions (e.g., the 
intentions of the caregiver in relation to what she gestures at when 
guiding the child’s attention). In this way, narrative practices help the 
child attune to a cultural niche both through rudimentary attentional 
processes (e.g., attending to gaze or pointing to determine ‘What does 
my mother want me to look at?) and the more elaborate models that 
convey socially appropriate behaviors in particular contexts (e.g., 
‘What do others expect of me in this situation?’), which are presumably 
learned mainly via implicit social learning, through active inference 
in earlier exposures to social situations.
In addition, active inference supports and is consistent with the 
MNF , which also recognizes that narratives are useful to group 
members as providers of predictions that guide the life course, as well 
as for knowledge acquisition, cooperation and social cohesion. Based 
on the active inference understanding that prediction is a crucial 
activity for adaptive organisms, we suggest that generating accurate 
predictions is a key role of master narratives. We argue that seeing 
master narratives as such can explain parsimoniously key aspects of 
each of the characteristics identified by McLean and Syed (2015) . 
Furthermore, seeing narrative as a vehicle for active inference can 
provide answers to some pending questions about the interaction 
between master and alternative narratives. For example, it can help us 
understand why someone would go through the difficulty of adopting 
an alternative (and socially marginalized, contentious or disvalued) 
narrative instead of simply adopting master narrative (i.e., because the 
alternative narrative is more predictive of one’s own reality) 
(McLean, 2024).
In a nutshell, we contend that certain narratives ‘become’ master 
narratives because they serve an important function for the group. 
Specifically, master narratives serve to synchronize the predictions 
that group members generate for their own and others’ future states, 
behaviors, and relationships. The fact that most group members tend 
to adopt the same narrative models of each other’s behavior and life 
course (or identity) makes it easier to predict the behavior and life 
course of oneself and each other. When members of a culture share 
the same master narratives, they share a set of predictions implicitly 
included by this narrative; how they collectively think that events and 
life periods are supposed to unfold. Our model suggests that master 
narratives may be understood as being put in place and maintained 
because of their role in the synchronization of predictions in the group.
Active inference also provides a parsimonious explanation for 
what causes master narratives to be  invisible (tacit, implicit or 
unconscious), ubiquitous (widely adopted by the mass of people), 
compulsory (normatively enforced) and rigid or persistent (hard to 
change). With regard to their compulsory nature, McLean and Syed 
(2015) hypothesize that master narratives are in place because they are 
enforced by those in power who benefit from the system. While this 
certainly has a role to play, this does not explain why many minorities 
tend to internalize the master narratives (which are often demeaning 
to them) (Nadal et al., 2021). Indeed, the counter-intuitive fact that 
minorities and racialized group members may automatically adopt 
many aspects of the master narratives that disadvantage them without 
necessarily having been constrained to do so is well demonstrated by 
research on system-justification theory (Jost and Andrews, 2011). This 
adoption of personally damaging master narratives is also evident in 
the resistance or backlash that some progressive movements face from 
the very people who would most benefit from the structural changes 
they advocate.
To account for this, as a complementary hypothesis to the power-
structure explanation, we suggest that what drives group members to 
adopt a master narrative is partly their added ability to reduce 
prediction-error, which occurs independently of whether or not the 
individuals internalizing the narrative benefit from the system enacted 
or maintained by that narrative. Note that this readiness to accept a 
master narrative to simplify predictive processing can be leveraged by 
those in power to maintain the master narratives that benefit them, 
but we argue that one basis of master narrative internalization lies in 
active inference processes, which make them tacit and more or less 
automatic (or in the words of McLean and Syed, invisible and 
ubiquitous). Group members also adopt master narratives because 
they are a tried-and-true set of predictive models that are easily 
available in their social environment. In addition, some of the 
normative or compulsory nature of the master narratives can 
be  understood as due to the fact that someone who presents an 
alternative narrative literally increases prediction-error for other 
group members. As a result, someone who transgresses the master 
narrative may experience social pressure or shaming by others to 
pressure them to conform in order to reduce the prediction-error that 
they generate for others.
In the same vein, active inference implies that master narrative 
change tends to be difficult and rare because it involves increasing 
prediction-error; this negative effect is more likely when groups share 
the same models (rigidity principle). We suggest that master narratives 
tend to be rigid because they have been found to be satisfactorily 
accurate predictions. Therefore, as McLean and Syed (2015) recognize, 
trying to change a master narrative by adopting an alternative 
narrative is difficult and may involve a risky long-term commitment. 
One price to pay is experiencing the consequences of being a source 
of prediction error for others who still adhere to the master narratives. 
This may require adopting a temporary position as a provocateur and 
agent of change, or an enduring identity as outsider who is viewed as 
unpredictable, disruptive, and a threat to the social order ( Hyde, 
1997). Nonetheless, history offers many examples of individuals and 
marginal groups investing in efforts to transform or replace master 
narratives with alternative narratives (with varying degrees of success), 
despite enduring the irritation or hostility of others. Active inference 
offers a framework to explore the tradeoffs involved in these dynamics 
of cognitive and social change.
The reason why master narratives are not explicitly recognized as 
such by the majority ( invisibility principle) is clarified by active 
inference’s basic assumption that elaborate and effortful information 
processing is not necessary when predictions are confirmed. In effect, 
one reason why master narratives are ‘invisible’ to the majority is 
simply that they are efficient as nonconscious or implicit predictive 
models, and as such do need to be extensively processed or made 
explicit. Indeed, neuropsychological studies support the idea that 
predictions are more extensively processed in the event of prediction-
errors (Den Ouden et al., 2012).
The MNF observes that we are strongly and automatically drawn 
to internalize master narratives, and that internalizing alternative 
narratives is uncommon and difficult. However, it raises the question: 
why would some individuals choose to pursue alternative narratives, 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org
if doing so is such a strenuous endeavor? We  argue that casting 
narrative as active inference can partly answer this question with the 
benefit of remaining consistent with the MNF’s overall claims. Master 
narratives are about what is expected of us from a normative 
standpoint, but individuals are also able to use narrative to craft  
predictions that deviate from societal expectations (i.e., alternative 
narrative). Crucially, while it is true that internalizing an alternative 
narrative would generate prediction-error for other group members 
and thereby constitute a risk, it could also generate more predictive 
accuracy for its beholder, and we suggest that this is the reason why 
some individuals go through the ordeal of adopting them.
Relying on active inference thus explains the risks of internalizing 
alternative narratives (i.e., becoming the source of prediction-error for 
others), while simultaneously explaining why some group members 
would instead choose to adopt alternative narratives: namely, because 
the new narrative yields what more accurate predictions about events 
than those provided by current master narratives. Of course, applying 
an active inference lens to master narratives does not contradict 
existing work, but supplements it, notably with regard to the defining 
principles noted above, while offering a complementary explanation 
for the basic underlying principles that explain the development of 
master narratives.
4 Future directions
Our model also has implications for the overall direction of 
narrative research, with potential downstream consequences for 
several domains of psychology and the human sciences in general. 
For instance, while conceptualizations of narrative identity 
recognize that both the past and the future can contribute equally 
to narrative identity, a review by Syed and McLean (2016)  found 
that almost no research on narrative identity has focused on 
narratives of the future. This emphasis on the past in narrative 
research has persisted, suggesting that there is an implicit 
assumption in the field that the bulk of narrative identity lies in 
recollecting and retelling our past, as if we were first and foremost 
historians of our own lives, and only then authors of its unfolding. 
One contribution of the active inference perspective is to shift the 
emphasis to consider the functions of narratives, even when they 
are about the past, as related to anticipating the adaptive challenges 
of the immediate or longer-term future. Perhaps the most relevant 
questions about identity then are not “Who am I?” or “Who was I?, ” 
but “Who am I becoming?” or “Who will I be?” To examine the 
relative weight of past and future narratives on identity processes, 
future research could compare the degree to which they predict 
aspects of identity processes over time.
In addition, an active inference model of narrative would imply 
that narrative identity is chiefly about the connection between past and 
future, as active inference involves a constant back and forth between 
prediction-errors associated with past experience that informs 
predictions of the future in order to effectively navigate dynamic and 
surprising environments. Narratives should be  especially apt to 
accomplish such complex interrelations between the “ongoing story” 
(McAdams, 2001) and a world that is constantly changing, especially 
given the ways that narratives of past surprises can inform narratives 
of the future (Philippe, 2022). Our model points to the importance of 
studying how narratives of the past and future are related to each other 
to generate possible selves and support predictions about future 
outcomes (Bruner, 1986).
This re-orientation is supported by the work of Chandler and 
Lalonde (1995) and Chandler (2000) who argued for the importance 
of narrative capacities in maintaining a sense of personal continuity 
and projecting the self into the future. Chandler developed a measure 
of the cognitive capacity to maintain a sense of personal continuity by 
presenting children with stories in which the central character 
underwent substantial changes in identity and asked if the character 
remained the same person and, if so, how they knew that. Children’s 
ability to warrant continuity becomes progressively more complex 
with cognitive development, culminating in narrative accounts that 
integrate the notion of continuity of identity with change through 
transformation. Ball and Chandler (1989)  found difficulties in 
warranting the continuity of identity among adolescents hospitalized 
for suicidality compared to those admitted for eating disorders. 
Chandler posited that the failure to project the self into the future was 
a specific risk factor for suicide in the context of psychic pain, role 
disruption, and personal crisis (Chandler and Proulx, 2006). In related 
work, Chandler and Lalonde (1998, 2007) documented a relationship 
between community-level disruptions of collective identity and local 
control (which they termed “cultural continuity”) and rates of suicide 
among Indigenous youth across First Nations in British Columbia. 
This future orientation may be crucial not only for individual survival 
but for the survival of whole communities as Chandler has argued in 
relation to Indigenous Peoples (Chandler, 2013). While Chandler’s 
focus was on the adaptive value of imagining any possible future that 
is in continuity with the past, we suggest that the realizability of a 
predicted or imagined future is an important part of its adaptive value. 
The active inference approach could be used to model the interaction 
between collective narratives of identity and individual future-
oriented identity narration.
A final conceptual contribution of our account of narratives lies in 
its epistemological implications. If narratives function through active 
inference, they can be approached in mechanistic terms to explain facets 
of individual and collective adaptation. Bruner’s (1986) distinction 
between the narrative and paradigmatic modes of knowing remains very 
influential. He insisted that intentionality is central to narrative, but that 
it plays virtually no role in paradigmatic knowing (i.e., how the physico-
chemical world works). While Bruner suggested that the narrative mode 
of knowing pertains to aspects of the world (e.g., meaning and 
intentionality) that are completely distinct from those that pertain to the 
paradigmatic mode, a virtue of active inference modelling is that it 
allows us to reject the hardline distinction between the epistemological 
realms of human meaning and physical mechanism. Understanding 
narrative as active inference then provides a way to bridge the narrative 
and paradigmatic modes. Indeed, a constantly changing world inevitably 
confronts us with uncertainty and, in these instances, generating 
multiple narrative possibilities through imagination is useful in finding 
those that are a good fit. Thus, the narrative mode of knowing, which 
involves considering multiple possibilities, becomes a means to survive 
in the physical world because of the ability it affords to navigate an 
uncertain, imprecise, and constantly changing environment. This 
adaptive value of narrative imagination might be part of why we are 
drawn to and enjoy complex narratives with surprises, cliff-hangers, plot 
twists or unexpected turns: they provide us with a risk-free exploration 
of surprise, enlarging our repertoire of possibilities to be  used in 
predicting events in our own lives. In sum, our active inference account 
Bouizegarene et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1345480
Frontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org
of narratives suggests that Bruner’s distinction is less sharp than it might 
appear. Narratives are in the service of prediction and can be used to 
model both the physical and social world. As tools of communication 
and rhetorical influence, narratives are also a primary vehicle for social 
action in science and in everyday life.
4.1 Future research: the predictive validity 
of narratives
Studies examining predictions under the active inference 
framework have mostly involved the prediction of auditory (Näätänen, 
1990), visual (Stagg et al., 2004), or somatosensory stimuli (Akatsuka 
et al., 2007), or rudimentary event sequences consisting of a succession 
of objects in scenes (Kumaran and Maguire, 2007). In these studies, 
the value of narrative lies in the capacity it affords to represent and 
communicate information about more complex series of events, and 
in doing so, increase the power to predict them in the long term. 
Longitudinal and experimental designs that examine the incremental 
value of narrative for active inference could help us better understand 
the mechanisms responsible for the association between narratives 
and adaptive functioning (e.g., Adler et al., 2016).
One research design that could be used as a basis to test our claim 
that narratives are related to anticipating the adaptive challenges of the 
immediate or longer term future is straightforward: examining the role 
of narrative in enhancing the accuracy of the predictions that 
we  generate or update. D’ Argembeau and Garcia Jimenez (2020) 
created a methodology that could be used to test hypotheses relevant 
to our framework. They measured the degree to which individuals 
could accurately predict an event that they believe could reasonably 
happen to them in the future. At Time 1, they asked participants to 
describe 10 events that they believed could happen to them in the next 
month. At Time 2, a month later, participants were provided with their 
event description and were asked if the event did or did not actually 
occur. We  suggest that adding an experimental component to this 
study’s design could be  used to isolate the effect of narrative on 
predictive accuracy. For instance, one group could provide a narrative 
description of prospective events, as was the case in the original study, 
whereas a second group could be asked to only think about the event 
using non-narrative means (e.g., picturing some features of the event). 
Researchers could use methodologies used in the affective forecast 
literature (Wilson and Gilbert, 2005) to create such control groups. For 
instance, Wilson et  al. (2000) asked participants to think about a 
specific day, estimate what they would be doing and the number of 
hours they would spend on 10 activities. Here, instead of describing 
activities and number of hours, another group would be  asked to 
imagine and provide a narrative description of the events. Based on our 
model, we  hypothesize that a narrative description would 
be significantly more predictive of the actual occurrence of details of 
the narrated events in the future than would non-narrative modes of 
reflection. This basic framework could be  extended to study the 
predictive power of narrative over different time scales, using 
longitudinal and diary study designs.
Also, approaching narrative as active inference could 
be leveraged to complement current studies of the links between 
planning and goal progress (e.g., Oettingen, 2012 ). Narrative has 
been found to bridge the divide between temporally distant events 
(Cohn-Sheehy et al., 2021 ), and thus could presumably lead to more 
accurate predictions of causally connected events. According to our 
model, using narrative to think about goal-related events in the 
future could facilitate goal progress because of better planning. This 
would result in future events that are part of planning (single events 
or a sequence of events leading to goal attainment) being predicted 
with more accuracy. This would help the individual better prepare 
for and take steps toward the desired outcome. In an experimental 
design, one could contrast two conditions (i.e., intention-only and 
intention-narrative), one in which a goal is intended, and another 
one in which goal planning is narrated ( Szpunar and Szpunar, 
2016). An increase in the predictive accuracy of the planning 
should give the narrative group an edge compared to the intention 
group, resulting in more goal progress.
With regard to the social function of narrative, studies could 
use the methodology described above to examine if master 
narratives (i.e., those exhibiting invisibility, ubiquity, compulsivity, 
and rigidity) and alternative narrative are more predictive of actual 
life events. The hypothesis based on active inference would be that 
master narratives or alternative narratives are adopted primarily 
because they increase predictive accuracy. Master narratives that 
depict a life script ( Berntsen and Rubin, 2004 ) that is shared by 
members of a specific group would be  especially relevant for 
empirical purpose. This could be tested by examining the relation 
of life scripts to outcomes over time. Syed and McLean (2023)  
provide a primer on master narrative and life script measurement 
useful for the design of such studies.
Future studies could reveal whether narratives can also improve 
the process of updating existing models to reduce prediction-error 
(see Habermas and Köber, 2015 , for some initial evidence of this). 
That is, narrative use should lead to better updates of erroneous 
models than non-narrative means of representing errors in events. 
The methodology of D’ Argembeau and Garcia Jimenez (2020) could 
be adapted to ask participants to predict an event and focus on the 
subgroup who fail to accurately predict the event. Those participants 
could then be  divided into two groups. In the first group, 
participants would be asked to provide a narrative description of 
how the erroneously predicted event actually occurred, and how it 
should occur in the future; this would prompt belief-updating 
through narrative processing. In the second group, participants 
would only be asked to think about the erroneously predicted event 
and provide a single word or feature to describe it, thereby using 
non-narrative means of reflecting about events. Those in the 
narrative group would be expected to have more predictive accuracy 
than the other group due to the involvement of narrative in 
belief-updating.
The active inference model suggests that there may be different 
strategies for narrative updating depending on the frequency of social-
environmental change. Certainly, if we had to change our models very 
often to understand each other, then some narratives might be more 
a burden than a resource. However, to the extent that individuals are 
encultured in the same social system or niche, they can benefit from 
the relative stability of socio-cultural narrative models afforded by the 
inclusion in the group. Overarching narratives may then provide 
useful predictions and guides to social adaptation. Variations in the 
frequency of updating may reflect the dynamics of cognitive niches 
and communities. There are situations where frequent updating will

be taxing and others where it will foster playful creativity. The active 
inference framework does not currently make assumptions about the 
frequency of updating or its consequences per se, but it could be used 
to model and explore these cognitive and social dynamics.
5 Conclusion
We have proposed a framework for understanding some of the 
key functions of narratives, leveraging the active inference framework 
to clarify the cognitive and social utility of personal and event 
narratives. The contributions of our model to the literature include 
(1) an integration of the cognitive and social functions of narrative, 
(2) a shift towards understanding narrative as basically for predicting 
the future, and (3) the potential to adapt a widely used computational 
toolkit for modelling narrative functions. Despite its wide explanatory 
reach, this model is not meant to be an all-encompassing account of 
narrativity and the many roles narrative plays in human cognition 
and social interaction. In the course of human cultural coevolution, 
our narrative capacities have been put to many novel uses, each of 
which has its own scope and limits. In particular, our active inference 
model of narrativity does not aim to explain completely why 
narratives are so central to art and entertainment. The function of 
literary or cinematic fiction may be to help us get better at simulating 
human experience by widening and enriching the repertoire of 
models that are available to us to predict the future (Mar and Oatley, 
2008). The key role of affect and emotion in these activities may 
reflect their role in organizing and justifying behavior in social 
interactions (Oatley, 1996, 1999). However, many of the aesthetic 
features that contribute to the appeal of narratives may 
be independent from their power to predict real world events. Our 
model also does not aim to explain why some individuals with 
psychological or neurological disorders may have difficulty using 
narrative to accurately predict their futures—though it provides a 
framework that could be  used to develop a typology of 
narrative pathologies.
The current account integrates the basic functions of narrative as 
a representational and communicational process, through an active 
inference lens. Narratives segment the beginning and end of specific 
events, enabling the capacity to build and maintain an information 
pool of specific past events to inform expectations, and to structure 
the imagination of the future in the enriched format of episodic 
future projection. The meaning-making function of narrative is 
especially useful for the exploratory phase of active inference, in that 
it allows us to draw new links between various facets of our 
experiences to incorporate changes in representations (i.e., model 
updating) and assimilate unexpected information (when needed). 
The coherence function of narrative is used to maintain and replicate 
the integrity of our complex network of expectations to minimize 
internal contradictions, as well as providing expectations linked to 
culturally common situations and typical life trajectories. Narrative 
storytelling practices can be usefully understood via active inference, 
in so far as they function by providing agents with immersive regimes 
of attention and deontic cues that prompt encultured individuals to 
react in culturally prescribed ways to engage with their niche. Finally, 
an active inference lens clarifies the defining characteristics of master 
narratives, while suggesting the reasons why some individuals go 
through the ordeal of adopting alternative narratives that challenge 
the conventional story.
In sum, the importance and ubiquity of narratives in many 
domains of human adaptation and sociality can be parsimoniously 
explained by recognizing their role in human social life, via active 
inference. Cast as active inference, narratives are an evolved capacity 
that promote human adaptation for individuals and groups 
(McAdams, 2019). From the point of view of active inference, it 
becomes clear that narrative capacity is not only a medium for human 
cognition and sociality but through its basic structure contributes to 
the adaptability of individuals and communities. Active inference 
provides new tools for modelling the narrative dynamics that link 
cognition and social interaction.
