This paper incorporates schematic concepts related to mental inertia and provides 
an avenue for interpreting psychology using the principles of classical mechanics. 
Schemas find wide application in diverse fields, ranging from ergonomics to 
psychotherapy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to incorporate schemas themselves into 
a more unified and comprehensive theoretical framework. Drawing upon the 
free energy principle (FEP) and the second law of thermodynamics, it is evident 
that humans possess a natural inclination to construct and maintain consistent 
cognitive structures. This characteristic contributes to the stability of schemas 
within a defined range. The particular scope of the model is closely intertwined 
with its structure, leading to variations among individuals in diverse environments. 
The coherence of the schema within a defined range can be perceived as the 
magnitude of mental inertia. This psychological analogy emphasizes the 
importance of considering the influences exerted by the external environment 
and their effects on mental inertia when predicting the human mind and behavior.

1. Introduction
The overarching aim of psychological research is to predict and control human behavior. 
Several studies have been conducted to predict and understand human behavior, with the 
Theory of Mind (TOM) being one such example. The TOM posits that people’s behaviors can 
be predicted and understood by considering their mental states, encompassing beliefs, desires, 
and emotions (Wellman, 2014). However, predicting human psychology and behavior becomes 
intricate when attempting to account for the interplay between the environment and human 
adaptation within the context of understanding human cognition. Nevertheless, by likening 
schemas, which are structured cognitive frameworks, novel perspectives can be obtained for 
predicting human psychology and behavior. Based on the principles of the free energy principle 
(FEP) (Friston, 2013) and the second law of thermodynamics (SLT) (Carnot, 1824), schemas 
are systematically constructed to maintain their viability. This exhibits certain resemblances to 
the manifestations of inertia. The Free Energy Principle emphasizes that systems undergo 
changes aimed at reducing their free energy (Friston et al., 2006). Additionally, the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics states that energy tends to become disordered in a closed system, as it 
naturally seeks to disperse. Based on these two principles, when considering the individual and 
their environment as a whole, the internal state of the individual tends to become disordered. 
Consequently, the individual schema plays a crucial role as a necessary mental structure for 
maintaining the stability of their mental state. This implies that our focus should extend beyond 
understanding and explaining the mental processes and behaviors of individuals, and place

greater importance on comprehending how forces and mental inertia 
influence changes in individuals and their recognition of 
existing patterns.
Schemas have been extensively applied in diverse fields, including 
psychotherapy and ergonomics, providing evidence of their value. The 
interdisciplinary significance of the unified concept of schema has 
been demonstrated in various domains, including interdisciplinary 
research on spatial schemas (Farzanfar et al., 2022), the theory does 
not adequately address the central core of the schematic structure, 
which is crucial for establishing a unified framework that encompasses 
multiple disciplines. The emphasis of this unified framework lies in 
defining a common core concept that transcends different fields of 
study. Through the classification of cognitive processing, the concept 
of schema applied in ergonomics and psychotherapy can 
be harmonized within a schema framework.
This paper primarily focuses on the correlation between the Free 
Energy Principle (FEP) and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
(SLT) about schemas, as well as the application of Newton’s first law in 
psychology. Firstly, it will discuss the successful interdisciplinary 
applications of schemas in the fields of ergonomics and psychotherapy, 
where the term “schema” is utilized and conceptually understood in 
both disciplines regarding cognitive perception. Furthermore, this 
paper will highlight the construction of schematic structures and the 
predictive role of mental inertia and forces in human behavior. It also 
proposes that the stability of the schematic structure can be attributed 
to the FEP and SLT. Based on these findings, when both the 
thermodynamic theorem and the Free Energy Principle suggest that 
the schematic structure remains constant, the schematic structure can 
be  conceptually aligned with mental inertia. This implies an 
advancement in the application of Newton’s laws to psychology.
2. The conception of schema applied 
in schema therapy
Schemas are organized units that contain factors including 
cognitive, emotional, and behavioral states, and individuals 
consistently exhibit the same cognitive, emotional, and behavioral 
patterns repeatedly (Lazarus et al., 2020). Some psychologists oppose 
the simplified model of conscious experience, more because the 
simplified model cannot account for the complexity of the visitor’s 
experience ( Connolly and van Deventer, 2017 ). That complexity 
derives from the variability of individuals themselves and their 
environments, but the way individuals construct schemas is relatively 
simple. Schemas are formed from the development of past 
understandable cognitive and affective models and construct current 
experiences (Stein and Y oung, 1997). Y oung argues that early adverse 
childhood experiences are central to personality disorders, mild 
personality trait problems, and chronic Axis I disorders, and defines 
some schemas as EMS (Early maladaptive schema) ( Y oung, 1999). 
Schema therapy was originally introduced into psychotherapy to 
complement cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with chronic 
personality problems due to unique personality traits that are not 
directly related to an Axis I diagnosis and also make them maladaptive 
to standard cognitive therapy (Y oung et al., 1996). Schema models are 
widely used in schema therapy ( Bernstein et al., 2021 ), long-term 
psychotherapy was found to be effective in the treatment of violent 
offenders with personality disorders for rehabilitation.
EMSs are a persistent and widespread cognitive structure that 
develops based on an individual and environmental basis influenced 
by early life experiences and hinders subsequent successful adaptation 
to life (Y akın et al., 2020). Y oung (1990) suggests that it serves as a 
trait-like, stable cognitive structure that, when combined with coping 
responses and or health functions, results in a temporary state of 
emotional-cognitive behavior known as a schema model. People 
experience different schemas and have different schema transitions, 
but groups of schemas can act as a cohesive and unique unit “I” across 
various events and incidents (Lazarus et al., 2020), and this unique 
unit will further become a personal schema on the basement 
of metacognition.
In Schema Therapy, Schema Modes are divided into four 
categories, the Child Schema, the Parenting Schema, the Maladaptive 
Coping Schema, and the Healthy Adult Schema (Y oung et al., 2003) 
where the Healthy Adult is considered to be the mature, empathetic, 
and psychologically competent person who believes, senses and 
behaves in the schema (Edwards, 2022), the concept of maturity and 
“fully functioning person, ” Maslow’s ( Maslow, 1971 ) “self-
actualization” and “self-transcendence, ” and the traditional concept of 
“wisdom “( Baltes and Staudinger, 2000 ), among other concepts, 
are consistent.
By utilizing a predictive model that considers these concepts 
and examples, it becomes clear that it is not possible to establish a 
predetermined definition of behaviors and cognitions that 
constitute a model of healthy adulthood. Interestingly, even in some 
challenging environments, there is the potential for cognitive 
benefits to emerge. Therefore, we can only affirm that healthy adults 
(Edwards, 2022 ) possess the ability to engage in “responsible, 
emotionally connected, and tolerant communication, ” while also 
demonstrating “reciprocally consistent communication, ” and 
exhibiting a “democratic, consistent, and coherent identity. ” This 
presents a dilemma in which we  can only speculate about the 
underlying mechanism based on the observed symptoms, rather 
than accurately predicting the symptoms based on the mechanism. 
Viewing it from a schematic perspective, a psychologically healthy 
adult is sufficiently mature to understand their schema and can 
adjust it to suit the environment. Therefore, it can be argued that 
when an individual’s schema fails to align with the environment, 
there is a significant probability that they will experience adverse 
psychological symptoms in the future.
Based on the theoretical framework of forensic Schema Therapy 
(ST), criminal and violent behaviors can be  comprehended by 
examining schema models or sequences of momentary states that 
encompass emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. These schema 
models can predict future violations of behavioral regulations 
(Keulen-de Vos et  al., 2016). These research studies highlight the 
predictive role of schemas. Nevertheless, the current research on the 
mechanisms underlying changes in psychiatric symptoms faces a 
limitation in that the hypotheses have yet to be  experimentally 
validated ( Hoyer et  al., 2017 ). At present, the hypothesized 
mechanisms are predominantly evaluated using trait instruments 
rather than State Aggression measures. This shift in approach places 
greater emphasis on predicting symptoms based on the present state, 
rather than predicting the mechanisms that give rise to these 
symptoms (Y akın et al., 2020). This statement suggests the importance 
of investigating a mechanism that can effectively predict the onset of 
a disease. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for a unified framework 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711

that focuses on understanding the mechanisms involved in 
predicting symptoms.
3. The conception of schema applied 
in ergonomics and automatic 
processes in cognition
Schema theory demonstrated to be successfully applied to core 
domains of ergonomics, including SA (Situation Awareness), NDA 
(Naturalistic decision-making), and error research. It is believed to 
be  potentially the theoretical foundation for the unification of 
ergonomics (Plant and Stanton, 2013). Schema theory is also broadly 
applied in ergonomics, including human–computer interaction 
(Chalmers, 2003 ), tool use ( Baber, 2006 ), military applications 
(Stanton et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 2008), and a variety of transport 
domains including road (Walker et al., 2011), rail (Stanton and Walker, 
2011), and aviation ( Plant and Stanton, 2012 ). However, Schema 
theory has received criticism for the lack of consensus on its 
definitions and the absence of a unified theory (Plant and Stanton, 
2013). One of the major criticisms directed toward schema theory is 
the lack of a unified theoretical framework that encompasses all 
dimensions of the theory ( Lodge et  al., 1991 ). A theory must 
be  capable of both predicting and explaining world phenomena 
(Kerlinger and Lee, 2000 ). For instance, a study revealed that 
individuals who hold both motorcycle and car licenses have a 
decreased probability of being involved in car-motorcycle accidents in 
comparison to those who possess only a car license (Magazzù et al., 
2006). According to schema theory, individuals with a car-only license 
exhibit greater cognitive incompatibility between car drivers and 
motorcyclists due to the absence of the necessary schema to effectively 
manage diverse road scenarios (Walker et al., 2011). This example is 
also seen as a predictive role of schema theory ( Plant and Stanton, 
2013). Schema theory provides insights into the function of schema 
organization in the mind, acting as mental templates that guide 
attention towards perceived information. The active and adaptable 
nature of schematic structures allows incoming information to shape 
and modify schemas, ultimately influencing perception ( Neisser, 
1976). In conceptual terms, Neisser defines schemas as organized 
mental structures of thought and behavior that are utilized to organize 
knowledge of the world ( Neisser, 1976). Meanwhile, schemas are 
structured units that encompass cognitive, emotional, and behavioral 
states. Within these schematic structures, individuals consistently and 
repeatedly demonstrate the same cognitive, emotional, and behavioral 
patterns (Lazarus et  al., 2020 ). Although the two conceptions of 
schemas stem from different domains, they demonstrate striking 
similarities, except for variations in emotional aspects. This conceptual 
alignment serves as the basis for establishing a unified construct.
The hierarchical nature of schemata plays a crucial role in their 
functioning. One of the fundamental assumptions is that actions can 
be  specified at the highest-level schema, and once this activation 
occurs, lower-level schemata autonomously complete the action 
sequence (Norman, 1981). It is worth emphasizing that the term 
“nodes” should not be interpreted as physical structures. Instead, it 
refers to mental representations and their interconnections. The use 
of nodes and associations serves as a metaphorical representation of 
the structure and linkage of knowledge within the mind (Plant and 
Stanton, 2013). Furthermore, Minsky’s Frame Theory (Minsky, 1975) 
posits that human intelligence is derived from the top-down 
processing of stored background information, serving as a 
complement to organizational structures. Similarly, Schank and 
Abelson’s Script Theory (Schank and Abelson, 1977) views schemas as 
the embodiment of procedural knowledge, offering an explanatory 
perspective for schema theory and its practical applications. Different 
from the script ( Albarracin et  al., 2021 ) that it takes a different 
approach by considering scripts as sequences of events in a given type 
of situation, without employing the active inference apparatus to 
construct a formalization of scripts.
From a conceptual perspective, the application of schema in 
ergonomics exhibits a remarkable similarity to automatic processing 
in cognitive processes. According to Shiffrin and Schneider, cognitive 
processes encompass both voluntary and automatic processes, with 
the latter not being governed by arbitrary control, not emphasizing the 
limitations of the system’s capacity, and not necessarily demanding 
attention (Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977). Anderson highlighted that a 
variety of automatic processes can be  conditioned to respond to 
stimuli and prioritize historical task relevance. These processes exhibit 
quick and flexible adaptations to facilitate goal-directed behavior. 
Additionally, Anderson suggested that the conceptualization of 
automatic processes may extend beyond our conventional 
understanding of cognitive control (Anderson, 2018).
Although we categorize unconscious processes as automatic and 
conscious processes as voluntary, then Wiggins (2020) “it now seems 
equally credible that goals experienced as conscious decisions are 
generated non-consciously, and then enter conscious awareness, as the 
more intuitive converse. ” Automatic and voluntary processes are 
inherently interconnected aspects of cognition, and it is conceivable 
that automatic processes carry greater weight in predicting the human 
mind and behavior. The repetitive nature of automatic processes, 
combined with the purposeful adaptations of schematic structures to 
establish equilibrium with the environment, contribute to the 
predictability of both repetitive behaviors and cognitive processes, 
especially when the environment remains relatively stable. Several 
studies have discovered that human decision outcomes are determined 
before conscious awareness, implying that automatic processes exert 
a more significant influence on cognition than previously believed. 
This plausible result aligns with existing research findings (Soon et al., 
2008). Although automatic processes seem highly relevant to 
psychological prediction, they can sometimes be misleading. This is 
due to the close integration and strong correlation between automatic 
and voluntary processes, which are significantly influenced by 
individual environments. Consequently, it is erroneous to consider 
automatic processes as the sole focus of predicting human psychology 
and behavior comprehensively. The role of schematic structure 
becomes apparent in the predictive capacity of automatic processes 
when individuals operate within stable and unchanging environments, 
where significant changes are unnecessary. The schematic structure, 
resembling mental inertia, tends to maintain existing actions and, to 
some extent, supports the persistence of automatic processes. 
However, when external forces exert a substantial impact or other 
factors come into play, individuals may change their behavioral states 
or modify their behaviors by adjusting their schemas. During such 
instances, the predictive function of automatic processes diminishes, 
necessitating consideration of additional factors. Undoubtedly, the 
analogy between the size of the schematic structure and the magnitude 
of mental inertia serves as the primary step in considering multiple 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org
influences during the process of psychological prediction. This 
analogy helps eliminate many influences that are inadequate to bring 
about behavioral change. Furthermore, learning provides a pathway 
to explore the connection between automatic and voluntary processes. 
Learning is a transfer from one system to another (Sigman et al., 2005; 
Sigman, 2017) and the process of structuring schemas encompasses 
both of these systems. Mariano Sigman put forward the notion that 
learning encompasses the transfer of knowledge between different 
systems, specifically involving the shift from voluntary control 
(cortical dorsal system) to automatic control (ventral system) (Sigman 
et al., 2005; Sigman, 2017). In this scenario, the two cognitive processes 
are closely intertwined. In the realm of cognitive analysis, drawing an 
analogy between automatic processes and the concept of psychological 
inertia, and further, likening voluntary processes to forces symbolizing 
the influx of information, illuminates the perspective that the process 
of learning can be conceptualized as a force transcending psychological 
inertia. Consequently, this cognitive force propels individuals towards 
active engagement in learning behaviors. Such engagement yields a 
spectrum of potential outcomes, notably including the expansion of 
schematic structure. The objectives of learning can be  seen as an 
iterative interplay between voluntary control and automatic 
processing. Through this iterative process, continuous learning results 
in an enhancement of automatic processes, which form an integral 
part of the schematic structure.
Nesser’s PCM perspective (Cyclical Perception Model) explains 
the cyclical process of interaction between individuals and the 
environment. In this model, the schemas held by individuals serve as 
predictive mechanisms in perception, exerting influence on decision-
making and directly impacting actions. Hohwy mentioned PEM 
(prediction error minimization) (Hohwy, 2016) which means that the 
brain continuously minimizes the error between the predicted sensory 
input based on the brain’s model of the world and the actual sensory 
input (Friston and Stephan, 2007). We can further construe PEM as 
the proactive pursuit of information by the individual to refine their 
schematic structure, thereby molding them into patterns that align 
most harmoniously with the environment. This process, in turn, 
serves to bolster cognitive inertia or diminish the propensity for 
compelled individual adjustments. However, we have some studies 
that find that human decision-making is not entirely rational 
(Kahneman, 1979) although these studies are not sufficient to disprove 
the argument that humans make rational decisions. For humans, the 
rational construction of our schema represents the closest 
approximation to the mentioned healthy adult schema, showcasing 
the highest level of maturity. In this well-developed schema, both 
automatic and voluntary processes work harmoniously. Early 
Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) serve an adaptive role in situations where 
rationality is not fully developed or fails to function effectively. 
Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that relying solely on EMS may 
hinder a smooth and successful life in the long term, rather than 
serving as a sustainable solution. Building upon this premise, 
considering the intricate nature of individuals and their environment, 
as well as the multitude of confounding variables arising from their 
interaction, the schema-based prediction model highlights relatively 
consistent schematic structures as enduring variables. To bring about 
changes in a schematic structure, an equivalent or greater force is 
necessary, which can be  achieved through modifications in the 
voluntary control system or alterations in the external environment. 
When focusing on Early Maladaptive Schemas, it is reasonable to 
expect that as the complexity of the encompassing schema increases, 
the magnitude of force required for transformation also intensifies.
Consequently, this paper aims to minimize discussions on factors 
such as culture and other aspects of schematic structure, focusing 
primarily on exploring schematic structure itself and providing a 
rationale for analogizing it to mental inertia. Nevertheless, the scope 
of this framework extends beyond being a unified theoretical 
foundation solely for ergonomics. It can serve as a comprehensive 
framework for studying the human mind and behavior across various 
domains. This is accomplished by drawing an analogy between the 
schema and the notion of mental inertia.
4. Schematic structure and mental 
inertia and force
In the context of transportation, mental inertia can be defined as 
the occurrence of unintentional, goal-directed repetitive behaviors, 
mental representations, and automatic behavioral responses (Sommer, 
2011). In sociological and psychological contexts, mental inertia is 
recognized to possess three distinct properties: the ability to learn 
from repeated behaviors, being triggered by content-related or script-
based processes, and ultimately giving rise to the manifestation of 
automatic behaviors (Haggar et al., 2019). It is assumed that mental 
inertia and habituation have similar meanings and are interchangeable 
in diverse literature (Gao et al., 2020).
If we not only conceptualize the comparison between classical 
physics and psychology but also take into account their practical 
application, it becomes crucial to establish a relationship between 
psychological schemas and physical mass. According to Newton’s first 
law (Newton, 1848), an object will maintain a state of rest or motion 
unless a force is exerted. The development of human mental schemas 
is influenced by environmental stimuli, which can be  regarded as 
forces, while the magnitude of human mental schemas can be seen as 
a form of mental inertia. In 1872, Ernst Mach posited that the inertial 
mass of a particle is somehow influenced by the presence of other 
masses in the universe (Mach, 1872), an idea that influenced Volkmar 
Putz’s contention that the inertia of a mass is a phenomenon 
exclusively induced by the gravitational influence of other masses 
(Putz, 2019). In the context of this analogy, it becomes evident that 
individual schemas are influenced by environmental stimuli. 
Following Newton’s first law, if the external stimuli surpass the mental 
inertia, individuals will undergo corresponding changes in their 
mental structures, ultimately leading to behavioral modifications. 
Conversely, if the stimuli are insufficient to surpass the mental inertia, 
no significant changes in mental or behavioral patterns will occur. 
However, it is vital to avoid linking mental inertia exclusively to 
specific behaviors. Rather, it reflects an individual’s tendency to 
maintain recurring behaviors, which may be associated with specific 
behaviors but should not be narrowly confined to them. If schema 
models are considered trait-type stable cognitive structures (Yo u n g ,  
1990), then they can be measurable.
In the field of psychology, the PMT (Psychological Momentum 
Theory) hypothesis suggests that changes in response rate are directly 
linked to the magnitude of the intervention or stimulus. It is worth 
noting that this hypothesis does not provide a clear analogy to the 
concept of momentum ( Deemer et  al., 2021), but rather uses the 
response rate (velocity) to define mass (inertia). According to their 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711
Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
viewpoint, individuals who do not actively pursue a specific task are 
characterized as being in a low-momentum state or having a low 
degree of momentum. Conversely, individuals who make efforts to 
pursue a given task are defined as having a high degree of momentum 
or being in a high-momentum state. A problem arises when trying to 
measure an individual’s mental inertia solely based on behavioral 
response rates, as this does not provide a comprehensive definition of 
mental inertia. From the individual perspective, the given task is seen 
as a force that is used to alter the motor state, and regardless of 
whether the state one maintains is related to the given task, we cannot 
determine whether the high momentum state (the state of pursuing 
the given mission) that the individual maintains after the altered 
motor state originates from his/her high mental mass or high velocity. 
This is the most important point because momentum is equal to mass 
times velocity (Markman and Guenther, 2007). As a result, these two 
factors exert an equal influence on psychological momentum. It is 
argued that if an individual manages to reach a state in which he/she 
performs an activity at a high frequency, it will be easier to continue 
performing that particular action (i.e., high inertia or large HMSI) 
(Deemer et al., 2021). This view of the state is plausible, but there are 
some problems with the definition of mental inertia. The correct 
characterization of this state implies that if an individual manages to 
consistently engage in an activity with a high frequency, they should 
be deemed to possess a state of high velocity. Additionally, the longer 
they can maintain this state without being influenced by external 
forces, the greater their mental inertia, which can be described as a 
high level of High Mental Inertia (HMSI). It is crucial to recognize 
that if an individual effortlessly enters a state of performing an activity 
with a high frequency, their mental inertia would be low.
5. Expansion of schematic structure 
and increase in mental inertia
Conditioned reflexes can contribute to the process of schema 
construction. The establishment of conditioned reflexes is not 
restricted to specific observable behaviors but also influences the 
development of schemas. Mental inertia is represented by the degree 
of value, importance, and timeliness that an individual places on a 
particular behavior with situational variables ( Markman and 
Guenther, 2007). An escalation in the perceived importance of a 
certain object or behavior contributes to an augmentation of 
psychological inertia. Here is a corollary regarding mental inertia and 
schematic structure. Taking Pavlov’s dog as an example, before the 
establishment of the conditioned reflex, the dog did not respond to the 
bell, indicating that the ringing held no significance for the dog. 
However, after completing the conditioned reflex training, the dog’s 
response to the bell became important. Consequently, the schematic 
structure of bell food salivation appeared within the dog’s cognitive 
framework. The ringing transitioned from being inconsequential to 
significant. According to the definition of mental inertia mentioned 
earlier, mental inertia expands. The role of Pavlov’s conditioned reflex 
is not solely attributed to the association formed between the 
conditioned and unconditioned stimuli due to their proximity. It is 
more importantly driven by the conditioned stimulus reliably 
anticipating the appearance of the unconditioned stimulus, which is 
regarded as the learning of relationships between these events 
(Rescorla, 1988). This learning of relationships between events shares 
similarities with the formation of schematic structures. However, it is 
crucial to acknowledge that conditioning represents just one among 
numerous learning processes (Rescorla, 1988). Furthermore, we can 
observe that the pursuit of meaning behind the bell sound is futile 
since it ultimately points to food, which serves as the fundamental 
source of meaning for the bell sound. Therefore, if we aim to control 
the dog’s consistent response to the bell sound, it is enough to ensure 
that the association between the bell sound and food remains intact 
within the dog’s environment, without requiring attention to the dog’s 
“mental process” or other factors. The establishment of the association 
between bell sounds and food not only enriches the schematic 
structure of dogs but can also be interpreted as an augmentation of 
mental inertia. As a result, animals develop stronger resistance to 
analogous connections between conditioned stimuli and 
unconditioned reflexes. This inference can also explain why the rats 
(Kamin, 1969 ) failed to acquire anticipatory responses to light, 
indicating that the effects generated by similar stimuli (light and 
sound) are no longer capable of modifying the rats’ already elevated 
mental mass. In other words, the heightened mental mass strengthens 
the rats’ resistance to other stimuli. When a human schema is formed 
without additional information input or voluntary processes, the 
schema tends to remain relatively stable. Due to the presence of 
mental inertia, it spontaneously resists the influence of information 
below its threshold. This resistance is manifested in the persistence of 
current behaviors. This suggests that if an external force (information) 
is not sufficiently strong, it will not induce a modification in the 
schema, resulting in no mental or behavioral changes. Conversely, 
when an external force does bring about a mental or behavioral 
change, the schema will either remain unaltered or undergo an 
increase, leading to an escalation or preservation of mental inertia.
According to Piaget, in the process of cognitive development, the 
construction of schemas or structures unfolds by progressing from 
simple to complex forms. Furthermore, Piaget highlights that the 
acquired structures are subservient to the ongoing development of the 
structures themselves (Piaget, 1964). It is justifiable to assert that the 
conditioned reflexes present at birth form the basis for the establishment 
of schematic structures and the presence of mental inertia. On one hand, 
this established relationship constantly receives input from the external 
world and actively constructs its schema. The initial conditioned reflex 
of an infant is a tendency to respond for survival. One of the remarkable 
strengths of a newborn is the complete set of useful reflexes, with certain 
conditioned behavioral patterns referred to as survival reflexes due to 
their significance in ensuring survival (Berne, 2003). Moreover, some 
conditioned reflexes also establish a positive bond with the caregiver, 
such as sucking on the nipple (Shaffer and Kipp, 2013), on the other 
hand, once a schema is formed and solidified, it tends to resist any forces 
that may disrupt it. The infant or the conditioned reflex is not concerned 
with who establishes this inclination but rather whether it can 
be established. And once the schema is reinforced through repetitive 
experiences, it becomes stable in its response.
6. An alternative explanation for the 
tendency of the structure shown to 
maintain stability
The tendency of individuals to preserve the stability of the 
depicted structure is influenced by the interplay between the free 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711
Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org
energy principle (FEP) and the second law of thermodynamics. The 
second law of thermodynamics postulates that the energy of an 
isolated system has a tendency to be disordered, and the concept of 
entropy is used to describe the degree of disorder of this energy, which 
also corresponds to the degree of organization of a particular given 
system (Rabeyron, 2021). Biological systems are thermodynamically 
open because they exchange energy and entropy with their 
environment ( Friston et  al., 2006 ). Therefore, living organisms 
endeavor to sustain a reduced level of entropy by actively engaging 
with the environment. From this perspective, living systems mitigate 
internal entropy by “externalizing” it to the surrounding environment, 
thereby expelling disorder and upholding internal order (Rabeyron, 
2021). In neuroscience, this principle is known as the “free energy 
principle” (Rabeyron, 2021). In 1969, Stoker introduced a hierarchical 
model that encompasses three levels: the inorganic domain at the 
lowest level, the organic domain at the intermediate level, and the 
information domain at the highest level (Stoker, 1969). Building upon 
this notion, Grobbelaar posited that these hierarchical relationships 
play a crucial role in establishing the individual as a cohesive entity, 
with each lower level of organization defining the boundaries and 
parameters for the subsequent level (Grobbelaar, 2012). In essence, 
this can be perceived as a constraint that influences the higher levels 
based on the lower levels. Connolly and van Deventer have put forth 
a three-level recursive description of psychoanalytic conditioning 
principles ( Connolly and van Deventer, 2017 ) influenced by 
Grobbelaar’s description (Grobbelaar, 2012) (and a similar model 
found in Connolly (2016)), which contains the inorganic (atoms and 
molecules), organic (cells, tissues, organs, systems, and organisms), 
and psychological layers (self-defense and pleasure principles).
In 2013, Friston proposed the notion of the “Markov blanket, ” 
enabling the exchange of the system’s internal state with its external 
state (Friston, 2013). This “Markov blanket” is essential for effectively 
separating the internal and external states, necessitating the 
preservation of minimum free energy within the internal state. 
Furthermore, Friston introduced the concept of a “working model” or 
“generative model” that allows individuals to simulate the environment 
through predictive mechanisms. By enhancing expected outcomes, 
this approach fosters organismal development and leads to a reduction 
in internal entropy (Friston, 2009). At each layer of the system, the 
formation of the internal state triggers the role of the Markov blanket 
as a boundary, effectively distinguishing the internal and external 
systems. For example, as the organic system emerges within the 
inorganic system, the Markov blanket acts as a boundary, separating 
the organic and inorganic components. Similarly, at the mental level, 
the Markov blanket serves to segregate internal mental processes from 
external chaotic stimuli, establishing an organized mental structure. 
Since each domain operates under the free energy principle, which 
drives an inherent tendency for increasing entropy and returning to a 
lower level, the preservation of the Markov blanket’s state becomes 
crucial. While the free energy of the working model may not 
be  minimized, its viability rests on being below the external free 
energy. This requirement entails the establishment of an organized 
and stable structure, with the working model’s inherent tendency to 
maintain internal stability serving as the cornerstone for upholding 
stability within the personal schema. Kuperberg proposed a 
hierarchical framework that contributes to our understanding of 
cognitive mechanisms, emphasizing their strong correlation with the 
generation and acquisition of sequential movements ( Kuperberg, 
2021). In the case of schemas, these investigations primarily 
concentrate on the process and content of construction, rather than 
the resulting implications. In my view, the free energy principle 
pertains to the idea that the primary objective of schema construction 
is to minimize internal entropy as much as possible.
Freud’s death drive is considered a tendency for living matter to 
gravitate toward inorganic matter (Armengou, 2009), which means 
that if the death drive acts on the Markov blanket, it will continue to 
be acted upon by the death drive, and if the Markov blanket loses its 
function, the individual will not be  able to stabilize his or her 
psychological state. Rabeyron proposed that just as cellular structures 
need closed boundaries to ensure their survival, mentally such closed 
structures can distinguish between the inside and the outside 
(Rabeyron, 2021), but such closed structures also need to maintain a 
certain exchange with the environment and keep their structures 
stable during the exchange, and we can consider this as the reason for 
schema construction. It has been suggested (Tran The et al., 2020) that 
if the entropy of the universe tends to increase to a maximum, 
according to Clausius’ theory, the closer the universe gets to the limit 
state, the more the possibility of new changes will disappear and when 
this state is reached, there will be no further changes and the universe 
will find itself in a “state of continuous death” ( Clausius, 1868 ; 
Locqueneux, 2009). These considerations make it possible to reread 
the hypothesis that Freud had about the death drive, “If we apply to 
live organisms this tendency of the universe toward a state of 
equilibrium, defined by the irreversible absence of all discernible 
motion and all difference in tendency – in other words, equivalent to 
a definitive death – we can envisage a closed system consisting of the 
unit “organism-environment. ” The “organism-environment” can also 
be considered psychologically as the life space (Levin, 1936) of Levin, 
and these ideas are in agreement. The definition of life and death (Tran 
The et al., 2020) “according to Prochiantz, also be interpreted as an 
argument against any concept of life as a singular point of resistance 
to the second law of thermodynamics. That is to say, as a structure 
that, at a given point, opposes increasing entropy (Prochiantz, 1990) .”
Levin asserted that psychological events are intricately influenced 
by the simultaneous state of both the individual and the environment 
(Levin, 1936 ). Unlike physics, which deals with singular closed 
systems and applies Newton’s laws of motion, psychology examines 
multiple open systems (Heidbreder, 1937). The schematic structure, 
like the mental topology, operates within defined boundaries and 
exhibits a semi-closed nature. However, it is crucial to distinguish that 
the schematic structure is not an exact representation of the entire 
topology. Rather, it encompasses the repeated and organized elements 
within the mental topology. By mitigating the propensity for entropy 
to escalate within the internal system, the schematic structure serves 
as a stabilizing force. Rabeyron (2021) cited “the aim of all life is death 
and, looking backward, inanimate things existed before living ones” 
(Freud, 1920 ). From this perspective, it is posited that death, 
representing an inorganic state, is an intrinsic and indispensable 
aspect of life, which is characterized by its organic nature. Moreover, 
it is suggested that every living entity can be perceived as a mortal 
being, existing and evolving within the dimension of time. The 
previously mentioned “Markov blanket” serves a dual role. On one 
hand, it functions as a connecting link between the internal and 
external aspects of the system. On the other hand, it serves the 
purpose of delineating and distinguishing the internal structure from 
the external environment ( Friston, 2013 ). Mental structures are 
restricted by the organism (Connolly and van Deventer, 2017). These 
constraints not only limit the formation of mental structures by 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org
exerting a force that dissolves them, but they also generate a 
counteracting force that organizes their structure, thereby maintaining 
the overall integrity of the mental structure. Bernfeld and Feitelberg 
attempted to elucidate mental functioning through the lens of entropy, 
providing experimental evidence that the determinants of human 
behavior are partially governed by the principle of entropy (Bernfeld 
and Feitelberg, 1931). Rabeyron argued that entropy gives rise to a 
“momentum or impulse” in inanimate matter, leading to the 
emergence of organizational structures through successive 
transformations. From this perspective, entropy does not directly 
impact the organism or the mental state but instead serves as a 
regulatory mechanism for the living being, as Thomas Rabeyron 
quotes Freud (1924) for the death drive turning outward to produce 
“destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or will for power for 
mastery, or will for power. ” The concept of the death drive, in itself, 
does not carry any intrinsic value or additional connotations. From 
the perspective of conditioned reflexes, it simply serves as an 
unconditioned stimulus to which individuals respond instinctively. 
When the unconditioned reflex associated with death becomes linked 
with other stimuli or behaviors that lead to death, individuals will 
naturally seek to avoid such stimuli or behaviors. The organism 
exhibits a strong reaction towards death, which, in my view, can 
be  considered an unconditioned response. From an entropy 
perspective, an organism can be deemed “dead” when it no longer 
maintains a decrease in internal entropy or when the Markov blanket 
loses its effectiveness, allowing for unrestricted exchange of various 
substances and energy with the environment.
Taking an alternative perspective on Freud’s statement regarding 
death as a state of life, we can posit that living beings are not driven 
solely by the pursuit of entropy reduction. Instead, they aim to 
mitigate or temporarily halt the increase in entropy. Furthermore, 
living beings can be  perceived as a continuous process of 
transformation instigated by entropy – a phenomenon that extends 
beyond organic matter to encompass inorganic structures (Rabeyron, 
2021). The mental hierarchy, constrained by the living organism, 
serves the purpose of not only assisting the organism in its pursuit of 
slowing down or temporarily suspending entropy but also exhibiting 
its inclination to decelerate or suspend. This tendency leads the mental 
hierarchy to make decisions that aim to mitigate or pause the incessant 
increase in free energy, rather than actively seeking a decrease in free 
energy. Consequently, this can be  likened to the deterministic 
inclination or deterministic impact that individuals experience when 
making decisions (Kahneman, 1979).
7. The unified framework should 
be studied beyond the mental 
processes
Based on this rationale, when attempting to predict the human 
mind and behavior, it is advisable to shift the focus away from cultural 
discussions, as mentioned earlier. Instead, emphasis should be placed 
on understanding the individual’s schematic structure and mental 
inertia, rather than delving extensively into the specifics of their 
schematic content. While exploring the schematic structure and 
mental inertia can provide valuable insights for analysis, their direct 
applicability in accurately predicting human behavior is limited. 
Although quantifying the magnitude of mental inertia may pose 
challenges, and expressing the magnitude of the schematic structure 
in simple weights may not be feasible, we can define the boundaries of 
the schematic structure with the “Markov blanket. ” The Markov 
blanket represents a relatively stable structure established by an 
individual within their life space. Life space is the sum of facts that 
determine a person’s behavior at a given moment (Levin, 1936). The 
life space referred to here encompasses the schematic structure, which 
represents the self-perceived structure within an individual’s life space. 
The close connection between the schematic structure and mental 
quality enables the quantification of the size of the schematic structure 
through the concept of mental inertia.
Some psychologists argue against the simplistic model of 
conscious experience, primarily due to its failure to capture the 
intricate nature of the force-visitor experience ( Connolly and van 
Deventer, 2017). By considering schema stabilization and schema 
magnitude, attention can be  directed towards assessing how an 
individual can alter their current circumstances or predicting their 
capacity to navigate challenges, without delving extensively into the 
complexity of their subjective experience. While analyzing past 
experiences of individuals is valuable for constructing schemas, the 
ultimate aim is to understand how the human mind and behavior can 
be transformed and how behavior and the psychological process can 
be effectively controlled (Gerrig and Zimbardo, 2002).
This suggests that research on consciousness and behavior is not 
inherently meaningless. Instead, it suggests that we can surpass the 
description and explanation of mental processes and approach human 
psychology and behavior from a predictive and control standpoint. 
Thagard contends that the holistic understanding of human cognition 
can be seen as a complex mathematical model, necessitating the use 
of differential equations for its construction. Furthermore, human 
cognition can be viewed as a chaotic model, wherein even a seemingly 
insignificant variable can result in substantial alterations (Thagard, 
2005). However, this model of chaos can somewhat align with our 
expectations if we  limit its application to human schemas within 
defined topological boundaries. We must shift our attention away 
from the subtle changes occurring within the model and instead 
concentrate on how schemas maintain their structure and undergo 
regular transformations within this intricately operating life space. By 
directing our attention to the consistency of the schematic structure 
in specific conditions and the forces that impact it, we  can make 
accurate forecasts regarding changes in human behavior and 
psychology. It is essential to emphasize that forces do not inherently 
modify human psychology and behavior; rather, the observable 
changes in behavior and psychology are a result of these forces. 
Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these forces 
predominantly stem from the external environment’s influence, while 
internal forces facilitate the development of a healthy adult schema 
within an individual.
8. Modifying early maladaptive 
schema
Maladaptive schemas arise from unmet core emotional 
requirements in early childhood and recur throughout our lives 
(Y oung et al., 2003). There is an argument suggesting that although 
some aggressive and risk-taking behaviors in childhood may have 
negative psychological implications, from an evolutionary perspective, 
children raised in unpredictable and challenging environments rely 
on such behaviors for their survival ( Ellis et  al., 2009, 2017). For 
Wei 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1243711
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org
children to thrive in a specific environment, prioritizing short-term 
effective strategies over long-term well-developed ones is a more 
adaptive choice (Bjorklund, 2018). The production of maladaptive 
schemas can, in certain respects, provide adaptive benefits. In harsh 
environments, it is probable that individual schema, under the 
influence of PEM, will undergo transformation into EMS.
A harsh and unpredictable environment does not have a universal 
detrimental effect on intellectual functioning during child-rearing. 
Instead, it can lead to diverse outcomes for different aspects of executive 
functioning (Mittal et al., 2015). According to the mental health model 
perspective, the growth process can lead to negative outcomes, 
including insecure attachment, sexual promiscuity, and academic and 
economic failure. However, this perspective primarily emphasizes the 
costs to children while overlooking their potential adaptive benefits 
(Bjorklund, 2018 ). Conversely, an evolutionary developmental 
perspective, grounded in life history theory, emphasizes that early 
development is relatively less disrupted by stressful environments and 
instead guides or regulates the establishment of adaptive strategies that 
can effectively function in such harsh conditions (Ellis et al., 2017). This 
implies that the distinction between maladaptive schemas and healthy 
adult schema models goes beyond their potential association with later 
psychological disorders. More crucially, it lies in their capacity to 
facilitate long-term adaptation to varying circumstances. Consequently, 
the content of individuals’ constructs may differ depending on their 
environment and individual differences, which can contribute to the 
development of psychological disorders. Best-fit environmental 
conditions play a crucial role in facilitating enhanced cognitive 
development in individuals. Both deaf and non-deaf children of the 
same age living in environments that matched their own were able to 
pass the theory of mind task, whereas deaf children with hearing 
parents showed significant delays in the theory of mind development 
(Peterson, 2009). Gaining an understanding of schema formation and 
recognizing the adaptive role they play can significantly enhance our 
comprehension of individuals. Assisting individuals in transitioning 
from maladaptive schemas to healthy adult schemas necessitates a 
focus on their specific schemas and identifying the forces required for 
transformation. Addressing the harmful effects of poor schemas on 
psychological well-being may necessitate distinct forces to induce 
change, as simply understanding the content of the schematic structure 
does not bring about automatic modification. The complexity of the 
graphical structure corresponds to the level of force required to 
instigate change. If there are insufficient forces capable of driving 
substantial schema transformation, the individual’s difficulties will 
persist, and even modifying cognition and behavior alone will not lead 
to a successful resolution of their problems.
9. Discussion
The purpose of this paper is not merely to superficially link the 
disciplines of psychology and physics through the concept of schema. 
Instead, it aims to apply Newton’s laws, which have been extensively 
employed in physics, to reevaluate psychological research from a 
different perspective within the field of psychology. Typically, we tend 
to understand individuals and their mental processes from the TOM 
perspective. However, due to factors such as the environment and 
individual differences, we  sometimes cannot fully comprehend an 
individual’s beliefs, desires, and emotions. This limitation can pose 
challenges in the application of psychology. By shifting our perspective 
to not only understand an individual’s beliefs, desires, and emotions 
but also to comprehend individual mental processes and behavior 
through the lens of classical mechanics, specifically through the 
relationship between inertia and schematic structures, or by employing 
different forces to assist individuals in modifying EMS, it may 
be possible to better facilitate individuals’ psychological well-being.
In predicting human behavior, a sole TOM-based understanding 
of individuals may not suffice, as humans continuously interact with 
their environment. From the perspective of forces and inertia, 
particularly if Newton’s laws can be integrated to aid in predicting 
human behavior, much like predicting the trajectory of an object’s 
motion, this approach can significantly benefit psychological research.
One aspect that this paper aims to explore is the relationship between 
the expansion of schematic structures and the increase in psychological 
inertia. It is essential to consider how to measure the magnitude of 
psychological inertia associated with corresponding schematic structures 
and how to apply mental inertia to Newton’s laws of motion. These 
considerations should be addressed in future research efforts.
In conclusion, schematic structures hold significant potential for 
providing a unified framework in psychology. If a psychological theory 
can offer value across diverse cultures, encompassing both collectivist 
and individualist cultures, as well as various academic disciplines, it 
represents a step towards achieving a unified framework. Once a method 
for quantifying and describing schemas is established, it becomes easier 
to conduct interdisciplinary research and approach psychology from 
various perspectives. Unlike attempting to reduce complex mental 
processes to mechanical interactions, schema theory acknowledges the 
influence of contextual constraints on human behavior, cognition, and 
individuals themselves. While this constraint enables the prediction of 
certain aspects of human behavior and cognition, it does not imply 
precise prediction of all human minds and behaviors. A complete 
schematic structure, from a psychological standpoint, corresponds to a 
healthy adult model capable of effectively navigating various situations 
in their environment without additional assistance. As a practical 
application, schema theory should be implemented with consideration 
for measuring psychological attributes and assessing the magnitude of 
forces at the psychological level.
