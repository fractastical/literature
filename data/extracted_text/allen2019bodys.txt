Abstract 10 
 11 
A growing body of evidence highlights the intricate linkage of exteroceptive perception to 12 
the rhythmic acti vity of  the visceral body. In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of 13 
emotion and self -consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science.  However, thus far no 14 
formal theory has emerged to  integrate these twin domains; instead most extant work is 15 
conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference,  which 16 
explains how  ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and 17 
confidence. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and 18 
commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to fear perception. We further show that 19 
simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt fear expectations, induce psychosomatic 20 
hallucinations, and exacerbate metacognitive biases. Through synthetic hear t-rate 21 
variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal -priors and visceral prediction 22 
errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers the 23 
possibility to computationally phenotype disordered brain-body interaction.  24

In this work, we take the embodied view to its ultim ate conclusion and consider perception 30 
as a function of the physical and physiological body we use to ‘measure’ the world. In 31 
particular, our focus is on the coupling – or interaction  – between interoceptive and 32 
exteroceptive perception; namely, how bodily  states and states of affairs beyond the body 33 
are inferred – and how inference about each domain affects the other. For example, does 34 
what we see depend upon our autonomic status and how does visual perceptual synthesis 35 
affect sympathetic or parasympatheti c outflow? The body is, in essence, an ensemble of 36 
fluctuating systems with biorhythms nested at multiple tim escales. How then do these 37 
physiological fluctuations interact with perceptual synthesis in the visual and auditory 38 
domains? 39 
There is a rapidly gro wing body of evidence suggesting that bodily and autonomic 40 
states affect perceptual and metacognitive decisions (Allen et al., 2016b; Azevedo et al., 2017; 41 
Bonvallet and Bloch, 1961; Cohen et al., 1980; Garfinkel et al., 2014; Hauser et al., 2017b; 42 
Lacey and Lacey, 1978; Park et al., 2014; Salomon et al., 2016; Velden and Juris, 1975; Zelano 43 
et al., 2016). Much of this evidence emphasises the dynamic aspect of our physiology; usually 44 
assessed in terms of how psychophysics depends upon the phase of some physiological cycle. 45 
Most of the empirical evidence suggests that biorhy thms gate or modulate the way that 46 
sensory evidence is accumulated during perception (Bonvallet et al., 1954; Bonvallet and 47 
Bloch, 1961; Karavaev et al., 2018; Varga and Heck, 2017). In the predictive coding literature, 48 
this is usually treated as fluctuating, context sensitive, changes in the precision of sensory 49 
sampling (e.g., the precision or gain of prediction errors). Clear examples of this include the 50 
fast waxing and waning of precision during active visual sampling. For example, saccadic 51 
suppression – during saccadic eye m ovements – alternates with attention to fixated visual 52 
information every 250 ms or so. This process of actively sampling the environment via 53 
ballistic saccade itself varies with the cardiac cycle (Galvez-Pol et al., 2018; Kunzendorf et al., 54 
2019; Ohl et al., 2016). At still slower timescales, respiratory (Herrero et al., 2017; Tort et al., 55 
2018b, 2018a; Zelano et al ., 2016)  are coupled to neuronal oscillations and behavior. In 56 
short, at probably every timescale there are systematic fluctuations in the precision or 57 
quality of sensory evidence that depend upon when we actually interrogate the wor ld, in 58 
relation to the biorhythms of our sensory apparatus; namely, our body. 59

Our focus on the multimodal integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive domains 60 
is driven by the overwhelming evidence for interoception as a key modality in hedonics, 61 
arousal, emotion and selfhood (Allen and Friston, 2018; Apps and Tsakiris, 2014; Gallagher 62 
and Allen, 2018; Seth, 2013 ; Seth and Friston, 20 16). This is generally treated under the 63 
rubric of interoceptive inference; namely, active inference in the interoceptive domain. 64 
There are several compelling formulations of interoceptive inference from the perspective 65 
of neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and, indeed, issues of consciousness in terms of minimal 66 
selfhood. However, much of this treatment rests upon a purely conceptual analysis – 67 
underpinned by some notion of active (Bayesian) inference about states of the world 68 
(including the body). In this w ork, we offer a more formal (mathematical) analysis that we 69 
hope will be a point of reference for both theoretical and empirical investigations. 70 
In brief, we constructed a (minimal) active inference architecture to simulate 71 
embodied perception and concomitant arousal. Here, we focused on simulating interactions 72 
between the cardiac cycle and exteroceptive perception. In principle however, our 73 
simulation provides a computational proof-of-principle that can be expanded to understand 74 
brain-body coupling at any physiological or behavioral timescale. Using a Markov decision 75 
process formulation, we created a synthetic subject who exhibited physiological (cardio -76 
acceleration) responses to arousing stimuli. Our agenda was twofold: first, to provid e a 77 
sufficiency proof that – in at least one example – the interaction between interoception and 78 
exteroception emerges from the normative (formal) principles of active inference. 79 
Furthermore, having an in silico subject at hand, means that we can simulate the effects of 80 
various disconnections and pathophysiology. For example, we can examine the effect of 81 
deafferentation of interoceptive signals on arousal, exteroceptive perception, and  82 
(metacognitive) confidence placed in perceptual categorization. Indeed, we were able to go 83 
beyond simulated deafferentation studies and ask what it would be like if we were able to 84 
selectively lesion the precision of  (i.e. confidence ascribed to)  different sorts of beliefs; for 85 
example, beliefs about ‘what I am doing ’, beliefs about ‘the state of the world ’, and beliefs 86 
about ‘the sorts of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals I expect to encounter’. 87 
Second, we constructed our synthetic subject in such a way that the same paradigm 88 
could be replicated in real subjects. The mot ivation for this is that the active inference 89 
scheme used below has an associated process theory (Friston et al., 2017a). In other words, 90

neuronal and behavioral responses associated with inferential processes  can be simulated 91 
on a trial by trial basis. This means that we can use electrophysiological, eye tracking, 92 
pupillometry and other physiological proxies to test various hypoth eses that can be 93 
instantiated in the model. Crucially, this provides a link betwe en neuronal and behavioural 94 
responses – as characterised by the latency between stimuli onset and autonomic responses 95 
(e.g., heart rate acceleration or variability) or confidence judgements (i.e., responses to how 96 
confident were you in your perceptual judgement?). In this paper, we will focus on the basic 97 
phenomenology and (some counterintuitive) results. In subsequent work, we will use this 98 
formalism to model real responses under various experimental manipulations. 99 
In what follows, we briefly describe the generative model and inversion scheme used 100 
to simulate cardiac arousal responses. We then demonstrate the results of anatomical 101 
(deafferentation) lesions on perceptual and met acognitive behaviour, as well as simulated 102 
belief updating. Finally, we will examine the effects on synthetic heart-rate variability when 103 
changing the precision of various prior beliefs that underlie perceptual inference. We 104 
conclude with a discussion of t he implications for existing research in this area – and how 105 
this research could be informed by a formal approach providing guidelines to discovery. 106

The simulations reported b elow build upon the notion of active inference. This is a ‘first -113 
principles’ approach to understanding (Bayes) optimal behaviour. Simpl y put, active 114 
inference treats the brain as using an internal (generative) model of the world to explain 115 
exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sensory d ata. By optimizing beliefs about 116 
variables in this model (perceptual inference), or by changi ng their internal or external 117

environment (action), creatures can ensure their sensations and prior beliefs are consistent1. 118 
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a form of probabilistic generative model that describes 119 
the sequential dynamics of unobserved (h idden) variables (e.g. , the current state of the 120 
cardiac cycle) and the  sensations they cause (e.g., baroreceptor signals) . The hidden 121 
variables of an MDP are hidd en states (sτ) and sequences of actions or  policies (π). The 122 
generative model then embodies the conditional dependencies between these variables, as 123 
expressed graphically in Figure 1. While we provide a brief overview here, we refer readers 124 
to (Friston et al., 2017a) for more technical detail. 125 
 126 
Hidden states generate observable sensory data with probabilities expressed in a likelihood 127 
matrix A. The states evolve through time according to a transition probability matrix, B and 128 
depend only on the state at the previous time, and on the policy, π,.  Finally, we equip the 129 
generative model with preferences (C), prior beliefs about initial states (D), and prior beliefs 130 
about policies. Beliefs about policies have two parts. The first of these is a fixed bias (E). This 131 
may be thought of as a habit; i.e., ‘what I expect to do’ a priori. The second is a belief that the 132 
most probable policies are those that have the lowest expected free energy ( G); i.e., ‘what I 133 
expect to do’ after considering the consequences of action. A simple intuition for the latter is 134 
to think of the selection between alternative courses of action as we might think of Bayesian 135 
hypothesis testing  (i.e. model comparison) ; namely, planning as inference  (Attias, 2003; 136 
Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012) . Here, each policy can be thought of as an alternative 137 
hypothesis about ‘how I am going to behave’. These are evaluated in terms of prior beliefs 138 
(E), and the (predicted) evidence future data affords ( G). Jus t as free energy is used to 139 
approximate the evidence data af fords a hypothesis, expected free energy  evaluates the 140 
expected evidence , under beliefs about how data are actively generated . As expressed in 141 
Figure 1, expected free energy can be separated into two parts. ‘Risk’ quantifies how far 142 
predicted observations deviate from prefer red outcomes . Minimizing this ensures 143 
maintenance of homeostasis. ‘Ambiguity’ quantifies the uncertainty in the mapping from 144

considered to be sub-personal.

Synthetic Cardiac Arousal 159

Using the MDP scheme detailed above, we set out to simula te a cardiac arousal 161 
response to threatening stimuli (e.g.,  a vicious looking spider), in comparison to non -162 
arousing stimuli (e.g., some flowers). To do this, we had to define ‘arousal’ and its 163 
interoceptive correlates. To keep things as simple as possible , we assumed the subject’s 164 
generative model included two sorts of hidden states (interoceptive and exteroceptive – and 165

that she could adopt two modes of engagement with the world (relaxed and aroused). These 166 
sorts of generative models are generally cast as Markov decision processes , whereby 167 
transitions among (hidden) states generate observable outcomes in one or more modalities. 168 
The modalities considered here were exteroceptive (non-arousing versus arousing visual 169 
stimuli) and interoceptive (the cardiac phase; diastolic or systolic). Having defined the nature 170 
of the state space generating outcomes, this model can then be parameterised in a relatively 171 
straightforward fashion as outlined above. For any set of A,B,C,D, and E parameters, one can 172 
then simulate active inference using standard marginal message passing  schemes (Parr et 173 
al., 2019) to optimize expectations about hidden states of the world – and the action or policy 174 
currently being pursued (technically, a policy is a sequence of actions. In what follows, we 175 
only consider policies with one action) (Friston et al., 2017a, 2017c).  176 
Crucially, inference about policies rest upon prior beliefs that the policies will 177 
minimise expected free energy in the fut ure. This expected free energy has both epistemic 178 
and instrumental terms; namely; the ability of any particular cours e of action to resolve 179 
uncertainty about hidden states (known as salience, Bayesian surprise, information gain , 180 
etc.) (Barto et al., 2013; Itti and Baldi, 2009; Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2009; Schmidhuber, 2010) 181 
and the pragmatic affordance (known as expected value, utility, reward, etc.) as specified by 182 
the prior preferences (Friston et al., 2015). 183

Figure 2 : the generative model . This schematic illustrates how hidden states cause each other  and 185 
sensory outcomes in the interoceptive and exteroceptive domain. The upper row describes the probability 186 
transitions among hidden states, while the lower row specifies the outcomes that would be generated by 187 
combinations of hidden states that are inferred on the basis of outcomes. The green panel specifies the models 188 
prior preferences; namely, the sorts of outcomes it expects to encounter. Please see main text for a full 189 
explanation. Although this figure portrays interoceptive and exteroceptive outcomes  as separate modalities, 190 
they were in fact modelled as combinations – so that the prior preferences could be evaluated (this is necessary 191 
because the preferred physiological outcome depends upon the visual cue). In this model, the precisions are 192 
denoted by Greek letters and control the fidelity of various probabilistic mapping is (i.e., the likelihood or A 193 
matrices and the transition or B matrices). 194 
 195 
To capture the fundaments of multimodal integration – of interoceptive and exteroceptive 196 
modalities – we ass umed the foll owing, reasonably plausible, form for the model. The 197 
synthetic subject had to infer which of two policies she was pursuing: a relaxed policy or an 198 
aroused policy. These are defined operationally in terms of transitions among interoceptive 199 
states. Here, we model this in terms of two distinct forms of cardiac cycling among diastolic 200 
and systolic bodily states. When relaxed, the probability transitions among cardiac states 201

meant that there were two phases of diastole and one of systole. Conversely, when aroused, 202 
the first diastolic state jumped immediately to systole. In brief, this means that being aroused 203 
causes cardiac acceleration and the average amount of time spent in systole. The outcomes 204 
are generated by these states were isomorphic; in other words, there was a simple likelihood 205 
mapping from states to sensations; such that the subject received a precise or imprecise 206 
interoceptive cue about the current cardiac status (i.e., diastole or systole). 207 
On the exteroceptive side, we just considered two states of the visual world; namely, 208 
the subject was confronting an arousing or non-arousing visual object. The corresponding 209 
visual modality again had two levels ( arousing versus non-arousing picture). Crucially, the 210 
fidelity or precision of this mappin g depended up on the interoceptive state. When the 211 
subject was in systole, this mapping became very imprecise. In other words, all outcomes 212 
were equally plausible under each hidden state of the visual world. Conversely, during 213 
diastole, there was a relative ly precise li kelihood mapping. This is the crucial part of our 214 
model that links the state of the body to the way that it samples the world. Put simply, precise 215 
visual information is only available during certain parts of the cardiac cycle, which itself 216 
depends upon the state of arousal (i.e., the policy currently inferred and selected). This can 217 
be thought of as a simple approximation of cardiac and other bodily timing effects, expressed 218 
as a momentary occlusion or attenuation of sensory input by (for examp le) afferent 219 
inhibitory baroreceptor effects  (Bonvallet and Bloch, 1961; Lacey and Lacey, 1978) , or by 220 
the brief flooding of the retina during cardiac contraction. 221 
This simple structure produced some remarkable results t hat speak to the intimate 222 
relationship between interoception and exteroception. These phenomena (see below) rest 223 
upon the final set of beliefs; namely, preferred outcomes. Here, the subject believed that she 224 
would be, on average, in a systolic state when confronted with an arousing picture and in a 225 
diastolic state otherwise. These minimal prior preferences then present the subject with an 226 
interesting problem. She has to choose between extending periods of precise  evidence 227 
accumulation (i.e., a relaxed state with more diastolic episodes) and sacrificing precise 228 
information, via cardio-acceleration, should she infer there is something arousing ‘out there’. 229 
However, to infer what is ‘out there’, she has to resolve he r uncertainty, through epistemic 230 
foraging; i.e., maintaining a relaxed state. We therefore hypothesised that at the beginning of 231

each trial or exposure to a picture 2, subjects would be preferentially in a relaxed state until 232 
they had accumulated sufficient evidence to confidently infer the visual object was arousing 233 
or not. If arousing, she would then infer herself to be aroused and enter into a period of 234 
cardio-acceleration (illustrated in Figure 3). 235 
By carefully adjusting the precision of sensory evidence  (through adjusting the A 236 
matrix), we could trade-off the evidence accumulation against these imperatives to simulate 237 
the elaboration of an arousing response to, and only to, arousing stimuli. Furthermore, we 238 
anticipated that a failure to implement a selec ted policy of arousal would both confound 239 
inference about the policy being pursued (i.e., an aroused state of mind) and – importantly – 240 
confidence about the exteroceptive state of affairs. The latter can be measured quantitatively 241 
in terms of the entropy or average uncertainty over hidden exteroceptive states (after taking 242 
a Bayesian model average over policies). This leads to the prediction that confidence in 243 
perceptual categorisation would not only evolve over time but would depend upon 244 
interoceptive infe rence. We tested this hypothesis in silico  through various lesion 245 
experiments reported in the subsequent sections (Figures 3 - 5). In what follows, we 246 
illustrate the belief updating and arousal responses under ‘normal’ priors (i.e. precisions) 247 
based upon the generative model above (summarized graphically in Figure 2).  248 
Simulations 249 
We implemented a minimal model of interoceptive and emotional inference – in the sense 250 
that one's state of active engagement with the world may be inferred from its interoceptive 251 
and exteroceptive consequences. In this minimal model, the two domains of perception are 252 
coupled by – and only by – sensory attenuation: i.e., attenuation of sensory precision in the 253 
visual domain during (inferred) systole.  Precision refers to the  reliability or confidence 254 
ascribed to a given probabilistic belief.  Within this model there are four kinds of precision; 255 
namely, sensory precision in the visual (α) and cardiac (β) domains and the precision of state 256 
transitions among interoceptive and exteroceptiv e states. For clarity, we w ill refer to the 257 
precision of transitions as (inverse) volatility and use precision to refer to sensory  (i.e. 258 
                                                        
2 Every simulation started off with a weak prior over hidden states that the picture was not arousing – and a 
weaker prior in favor of the relaxed policy.

likelihood) precision. In this example, because there are only two states, the corresponding 259 
parameters of the generati ve model control both the e xpected contingencies and their 260 
precision. In other words, when α (or β) decreases to 1/2, sensory signals become imprecise 261 
and completely ambiguous. In what follows, we will focus on manipulations of precision 262 
under a canonical volatility of ζ = 0.9. In o ther words, we will assume that our synthetic 263 
subject believes state transitions among phases of the cardiac cycle follow each other fairly 264 
reliably with a 90% probability. Similarly, if there is a flower ‘out there’, then there is a 90% 265 
probability that i t will remain there at the next sample.  Cardiac and visual stimuli were 266 
generated by the same precisions and volatilities as assumed by the subject’s generative 267 
model. 268 
We conducted three sets of simulations to illustrate the sort s of behaviours that 269 
emerge under this active inference scheme – and to establish the construct validity of the 270 
model in relation to empirical phenomena that speak to the influence of interoception on 271 
exteroception and vice versa. This enabled us to illust rate the basic phenomenolog y of our 272 
agent – in terms of simulated perceptual inference and cardiac physiology – under some 273 
differing levels of sensory precision.  274

agents a fixed sequence of cardiac and exteroceptive stimuli, such that the first 14 trials constituted a ‘baseline’ 280

interoceptive precision ( β = 0.5, blue lines). Under these conditions  our synthetic  subjects exhibit a clear 284

acceleration (left panel) and a dramatic shift in  the posterior expectation of encountering another threatening 286 
stimulus. Interestingly, during the baseline period the posterior expectation of encountering a threat stimulus 287 
oscillates with the heartbeat; i.e., the lesioned subjects show both an attenuation of the cardiac response and a 288 
blunted belief update. Note that for the right panel, only trials 1 -40 are shown. On the left, blue lines show 289 
summed heartbeats (time spent in systole) for 15 -trial bins; on the right, lines depict th e median posterior 290 
probability that the agent will see a spider on the next trial. See Methods and Results for more details.    291 
 292 
In the first set of simulations (Fig. 3), we focused on the physiological and psychological 293 
response to arousing stimuli. To do  so, we tested the hypothesis that the unexpected 294 
presentation of a ‘spider’ would induce an aroused state – as reflected in an increased heart 295 
rate – and a greater posterior expectation of encountering an arousing spider stimulus on 296 
the next trial. To eva luate this hypothesis, we supplied the subject with a fixed sequence of 297 
15 stimuli – in both the cardiac and visual domains – and examined the posterior beliefs 298 
about the next exteroceptive state following a period of relaxed cardiac input. Note that this 299 
is possible precisely because our g enerative model includes beliefs about the future – 300 
including the next hidden state and subsequent sensory sample. Here , we used as outcome 301 
measures the agent ’s evoked cardiac acceleration response (calculated by binning the 302 
number of siastole events acros s the experiment) and the agent’s posterior belief that the 303 
next stimulus would be threatening. These simulations were repeated 60 times with 304 
randomized starting values, such that the first thirty ‘healthy’ agents where compared to an 305 
‘interoceptive lesion’ group for whom interoceptive precision had been attenuated (β = 0.5). 306 
This enabled us to not only establish the interaction of fear expectations and cardiac arousal, 307 
but also to demonstrate how these responses change wh en interoceptive sensory precision 308 
is ablated.  309 
In the second set of simulations (Fig. 4), our f ocus moved from perceptual to 310 
metacognitive inference. Here, we examined the interaction between exteroceptive and 311 
interoceptive sensory precision on the one ha nd and their coupling to cardiac timing and 312 
metacognition (posterior confidence) on the other. Our goal here was to illustrate how both 313

interoceptive and exteroceptive precision interact to influence metacognitive inference, and 314 
to link these to empirical findings showing that cardiac arousal biases metacognition (Allen 315 
et al., 2016b; Hauser et al., 2017a) . For these, we used the uncertainty about inferred 316 
exteroceptive and interoceptive states (as quantifie d by the summed entropy of posterior 317 
beliefs for each state) as outcome measures, simulated unde r a range of cardiac and visual 318 
precision settings (figure 3A). To further illustrate how these effects oscillate with the 319 
cardiac rhythm, we separated these me asures for each phase of the cardiac cycle (early 320 
diastole, late diastole, systole). We then rep eated these analyses comparing ‘healthy’ 321 
interoceptive inference agents (α & β = 0.9), to agents for whom either exteroceptive or 322 
interoceptive precision was lesioned (α or β = 0.5, respectively). In virtue of our coupling of 323 
exteroceptive sensory precisio n to the cardiac cycle, we anticipated that metacognitive 324 
confidence (outscored by the negative entropy of posterior beliefs ) would depend on the 325 
precision of b oth interoceptive and exteroceptive states, and that this effect would clearly 326 
oscillate with th e cardiac cycle. Further, we expected in the extreme case of our ‘lesioned’ 327 
subjects, these effects would be further exacerbated such that interoceptive and 328 
exteroceptive uncertainty would increase dramatically, under their respective lesion 329 
conditions.  330

Figure 4 . Simulating the influence of interoceptive and exteroceptive precision on  metacognitive 333 
uncertainty.  To explore how interoceptive inference influences metacognition, we measured the summed 334 
entropy of beliefs for both exteroceptive (top panels) and interoceptive (bottom panels) states. By simulating 335 
the full range of sensory pr ecision values, from lesioned precision (α or β  = 0.5) to ‘hyper-precision’ (α or β = 336 
1), the predominant pattern of interaction s is revealed. A) For exteroceptive inferences (i.e., the agent’s belief 337 
that a spider or flower is present), the principle entr opy gradient is characterized by reductions in 338 
exteroceptive precision. This effect is modulated in part by interoceptive precision; for example, the lowest 339 
uncertainty is obtained when interoceptive and exteroceptive precision are maximal. B) Separating 340 
exteroceptive uncertainty by each phase of the cardiac cycle reveals a clear effect of the heartbeat on belief 341 
entropy, which is modulated most strongly by lesioning the pre cision of exteroceptive predictions. Lesioning 342 
interoceptive uncertainty does raise the overall level of exteroceptive uncertainty, but to a lesser degree.  Note 343 
that altering exteroceptive precision only affects the diastolic phases (as precision is already attenuated during 344 
systole). Interoceptive lesions preclude precise inferences abou t the cardiac phase, so reduce the discrepancy 345 
in uncertainty between these phases.  C) Similar to exteroceptive belief, interoceptive metacognition is 346 
predominately influen ced by interoceptive precision. D) The cardiac cycle also modulates the overall 347

uncertainty of interoceptive beliefs; this effect is greatly increased when interoceptive precision is lesioned. 348 
Interestingly, exteroceptive lesions primarily reduce the differentiation between cardiac states.  349 
 350 
Finally, to complement these simulations we modelled the response of first and second order 351 
statistics of the physiological responses to changes in sensory precision. These were based 352 
upon simulated heart rate (frequenc y of systole) and the heart rate va riability (HRV) 353 
assessed over multiple trials or heartbeats (Fig. 5). Our objectives here were ; 1) to test the 354 
hypothesis that fluctuations in both low-and high- frequency synthetic heart rate variability 355 
can be produced by altering the balance of interoceptive sensory precision versus the prior 356 
precision for the aroused sympathetic policy, and 2) to illustrate how generative modelling 357 
of interoceptive active inference can be used to phenotype maladaptive inference 358 
parameters from observed heart -rate data ( i.e., interoceptive inference phenotyping). For 359 
this analysis, we simulated 1000 trials under three canonical parameter settings designed to 360 
resemble potential neuropsychiatric phenotypes of interest: healthy interoceptio n (α = 0.8, 361 
β = 0.8, prior probabil ity of parasympathetic policy = 55%), hyper -precise interoceptive 362 
sensation (α = 0.8, β = 1, prior probability of parasympathetic policy = 55%), and hyper -363 
precise arousal priors (α = 0.8, β = 0.8, prior probability of sympathetic policy = 75%).  364 
The resulting time-series of systole events from each agent were then convolved with 365 
a canonical QRS-wave response function and transformed into normalized beat-to-beat RR-366 
intervals. To normalize the ( arbitrary) sampling rate of ea ch time -series, we assigned a 367 
350ms repetition time (TR) for each state of the MDP simulation, such that the healthy agent 368 
had a heart rate of approximately 60 BPM. The time intervals between successive synthetic 369 
R-peaks was then calculated. As  the RR interval data is unevenly sampled , the time series 370 
was linearly interpolated. The power spectrum was then estimated using Welch’s method.  371 
In line with conventional HRV analysis, the power spectra were then categorized into four 372 
frequency bands corresponding t o ultra-low (0 - 0.04 Hz), low (0.0 4- 0.15 Hz), high (0.15 - 373 
0.4 Hz), and very -high (> 0.4 Hz) frequency categories.  Finally, to summarize the 374 
physiological response of each agent, we calculated the beats per minute (BPM) and the ratio 375 
between low and high  frequency components (LF/HF), i.e., sympathovagal gain or balance. 376 
Sympathovagal valance is thought to index the balance of sympathetic and vagal outflows 377 
and is frequently interpreted implicated in stress and other psychophysiological  and clinical 378

interoceptive inference (bottom left), another with hyper -precise visceral sensations (bottom middle), and 394 
another with hyper -precise priors for the aroused (sympathetic) policy (bottom right). These each produce 395 
unique interoceptive inference ‘fingerprints’; i.e., the individual patterns of heart -rate variability produced by 396 
these parameter settings. In this example, hyper-precise visceral sensations reduce heart-rate and shift overall 397 
peak frequency to the high -frequency domain, whereas hyper strong arousal priors  induce strong heart -rate 398

Simulated Physiology and Perceptual Active Inference. 405 
To establish the  face validity of our model, we  simulated the basic psychophysiological 406 
behavior of our active inference agent. This involved simulating a fixed serie s of stimuli  407 
(states) in which the heartbeat was forced to remain relaxed – and only non-arousing 408 
(flower) stimuli were presented. On the 15th trial, an unexpected spider stimulus was 409 
presented, and the simulation continued for a further 85 trials. Thus, b y evaluating the 410 
evolution of the agent’s synthetic interoceptive physiology and exteroceptive beliefs, before 411 
and after the quiescent baseline period, we hoped to reproduce and illuminate well -known 412 
psychophysiological phenomenon such as the defensive sta rtle reflex (Graham and Clifton, 413 
1966; Sokolov, 1963).  414 
 This analysis, illustrated in Figure 3, revealed several interesting aspects of 415 
interoceptive active inference. Over 60 simulations there was a clear and robust increase in 416 
heart-rate acceleration , following the presentation of the unexpected or novel threat 417 
stimulus. During subsequent experiences of its  own heartbeat and spiders  or flowers, this 418 
response habituates, resulting in a gradual heart-rate deceleration from the evoked cardiac 419 
response. Th is robust modulation of heart -rate was accompanied by a jump from an 420 
expected probability of encountering a spider of about 25% to almost 65% following the 421 
spider presentation. This combined response of both the heartbeat and fear-expectations is 422 
further underscored by the curious oscillation of cardiac states and the expected probability 423 
of observing a spider; note the uptick in expectations of approximately 5% on each systole 424 
event (denoted by the pink dotted line on Figure  3, right panel).   A simple expl anation for 425 
this result is that, during presentation of a stream of flowers, we can confidently infer a safe 426 
external environment. This accounts for the relatively low probability of spiders in the 427 
earlier part of the plot. However, during systole, attenuated integration of exteroceptive data 428

leads to greater uncertainty. Going from a confident inference in the absence of a spider to a 429 
more uncertain inference necessarily increases the probability of a scary environment 430 
during this cardiac phase. This offer s a simple perspective on p revious experimental work 431 
suggesting that fear -stimuli are potentiated when presented in synchrony with the heart 432 
(Garfinkel et al., 2014; Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016); namely, that a mechanism underlying 433 
this effect can be found in the link between cardiac active inference and fear expectations. In 434 
short, under generative models of an embodied world – in which sensory sampling depends 435 
upon fast fluctuations in bodily states  – there is a necessary  dependency of Bayesian belief 436 
updating (i.e., perceptual inference) across all modalities on introception. 437 
 When comparing these effects in the healthy agent to our sample of ‘lesion patients’, 438 
a few sensible but counter-intuitive consequences ensue. In the physiological domain, when 439 
presented with the unexpected arousal stimulus, the lesioned agent shows a blunted cardiac 440 
acceleration response , which remains diminished throughout the simulated trials. This 441 
blunting effect is mirrored for fear expectations in the immediate post -stimulus (e.g., trials 442 
15-20) period, further underlining the close  link between visce ral and exteroceptive 443 
inference in our agent.  The reason for this blunting likely results from the differing 444 
exteroceptive precision anticipated during different cardiac phases  (see also Fig. 4B) . A 445 
visual impression – consistent with a spider – is highly informative during diastole but must 446 
be treated with suspicion during the sensory -attenuated systolic phase. This implies a 447 
blunting of belief -updating in response to a spider , when we are unsure of cardiac phase 448 
(compared to when we are confident o f a dia stolic phase).  A further interesting result is 449 
found when examining the controlled baseline period (trials 0 -15); baseline  fear 450 
expectations in the interoceptive lesion group are actually slightly enhanced by about 5-10% 451 
posterior probability. This lends an interesting embodied twist to the literature on ‘circular 452 
inference’, psychosis and hallucinations  (Denève and Jardri, 2016; Powers et al., 2017) ,  453 
suggesting that the disruption of interoceptive precision may be one mechanism underlying 454 
hallucinations, particularly those that are affective and/or somatic in nature.  455

Simulating the Influence of Sensory Precision on Metacognition 456 
We next performed a series of simulations to tease apart how interoceptive and 457 
exteroceptive precision ( and their disruption) influence ‘metacognition’ ; that is the 458 
uncertainty in our agent’s beliefs. To do s o, we  first measured the Shannon entropy for 459 
interoceptive and exteroceptive inferences (summed across both factors of posterior beliefs) 460 
under a full range of precision settings  from 0.5 - 1. To highlight the oscillatory nature of 461 
cardiac effects, we then  calculated the same entropy measure separately for each cardiac 462 
state (early diastole, late diastole, systole). Finally, we compared these ‘healthy’ simulations 463 
to extreme degradations in sensory precision (exteroceptive and interoceptive ‘lesions’), to 464 
better understand how disruptions of each modality are integrated in metacognition.  465 
 This analysis revealed first of all that, in our simplified model, metacognitive 466 
uncertainty is largely influenced by the unimodal precision of each domain.  For both 467 
exteroceptive and interoceptive inferences, the slope of the uncertainty gradient  (Fig. 4A & 468 
C) was predominantly characterized by degradations in the precision of the corresponding 469 
modality. However, this modularity is not complete; exteroceptive uncertainty is at its lowest 470 
when interoceptive and exteroceptive precision are maximal. Similarly, although 471 
interoceptive uncertainty is largely driven by interoceptive precision, small interactions 472 
with exteroceptive precision can be observed in the plotted uncertain ty gr adient. One 473 
interesting isomorphism, however, is that overall interoceptive uncertainty is  less affected 474 
by exteroceptive precision. This is likely due to that fact that in our model, the cardiac cycle 475 
directly modulates exteroceptive precision, where as ex teroceptive states only indirectly 476 
modulate interoceptive responses, via policy selection.   477 
This intricate  relationship of the cardiac cycle and metacognitive uncertainty is 478 
further teased apart in Figure 4B, which shows clearly that exteroceptive confide nce 479 
oscillates with each phase of the heartbeat, being highest at diastole. This is an unsurprising 480 
feature of our model : on each diastole , phase exteroceptive sensory precision drops 481 
effectively to null. Interestingly however, average exteroceptive uncertainty is modulated in 482 
a fairly linear fashion by visceral and exteroceptive lesions : average entropy is increased 483 
modestly by lesioning interoceptive precision and more robustly by exteroceptive lesions. 484 
Whereas i nteroceptive lesions cause d the greatest in crease in interoceptive entropy , 485

exteroceptive lesions seem to exert a specific effect of unbinding entropy from the individual 486 
cardiac state, again mirroring the isomorphic representation of these states in uncertainty . 487 
This is a sensible finding, as the manipulation leads to relatively high uncertainty in the 488 
mapping between hidden states and outcomes during all cardiac phases, not just during the 489 
previously attenuated systolic phase.  This sort of chronic hypo-arousal – as a consequence 490 
of a failure to contextually modulate precision – is not unlike that which may underwrite the 491 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia or depression.  492 
Synthetic Heart-Rate Variability (HRV) and Embodied Computational Phenotyping  493 
In our final set of simulations, we  illustrated how the interoceptive inference approach 494 
developed here offers a new means for analyzing and interpreting fluctuations in observed 495 
physiological data. Our goal here was to demonstrate the potential for generative modelling 496 
and ‘embodied computational phenotyping’; i.e., the identification of specific parameters of 497 
brain-body int eraction underlying maladaptive interoceptive inference  in psychiatric and 498 
other health-harming disorders; e.g., (Peters et al., 2017).  499 
To this end, we generated synthetic cardiac data by convolving our train of cardiac 500 
events with an ECG response waveform. Following standard methods, we then calculated the 501 
normalized beat-to-beat intervals and performed a time-frequency analysis of the resulting 502 
RR-interval data. By repeating this analysis for a ‘healthy’ agent under normative values, an 503 
agent with interoceptive ‘hyper -precision’ (i.e., β = 1), and an agent with an overly precis e 504 
prior beliefs about its own arousal, we illustrate how individual HRV fingerprints are linked 505 
to unique patterns of interoceptive active inference.  506 
 This analysis showed that, despite the exceedingly simple (biomechanically speaking) 507 
conditions of our m odel, sensible and interesting patterns of heart -rate variability emerge 508 
for different combinations of interoceptive sensory and prior precision. Specifically, we 509 
found that whereas the healthy agent exhibited a relatively relaxed profile in terms of heart 510 
rate and sympathovagal balance (BMP = 63.5, peak frequency = 0.14 Hz) – predominated by 511 
low versus high frequency oscillations (aLF/aHF = 0.52 ) – an agent with hyper -precise 512 
visceral sensations exhibited a mild downshift in heart -rate coupled (BPM= 59.5) with an 513 
overall increase in high -frequency oscillations (aLF/aHF =  0.51, peak frequency = 0.25). In 514

contrast, the agent with hyper -precise arousal priors showed a strong bimodal modulation 515 
of both ultra-low and ultra-high frequencies HRV (peak frequencies = 0.04 Hz & 0. 34 Hz, 516 
respectively), coupled with a strong increase in heart-rate (BPM = 84) and high versus low-517 
frequency outflow (aLF/aHF = 0.47) . These results speak to the unique role of different 518 
active inference parameters in producing highly idiosyncratic patterns of HRV variability. In 519 
the future, our model may be enhanced to subserve computational phenotyping of individual 520 
differences and/or patient subgroups categorized by the balance of visceral precision and 521 
arousal policy priors from raw HRV data alone.  522

 524 
Discussion and Conclusions 525 
 526 
In the present work, we have introduced the first formal model of interoceptive inference as 527 
applied to emotion, exteroceptive perception, and  metacognitive uncertainty. Through a 528 
variety of simulations, we demonstrated that this model can reproduce a variety of  529 
psychological and physiological phenomena, each of which speak to a unique domain of the 530 
burgeoning interoceptive inference literature (Allen and Friston, 2018; Feldman and Friston, 531 
2010; Seth, 2013) , and the application of interoceptive inference to computational 532 
psychiatry (Owens et al., 2018; Petzschner et al., 2017) . This formulation of interoceptive 533 
inference reproduces some of the finer details of physiological responses to arousing stimuli 534 
that, cruciall y, are emergent properties  under the simple assumption that  people use 535 
generative models to infer the state of their lived world.  536 
The form of the generative model and (neurobiological implausible)  belief updating 537 
used in this paper are generic : exactly the same scheme has been used to simulate a whole 538 
range of processes, from neuroeconomic games to scene construction and attentional neglect 539 
(Friston et al., 2017a; Parr and Friston, 2018) . The key aspect of the generative model  540 
introduced here is that th e quality (i.e., precision) of sensory information depends upon  541 
fluctuations in (inferred) autonomic states . This simple fact underwrites all of the 542 
phenomenology illustrated above; both in terms of simulated physiology and accompanying 543 
belief updates. The explicit inclusion of interoception into active inference licenses us to talk 544 
about ‘fear’ and in the sense that affective inference is thought to emerge under models that 545

generate multimodal predictions  that encompass the interoceptive domain.  Furthermore, 546 
casting everything as inference enables a metacognitive stance on belief updating, in the 547 
sense that one can quantify uncertainty invested in beliefs about states of the body, states of 548 
the world and, indeed, states of (autonomic) action. 549 
In particular,  we show that by simulating periodic attenuation of exteroceptive 550 
sensory inputs by the cardiac cycle, affective expectations become intr insically linked to 551 
afferent interoceptive signals through a startle reflex-like phenomenon. This linkage not only 552 
induces oscillatory synchrony between the heartbeat and exteroceptive behavior, but also 553 
propagates to metacognitive uncertainty (i.e., the e ntropy of posterior beliefs). This latter 554 
finding speaks to numerous reports of metacognitive bias (e.g.,  confidence -accuracy 555 
dissociation) by illustrating how the precision of interoceptive states can directly influence 556 
exteroceptive uncertainty  (Allen et al., 2016b; Boldt et al., 2017; Spence et al., 2016) . By 557 
simulating synthetic heart -rate variability (HRV) responses, we further illustrated how 558 
idiosyncratic patterns of aberra nt interoceptive precision-weighting can be recovered 559 
through generative modelling of physiological responses, opening the door to computational 560 
phenotyping of disordered brain -body interaction in the spirit of (Schwartenbeck P and K 561 
Friston 2016). In what follows, we outline some of what we view as the most promising 562 
future directions for this work, sketch a proposed neuroanatomy underlying our model, and 563 
point out a few limitations for consideration. 564 
By focusing o n the periodic nature of the cardiac cycle, and concomitant influences 565 
on exteroceptive perception, our goal was to provide an initial proof-of-principle, illustrating 566 
how visceral and exteroceptive signals may be combined under active inference. Our aim 567 
was not to suggest that our model provides the ultimate view of interoceptive inference; 568 
indeed, we view the present work as a starting point that can be taken forward in a variety 569 
of research directions, some of which are outline below.  570 
In this paper, we formalized the hypothesis that frequently reported effects of cardiac 571 
timing on perception could arise as a function of periodic sensory attenuation – but the 572 
reader should feel encouraged to test their own hypotheses within the openly available MDP 573 
framework. Our intention here was also not to prioritize cardiac-brain interaction over e.g., 574 
gastric or respiratory cycles, but instead to provide a toy exampl e, to show how these 575 
systems may be subjected to formal analyses. This was motivated by the large predominance 576

of research on cardiac -brain interaction ; however, we do anticipate that the periodic 577 
attenuation of sensory precision by visceral signals is likely to provide a general explanation 578 
of brain-body interaction. 579 
Neurophysiologically, t he principal me ans by which cardiac signals influence the 580 
central nervous system is through the afferent cardiac baroreceptors. These pressure -581 
sensitive neurons, located  primarily in the aorta and carotid artery, are triggered by the 582 
systolic pressure wave generated when  the heart contracts. Far from being  restricted to 583 
homeostatic function only , it was first reported (nearly a century ago ) that afferent 584 
baroreceptor outputs induce a general inhibitory effect on cortical processing (Bonvallet et 585 
al., 1954; Bonvallet and Bloch, 1961; Koch, 1932) . These findings were later extended by 586 
Lacey and Lacey (1978) who proposed the “neurovisceral afferent integration hypothesis” , 587 
positing that cardiac acceleration and deceleration serve to respectively disengage or engage 588 
with an exteroceptive stimulus via cortical inhibition.  589 
In parallel, the soviet psychologist Evgeny Sokol ov proposed that novelty (but not 590 
threat) evoked heart -rate deceleration was a core component of the ‘orienting reflex’  591 
(Sokolov, 1963) . By r educing overall cardiac output, this reflex served to limit the 592 
contribution of cardiac signals to cortical noise boosting overall sig nal-to-noise ratio 3. In 593 
contrast, Sokolov theorized that the defensive startle reflex  – in which an extremely strong 594 
(e.g., the loud bang of a starting gun) or unexpectedly aversive (e.g., the sudden presentation 595 
of a spider) stimulus evokes cardiac acceleration – facilitated the disengagement of cortical 596 
processing, to initiate fight-or-flight responses. These theories in turn sparked a wave of 597 
empirical studies  attempting to link  cardio-acceleration and deceleration responses to 598 
increased or decreased exteroceptive sensitivity, which continues to this day (Azevedo et al., 599 
2017; Cohen et al., 1980; Delfini and Campos, 1972; Edwards et al., 2009; Elliott, 1972; 600 
Garfinkel et al., 2014; Ghione, 1996; Park et al., 2014; Salomon et al., 2016; Sandman et al., 601 
1977; Saxon, 1970; Velden and Juris, 1975).  602 
                                                        
3 Sokolov (1963) described the orienting reflex as an ‘embodied’ mechanism for boosting to signal-to-noise and 
thus enhancing processing of the oddball stimulus. The reflex consists primarily of the rapid deployment of 
saccades to the oddball stimulus, freezing of the muscles of the head and neck so as to orient the visual  organs 
towards the stimulus, and an immediate cardiac deceleration. In light of their inhibitory influence, the cardiac 
deceleration was thought to primarily reduce cortical noise; when coupled with the other bodily components 
of the response it was thought that effective overall signal would be maximized.

While these findings highlight the intricate  relationship between cardiac timing and 603 
exteroceptive psychophysics, so far a consistent pattern of findings (e.g.,  sensory signal 604 
enhancement and/or inhibition ) has failed to emerge (see Elliott, 1972 for one crit ique). A 605 
cursory review of this literature reveals evidence for both exteroceptive enhancement and 606 
suppression, depending upon the specific nature of the exteroceptive stimuli  (i.e., whether 607 
they are inherently aversive, sociocultural, or neutral in natur e), the context of the arousal  608 
(including specific s timulus and response timing) , and other psychophysiological 609 
moderators; such as age, gender, and overall physical fitness . Accordingly, more recent 610 
proposals have focused on more modality-specific exteroceptive enhancement by cardiac 611 
signals. For example, that cardiac-exteroceptive effects specifically potentiate fear or threat 612 
signals (Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016)  or the generation of a subjective first -person 613 
viewpoint (Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014).  614 
We offer a unique synthesis of these views, expressed in terms of interoceptive 615 
inference. In our model, the cyclic influence of the heart on exteroception is exerted primarily 616 
through the attenuation of  sensory precision on each systolic contraction , which in turns 617 
influences the selected (multimodal) arousal policy  as determined by the agent’s 618 
preferences. The coupling of sensory attenuation to the cardiac cycle  endorses the notion 619 
that baroreceptors exert an inhibitory influence on the brain . Beyond this direct effect, our 620 
model can also be understood in light of the well-known relationship between intrinsic noise 621 
fluctuations in the brain and cardio -respiratory cycles (Birn, 2012; Karavaev et al., 2018) . 622 
Physiological oscillations exert non-neuronal influences on spontaneous brain activity via a 623 
variety of more or less direct causal influences ; for example, at each heart beat visual input 624 
to the retina is briefly attenuated by a pulsatile blood inflow . Similarly, with each cardio -625 
respiratory cycle, fluctuations in cerebral pulsatile motion and blood pres sure induce 626 
neurons to spontaneously fire, shaping the ‘infraslow’ brain dynamics (Golanov et al., 1994; 627 
Karavaev et al., 2018; Zanatta et al., 2013)  that influence the overall global dynamics o f 628 
neural excitability and connectivity (Fox et al., 2007, 2006; Fox and Raichle, 2007) . Our 629 
suggestion is that,  insofar as the brain must model its own dynamic noise trajectories as a 630 
function of  active self-inference, non -neuronal sources of variability such as inscribed by 631 
visceral rhythms  must be incorporated within the brain’s  generative model  of its own 632 
percepts. Interoceptive fluctuations are thus an important influence over the precision of 633

exteroceptive sensory channels , and inter oception is itself the means by which the brain 634 
infers and controls its own pathway through these precision trajectories. The modelling 635 
introduced here can thus be ex panded beyond the cardiac domain to the more general 636 
problem of modelling how spontaneous fluctuations in neurovisceral cycles  (including 637 
heart-rate variability) influence information processing and behavior.   638 
What then, explains the lack of consistent results within the cardiac timing literature? 639 
In contrast to the binary on/off hypotheses pr oposed by Lacey or Sokolov, our simulations 640 
highlight the context -sensitive manner by which ascending visceral signals modulate the 641 
precision of both interoceptive and exteroceptive inferences. For example, our simulation of 642 
the startle response ( illustrated in Fig. 3 ) clearly indicates that the functional impact of 643 
cardio-ballistic responses is coupled to the agent’s baseline prior expectations, as well as the 644 
overall precision of active inference and policy selection. In this sense, whether a specific 645 
cardiac response is likely to potentiate or inhibit a specific domain (e.g., fear) depends upon 646 
the specific weighting of arousal policy priors , the precision of incoming exteroceptive and 647 
interoceptive sensations, and the linkages thereof  as determined by the task itself. In other 648 
words, the specific balance of prior beliefs and sensory information , in a given cognitive or 649 
affective domain, must be addressed before one can predict the exact directionality of an 650 
interoceptive effect on perception, or vice versa. Here, we modelled the generation of arousal 651 
policies as a function of hyper-parameters governing the preferred policy. In the future this 652 
can be unpacked further by examining the divergence between prior and posterior beliefs 653 
about these policies (e.g., through inferred epistemic value). Through Landauer’s principle, 654 
this divergence may be equated with the associated metabolic costs of computation and the 655 
conceptual notion of interoceptive self -modelling (Kiverstein, 2018; Limanowski and 656 
Blankenburg, 2013; Seth and Tsakiris, 2018).  657 
 658 
The computational neuroanatomy of interoceptive inference 659 
 Having addressed the construct validity of our model, we now speculate as to some 660 
likely neuronal substrates of the message passing implied by variational inference . 661 
Interoceptive inference can be broken down into four core functional domains: basic 662

sensory-motor control, conscious interoceptive (perceptual) awareness, metacognitive 663 
monitoring, and hedonic (intrinsic) value. In our model, we focused primarily on the simplest 664 
possible implementation of interoceptive inference, corresponding to the sensory -motor 665 
domain (i.e., ascending and descending cardiac pathways) and their low -level interaction 666 
with exteroceptive inference , via neuromodulatory gain control. Future work will benefit 667 
from expanding upon our representation of uncertainty  to include the computation  of 668 
epistemic and/or intrinsic value as proxies for these higher -order interoceptive systems 669 
(Friston et al., 2017b; Parr and Friston, 2017). 670

Figure 6, computational neuroanatomy of interoception . The schematic above shows the form of 673 
the neuronal message passing implied by active inference for the generative model depicted in Figure 2. We 674 
have related this to the anatomical networks that could implement these inferences. The sensory observations 675 
in our simulations are visual and interoceptive (cardiac). These sensations are carried by cranial nerves II and 676 
IX respectively. Cranial nerve II targets the superior colliculus in the midbrain. Thi s structure sends short 677 
latency visual data to the amygdala, which is well placed to make inferences about emotionally salient stimuli. 678

The amygdala additionally receives visual data from the ventral visual stream in the temporal lobe. Cranial 679 
nerve IX car ries information from the carotid sinus baroreceptors to the nucleus tractus solitarus in the 680 
brainstem. This nucleus communicates with the posterior insula (via thalamic and PAG relays); the anterior 681 
cingulate monitors and controls the precision of this a scending visceral information via neuromodulation, 682 
possibly via feedback through noradrenergic pathways (not shown). The posterior insula and amygdala 683 
interact with one another but also project to the anterior insula. This targets the nucleus ambiguus (via  684 
brainstem relays such as the periaqueductal gray ), which gives rise to the vagus (X) nerve. The vagus nerve 685 
targets neurons in the cardiac plexus that project to both the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node of 686 
the heart, slowing its rhythm. The nucleus tractus solitarus additionally participates in a reflex loop implicating 687 
the sympathetic control of the cardiac cycle, but this is omitted for simplicity. The functional anatomy suggested 688 
here implies the anterior insula might play a similar comput ational role in autonomic policy selection to the 689 
basal ganglia in selection of policies involving the skeletal muscles  (Friston et al., 2018) . Note that inscribed 690 
directed influences (blue arrows), are not assumed to be monosynaptic – for simplicity, many intermediary 691 
relay nodes have been omitted.  692 
 693 
Accordingly, in our sketch of the putative neuroanatomy underlying cardiac active 694 
inference (Fig. 6) , we focus primarily on the neuronal substrates that inscribe low-level 695 
viscerosensory and visceromotor  control, as well as some hierarchically superior regions  696 
related to emotional salience and interoceptive awareness. For simplicity, our model depicts 697 
only the minimal neuronal message passing scheme implied by our generative model ; as 698 
such, we have omitted many of the intermediary relay nodes; e.g., in the thalamus and ventral 699 
visual stream. Afferent baroreceptor signals are transmitted along the ascending vagus to 700 
the rostrum of the nucleus tractus solitarus (NTS, Mifflin and Felder, 1990; Miura and Reis, 701 
1972). From here, ascending viscerosensory signal are projected via brainstem and midbrain 702 
nuclei to the thalamus, somatosensory cortex, and posterior insula (Cechetto and Saper, 703 
1987; Craig, 2002) ; ascen ding cardio-sensory outcomes are thus encoded in the NTS and 704 
then passed to the posterior insular cortex (PIC) as inferred interoceptive states. The PIC has 705 
a well-known role as primary viscerosensory cortex; electrical stimulation of this area elicits 706 
phantom visceral sensations (e.g ., pain, h eart-rate acceleration) (Chouchou et al., 2019;  707 
Oppenheimer et al., 1992)  and bolus isoproterenol infusions increase the intensity of 708 
cardiorespiratory sensations and concomitant PIC activation s (Hassanpour et al., 2016; 709 
Khalsa et al., 2009) . In parallel, visual sensory outcomes are passed via the second cranial 710 
nerve to the superior colliculus, where they inform exteroceptive inference in the amygdala, 711

which is well -situated to process salient emotional stimuli (Anderson and Phelps, 2001; 712 
Liddell et al., 2005). These interoceptive and exteroceptive expectations then converge in the 713 
anterior insular cortex (AIC), where they inform the selection of the appropriate autonomic 714 
policy. Finally, the selected policy is passed down the hierarchy via descending pathwa ys 715 
(likely carried by von Economo neurons), to eventually engage the rostral nucleus ambiguus 716 
and descending vagus, decelerating the heart -rate when the relaxed policy is selected. 717 
Collectively, the scheme represents a multimodal reflex arc interlinking ex teroceptive and 718 
interoceptive domains to specific patterns of cardio-ballistic responses.  719 
Within this scheme, we suggest that the rostral anterior cingulate (ACC) controls the 720 
precision of ascending visceral outcomes and inferred interoceptive states via 721 
neuromodulatory gain control  (Fardo et al., 2017; Feldman and Friston, 2010) . Further, 722 
interoceptive and exteroceptive state precisions (in our scheme) interact indirectly through 723 
global neuromodulatory influences, possibly through regulation of noradrenaline by the ACC 724 
(via descending influence on the locus coeruleus) . Neurobiologically and functionally  725 
speaking, the AIC  and ACC share similar profiles; both are densely popul ated with Von 726 
Economo neurons (VENs) , which are well -suited for the long -range modulation of neural 727 
activity across the cortex  (Allman et al., 2011) , and also contain diverse populations of 728 
noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioidergic neurons. B oth regions further share an 729 
integrative connectivity structure, with projections to both lower-level visceral-motor 730 
brainstem nuclei and higher-order regions implicated in decision -making, metacognition, 731 
and self-awareness, such as the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal  cortices (Allen et 732 
al., 2017, 2016a; Fleming and Dolan, 2012; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Ullsperger et al., 2010). 733 
However, the AIC is more densely interconnected with the PIC whereas the ACC is more 734 
closely related to uncertainty and decision -making. On this basis, we propose that whereas 735 
the AIC integrates the visceral and exteroceptive states required for the regulation of arousal 736 
policies, the ACC is likely to regulate the gain or precision of these interactions4.  737 
                                                        
4 It is worth noting that this model may explain the widespread, seemingly unspecific activation profiles of 
these areas (Chang et al., 2013; Yarkoni et al., 2011), as the generative model specified here suggests both form 
part of an integrated hierarchical circuit by which  interoceptive and exteroceptive states interact : e.g., either 
through the regulation of arousal policies or through the modulati on of ascending viscerosensory precision.

What about metacognitive or reward-related interoceptive processes? Although here 738 
we do not model these higher -order functions, the model can be expanded to include the 739 
explicit representation of policy uncertainty and epistemic value as the mechanisms 740 
underlying metacognitive self -inference; i.e., the integrative self -model that combines 741 
exteroceptive and interoceptive p redictions into a conscious schema  (Allen and Tsakiris, 742 
2019). In this case, we would expect  that the VMPFC and DLPFC are likely to be engaged in 743 
inferences about variables (e.g., those derived from expected free energy such as epistemic 744 
and intrinsic value)  that contextualize the inferences performed by the  AIC and ACC  over 745 
longer timescales (Friston et al., 2015, 2017a).  746 
 747 
Limitations and Future Directions 748 
The model and simulations presented here represent a minimal  proof-of-principle 749 
demonstrating how cyclic interactions of interoceptive and exteroceptive perception ar ise 750 
directly from the principles of  active inference. Here, our primary goal was to move the 751 
literature beyond purely conceptual analyses of ‘interoceptive inference’, to provide a formal 752 
model sub -serving direct hypothesis testing. As such, we focus prima rily on reproducing 753 
commonly reported phenomena, rather than empirical cross-validation or biological 754 
plausibility. While the model presented here does a reasonably goo d job of approximating 755 
the cardiac cycle, it should be clear that much work remains to b e done if the model is to be 756 
used as a full generative model ; e.g., of heart -brain interactions and/or physiological data 757 
such as HRV. We therefor e anticipate a variety  of fruitful applications . F or example, the 758 
present MDP scheme could be expanded to include biologically realistic cardiac parameters, 759 
or to include other visceral modalities such as gastric or respiratory fluctuations. Similarly, 760 
the exteroceptive states modelled here could be adapted to a variety of experimental tasks 761 
to capture embodied in fluences on , for example,  active spatial navigation  (Kaplan and 762 
Friston, 2018; Lockmann et al., 2018; Lockmann and Tort, 2018) , active reward learning  763 
(FitzGerald et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2019) , interaction between the card iac cycle and 764 
ballistic saccades  (Galvez-Pol et al., 2018; Mirza et al., 2016; Ohl et al., 2016) , or 765 
metacognitive self-inference (Allen et al., 2016b; Friston et al., 2017b; Hauser et al., 2017a) . 766
