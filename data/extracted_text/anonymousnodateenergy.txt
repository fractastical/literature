THE ENERGY
PRINCIPLE
6.1
In this chapter, the elastic behavior of solids containing cracks is examined using
the energy principal approach, which includes all forms of energy since loading
develops mechanical work, energy absorption around the crack tip, and energy
dissipation as heat. Williams [1] and Broek [2] undertook this energy approach
as the primary  form of energy (mechanical work ) being c onsidered. If work is
done, then crack growth occurs and elastic energy is released. With the ex cep-
tion of pure brittle solids, engineering materials undergo some form of plastic
deformation at the crack tip due to an applied external st ress. Such plastic
deformation is an irreversible process and the material undergoes a plastic flow
process.
In a general sense, plastic flow is r eferred to as a permanent and non-
recoverable deformation in most common solid materials. On the other hand,
viscous flow describes the mechanical behavior of plastics, such as non-crystalline
polymers, and it is temperature and  time dependent. The term viscoelasticity
is also used to indicate viscous flow.
6.2 ENERGY RELEASE RATE
The focus of this section is to determine the energy balance and the crack driving
force for a slow crack growth event due to the action of an external quasi-static
load. The crack may be embedded, on the surface or  through-the-thickness.
Consider a body with a boundary contour as shown in Figure 6.1 subjected
to an energy input increment due to an external loading [1,7]. Assume that
the solid body is elastic and it s elastic mechanical behavior can be characterized
by a linear load-displacement re lationship, as depicted in Figure 6.2

stiffness and the inverse of stiffness is called the compliance.
