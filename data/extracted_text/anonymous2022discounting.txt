Discounting Trillions of Dollars in Pension Obligations: A Better 
Alternative to Using the Expected Return or Risk-Free Rate

Abstract 
This paper proposes a new discount rate that pension funds can use to discount their future 
obligations. If the payouts of a pension fund depend on the return of the fund's assets, then 
neither the risk-free rate nor the expected return is an equitable way to discount future 
liabilities.  Using the newly proposed rate, the expected utilities of a particular stream of 
payments are the same in each period. This proposed rate is higher than the discount rate that is 
used by some pension funds but lower than the rate that the U.S. States are required to use.

1. Introduction
Trillions of dollars and the welfare of millions of people are at stake when pension funds and 
other organizations discount their future liabilities. Pension funds use a discount rate in order to 
value the current cost of their obligations. The states in the U.S. are required to use the expected 
return on the pension fund’s assets as the discount rate. In contrast, Dutch pension funds are 
required to discount using the risk-free rate. This paper argues that neither rate is equitable if the 
future payments of a pension fund depend on future returns. Examples of such funds are the 
Dutch pension funds and funds for which cost of living adjustments (COLA) depend on the 
funding rate, such as the New Jersey state pension funds and the Rhode Island state pension 
funds. The proposed rate is also useful for other pension funds that are underfunded by using 
either the risk-free rate or the expected return. Underfunding is a feature of the pension funds of

all the U.S. States, as documented by Novy-Marx and Rauh (2011), and Andonov, Bauer, and 
Cremers (2017). 
A standard view in financial economics is that future payments should be discounted at a 
rate that reflects their risk (Modigliani and Miller (1958)), and particularly their covariance with 
priced risks (Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Cochrane (2011)). This seems to suggest that 
pension funds should discount future payments at the expected rate of return.  However, under 
risk aversion, the utility of a certain payment is higher than the expected utility of an uncertain 
payment with the same expected value. Thus, a pension fund may want to keep the expected 
utility of payments to a pensioner constant. In such a case, using the expected rate of return is not 
a good option. We show that the pension funds can use a discount rate that ensures that the 
expected utility of future payouts equals the utility of the current payout. This discount rate is 
lower than the expected rate of return but higher than the risk-free rate. Following the labeling in 
macro growth models by Phelps (1966) and others, we call this the Golden Rule discount rate. 
Under the assumption that the pension payments are a given amount and must be paid, 
the risk-free rate is the correct discount rate according to many authors; see, for example, Brown 
and Wilcox (2009) and Novy-Marx and Rauh (2011). However, the Dutch pension funds let their 
future payments depend on future returns, so the risk-free rate is not the correct discount rate for 
them. The Dutch Central Bank, de Nederlandsche Centrale Bank, regulates the Dutch pension 
funds. These have 1.56 trillion Euros in assets2; the largest is the Algemeen Burgerlijk 
Pensioenfonds for civil servants with 0.476 trillion Euros in assets3. A large pension fund for a 
private company is Shell Pension Fund, with 30 billion Euros in assets4. 
A pension fund that invests in risk-free assets and uses the risk-free rate to discount its 
future obligations can increase the expected utility of the pensioners by using the Golden Rule 
discount rate and by investing part of its funds in risky assets. Suppose that the pensioners 
receive the same payments every year when the pension fund only invests in the risk-free asset. 
Using the Golden Rule discount rate and investing in some risky assets increases the payout in 
the current year proportionally to the 'risk-free rate' payouts. All the future payments yield the 
same expected utility as the current period payment, and these expected utilities are higher than 
the utilities of the 'risk-free rate' payouts. 
Further, the pension funds of most U.S. States promise certain payments, but they are 
required by Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) ruling 25 and Actuarial Standards 
of Practice (ASOP) item 27 to use the expected return on pension assets as a discount rate. The 
U.S. state pension funds are all underfunded when they use the expected rate of return, according 
to Andonov, Bauer, and Cremers (2017). If they used the lower risk-free rate, as advocated by 
Brown and Wilcox (2009), then these pension funds would be even more underfunded. Of 
course, the U.S. states could have used the risk-free rate and set more assets aside, but none of 
the states chose to do so. In this paper, we consider the case where the future payments depend

on future returns, which is currently the case for the Rhode Island and New Jersey pension funds, 
as well as for other pension funds with trillions of dollars in assets. Other states may join Rhode 
Island and New Jersey and let their future payments depend on their future investment results. A 
dramatic way for a state to do so is to default. Ergungor (2017) reviews the law and history of 
states that have defaulted in the past. 
Private firms in the U.S. are required to discount using the yield on high quality corporate 
bonds, which is close to the expected return of a balanced portfolio consisting of stocks and 
government bonds. The Golden Rule discount rate can be useful for firms because it takes the 
uncertainty of returns into account. A concept that is somewhat related to the Golden Rule 
discount rate is Asset and Liability Management.5 However, Asset and Liability Management 
does not imply a discount rate for future liabilities and does not give guidance on dividing the 
assets of an underfunded pension fund. 
Andonov, Bauer, and Cremers (2017) show that underfunded pension funds increase their 
risky investments in an attempt to boost their expected returns, thereby increasing the discount 
rate of future pension obligations under current rules. Such gaming of the system is not possible 
under the Golden Rule discount rate, because when the variance of investments goes up, then the 
discount rate goes down. Using an example and an empirical application, we show the benefits 
of the ‘even-handed’ approach of the Golden Rule discount rate rather than the use of expected 
returns or the risk-free rate. 
 
 
2. The Golden Rule Discount Rate 
 
In this section, we present an example to illustrate the Golden Rule discount rate and then state a 
proposition showing its most important properties under more general conditions. 
 
Example: 
 Let w denote the assets of a pension fund whose obligation is to care for its participants. 
Half of the participants will live for one period while the other half will live for two periods. Let 
R denote the discount rate for future obligations. If the discount rate R is close to zero, then 
about two thirds of the assets w will be used in the current period and about one third in the 
future period. In particular, 𝑤

per group. Approximating a portfolio using a log normal distribution is standard in finance; see, 
for example, Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (2017) for using the log normal distribution for stock 
market returns. The skewness and excess kurtosis of a balanced portfolio are smaller than those 
of the stock market so that the log normal approximation is relatively good6. 
Let r and 2 denote the mean and variance of the log real return of the portfolio. The expected 
utility in the second period is then

If a pension fund uses the expected return, i.e. 𝑅ൌ𝑅 ௘௫௣௘௖௧௘ௗ ൌ𝑒 ௥ାమ

The utility in the first period equals the expected utility in the second period if  ൌെ 1 , i.e. risk 
neutrality. Under risk aversion, i.e.  ൐െ 1, the expected utility is less in the second period. The 
proposition below shows that 𝐸𝑈ሺ𝐶ଶሻ ൏ 𝑈 ሺ𝐶ଵሻ under risk aversion for a very large class of 
utility functions and data-generating processes for portfolio returns. 
  
The Golden Rule discount rate uses R*=𝑒୰ିమ

aversion and log normal returns. This yields that the utility in the first period and the expected 
utility in the second period are

మ െ1 . Note that for  ൐െ 1 , 
we have that R*<𝑅௘௫௣௘௖௧௘ௗ. That is, under risk aversion the golden rate discount rate is lower 
than the expected return. This lower discount rate implies that less is consumed in period one, so 
that we have the following inequalities: 
𝑈ሺ𝐶ଵሻோ೐ೣ೛೐೎೟೐೏ ൐𝑈 ሺ 𝐶ଵሻோ∗ ൌ𝐸 𝑈 ሺ 𝐶ଶሻோ∗ ൐𝐸 𝑈 ሺ 𝐶ଶሻோ೐ೣ೛೐೎೟೐೏. 
 
                                                 
6 In the application, we use a portfolio consisting of 60% stocks (S&P 500) and 40% government bonds (10-year 
government bonds). We use fifty years of data, 1970-2019. The yearly skewness and excess kurtosis are -0.682 and 
0.558, respectively. Over a 2-year horizon, the skewness reduces to -0.324 while the excess kurtosis is -0.849, i.e. it 
is just negative.

Now consider the risk-free rate 𝑅௦௔௙௘. If the pension fund invests in the risk-free asset, then the 
utility in the first period is the same as the (expected) utility in the second period. However, if 
some of the fund’s portfolio is invested in risky assets in order to maximize expected utility, then 
the expected utility is higher in the second period, i.e.  
𝑈ሺ𝐶ଵሻோೞೌ೑೐ ൏𝐸 𝑈 ሺ 𝐶ଶሻோೞೌ೑೐ . 
 
We now generalize this example to a proposition. In the example, the group that lives for one 
period is twice as large as the group that lives for two periods. More generally, size of the group 
that lives for one period divided by the other group can be denoted by , so that  =2 in the 
example,  ൌ1  when the groups are of the same size, and  ൌ0  when everybody lives for two 
periods.

Instead, it chooses the return S since it yields a higher expected utility, so 𝑈ሺ𝐶ଵሻ ൏𝐸 𝑈ሺ𝐶ଶሻ.  
 
 
Using the expected return in the context of Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 
ruling 25 means using a single discount rate. For cases in which a U.S. State does not fully 
guarantee the payments, one can use the Golden Rule discount rate. Of course, one can let the 
discount rate depend on how far in the future the liabilities are due. A reason to do this could be 
that the risk-free rate has a yield curve that is not flat. All approaches can accommodate this. 
Further, the risk-free discount rate, the expected return discount rate, and the Golden Rule 
discount rate all have simple representations in continuous time. In particular, for the latter two, 
we have under log normality of the returns, 
Rexpected(t)=𝑒௧ሺ௥ାమ
మ ሻ െ1 , and 
 
R*(t)=𝑒୲ሺ୰ିమ
మ ሻ െ1 . 
 
We applied the three discount rates to balanced portfolios of 60% stocks (S&P 500) and 40% 
government bonds (10-year government bonds). This balance of 60% risky assets and 40% safe 
assets is common among pension funds; see the empirical study of Andonov, Bauer, and 
6 
 
Cremers (2017). We use fifty years of data7, 1970-2019. The value of gamma for which a 60/40 
portfolio is optimal is 𝛾ൌ1 . 4. This is in the range of values found credible by Havránek (2015), 
and it is the value we use. We consider investing over a 20-year horizon starting at the beginning 
of 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. An endowment is consumed by one group (over a 20-year 
period) and, for every year, we calculate the future liabilities using a discount rate. We use 5.9% 
as the real expected return, as this was the average return over the sample periods. We estimate 
the portfolio variance, using the last 20 years of the balanced portfolio, i.e. using 1950 through 
1969 for 1970. We use this estimated variance to calculate the Golden Rule discount rate for 
every year; the average value of this discount rate in our sample is 4.5%. The average value of 
the risk-free rate is 2.3%. All rates are real.  
           Using the risk-free rate, we find that the average utility is -36.52 in the first ten years and  
-25.04 in the remaining ten years. This is in agreement with the proposition theorem that states 
that the expected utility will be higher in the second period, i.e. it causes such inequality in 
expectation. For the expected return discount rate, we found -29.16 and -33.87, respectively, 
which is also consistent with the proposition since the utility decreases with time. Finally, for the 
Golden Rule discount rate, we found that the utility varied less: -31.05 in the first ten years and  
-30.12 in the remaining ten years. Thus, in this sample, the Golden Rule discount rate produces 
utilities that vary less over time compared to the other discount rates. 
 
  
3. Conclusion 
This paper proposes a new discount rate that pension funds can use to discount their future 
obligations. If the payouts of a pension fund depend on the return of the fund's assets, then 
neither the risk-free rate nor the expected return is appropriate to discount future 
liabilities.  Using the proposed Golden Rule discount rate, the expected utilities of a particular 
stream of payments are the same in each period. In a two-period model, the (expected) utility is 
higher in the first period than in the second period when the expected return is used as the 
discount rate. Using the risk-free rate as a discount rate yields the reverse. Such differences can 
be problematic if the make-up of the groups changes with time. The proposed rate avoids such 
problems. Further, this rate is higher than the discount rate that is used by some pension funds 
but lower than the rate that the U.S. States are required to use.
