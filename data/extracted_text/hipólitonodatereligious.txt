Religiouspracticesarewaysinwhichhumanbeingscollectivelyengagewiththeworldunderacommon worldview (Weltbilt). Being socioculturally situated, religious practices involveengagingwiththeworldbymasteringavarietyof cognitivecapacities, suchasinterpretingandsharing communications about one’s worldview, partaking in rituals and ceremonies, andunderstanding non-explicit or ineffable meanings commonly implied in mystical and spiritualexperiences(James, 1901-1902/2003, pp. 53, 125, 137, 443, 502; seealsoTurner, 2008;Weed,2020; Fabb, 2021; Bennett-Hunter, 2022).Among researchers, there is only a fuzzyconsensusabout what preciselyconstitutesareligion. Religious practices are usually defined according to a socio-cultural setting (DawsonandRussello, 1948; Hordern, 2016; 2020; Luckmann, 2019; Ammerman, 2020), whichincludesspecificmorals, worldviews, sanctifiedpracticesandpropheciesheldinrituals, sacredhistoriesand religious beliefs relating the human faith experience and its spiritual elements to atranscendental world. Spiritual elementsofpersonalfaithexperiencestendtoinvolveperceivedcontact with something sacred, divine, or otherwise supernatural, combined withaperceivedtranscendence that provides meaning, direction, and/or an ultimate goal for life (Kennedy,Kanthamani and Palmer, 1994; Appel et al. 2020; Skrzypi ń ska, 2021). Ritualsincludesermons,commemoration or veneration (of deities and/or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances,initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance.Religious practices also include sacred historiesandnarrativescontainedinsacredscriptures,aswell assymbols, andholyplacesthat aimatgivingmeaningtolife(Augustine, 397AD/1996;Burnaby, 2007; Brown 2007; Classen, 2018). The symbolic stories, sometimes held to behistorically accurate, aimat offering a range of explanations for, e.g., the originof lifeandtheuniverse(Hick, 1988; Artigas, 1999; BerryandBerry, 2009;Hanley, BennettandRatcliffe, 2014;Peterson and Venema, 2021). Religious beliefs tend to presuppose the existence of atranscendental world.While awareness of religious diversity is not new, philosophers of religion frombothEast and West have recognised and acted upon the need for more interactive collaborations(Smart and Murthy, 1996; Pollack, Müller andPickel, 2012; Fehige, 2016; Allen, 2018; Barrett,2022). Therearebothstrikingsimilaritiesanddifferencesbetweentheapproachesputforwardwithin the most popular religious traditions across the globe. While we cannot provide afull-blownanalyticreviewthat doesjusticetoall their nuances, it canbeinsightful tohighlightsome of their key features in the following order: self-relation, salvation, devotion, andveneration.

Bloomsbury Press.3Firstly, religious traditions propagate different ways of relating to ourselves, ascontextualisedbyoneor morelarger realms–consistingof thephysical universeandpotentialspiritual realms. Buddhists assert there is only Oneness (strict monism), which inspires thecommon Buddhistic claimthat the notionof anindividual “self” isfictional inessence. Hinduscommonly wield the concepts of Brahman (roughly connoting divine ultimate reality) andAtman (roughly connoting the substance of individual consciousness or “self”), but variousHindu communities propagate divergent views on whether this distinction is essential(imposing a form of dualism) or merely conceptual (affording non-dualistic views).Non-dualistic Hindus tend to assert that “Atman is Brahman”, which implies that everyone ispermeated by divine consciousness (as in, e.g., Advaita Vedanta Hinduism). In contrast,adherents of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, &Islam) tend to assert that theuniverse was created by an almighty God that differs fromall of creation. For most JewsandMuslims this distinction between God and mankind is absolute in every substantial sense. Incontrast, most modern Christian traditions believe in the Trinity(asformulatedintheNiceneCreed, 325AD), whichclaimsthat God(“theFather”)incarnatedfullyinJesusChrist(“theSon”)who enabled his followers to be filled with God’s spirit (“the Holy Spirit”).Secondly, a central theme in the world’s religions is to assert a spiritual yearning ofhumankind and offer a solution of some form, often referred to as “salvation”. Within theAbrahamic religions, salvation typically involves being accepted by or united to God whileretaining one’s individuality, although traditions differ widely on howone attainssalvation. Asimilar themeiscentralfordualistHindus, whostriveforunitywithBrahmanwhiledifferingonbest practices. For non-dualisticHindus, thisunityisalreadythereinessence, butitis“hidden”until individualsachieve“moksha” asinliberatingself-knowledge. Whiletherearesimilarities,Buddhists deny the existence of the self more explicitly – their ultimate goal of “nirvana”involvesacompleteextinguishingof theselfandcompleteextinctionofallsuffering(MooreandKlein, 1977).Thirdly, althoughpracticesarewidelydivergentacrossreligions, allinvolvesomeformofpersonal devotion to a larger whole that is perceived as sacred, which usually includes anoverarchingreligiouscommunityanditsestablishedreligiousauthorities(e.g., religiousleaders,holyscriptures). Indailylife, suchdevotiontendstobeexpressedandmaintainedinmanyways,bothpublicly(e.g., throughclothing, generosity, andotherobservablebehaviours)andprivately(e.g., inone’sthought). Ontheindividuallevel, thereisanongoing, circularrelationshipbetweenone’s personal devotion or “faith” and one’s expressions thereof. The deepening of devotiontendstobeelicitedbyexpressionsofdevotion, suchascommunityinvolvementwithmeditationand/or prayer, which are practised both individually and collectively.

Bloomsbury Press.4Fourthly, thepracticeof venerationhasbeenidentifiedasanintegralpartofeachofthemajor world religions, either explicitly or implicitly. In explicit veneration, highly dedicateddevotees of religious communities (e.g., nuns and monks, priests and priestesses) can beregarded as sacred themselves (“saints”) and respected in their religious communities asauthorities onreligiousmatters, suchasmoral guidelines. At thesametime, religiousdevotionencourages submission to these religious authorities. More generally, community-levelperceptions with regard to a community member’s degreeof devotionwill tendtostrengthentheperceivedtrust inthat person’sauthorityonreligiouspractices. Therefore, dueto(implicit)veneration, the relationship between religious devotion and religious authorityisintrinsicallycircular, cumulative, and collective.Nowthat we have provided our admittedly selective (and oversimplified) overviewofreligious traditions, we will surveysomeof thediscussionsinthecognitivescienceof religion.For example, the form of religious beliefs themselves has been a subject of debate (for anoverview, seeBarrett, 2022) asscholarshavetriedtopindownthedeterminingconditionsforreligious convictions, and how they relate to evidence-based reasoning and/or “blind” faith(Löffler, 2018; Matheson, 2018; McGrath, 2018; Penelhum, 2019; Tillson, 2022).Cognitivist approaches toreligiontendtofocusonreligiousbeliefsandregardthemascognitive processes of (implicit) computational inference(Boyer, 2001; 2018; seealsoSperberandHirschfeld, 2007; Purzycki andSosis, 2010; Tremlin, 2010). Someauthorshavearguedthatreligious beliefs should be seen as mental representations that happen to provide misguidedembellishmentsof what theycall “empirical reality”. Specifically, WoodandShaver(2018)statethat, “the evolutionary roots and continued persistence of religion are thus functions of thecapacityforhumanstogeneratecognitivealternativestoempiricalreality, andtheneedtostablycoordinate those alternative conceptions” (p. 1) and then proceed to cast religious beliefs asunnecessary cognitive processes that require correction. If religious beliefs could indeed bereducedtoclaimsthat canbeinvestigatedusingthescientificmethod, onecouldpaintapictureof human progress away from “erroneous” magical and religious beliefs, and towardsscientifically validated thought. Both Frazer (1890) and Dennett (2007) expressed hopes inaccordance with this view, which has received much criticismfromWittgenstein (RFGB) andothers, as we will discuss in more detail below.Along with most authorsincognitivescienceandphilosophyof mind, wewouldassertthat the scientific method is (and shouldremain) dedicatedtoproducingnatural explanationsfor all observablephenomena, includingreligion. However, manyauthorshavecriticisedvariousparts of the overall perspective of human progressput forwardbyFrazer (1890) andDennett(2007). For example, many authorshavearguedthat enculturatedpracticesingeneral requirecontextualizationandcannot beproperlyunderstoodbyreductiontocognitiveprocessesalone

Bloomsbury Press.5(Ryle, 1949; Hutto and Myin, 2017; Di Paolo, Cuffari and De Jaegher, 2018; Gallagher, 2020).Reductive cognitivism ends up disregarding the diverse kinds of recursive interactions andemergent dynamics entailed in religious practices both within and between individuals andcommunities over time, such as the roles played by non-propositional meanings, culturalembodiment, and the broader socio-cultural environments in which religious practices aresituated (Ryle, 1949; Hutto and Myin, 2017; Di Paolo, Cuffari andDeJaegher, 2018; Gallagher,2020). In this chapter, we develop the implications of viewing religion as an enculturatedpractice and evaluateit inlight of cognitivescienceandphilosophyof mind, asinspiredbytheconsonance between Wittgenstein’s thought and the more recently developed conceptualtoolbox associated with generative modelling, in particular as applied to complex adaptivesystems. In doing so, we converge on a non-reductive, communal perspective onreligionthatcontrastsstarklywithcommon“strawperson” perspectivesonreligionthat aimtoreduceit to“erroneous” metaphysical theorising motivated by spiritual experiences “generated by thebrain”. In contrast, a communal perspective informed by Wittgenstein’s thought, cognitivescience, and complex systems theorysuggeststhat religiouspracticesbothenableandrequiretheemergenceof implicit (or “ineffable”) meaningsthat areexperiencedbothindividually(i.e.,one’spersonalfaith)andcollectively(“thefaith”), withonlypartialcommensurability. Individualparticipation in collective religious practices can generate evidence that becomescommensurable for other encultured participants, as personal experiences that support theirindividual faith in the collective and consolidate future participation. In this view, religionsemergefromarecursiverelationshipbetweenindividualandcollectivedynamicsthatcannotbereduced to the individual level of description. We further elaborate on the collective andperspectival aspectsof religioninenculturationwithmorals, doctrines, rituals, andexpressionsthat areincommensurablewiththescientificmethod. Whileimposingthisepistemicseparationbetween the different kinds of “language games” of religion and science has proven useful inpractice, we furthermorearguethat aharshdichotomyisitself anoversimplificationthat doesnot provide a “perspicuous presentation” of their interactions. Touchpoints between thesedifferent kinds of language games tend to give rise to perpetual confusion and unproductivediscussions. As a particularly impactful example, we discuss ethical considerations inpolicy-making, which demonstrates howour account can help shed light on complex societalchallenges that have emerged at the touchpoints between religion and science.

Religious practices require participants to master a diverse set of cognitive capacities. Whilesituatedwithinandenactingaspecificsocioculturalsetting, religiousindividualsactivelyengagein ritualistic activities, such as festivals, feasts or meditation. In doing so, they engage withsacred narratives that shape these individuals and their relationships with others and guidelives in a manner that is reportedlyexperiencedasmeaningful andpurposeful andhelpsbindcommunities.Much of the (neuro)cognitive science of religion tends to focus on the cognitiveprocesses associated with religious beliefs. One of the most prominent reductive views onreligionischampionedbyPascalBoyer(2002;2018). Inthisview, religiousconceptsandbeliefsarecast asunconsciousinferencecomputedinmodularsystems, followingtheModularityoftheMindframework(Fodor, 1983). Thisframeworkcontendsthatcognitiveprocessestakeplaceina roughly double-layered architecture. On the bottom levels, modular mechanisms areencapsulated to generate (series of) responses given some set of domain-specificstimuli. Theresulting responses are continuously aggregated in domain-specific representations that areassumedtofeedupwardstothecentral cognitivemodule, whichistaskedwithinferencetothebest explanation in order to integrate its various uni-modal inputs inonecentralised“mentalrepresentation”. AccordingtoFodor (1983), mentalrepresentationsareformedatthislevel. Itisat this level that, according to reductive cognitivism, we should expect religious beliefs to beinstantiated. Boyer (2002) provides the following examples of this process:
Whenweseebranches movinginatreeorwhenwehearanunexpectedsoundbehindus,we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. Wecandothatwithout any specific description of what the agent actually is. (p. 144, emphasis added).
Under the Modularity of the Mind account, certain series of stimuli will trigger simplifiedperceptual representations in the corresponding domain-specific modules (e.g., visual:“branchesmovinginatree” or auditory: “anunexpectedsoundbehindus”)andthosearefedtothecentral cognitivemodule, whichtheninferswhat appearstobethemostlikelycauseofthisperceptual representation (e.g., “some agent”). This is a reasonable (and common) examplescenario where unexpected sensorial stimuli are attributed to the actions of another agent,supposedly hidden (“in a tree” or “behind us”). In Boyer’s (2022), account, “Specializedexplanatory devices, more properly called inference systems, each of which is adapted toparticular kinds of events and automatically suggests explanations for these events. (p. 16),“Religious concepts may seem out of the ordinary, but they too make use of the inferencesystems I just described”  (p. 17).

Bloomsbury Press.7Althoughformallyjustifyinginferenceswithregardstotheexistenceofothermindsisathornyissueinitself (e.g., Plantinga, 1967), it sidestepsmuchmorecomplicatedquestionssuchas spiritual transcendence and other aspects associated with religious experiences. It leavesunanswered important questions about how a cognitive architecture that gradually developsrepresentations inanentirelystimulus-drivenfashionisexpectedtoconstruct representationsassociatedwithtranscendent spiritual realmsandentities. Postulatingthatneuralarchitecturescoulddevelopsymbolicrepresentationsishighlycontroversial(seeBennettandHacker, 2022, p.179). Further, simply suggesting that our capacity tomakeinferencesabout abstract conceptsthat commonly recur in our daily lives (such as other agents andtheir intentions) couldhavebeen repurposed and generalised to generate hypotheses about spiritual beings and theirintentions does not clarify how that qualitative transition occurs for the individual or thecollective, nor doesit shedanylight onitspractical implicationsforthedailylivesofthosewhoentertainandpropagatespiritual concepts. Inshort, theModularityoftheMindasaframeworkdoes not provide clarity on the formation and propagation of spiritual conceptsandreligiousbeliefs more generally.Contemporarycognitiveempirical andtheoretical researchhasgeneratedmultiplelinesof evidence contradicting the Modularity of the Mind framework (Driver and Spence, 2000;Baltieri andBuckley, 2018;Khambhatietal. 2018;Zerilli, 2019;PietraszewskiandWertz, 2022).Some researchers specifically note a shift in the neurocognitive science of religion (Asprem,2019; Schjødt andvanElk, 2019; SzocikandVanEyghen, 2021). Accordingly, researchersarguethatcognitiveneurosciencehasundergoneaKuhnianshiftawayfromtheModularityoftheMind(mostly bottom-up) toward predictive accounts of cognition that emphasise and formaliserecursive relationshipsinwhichtherelativedominanceof bottom-upandtop-downinfluencesvariesdynamically(Asprem, 2019). Predictiveaccountsof cognitionhavebecomepredominantasexplanationsofcognitiveprocessesbasedonalargeamountofscientificevidencefortheroleof domain-general over domain-specific processing, disputing the information encapsulationsupposedbytheModularityoftheMind(Kalénetal. 2021, Nairetal. 2021;Mononen, Gerlachetal. 2022; Niemivirta and Korhonen, 2022; Saito et al. 2022). Another scientific findingchallengingtheModularityof theMindframeworkistheroleoftop-downeffectsonlower-levelcognition. Contrary to what was supposed by the Modularity of the Mind, evidence indicatestop-downmodulationover lower levelsof cognition. Thisevidencehasledtopredictivecodingbecomingthebasisfor avarietyof frameworkstounderstandneural activity(RaoandBallard,1999; Spratling, 2016; Smith, BadcockandFriston, 2021; Kramer et al. 2022;Pezzulo, ParrandFriston, 2022) and it has inspired predictive accounts of cognition, which extend predictivecoding to cognitive activity totheagent scale, suchasthinking, dreamingor perceiving(Clark,2015; LupyanandClark, 2015;VandeCruys, 2017;Fabry, 2018;Wilkinsonetal. 2019;Walshet

Andersen(2019) specificallyappliespredictivecodingtothedetectionof supernatural agency. He argues that most falsepositivesinagencydetectioncanbeseenastop-downinterferenceofoverweightingunreliablestimuli. Inhisview, theformationofreligiousbeliefs is a consequence of an error of the predictive system, which, in the face of unreliablestimuli, puts too much weight on priors.Reducing religious practices to religious beliefs, understood as inference of a mentalrepresentationor asaninferredmental representation, under predictiveaccountsofcognition,motivates thinking of religious practices as inference alternatives to the empirical reality(Anderson 2019; Asprem, 2019; see other work pointing in the same direction Van Elk andWagenmakers, 2017; Schjødt, 2018; SchjødandvanElk, 2019; Szocik, K., &VanEyghen, 2021).This motivates the consideration that those who engage in religious practices are somewhatunder a predictively faulty mechanism, reasoning, or model that needs to be updated forepistemicaccuracy. Inthislight, predictiveaccountsof cognitionalsodonotelucidateuponthebelief/concept formationabout transcendent beingsandwhat theseconceptsmeanfor humanlife, other than being “fictional”. This explanation depends upon accepting the followingconditions: (1) evidenceisonlyadmissibleif it isfoundbyexplicit reasoningand(2) cognitivecapacities implied in religious practices can be reduced to such explicit reasoning (i.e., it issufficient to explain subjective experience, of the ethical, the religious or the psychological).Accordingly, such predictive accounts of cognition tend to conclude that inferences aboutsomething that is not in the empirical world must be corrected for epistemic accuracy.TheintentiontoinspireprogressfromreligioustowardscientificthinkingisalsoheldbyDennett (2006). Inhispopular bookBreakingtheSpell, takinginspirationfromFrazer’s(1890)analogy between religion andmagic, Dennett arguesthat thephenomenonof religionrequiresscientificanalysis, for itmustnotbeoff-limitstoorbeyondscientificinquiry.

For example, the two-truths doctrine of Buddhism encourages its practitioners tosimultaneously entertain multiple statementsthat aremutuallyexclusive, theinterpretationofwhich has motivated the development of Catu ṣ ko ṭ i, an intrinsically paradoxical (or“paraconsistent”) logic system. Furthermore, acollectionof paradoxical statementsarecentraltoChristiandoctrinesasdiscussedby, forexample, SørenKierkegaardinPracticeinChristianity,wherehecelebratedChrist asthe“AbsoluteParadox”, aperspectivethat wasfurtherdevelopedand popularised by theologian Karl Barth (for a review, see Woo, 2014).In such cases, religious statements can be nonsensical because they are attempts tomove beyond our everyday realities and hence beyond the significant language. The humanmind is often lured into going against theboundariesof language. Inthisregard, Wittgensteinmakesadistinctionbetweenwhat isknowableandwhat issayable, preciselytodemarcatethatsome things that can be known are not sayable, which he terms “mystical”: “the essence ofreligioncanhavenothingtodowithwhat issayable”. Inthisrespect, Wawrzyniak(2021)notesthat, accordingtoWittgenstein, “all attemptstosaysomethingmorethanthisareeitheramarkof philosophical arroganceor amanifestationof one’sownpersonal commitmenttoadoptingastance of religious belief or nonbelief.” (p. 1767). Because certain core parts of religiousconvictions are not in the domain of the sayable, those parts are by definition not contradictable:
AndthenIgivetheexplanation:‘Idon’tbelievein… ’, butthenthereligiouspersonneverbelieves what I describe.I can’t say. I can’t contradict that person. (LRB)
Thisthought isevident inthetrainof propositionsleadingtothefamouslastpropositionintheTractatus, “7. Whereof onecannot speak, thereof onemust besilent”. Wittgensteinreferstothekind of mystical knowledge concerning the problems of life, e.g. ethical or religious, that isknown but not sayable.In line with Wittgenstein, James (1901-1902/2003) stipulates two conditions formystical experiences: ineffability such that no adequate report of its content can be given inwords (i.e. “ineffable spiritual riches” (p. 53)) and noetic quality, i.e meaningful revelationsranging from the divine, sacred things, and faith, to a supernatural being or some sort oftranscendence that provides meaning and/or an ultimate goal for life (Kennedy, Kanthamaniand Palmer, 1994; Appel et al. 2020; Skrzypi ń ska, 2021). While it is possible to theorise andreasonaboutreligion, James(1901-1902/2003)notes, rationalargumentsaboutreligionmostlytendtobecompellingfor someoneif theyalreadybelievetheconclusion. Conversely, ittendstobe highly unlikely to convince someone of a mystical experiencebyreasoning: “evenwerewe

Cognitivemodelsandexperimentalresearchareimportant means for understanding neurocognitiveprocessesunderlyingandenablinghumansocio-cultural practices in general and religions in particular. What isdisputediswhether themethodof scienceisappropriateeverywhereandspecificallyinreligiousconsiderations. Inthechaseof understandingreligiouspracticesassociatedwith, e.g., spiritualormysticalexperienceswith ineffable properties (James, 1901-1902/2003; Turner, 2008; Weed, 2020; Fabb, 2021;Bennett-Hunter, 2022), it is not possible to set up a research experiment to answer thisquestion. In this respect, Wittgenstein remarks the following: “I believe that the attempt toexplain [religion] is already therefore wrong, because one must only correctly piece togetherwhat oneknows, withoutaddinganything.”(RFGB, emphasisintheoriginal). Religiouspracticesare deeply rooted in the experience of themystical, henceit isnot possibletoexplainreligionwithout adding howit isinrelationtome. Indeed, “Hereonecanonlydescribeandsay: thisiswhat humanlifeislike. Comparedwiththeimpressionwhichthethingdescribedmakesonus,theexplanationistoouncertain. Everyexplanationisafter all ahypothesis.”(RFGB, I, emphasisintheoriginal).

Onlyintheorisingcantherebeerror. AccordingtoWittgenstein, neitherAugustine nor the Buddhists were in error, “except when they set forth a theory” (RFGB).Paraphrasing Wittgenstein, there is nothing hypothetical in our religious considerations (PI§109).

2. On the Certainty of Religion in Enculturated Practices
In the previous section, we have argued that religious practices emerge from certaintiesexpressedinthesepracticesthemselves(asopposedtotheorisingperse)andthusensuretheirown propagation. Inthissection, weexpandonWittgenstein’snotionof certaintyasapractice(not amental representation) byemployingthefamousrule-followingparadox. Whiletheologyis a discipline par excellence, oneattendssermons, commemorations, festivals, meditationandother religiousservicesasformsof actingthat giveexpressiontoareligiousbelief that isheld.One engages in rituals, and sacredstorieswithsomehighdegreeof confidenceor certaintyinone’s religious community – with faith.Certaintyis, accordingtoWittgenstein, bothanattitudeandtheobjectofanattitude, i.e.thingsonedoeswithoutadoubt(OC337). Certaintyisabasic, non-propositional, non-epistemicand yet an undoubting attitude towards some things. In other words, certainty is a kind ofconviction that does not rely on propositions per se, but on acting:
(...)theendisnotcertain‘propositions’strikingusimmediatelyastrue,i.e.itisnotakindofseeing on our part; it is our acting, which lies at the bottom of the language-game.(OC 204)
Certainties exhibit themselves in the attuned and adjusted ways by which one navigates andco-constructs the world. Religious practices, like anyother sociocultural practice, areawayofacting amongst many potential ones – they are facts of our living:
(...)thefactthatweactinsuch-and-suchways,e.g.,punishcertainactions,establishthestateof affairsthusandso,give orders,renderaccounts,describecolours,take aninterestinothers’feelings.Whathasto beaccepted,thegiven–itmightbesaid–arefactsofliving”(RPP I, 630)
‘Factsof living’ arehardlyeveracknowledgedeitherbecause“oftheirgreatgenerality”(PI142);or because they are always before our eyes (RFM92). Yet, facts of living ground certainties,certainties themselves grounding the ways of our living, what Wittgenstein calls, ‘forms of life’:
NowI wouldliketoregardthiscertainty, notassomethingakintohastinessorsuperficiality,but as a form of life [Lebensform]. (OC 358)
ButthatmeansI wantto conceive it as somethingthatliesbeyondbeingjustifiedorunjustified; as it were, as something animal. (OC 359)

In this view, one knows what to do and howtoactupon the worldbyrepresentingguidingrules. Thisapproachstatesthat beliefscanbeusedasevidence for other beliefs. In this view, religious experience is essentially belief-driven:experiences of awe, gratitude, contrition, etc., are caused by religious beliefs. Such groundedbeliefs are warranted providedtheycanbedefendedagainst knownobjections. Theycanthenbe used as evidence for further religious beliefs (Wolterstorff, 1976; Plantinga, 1983; Moon,2016; Kvandal, 2022).

Wittgenstein’s notion ofrule-following presents a problemto belief-first epistemology as an explanationof (religious)practices.

Wittgenstein’s paradox has in common with Greek scepticism the claimthat knowledge isimpossible. At issueistheobservationthat therearenonormativefactsabouthowtocorrectlyapply a rule (all we have isfactsof living). If therearenofactsabout howtocorrectlyapplyagiven rule, then we cannot possibly know how to correctly apply that rule (assuming thatknowledge is factive). Why should we think that there are no normative facts about howtofollow rules?Let usillustratethisinathoughtexperiment. Supposethatoneisfamiliarwiththeword“plus” and the symbol “+” todenoteafunctionknownas‘addition’ inEnglish. Until todaytheyhaveusedthefunctionbut it sohappensthat theyhaveneveraddednumberswhereanyoftheintegers was greater than 57. Stumbling upon the computation, 68+57, they obtain 125 as aresult. AccordingtoKripke(1982), ascepticcouldhoweveraskthemhowtheycanbesurethattheycorrectlyfollowedtheruleexpressedby‘plus’. Nothinginthepast, thescepticcouldclaim,guarantees that they are applyingadditioninsteadof, for example, somehypothetical function
called “quaddition”. Suppose such quaddition were represented by the symbol ‘⨁ ’ andcanbedefined as follows:
Onecannot usepast behaviour tojustifypresent behaviour consideringthatnothingfromtheirpast behaviours guarantees that they are using additioninsteadof quaddition. Moreover, theycan only rely on a finite number of past instances, all of whichwill beconsistent withalargesubset of the infinitely many conceivable rules, quaddition, or anyother conceivablefunction.Thisinsight isgeneralisabletootheraspectsofmentallifeandevenfaith:one’spresentusageisa ‘leap in the dark’, that cannot be fully proven based on past usage.One might object that insteadof relyingonpast usethecalculationof 68+57drawsontheexplicit representationof theadditionof therule, i.e. onehasajustifiedbeliefofquaddition(Gettier, 1963). The rule would thus be memorised like a set of specific instructions inMentalese, readinginEnglish, asfollows: ifyoureadP+QaddPandQandstoretheresult. Thiswould still not solve the problem. The symbol ‘+’ is explained by invoking theterm‘add’. Yet,howcan oneknowwhat isto‘add’ just bytherule? What operationshouldbedoneunder theinstruction‘add’?

Notably, whateverrulesomeonegivesthemselves, itcannotbyitselfdeterminethecorrect use of an associated symbol or expression. For any procedural result obtained bysupposedly following a rule, there is a deviant or alternative interpretation to the rule, adinfinitum. A rule, regardless of its Mentalese symbols the rule is encoded with, would thenalways require some interpretation to determine its meaning. Evenif oneexaminestheir ownmental life or even the belief in God, this belief would still require some interpretation todetermine its meaning where no fact would be discovered.Does this mean that meaning is interpretation? Surely no, because this would implyinfiniteregress. Understandinganactionor anexpressionwouldrequireaninterpretationthatwouldnot itself needaninterpretation: one“last interpretation” (BB34).

Wecouldobeyaruleinour practice: “Andhence‘obeyingarule’ is a practice.” (PI 202).In our practices we do our believing. Certainties are in our actions (Moyal-Sharrock,2021). There is a “misleading appearance that leads philosophers to believe that at thefoundationof thought isyet morethought.” (Moyal-Sharrock, 2016). Interpretationmustendinthe animal in epistemology. More specifically, 'hinge certainties' as the ungrounded,non-propositional underpinning of knowledge, manifest themselves as ways of acting. It is inreligious practices that people enact beliefs about theineffable. Thosebeliefsaregroundedinthe basic certainties of their formsof life. Inthenext section, wewill expandonthisnotionofreligious belief as a practice, we will argue that religious practices instantiate a form ofrationality.
3. On Language Games and Embodied Rationality in Religious Practices
In this section, we will be arguing that religious practices, considered in their own context,involve an embodied form of rationality. Because (P1) religious practices involve theembodiment of language games; (P2) language games are a formof life (consisting both inlanguage and practice), and (P3) rationality is a matter of making allowed moves withinlanguage games, (C.) religious practices involve a formof embodiedrationality. Wittgenstein’streatment of ‘rationality’ is a rule-governed grammar of the ordinary and everydaythat givesexpressive force to a form of life. This deflationary, context-dependent sense of rationalityprovides a stark contrast with notions of logical empiricismor positivism, adherentsof whichwouldtendtoupholdscienceasthegreatest embodimentofrationality(RichardsonandUebel,2007). In Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein defines language games as follows:
71. One might say that the concept ‘game’ is a concept with blurred edges.(...) 101. Wewant tosaythattherecan’tbeanyvaguenessinlogic. Theideanowabsorbsus, that the ideal [i.e. the essence of a game] ‘must’ be found in reality.
He then gives examples of language games as:
Forming and testing a hypothesis—Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams—Making up a story; and reading it—

, R. (ed.) (2022/in press).Wittgenstein andthe cognitive science of religion. Bloomsbury Press.16Play-acting—Singing catches—Guessing riddles—Making a joke; telling it—Solving a problem in practical arithmetic—Translating from one language into another—Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying. —
Thetwomost strikingfeaturesoflanguagegamesisthatwhiletheyembodytheregularitiesofasociocultural community, they are also subject to transformation as the communities change.The ‘framework of the game’ is subject to transformation over time reflecting changes in theformof life and language-games change and adapt (Grimmer, 2015). Fromthis follows thatrationalitycannot bereducedtofixedmeaningssincethemeaningisin-usechangeandtherebyreflects the changes of rationality, rational reasoning and action.Apart fromthe openness to variability, languagegamesalsoembodyregularities. Theycontainthecombinationof linguisticexpressionandaction, thatistosay, thegoverningrulesofa language game. A language game is a matter of, not representing a rule, but rule-following.Following a rule, as seen in the previous section, is a matter of actions and reasoning aboutpossibleactions, whichispar excellenceaformof rationality. For thisreason, rationalitycannotbearbitrarilydefinedinhumannature, butonlyinhumanlanguageandaction(Grimmel, 2017).Wittgenstein’snotionof languagegameoffersaperspectiveof rationalityas‘formof life’. Moreprecisely, a perspective of rationality that, while preserving the rules, is also sensitive tosociocultural situatedness. Rationality becomes part of an activity where “[i]t is thelanguage-gamethat manifestsarational behaviour andnotthepersonherself”(Grimmel, 2017,p. 6). Languagegamesexpressfactsaboutethics(Rhees, 1965;Burbules, Smeyers, 2002;Bizri,(2021), religion(Altmann, 1987; Phillips, 1993;Diamond, 2017;Asad, 2020), aesthetics(Shiner,1974; Perloff, 1994; Schroeder, 2020), science (Birgani and Soqandi, 2020), or any culturallysituated practice. The crucial insight for the topic of our paper is that religious practices,particularly, involvelanguagegames. Languagegamesareaformof life, i.e. theyconsistbothoflanguage and practice. Speaking a language is part of an activity or aformof lifeinaspecificsociocultural community. In this respect, Wittgenstein (PI 7) remarks as follows:
7. [ … ] Children learn their native language and acquire the rules through learning toplay language-games. Learning to play the game is understood in terms of making amove in the game. Learning to play the game is a paradigm of learning to be rational.

Rationalityimpliedinmovingaroundalanguagegamecannothencebereducedtofixedmeaning. For thestabilityof meaningisusage, i.e., action. Rationalitycorresponds to the family of concepts that are part of an activity: where participation in thelanguage-game corresponds to rational behaviour.From a Wittgensteinian perspective, religious practices involve a formof embodiedrationality. The use of the concept ‘God’, accordingtoWittgenstein, expressestherulesfor theuseoftheologicaltermsineverydayreligiousdiscourse(Arrington, 2001). Religiousdiscourseisaformof grammar that allowsustoexpress, not“scientificfacts”(whateverthatissupposedtomean), buthowthingsareexperiencedbypractitioners.

Insomeof hiswritings, WittgensteinagreedwithLutherinsayingthat‘theologyisthegrammar of theword“God”’(Lectures). Thus, standardclaimsoftheologyaboutGodarenotto be understood as scientific claims but rather “as grammatical remarksexpressingrulesforthe use of theological termsineverydayreligiousdiscourse” (Arrington, 2001, p. 172). Wecantalk about such matters in a way that shows the ineffable, not as scientific facts, but as grammar.Inthissectionwehavearguedthat becausereligiouspracticesinvolvelanguagegames;whichareformsof life(consistingbothinlanguageandpractice), andrationalityisamatterofmaking allowed moves in language games, religious practices involve a form of embodiedrationality.
4 Note that as stressed previously in this chapter, not all religious claims are nonsensical. It is also important to note that, as it iswidely known, Wittgenstein’s thinking has evolved from the Tractatus, putting emphasis onnonsensical, towards PhilosophicalInvestigations, elucidating upongrammaticalstatementsthat can be made about diverse forms of experiencing/engaging with theworld, e.g. aesthetic, ethical, religious, psychological.

One could almost say that man is a ceremonial animal. That is, no doubt, partly wrongand partly nonsensical, but there is also something right about it.(...)That is, one could begin a book on anthropology by saying: When one examines the lifeand behavior of mankind throughout the world, one sees that, except for what might becalled animal activities, such as ingestion, etc., etc., etc., [humans] also perform actionswhich bear a characteristic peculiar to themselves, and these could be called ritualisticactions.(...)Rather, the characteristic feature of ritualistic action is not at all a view, an opinion,whether true or false, although an opinion--a belief--can itself be ritualistic or part of arite. (RFGB I)
The sheer diversity of the various angles we have considered in this chapter so far might beoverwhelming to the reader. The crux of our argument entailsthat thisdiversityisabsolutelynecessary, should anyone wish to provide a perspicuous presentation of the complex,multi-scale phenomenon called religion, without particularly favouring any particular level ofdescription (“we must plough through the whole of language”, RFGB I). The human mind’sreductive tendencies will favour latching onto a particular level (e.g., genetic,neurodevelopmental, affective, cognitive, social) andpushfor theeliminationof other levelsofdescription by subsuming all their explanatory power under one’s current favourite. Forexample, constructivists argue that almost everything we do is socially constructed, whilenativists argue that almost everything we do is innate. The conceptual toolbox of complexsystems theory

Complex Systems Theory (CST), as a formalism, iswidely known for rejectingthe machine vocabularyof processing devices,programs, storage units, schemata, modules…We substitute,instead, a vocabulary suited to fluid, organic systems, withcertain thermodynamic properties”(Thelen and Smith,1996, p. Xix, emphasis added). Complex systems aresystems composedof many interacting elements, which makes them extremely rich dynamical systems showing a huge range of phenomena withproperties that arise from these relationships, such asnonlinearity,emergence,spontaneous order,adaptation,andfeedbackloops, among others.

Friston’s notion of Markov blankets was developed toformalise how interactions between internal and external states of any particular system(or“particle”) are mediated by its “blanket states”. Oftentimes, theseblanket statescanbefurtherdecomposedintosensorystates(thosethat regulateinwardinfluences)andactivestates(thosethat regulate outward influences).

Inparticular, Friston’smonograph(2019) demonstratestheprime importance of blanket states when moving to higher (i.e., slower, larger, morecoarse-grained) levels of description:

In the context of socio-cultural dynamics, furtherdevelopments of deep active inference have been made towards the simulation of epistemiccommunities (Albarracin et al., 2022) and cumulative culture (Kastel & Hesp, 2021).Inthelast-mentionedwork, Kastel &Hesp(2021) particularlyaimedtoincorporatetherelationtosubjectiveexperiencesaswell, simulating“culturaldynamics”alongwiththeaffectivedimension of valence(asderivedbyHespet al., 2021), whichcharacterisesthepositiveversusnegative subjective value associated with one’s experience. Within these simulations, thataffective quality was (partially) expressed by agents along with their content-specificexpressions, affording a degree of social contagion through (implicit) associative learning. Inother linesof work, deep-parametricactiveinferencehasshowntobeafruitful frameworkforcharacterising subjective experiences ranging fromattentional control andmeta-awarenessinthe context of meditative practice (Sandved-Smith et al., 2021) to altered sense of self andagency (Ciaunica et al., 2021). As such, it has been argued that this approach provides arelativelymodel-agnosticmethodologicalbasisforcomputationalphenomenologyofexperience(Ramstead et al., 2021). We do not intend to wade too far into the diverse and challengingfield(s) of consciousness research, but it is worthwhile noting that deep active inference hasbeen heralded as a framework with enough epistemic flexibility to provide researchers ofvarious backgrounds with acommonlanguageintheir effortstoweavetogether thevarietyofleadingtheoriesof consciousnessthat haveemerged, integratingtheevenmorediversearrayofassociated experimental findings (see, e.g., Barret, 2017; Saffron, 2020; Kirchhoff &Kiverstein,2020; Friston, Wiese, &Hobson, 2020; Deane, 2021; Ciaunica, Saffron, &Delafield-Butt, 2021;Vilas, Auksztulewicz, &Melloni, 2021; Whyte, Howhy, &Smith, 2022;Seth&Bayne, 2022;foranexample of popular science literature, see Seth, 2021).Although we are not presenting newsimulation work in thischapter contribution, forthe sake of clarity we will illustrate how these strands of research could be integrated toformulateagenerativemodel that characterisesbothreligiouspracticeandexperience, albeitinan inevitably simplified manner, in relation to the four aspects of religion described in ourintroduction: self-relation, salvation, devotion, and veneration.

Itshould be noted that the highest embedding level (“Context”, green in Figure 2) is ofteninterpreted as implicit, “precognitive”, andusuallychangingonlyslowly(if at all), indicativeofits mostly presuppositional nature. However, it can be directly affected and even exhibit fast,non-linear transitions, because everyunidirectional arrowinthisBayesiannetworkeffectivelycharacterises a bidirectional relationship between the variables (in contrast to theunidirectional bottom-upinfluencesthat aretypical of Modularityof theMind). For thesakeofour discussion, we will focus on explaining howit could be usedtointerpret eachof thefouraspects of religion highlighted in our introduction:
1. Self-relation(indicatedwith[1]inFigure2). Earlier, wedescribedhowdifferentreligionspropagate different ways of relating to ourselves. In a modelling context, thisfundamental aspect couldbeinterpretedascorrespondingtotheinitialstructureofthepotential statespacesandtheir relations, whichjointlycharacteriseagenerativemodel.This emergent notion of selfhood has been characterised as arising fromdialecticalattunement with one’s social environment (see, e.g., Bolis & Schilbach, 2020).2. Salvation. Secondly, we described how religions tend to assert a spiritual yearning ofhumankind and offer a solution of some form, often referred to as salvation. In amodellingcontext, thisaspectcouldbeinterpretedasconcernselection(see[2]inFigure2), becauseit involvesmodulatingthekindsofstatesthatanindividualwouldtendtobeconcernedwith, andthekindsof solutionstheymightconsider. Inotherwords, concernselection would be equivalent to setting target states and acceptable ways of gettingthere.3. Devotion. Thirdly, all religionsinvolvesomeformof personal devotiontoalargerwholethat isperceivedassacredandconsiderthisanintegralpartofsalvation. Inthiscontext,devotion could be seen as concern realisation (see [3] in Figure 2), as it is aboutimplementing one’s intentions associated with salvation. This process tends to becommunity-oriented in the form of communal devotion – a crucial link betweenindividual choices and group-level dynamics.4. Veneration.

It shouldbenotedthat, whilethegraphicalformofthis model exhibits a hierarchical embedding structure, it is neither strictly hierarchical norstrictly flat because it involves cross-layer connections that manipulate the relationsbetweenlayers (e.g., the dashed arrows). This kind of heterarchical structure is typical of complexadaptive systems exhibiting cross-scale metastability (or self-organised criticality) and henceresisting reduction to any particular level of description. For example, consider all thevariouschanges that would co-occur across these levels for someonewhoiscurrentlyconvertingtoaparticular religion (or deconverting, for that matter). Their forms of living would tend to beaffectedonvariouslevelsofdescription, noneofwhichcanbedisregardedifoneaimstoprovideaperspicuouspresentationof that (de-)conversionexperience. Assuch, whatwearepresentinghere (as summarised in Figure 2) is not an explanation of the phenomena of religiousexperiences and practices per se, but rather a tool that is supposed to aid researchers in thedevelopment of perspicuous presentations of this phenomenon.

Previouslywehavearguedthatreligiouspractices, likeanykindofenculturatedpractice, cannotbe appropriately judged as “erroneous” froma scientific perspective – unless such religiouspracticesspecificallyinvolvepractitioners“puttingforthatheory”, thuswadingintotheterritoryof scienceandexposingthemselvestoscientificscrutiny. Throughouttheworldandthroughoutwritten history, highly educated religious thinkers of various stripes have attempted to teachtheir fellow practitioners to avoid embedding obstinate claims about the natural world inessential religious doctrines. For example, even as early as 397 AD, Augustine (Confessions,Chapter 5, Section 5) wrote:
When I hear someone amongst my fellow believers expressing a mistaken opinionarisingfromtheir ignorancewithregardstothestudyofnature, Iregardwithtolerancethe person who entertains that notion. As long as they do not believe anythinginappropriateabout you, OLord, creator of all things, I donot seethat it harmsthemiftheyhappentobeignorantofstatesorpropertiesofthematerialworld. However, itdoesharmthemif theythinktheir viewformsanessentialpartofourdoctrineandfaith, andthey obstinately choose to continue making assertions about what they do not know.
In principle, the approach described in this short segment affords a peaceful coexistence ofscience and religion as enculturated practices, while alsohighlightingtheir potential pointsoffriction. For Augustine, it was tolerable (and probably inevitable) that people in his religiouscommunityexpressedperspectivesonnaturethat hehimself viewedasignorant, aslongas(1)their opinions were not expected to generate harmful consequences and (2) they would notassert their opinionsas“essential doctrine” intheir religiouspractices. Withrespecttothefirstpoint, if theconcept of harmwerebroadlyinterpretedinacommunitycontextonewouldneedto resort to complex ethical considerations (we will revisit this below). With respect to thesecond point, thereisnoneedtoresort tospeculationabout past societies(likeFrazer; RFGB)because there exist modern-day religious communities that have explicitly embellished theircore doctrines with particular claims about nature that directlycontradict converginglinesofscientific evidence. For example, young-earthcreationistsadheretoaspecificinterpretationoftheir Scripturesandassert that thephysical ageof planet earthmustbelessthan10,000years.These communities continue to reject well-established hypotheses that have accrued anoverwhelming amount of empirical andtheoretical support fromdecadesof scientificresearch

Althoughtheydifferwithregardtotheir attitudes toward what is considered “progress”, religions and science are bothrule-followingandcommunal innature(Harré, 2001; Bell, 1969). Bothrelyonspecial-purposelanguage games arising through many interactions between community members, but thecorresponding “goals” and “rules'' focus on different facets of life. Since the volume of thischapter does not allowus to do justice to a full-blown comparative analysis, wewill focusonsome obvious touchpoints between these different kinds of language games, the domain ofethics being a particularly pertinent one. Intersections have to be handled with special carebecause inadvertent mixingof gamesisguaranteedtoleadtoconfusionintheWittgensteiniansense. The field of ethics is a useful example that highlights both the symmetries and theasymmetries inherent to the coexistence of religion and science. On the one hand, suchcoexistenceallowspeoplewithdiverseopinionsaboutthenaturalworldtoenjoycommunioninreligious practices, as long as they conform to shared morals and religious doctrines. Forexample, doctors can participate in religious gatherings without first having to exorcise allerroneous beliefs about human body function. On the other hand, scientists with diversereligious and secular affiliations can – in principle – work together effectively on scientificresearch, as long as they adhere to common principles of science. However, scientificconducttends to be additionally constrained by moral principles and ethical considerations, whichthemselves are outside the purview of science and tend to be influenced by religiousconsiderations. Consider, for example, howembryonal research is constrained by the field ofbioethicsandmoral principlessuchasthesanctityoflife. Strikingaproperbalancebetweenthetensions generated by these fronts requires yet another kind of language game, one that hasbeentargetedbyethicists. Evenwhenmasteredtoperfection, theirgamewouldbeanextremelydelicate and frustrating one that requires balancing a perpetual tug-of-war between domainexperts, policymakers, politicians, and the general public to achieve (some degree of)convergenceondecidedlynon-scientificquestions(e.g., concerningtherelativeprioritisationofanimal welfare in scientific experiments). The resulting answers depend on (largelyincommensurable) scientificknowledgeandwill endupconstrainingscientificpractices, whileeachof the“players” (includingthescientists)willrequireguidancefromtheirindividualmoralprinciples (whether religiously motivated or not).

Thetouchpointsbetweenscienceandreligioncanbeinterpretedinlight of thegenerativemodel presented in Figure 2. Whenever possible, scientists aimto constrain themselves todevelop mechanistic models (orangeinFigure2) for what isobservable, quantifiable, testable,replicable, etcetera(blueinFigure2). Beyondadherencetoscientificprinciples(greeninFigure2), it doesnot prescribeanyparticular moral valuesor target states([2] inFigure2). However,given some variables of moral relevance and their relative importance (e.g., survival andrecovery rates, self-reported quality of life), science could help informimplementation([3] inFigure 2) and constrain its practices accordingly. Suchconsiderationsareparticularlyrelevantwhen considering the potential benefits of experimental studies and balancing themagainstexpectedcosts, anongoingchallengefor thefieldof ethics.
