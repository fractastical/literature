Listening can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, in which the brain forms internal models to integrate auditory
information in a complex interaction of bottom-up and top-down processes. We propose that individuals vary in their “prediction
tendency” and that this variation contributes to experiential differences in everyday listening situations and shapes the cortical
processing of acoustic input such as speech. Here, we presented tone sequences of varying entropy level, to independently quantify
auditory prediction tendency (as the tendency to anticipate low-level acoustic features) for each individual. This measure was then
used to predict cortical speech tracking in a multi speaker listening task, where participants listened to audiobooks narrated by a target
speaker in isolation or interfered by 1 or 2 distractors. Furthermore, semantic violations were introduced into the story, to also examine
effects of word surprisal during speech processing. Our results show that cortical speech tracking is related to prediction tendency. In
addition, we find interactions between prediction tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal in disparate brain regions.
Our findings suggest that individual prediction tendencies are generalizable across different listening situations and may serve as a
valuable element to explain interindividual differences in natural listening situations.
Key words: auditory processing; cortical speech tracking; interindividual differences; magnetoencephalography; predictive processing.
Introduction
Listening is a neurobiological challenge that requires a complex
interaction of bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance,
understanding speech in a noisy environment by bottom-up
input alone would be impossible because of the vast amount
of overlapping spectrotemporal information (
McDermott 2009).
In line with notions of the so-called predictive brain (Knill and
Pouget 2004; Friston 2010; Yon et al. 2019; Friston et al. 2021),
we assume that our brain is actively engaged when listening to
speech by fitting and testing experience-based internal models,
inferring which sound sources (“auditory objects”;Griffiths and
Warren 2004) are causing the neural activity patterns. This
process requires the constant generation of predictions that are
continuously compared with incoming bottom-up information.
We argue that interindividual differences in the tendency to use
predictions exist, and that these differences have consequences
for real-life listening experience such as speech perception.
Indeed,“normal”hearingindividualsvary considerablyintheir
abilitytounderstandspeechwithsomeevenreportingdifficulties
in everyday speech comprehension and communication (
Ruggles
etal.2011 ).Insearchofapredictoroflinguisticabilities,individual
differences in statistical learning, “a general capacity for picking
up regularities,” have already been proposed (for a review see
Siegelman et al. 2017). Crucially, however, statistical learning as
an individual capacity should be operationalized and precisely
whichofitscomponentsdrivetherelationshipbetweenstatistical
learning and linguistic performance remains unclear.We suggest
that the individual tendency to actively generate auditory predic-
tions might be one such factor. We propose that this tendency
can even be conceptualized as a “trait-like” disposition, following
a notion that has already been used to explain clinical psycholog-
ical conditions and disorders such as autism (
Sinha et al. 2014),
schizophrenia (Sterzer et al. 2018), and tinnitus (Sedley et al.
2016; Partyka et al. 2019). Although strong predictive tendencies
can promote illusory auditory perceptions (Powers et al. 2017),
overall they should be adaptive in listening situations as it has
been shown that speech-auditory cortex coupling is enhanced as
a function of stronger top-down signals (
Park et al. 2015). Here
we aim to establish empirically how interindividual variability in
“predictiontendency,”whichweoperationalizeasthetendencyto
preactivate sensory features of strong likelihood, contributes to
differences in speech processing.
Anothergoalofthecurrentstudyistodetailthecircumstances
under which strong prediction tendencies are particularly ben-
eficial for speech processing. Interindividual differences become
especially apparent in noisy situations, which are typical for nat-
ural environments (
Meyer et al. 2013). In the iconic cocktail party
situation multiple speech streams enter the auditory system, yet
only one is to be followed (
Oberfeld and Klöckner-Nowotny 2016).
This task gets increasingly challenging with increased interfering
noise, revealing and/or increasing interindividual differences in
listeningexperiences(
Wöstmannetal.2015 ).Regardlessofsignal-
to-noise ratio, it should be considered that even under opti-
mal conditions not all incoming sensory information is equally

predictable. Thus, how the relationship between prediction ten-
dency and speech processing depends on the predictability of the
speech input itself is another important question that needs to
be addressed. Although there are several neuroimaging studies
offering valuable insight into the effect of prior knowledge on
isolated sentences (
Di Liberto et al.2018) or target words (Sohoglu
et al. 2012), it has been questioned whether effects from con-
trolled manipulation generalize to natural, narrative language.
More recent studies, that investigated speech processing on a
continuous scale, also suggest an influential role of speech pre-
dictability in general (e.g. semantic context and word surprisal
(Brodericketal.2019 ;DonhauserandBaillet2020 ;Weissbartetal.
2020).
In the current study, we combined magnetoencephalographic
(MEG) data from 2 different paradigms in order to establish a link
between individual prediction tendency and speech perception:
(i) An adapted paradigm as used by
Demarchi et al. (2019),p r e -
senting tone sequences of varying entropy level (in the following
referred to as entropy modulation paradigm), which was used to
independentlyquantifyindividualpredictiontendency(fordetails
see
Fig. 1A–C). (ii) A multi speaker listening task to investigate
individual differences in cortical speech tracking (i.e. tracking of
the acoustic envelope, that is extracted from the audiofile and
used as a predictor to explain variance in the neural signal)
across different levels of background noise. We used natural,
continuous speech but also introduced rare semantic violations
by randomly replacing a limited set of words with target words
thatoccurredelsewhereinthesamestoryline(see
Fig. 1D–F).This
allowed us to investigate encoding of the acoustic envelope on a
continuousscaleaswellasonanindividualwordlevel(oflexically
identical stimuli), ensuring that effects of word surprisal cannot
be attributed to differences in bottom-up input.Our results show
that cortical speech tracking in perisylvian and inferior frontal
areas of both hemispheres is enhanced in individuals with strong
prediction tendency, which we define as the tendency to antic-
ipate auditory events of high probability. Furthermore, we find
spatially dissociable interactions between individual prediction
tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal.In sum,
thesefindingssuggestthatindividualpredictiontendenciesshow
considerable generalizability across different listening situations
and may serve as a valuable element to explain interindividual
differences in natural listening experience.
Methods
Subjects
In total 53 (21 male) subjects were recruited to participate in the
study,however4subjectsdidnotcomplete theexperimentdueto
technical difficulties,leaving a total number of 49 subjects (mean
age=26.31, range=19–40) for further data analysis. Originally
we aimed for a total of 60 participants to enable a meaning-
ful between-subject analysis, however due to unexpected coro-
navirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related restrictions and limited
accesstoourlaboratories wedecidedtostopmeasurements after
2 years before reaching the anticipated sample size.Participation
was compensated either monetarily or via course credits. All
participants were German native speakers and reported normal
hearing,whichwasconfirmedusingstandardpuretoneaudiome-
try.Participantsgavewritten,informedconsentandreportedthat
they had no previous neurological or psychiatric disorders. The

Stimuli
We used audio recordings of excerpts from German books and
short-stories (
Supplementary Table S1,see online supplementary
material).Intotal,6different,consistenttargetstories(à ∼10min)
and 18 distractor stories (à∼3 min) were recorded with a t.bone
SC 400 studio microphone and a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz.
Prior to recording, target stories were split into separate trials of
∼3–4 min (mean=3.46 min, range=3.05–4.07 min). In addition,
we randomly selected half of the nouns that ended a sentence
and replaced them with the other half to induce unexpected
semanticviolationswithineachtrial,resultingin2setsoflexically
identical words (N =79) that differed greatly in their contextual
probabilities (see
Fig. 1Ffor an example). All 6 target stories were
recorded twice, narrated by a different speaker (male vs. female).
The remaining 18 recordings were narrated by the same 2 speak-
ers (used as second female/male distractor speaker to a male/fe-
male target speaker,respectively) and 2 additional speakers (used
as first distractor speaker). Stimuli were presented in 6 blocks
containing 3 trials each, resulting in 3 male and 3 female target
speaker blocks for every participant (see section “Experimental
procedure”).
Experimental procedure
Before the start of the experiment, we performed standard
pure tone audiometry using the AS608 Basic (Interacoustics,
Middelfart, Denmark) to assess participants’ individual hearing
ability. Afterwards, participants’ individual head shapes were
assessed using cardinal head points (nasion and preauricular
points), digitized with a Polhemus Fastrak Digitiser (Polhemus)
at around 300 points on the scalp. For every participant MEG
sessions started with a 5-min resting state recording, after which
the individual hearing threshold was determined using a pure
toneof1,043Hz.Thiswasfollowedby2blocksofpassivelistening
to tone sequences of varying entropy level to quantify individual
prediction tendencies (see quantification of individual prediction
tendency) while participants watched a landscape movie. In the
main task,6 different stories were presented in separate blocks in
random order and with randomly balanced selection of the target
speaker (male vs. female voice). Each block consisted of 3 trials
with a continuous storyline, with each trial corresponding to 1
of 3 experimental conditions: a single speaker only,a 1-distractor
speaker, and a 2-distractor speaker condition (in the following:
0-dist, 1-dist, and 2-dist, see
Fig. 1D). The distractor speakers
were selected to be of the opposite sex of the target speaker
and were presented exactly 20 s after target speaker onset. All
stimuli were presented binaurally at equal volume for the left
andrightear(i.e.atphantomcenter).Participantswereinstructed
to attend to the first speaker and their understanding was tested
using comprehension questions (true vs. false statements) at the
end of each trial. Furthermore, participants indicated their task
engagementandtheirperceivedtask-difficultyona5-pointLikert
scale at the end of every trial.All stimuli were presented at 40-db
above the individual hearing threshold. In total, the experiment
lasted ∼3.5 h per participant (including MEG preparation time).

room (AK3b, Vacuumschmelze, Germany), was used to capture
magnetic brain activity with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz
(hardware filters: 0.1–3,300 Hz).The signal was recorded with 102
magnetometersand204orthogonallyplacedplanargradiometers
at 102 different positions.In a first step,a signal space separation
algorithm,implemented in the Maxfilter program (version 2.2.15)
provided by the MEG manufacturer, was used to clean the data
from external noise and realign data from different blocks to
a common standard head position. Data preprocessing was
performed using Matlab R2020b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA,
United States) and the FieldTrip Toolbox (
Oostenveld et al. 2010).
All data were filtered between 0.1 and 30 Hz (Kaiser windowed
finite impulse response filter) and downsampled to 100 Hz.
To identify eye-blinks and heart rate artifacts, 50 independent
components were identified from filtered (0.1–100 Hz), down-
sampled (1,000 Hz) continuous data of the recordings from the
entropy modulation paradigm and on average 3 components
were removed for every subject. Data of the entropy modulation

paradigm were epoched into segments of 1,200 ms (from 400 ms
before sound onset to 800 ms after onset). Multivariate pattern
analysis (see section “Quantification of individual prediction
tendency”) was carried out using the MVPA-Light package (Treder
2020).Single trial data from the main task were further projected
into source-space using LCMV spatial filters ( Van Veen et al.
1997). To compute these filters, anatomical template images
were warped to the individual head shape and brought into a
common space by co-registering them based on the 3 anatomical
landmarks (nasion, left, and right preauricular points) with a
standard brain from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI,
Montreal, Canada;Mattout et al. 2007). Afterwards, a single-shell
head model (Nolte 2003) was computed for each participant. As
a source model, a grid with 1-cm resolution and 2,982 voxels
based on an MNI template brain was morphed into the brain
volume of each participant. This allows group-level averaging
and statistical analysis as all the grid points in the warped grid
belong to the same brain region across subjects. Afterwards, the
data were temporally aligned with the corresponding features
from the audio material.
Quantification of individual prediction tendency
In the present study, we used an entropy modulation paradigm
where participants passively listened to sequences of 4 different
pure tones (f1: 440 Hz, f2: 587 Hz, f3: 782 Hz, and f4: 1,043 Hz,
each lasting 100 ms) during 2 separate blocks, each consisting
of 1,500 tones presented with a temporally predictable rate
of 3 Hz (adapted from
Demarchi et al. 2019). Entropy levels
(ordered/random) changed between the 2 blocks for half of
the participants and pseudorandomly every 500 trials within
each block for the other half, always resulting in a total of
1,500 trials per entropy condition. By design, the transitional
probabilities between tones varied according to the different
levels of entropy (ordered vs. random; see
Fig. 1A): While in an
“ordered” context certain transitions (hereinafter referred to as
forwardtransitions,i.e.f1 → f2,f2 → f3,f3 → f4,andf4 → f1)were
to be expected with a high probability of 75%,self-repetitions (e.g.
f1 → f1 and f2→ f2,...) were rather unlikely with a probability
of 25%. However, in a “random” context all possible transitions
(including forward transitions and self-repetitions) were equally
likely with a probability of 25%. As
Demarchi et al. (2019)showed
that preactivation of carrier-frequency related neural activity is
systematically enhanced within low entropy conditions, it can
be assumed that correct frequency-specific predictions about
upcoming events should only be generated for transitions of
high probability, i.e. (expected) forward transitions in an ordered
context. Within the same ordered context, the less expected
self-repetition trials should erroneously generate pre-stimulus
predictions about an upcoming tone in the expected forward
direction. As the tone instead is repeated, this expectation is
violated whichshouldthen lead to post-stimulusmodel updating
due to the unanticipated event. To test this assumption, we
used a multiclass linear discriminant analyzer (LDA) to decode
sound frequency from brain activity in a time-resolved manner.
To capture any prediction related neural activity, the classifier
was trained only on forward transition trials of the ordered
condition (and thus “predictable” trials) and then tested on
self-repetition trials of both entropy conditions. This resulted
in classifier decision values (dvals) for every possible sound
frequency (d1, d2, d3, and d4) of all test trials (t) which were
then transformed into corresponding transitions with respect to
the preceding sound (t − 1) (e.g. d1(t)|f 1 (t − 1) “dval for f1 at
trial t given that f1 was presented at trialt − 1” → repetition,
d2(t)|f 1 (t − 1) → forward,...). This was done for test trials of
the ordered and the random entropy condition separately (see
Fig. 1C). Resulting classifier decisions for a forward transition
vs. a repetition in each repetition trial were contrasted for every
time-point from −0.3 to 0.3 s. Then, the average forward-vs.-
repetition tendency over trials was zero-centered (resulting in
positive values for a forward and negative values for repetition
decision) and compared between entropy conditions (tested on
ordered vs. tested on random repetitions; see
Fig. 1B). Since
the classifier is trained on forward transitions only, bottom-up
representations of the preceding sound, which fall within the
pre-stimulus interval of interest,also result in strongest dvals for
a forward transition (i.e. “carry-over classification effect,” which
is visible for both conditions as in
Fig. 1B). Since we have the
same transitions (self-repetitions) in both conditions, we ensure
an equal carry-over effect across conditions, which enables us to
isolate pre-stimulus prediction effects by contrasting “ordered”
vs. “random.” Thus, we quantified “prediction tendency” as the
classifiers pre-stimulus decision in favor of a forward transition
in an ordered compared with a random context (see
Fig. 1B).
Analogously, we further quantified “updating tendency” as the
post-stimulus decision tendency towards the actually presented
repetition transition (again for ordered > random). Using the
summed difference across time (pre-stimulus for prediction and
post-stimulus for model updating) one value can be extracted
per individual subject. Note that condition contrasting was
also applied to ensure that individual differences in prediction
tendency cannot be explained by subject specific signal-to-noise
ratio (as no vacuous difference in SNR is to be expected between
conditions). In addition, we used frequency decoding accuracy as
a control variable to correlate with speech tracking variables of
interest (see Supplementary material).
Encoding of acoustic features
Firstly, the speech envelope was extracted from the audio files of
the target speaker using the Chimera toolbox (Smith et al. 2002)
over a broadband frequency range of 100 Hz–10 kHz (in 9 steps,
equidistant on the tonotopic map of auditory cortex, seeFig. 1E).
Afterwards,to quantify the neural representations corresponding
to the acoustic envelope, we calculated a multivariate temporal
response function (TRF) using the Eelbrain toolkit (
Brodbeck et al.
2021).A deconvolution algorithm (boosting;David et al.2007)w a s
applied to the concatenated trials of the clear speech condition
(0-dist) to estimate the optimal TRF to predict the brain response
from the speech envelope for each individual virtual channel in
source-space (2,982 voxels). The defined time-lags to train the
model were from−100 to 500 ms. To evaluate the model, the 0-
dist data was split into 4 folds, and a cross-validation approach
was used to avoid overfitting (
Ying 2019). Furthermore, the same
model was used to deconvolve speech envelope and brain data of
the other 2 conditions (1-dist and 2-dist). The resulting predicted
channelresponsesforallconditionswerethencorrelatedwiththe
true channel responses in order to quantify the model fit and the
degree of speech envelope tracking in a particular brain region.
To investigate the effect of semantic violations the whole data
was segmented into single word epochs of 2 s starting at word
onset (using a forced-aligner;
Kisler et al. 2017; Schiel and Ohala
1999) and grouped into 3 different categories: high surprisal, low
surprisal controls (see section Stimuli or Fig. 1Ffor an exam-
ple), and all remaining. Words were then concatenated within
eachcategory(anddistractorcondition)beforedeconvolutionwas
applied and a speech envelope encoding model was estimated
from the remaining words category in the clear speech condition
6612 | Cerebral Cortex, 2023, Vol. 33, No. 11
(0-dist). Using the same time-lags (−100 to 500 ms) as in the
standardanalysis,theoptimalTRFswerethenusedtotestspeech
envelopeencodingforhighsurprisalwordsand(lexicallyidentical
low surprisal) controls respectively (again for each individual
virtual channel in source-space).
Statistical analysis
To investigate the influence of individual prediction tendencies
on speech tracking under different noise conditions, we used
Bayesian multilevel regression models with Bambi (
Capretto
et al. 2022 ), a python package built on top of the PyMC3
package (Salvatier et al. 2016) for probabilistic programming.
The correlation between predicted brain activity from speech
envelope encoding and true brain activity was used as dependent
variable,andseparatemodelswerecalculatedpervoxelusingthe
followingformulaaccordingtotheWilkinsonnotation(
Wilkinson
and Rogers 1973):
cortical tracking∼ n_distractors ∗ prediction_tendency +(1|subject_id).
To investigate the influence of higher-level probabilistic structure
of speech, we also calculated a model for which the depen-
dent variable only included cortical tracking (i.e.speech envelope
encoding) results of lexically identical nouns of high vs. low
surprisal:
cortical tracking∼ n_distractors ∗ word-surprisal ∗ prediction_tendency
+(1|subject_id).
Before entering the models, prediction_tendency was zero-
centered (note that in these interaction models other predictors
are assumed to be zero to estimate effects of one predictor) and
the number of distractors (0–2) was treated as a continuous
variable. As priors we used the weakly- or non-informative
default priors of Bambi (
Capretto et al. 2022) and specified a
more robust Student-T distribution as response distributions
instead of the default gaussian distribution. For a summary of
model parameters we report regression coefficients and 94% high
density intervals (HDI; the default HDI in bambi) of the posterior
distribution. From the HDIs we can conclude that there is a
94% probability that the respective parameter falls within this
interval given the evidence provided by the data,prior and model
assumptions.Effects were considered significantly different from
zero if the HDI did not include zero. Furthermore, it was ensured
that for all models there were no divergent transitions (
ˆr < 1.05
forallrelevantparameters)andaneffectivesamplesize > 400(an
exhaustive summary of bayesian model diagnostics can be found
in Vehtari et al. 2021). Since separate models were calculated
per voxel, to further reduce the possibility of spatially spurious
results,voxelswereonlyconsideredassignificantifaminimumof
2 significant neighbors could be detected.Subsequently,posterior
distributions were aggregated over voxels that formed a valid
cluster (in that sense) to report and plot summary statistics for
each effect. Labels for all voxels were obtained using a template
atlas (
Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2002).
Due to an error in the experimental code that resulted in loss
of data on accuracy for true vs. false statements, we were not
able to investigate listening comprehension on a behavioral level.
To investigate the influence of background noise and individual
prediction tendency on subjective perception we calculated 2
bayesian multilevel models using the following formulas:
difficulty ∼n_distractors ∗ prediction_tendency + (1|subject_id).
engagement ∼n_distractors ∗ prediction_tendency +(1|subject_id).
As dependent variables we used perceived task-difficulty as well
as self-reported engagement (mean subjective ratings over blocks
on a 5-point likert scale).
Results
Quantifying individual prediction tendencies
Firstly, we used an entropy modulation paradigm to quantify the
individual prediction tendency, which we define as the tendency
topreactivatesoundfrequenciesofhighprobability(i.e.aforward
transition from one tone to another: i.e. f1→ f2, f2→ f3, f3→ f4,
and f4 → f1). To estimate this tendency we trained a classifier
(LDA) to decode sound frequencies from brain activity in ordered
forward trials, in order to capture any prediction related neural
activity.Afterwards,the classifier was tested on all self-repetition
trials, providing classifier decision values for every sound fre-
quency, which were then transformed into corresponding transi-
tions (e.g. d1(t)|f 1 (t − 1) “dval forf1 at trialt given thatf1 was
presented at trialt − 1” → repetition, d2(t)|f 1 (t − 1) → forward,
...). Within an ordered context the unexpected self-repetition
trials should erroneously generate pre-stimulus predictions for
an upcoming tone in the expected forward direction (in a similar
fashion as in ordered forward trials), which then lead to post-
stimulus model updating due to the unanticipated repetition
event. The tendency to represent a forward-vs.-repetition transi-
tionwascontrastedforbothorderedandrandomtrials.Usingself-
repetitiontrialsfortesting,weensuredafaircomparisonbetween
the ordered and the random context (with an equal number of
trials as well as the same preceding bottom-up input). Thus, we
quantified “prediction tendency” as the classifier’s pre-stimulus
tendency to a forward transition in an ordered context exceeding
the same tendency in a random context (which can be attributed
to carry-over processing of the preceding sound).
Results for quantification of individual prediction tendencies
are shown in Fig. 2. We find a clear pre-stimulus tendency to
predict a forward transition during repetition trials in the ordered
condition, which exceeds the carry-over effect (seeFig. 2). How-
ever,thedatashowsnovisibledifferenceinthepost-stimuluscor-
rection for the actually presented repetition between an ordered
andarandomcontext.Itispossiblethatourclassifierwasunable
to identify or use any activity related to prediction violations,
as it was trained only on trials, for which the outcome was as
predicted (i.e. ordered forward trials). A different approach (e.g.
to train on ordered repetition trials) might be more appropriate to
capture post-stimulus differences in model updating tendencies.
Model updating quantification was therefore dropped and only
prediction tendency was used for further analysis.
Speech envelope encoding is modulated by
individual prediction tendency and background
noise
In order to investigate the relationship between individual pre-
diction tendencies and speech tracking, we used a multi speaker
listeningtask,where6differentstorieswerepresentedinseparate
blocks.Eachblockconsistedof3trialswithacontinuousstoryline,
with each trial corresponding to 1 of 3 experimental conditions:
a single speaker only, a 1-distractor speaker, and a 2-distractor
speaker condition (in the following: 0-dist, 1-dist, and 2-dist, see
Fig. 3A). The distractor speakers were always selected to be of
the opposite sex of the target speaker. We find an effect for the
number of distractors on self-reported difficulty, indicating that
the task is perceived more difficult as the number of distracting
speakers increases. This result confirms that our modulation of

Classifier tendencies showing frequency-specific prediction for tones with the highest probability (forward transitions) can be found even before
stimulus onset but only in an ordered context (shaded areas always indicate 95% confidence intervals). Using the summed difference across pre-
stimulus time, one prediction value was extracted per individual subject. B) Distribution of prediction tendency values across subjects (N =49).
the background noise achieves the desired effect.A more detailed
description of all subjective task ratings (along with figures and
summary statistics) can be found in the supplementary material.
We used Bayesian multilevel regression to predict cortical speech
envelope tracking (the correlation between predicted brain activ-
ity from speech envelope encoding and measured brain activity)
from the number of distractors (i.e. condition effect) as well as
from individual prediction tendency.
Firstly, we find a negative effect for the number of distractors
on envelope encoding in bilateral auditory areas ( b =−0.009,
94%HDI=[ −0.023, −0.002], see Fig. 3A). This indicates that
envelope encoding decreases with increasing noise for average
prediction tendency. Secondly, we find a positive effect for
prediction tendency in right perisylvian areas (namely inferior
frontal,precentral,andsuperiortemporalcortex) andleftinferior
frontal cortex (b =0.011, 94%HDI=[0.002, 0.025], see
Fig. 3B). This
suggests that individuals with stronger prediction tendency
show an increased envelope encoding in these areas. There
was also a negative effect for prediction tendency in the left
inferior temporal cortex (b =−0.008, 94%HDI=[−0.015, −0.001]).
Furthermore, our results indicate a positive interaction effect

To show that the relationship between prediction tendency
and the encoding of speech features cannot merely be explained
through individual differences in signal-to-noise ratio or differ-
ences in task engagement we also calculated “control models.”
One model includes the individual decoding accuracy (of sound
frequenciesintheentropymodulationparadigm)asanadditional
predictor and the other model includes subjective task engage-
ment ratings. We find that individual decoding accuracy itself
cannot predict envelope encoding. Furthermore, the HDI of the
beta coefficients for individual decoding accuracy does not over-
lapwiththatofpredictiontendency(
Supplementary Table S2,see
online supplementary material). The same applies to subjective
task engagement (
Supplementary Table S3, see online supple-
mentary material). We therefore conclude that speech tracking
effects cannot be explained by differences in pure tone decoding
or differences in individual task engagement. In sum, our results
suggest an important,albeit differential role of individual predic-
tion tendencies on speech envelope encoding.
Violations of semantic probability differentially

Inordertoinvestigatehowthebeneficialeffectofastrongpredic-
tion tendency on speech processing in general might be affected

prediction tendency (as well as all results in

theclearspeechconditiononly.Inadirectcomparisonoflexically
identicalwords,whichhavebeendifferentiallyembeddedintothe

for words of high surprisal vs. low surprisal in left perisylvian
cortex (b =0.024,94%HDI=[0.005,0.047],see Fig. 4A).We also find
a weak negative cluster showing a decreased encoding of sur-
prising words in bilateral supplementary motor areas (b =−0.017,
94%HDI=[ −0.031, −0.002], see Fig. 4A). For prediction tendency,
again there was an overall positive effect in right superior tem-
poral as well as bilateral inferior frontal cortex for encoding of
words of low surprisal (b =0.020,94%HDI=[0.004,0.041]).Further-
more, there was a left lateralized positive interaction between
word surprisal and prediction tendency, indicating an increase in
encoding of surprising words with increased prediction tendency
inleftangulargyrus( b =0.017,94%HDI=[0.004,0.032],see
Fig. 4B).
Vice versa, we find a right lateralized negative interaction in
mid occipital and superior frontal cortex, indicating that, with
increased prediction tendency, encoding of surprising words is
decreased whereas encoding of unsurprising words seems to be
increased in these areas (b =−0.018, 94%HDI=[−0.033, −0.003],
see
Fig. 4B). In addition, our results also show an effect for the
number of distracting speakers along with several interaction
effects with noise,which are all listed inSupplementary Table S3

along with the aforementioned interaction effects seem to dimin-
ish with increasing noise. We therefore conclude that the inter-
action between the influence of word surprisal and individual
prediction tendency on encoding is negligible under conditions of
high background noise. Instead, we focus our interpretation on
the interaction effects of word surprisal and prediction tendency
with respect to the clear speech condition.
Discussion
Based on previous research emphasizing the ubiquity of the
predictive brain, the aim of the current study was to investigate
the supportive role of strong prediction tendencies in everyday
situationssuchaslistening.Weproposealinkbetweenindividual
auditory prediction tendency and differences in the processing of
spoken language. Across 2 independent paradigms, we con-
nected the individual tendency to preactivate expected sound
frequencies to the individual encoding of continuous narrative
speechunder varyingconditions of background noise.Our results
demonstrate that speech tracking is related to individual
prediction tendency. Furthermore, manipulating contextual
predictability of speech by including rare semantic violations
allowed us to investigate how this in itself beneficial effect is
affected by unpredictable events,showing spatially differentiable
interactions.
Speech tracking is related to individual
prediction tendencies
Prediction tendency is often conceptualized as an individual
trait, a tendency that varies considerably across individuals
and generalizes across situations, and that could be linked to
psychiatric disorders such as autism (
Pellicano and Burr 2012)
and schizophrenia (Corlett et al. 2019). Taking into account its
explanatory value for such long-term and highly individualized
disorders, predictions have worked their way from feedback
connections carrying expected lower-level neural activity (Rao
and Ballard 1999) to an individual disposition that forms one
of many core dimensions of personality. Here we make no such
claim, but we strongly suggest that more emphasis is put on
the investigation on the intra-individual stability of prediction

regarding statistical learning). Furthermore, our findings that it

engagement(asshowninourcontrolmodelinthesupplementary
material), or (iv) attention (as we are currently investigating by
using the same paradigm under different conditions of attention;
Demarchi et al. in prep.) favor the general assumption of a “trait”
as compared with a “state” dependent measure. So far strong
predictive tendencies have been linked to maladaptive auditory
phantom perception (e.g. hallucinations and tinnitus, see
Corlett
et al.2019 and Sedley et al.2016).However,the beneficial aspects
of prediction tendencies in complex listening situations have
received little scientific attention.
Our findings show that the tendency to anticipate low-level
acoustic features according to their contextual probability is
positively related to the cortical tracking of the speech envelope.
Tracking of information conveyed by the speech envelope is
critical for speech comprehension and the processing of low-
level linguistic features (
Vanthornhout et al. 2018; Schmidt et al.
2021). This suggests a potentially supportive role of the tendency
to anticipate low-level acoustic features on the processing of
naturally spoken language. Expectedly, this effect is most
prominent in areas associated with auditory processing and
speech perception such as inferior frontal as well as temporal
regionsoftherighthemisphere,butalsoinBroca’sareaoftheleft
cortex (see
Fig. 3B).To our knowledge,this is the first study to link
speechtrackingcapabilitiestoindividualdifferencesinprediction
tendency. This finding becomes all the more remarkable as
our quantification of prediction tendency stems from a very
different auditory paradigm that was completely independent of
speech processing. Therefore, we can infer some generalizability
of individual prediction tendencies across different listening
situations. Most importantly, we argue that this link cannot be
explained by individual signal-to-noise ratio or other attributes
(such as linearity and distributive properties) that are known
to have an influence on the performance of classification and
encoding algorithms. Firstly, prediction tendency is quantified
as the difference in anticipatory predictions between conditions
(thus uninformative idiosyncrasies in feature decodability are
canceled out) and secondly, we find that individual decoding
accuracy (of sound frequencies in the entropy modulation
paradigm) itself cannot predict envelope encoding. Further-
more, the HDI of the beta coefficients for individual decoding
6616 | Cerebral Cortex, 2023, Vol. 33, No. 11
accuracy does not overlap with that of prediction tendency
(Supplementary Table S2, see online supplementary material).
Furthermore, by including subjective ratings of task engagement
into our control model ( Supplementary Table S3, see online
supplementary material), we can show that the relationship
between individual prediction tendency and speech encoding
cannotbeexplainedbyindividualdifferencesintaskengagement.
The effect of prediction tendency on speech
tracking decreases as background noise
increases
Regarding how the beneficial effect of prediction tendency on
speechenvelopetrackingisaffectedbybackgroundnoise,wefind
evidenceforadualisticeffectshowingaclear lateralization.More
precisely,wefindthattheextenttowhichpredictiontendencycan
explain speech tracking within the right hemisphere decreases
withanincreasingnumberofdistractingspeakers.Thus,showing
the strongest effect of prediction tendency on speech tracking
while speech is clearly understandable. When simultaneously
confronted with multiple speakers at a real cocktail party, the
distracting speech streams are often spatially separable from the
target stream, but in situations when a spatial segregation is not
possible(forexampleinanonlinemeeting)speechintelligibilityis
heavilydecreased.Inourexperimentthetargetandthedistractor
streams were both presented at the phantom center, creating a
similar situation. It is possible that with decreased intelligibil-
ity in bottom-up input, predictive processes are impaired from
distortions in the auditory feedback-loop. The current results
support our assumption that differences in prediction tendency
canexplainthevariabilityinlisteningperformanceunderoptimal
conditions.
However,wealsofindaleftfrontalclusterthatshowsapositive
interaction between prediction tendency and background noise.
Looking at the slopes inFig. 3C, this seems to be the result of
a decrease in a negative effect of prediction tendency rather
than an increase of the positive prediction tendency effect with
noise. Thus, the extent to which the left inferior frontal cortex
is engaged in speech envelope tracking in individuals with lower
vs. stronger prediction tendencies seems to be dependent on
background noise (notably this interaction effect only partially
overlaps spatially with the reported main effect for prediction
tendency). One possible explanation is that differences in pre-
diction tendency may result in differential allocation of attention
depending on individual listening effort. For example,
Lesenfants
andFrancart(2020) foundthatattentionplaysacrucialroleinthe
cortical encoding of speech and showed an advanced encoding
in frontal & fronto-central electrodes with focal attention. So far,
differences in challenging listening situations with low signal-to-
noise ratio (such as in a cocktail party situation) have often been
linked to individual differences in selective attention (
Kerlin et al.
2010).Yet,wearguethatapredictivetheoryofindividuallistening
experience is not exclusive but rather complementary to that as
predictions are assumed to generate a selective attentional gain
to the expected sensory feature (e.g.Marzecová et al. 2018). It
seems possible that people allocate attention in a different or
more parsimonious way depending on their tendency to rely on
predictions.
An alternative (though not mutually exclusive) interpretation
isthatindividualswithweakerauditorypredictiontendencyhave
to rely more on the sensorimotor system to integrate acoustic
information during speech processing. The general idea is that
auditory processing is critically involved in speech production
and,viceversa,thatmotorprocesseshaveamodulatoryinfluence
on speech perception. An integrative model was proposed by
Hickok et al.(2011)in which the motor system promotes auditory
forward predictions as part of a sensory-to-motor feedback cir-
cuit.This in-built predictive capacity could play a role in support-
ing listening. Based on this, we speculate that individuals with a
strongertendencytogeneratepurelyauditorypredictionsareless
reliant on predictions from the motor system during clear speech
perception. This could be reflected in the observed decreased
tracking in left Broca’s area for individuals with stronger predic-
tion tendency. We suggest that future research should explore
the possibility of an interaction between individual prediction
tendency and the sensorimotor system during speech perception
in challenging listening situations.
Violations of semantic probabilities interact with
individual prediction tendencies
To test the influence of individual prediction tendencies on
changes in semantic probabilities during speech processing,
we compared speech envelope encoding between a subset of
surprising target words that are semantically unrelated to the
preceding context and their lexically identical counterparts for
which contextual predictability was not manipulated. Although
the benefits of using natural speech with no experimentally
induced manipulations have to be acknowledged, one remaining
disadvantage is the difficulty in separating top-down from
bottom-up influences. In narrative language the acoustic signal
is correlated with the higher-level information it conveys and any
alteration in speech envelope encoding may be attributed to both
aspects (
Brodbeck and Simon 2020).
Our results show an increased envelope tracking for surprising
words in the left perisylvian cortex. In previous decades, the
effects of surprise in speech perception has focused on event-
related potentials and the typical N400 component—a negativity
at 300–600 ms in central and/or parietal regions. It is well estab-
lished that unexpected stimuli raise a stronger response (or from
another perspective: expected stimuli evoke a reduced neural
response),buttherelativeinformationcontentoftheseresponses
is still debated (
de Lange et al. 2018). Our findings show consid-
erable spatial overlap with previous studies that have focused on
surprisal-evoked responses in speech perception (Willems et al.
2016; Frank and Willems 2017), complementing them in 2 ways.
Firstly,weprovideevidencethattheseresponsesarenotdrivenby
a rather unspecific error signal but instead actually encode infor-
mation about the surprising stimulus itself. Our results indicate
that the low-level acoustic representation is sharpened for high
compared with low surprisal and, importantly, that this sharpen-
ingisaconsequenceofcontextualunpredictabilityandcannotbe
explained by any differences in bottom-up input. Secondly, even
thoughtheimpactofpredictionsonspeechperceptionhaswidely
been emphasized (e.g.
Heilbron et al. 2022), the question of how
individual prediction tendency interacts with the processing of
semantic violations has, to the best of our knowledge, not been
investigated so far. Originally, we expected a disrupted encoding
of surprising words, scaling with individual prediction tendency.
Instead,we find a spatially dissociable interaction effect,indicat-
ing the expected interference for surprising words in right occipi-
tal and superior frontal regions on the one hand (or hemisphere),
but also an increased encoding of surprising words in left angular
gyrus with increased prediction tendency on the other.
In the current study, prediction tendency is operationalized
by the tendency to preactivate sound frequencies of high prob-
ability in a predictable context. Contextual predictability was
determined via a first-order markov chain (i.e. each subsequent
Juliane Schubertet al. | 6617
state depends only on the immediately preceding one). Human
language (although see Sainburg et al. 2019for an example in
birdsong) is assumed to follow a more complex,hierarchical non-
markovian structure (Chomsky 1956; Sainburg et al. 2019). The
current results show that lower-order predictions seem to be
relevant in the processing of acoustic speech. Furthermore in
continuous speech, predictions happen at a number of different
levels such as acoustic,syntactic,semantic etc...Here we focused
our analysis on acoustic (i.e. speech envelope) tracking, however,
the fact that prediction tendency seems to interact with seman-
tic predictability, independent of acoustics, indicates a potential
generalization to higher-order speech processes as well. Future
research should focus on the explanatory value of individual
prediction tendency for speech processing across all levels along
the linguistic hierarchy.
Limitations
There are several limitations to the interpretation of our results.
Firstly, using a regression model, we cannot draw any conclu-
sion on causality. Although the idea that individual prediction
tendencies influence cortical speech tracking is certainly one
compelling way to explain our results, we cannot rule out other
causal agents (such as cognitive abilities) or a reversed direc-
tionality. Secondly, we were not able to directly link prediction
tendencies to differences in behavioral task performance (due
to data loss) or to subjective listening experience. Although one
might argue that these variables are of considerable importance
for real-life implications, in the current study they are likely to
be biased by floor/ceiling effects (see supplementary material).
Thirdly,weknowthatauditorypredictionscanbecoarselydivided
into spectral and temporal predictions that are associated to
slightly different regions (e.g.
Auksztulewicz et al. 2018; Wollman
andMorillon2018 )andbothplayanimportant,albeitdifferential,
role for language perception and production (Forseth et al. 2020).
Here we demonstrate that spectral prediction tendency plays a
role in acoustic speech tracking, however, as the sound sequence
used to assess that tendency were highly rhythmic (with a fixed
rateof3Hz),wecannotinfertheextenttowhichthisrelationship
might be driven or modulated by temporal prediction tendency.
Finally,wedidonlyfocusononeacousticfeaturealthoughspeech
perception encompasses many more linguistic features (such as
formants, phonemes, syllables etc.), and even though we demon-
strated an effect of word surprisal on low-level encoding, we did
not investigate the tracking of such higher-level features directly.
Conclusion
We support the assumption that predictive processing is an ubiq-
uitous perceptual phenomenon and that it is crucial for continu-
ous speech perception. Furthermore, we argue that the tendency
toengageinthesepredictiveprocessesisdifferentfromindividual
to individual and that this variability can explain differences
in listening experience. Importantly, individual prediction ten-
dency can be assessed independently of the speech perception
it facilitates, thus we can infer some generalizability of auditory
predictions across different listening situations.
