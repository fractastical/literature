Abstract: Understanding and promoting subjective wellbeing (SWB) has been the topic of 
increasing research, due in part to its potential contributions to health and productivity. To date, 
the conceptualization of SWB has been grounded within social psychology and largely focused on 
self-report measures. In this paper, we explore the potentially complementary tools and theoretical 
perspectives offered by computational neuroscience, with a focus on the active inference (AI) 
framework. This framework is motivated by the fact that the brain does not have direct access  to 
the world; to select actions, it must instead infer the most likely external causes of the sensory input 
it receives from both the body and the external world. Because sensory input is always consistent 
with multiple interpretations, the brain’s intern al model must use background knowledge, in the 
form of prior expectations, to make a “best guess” about the situation it is in and how it will change 
by taking one action or another. This best guess arises by minimizing an error signal representing 
the dev iation between predicted and observed sensations given a chosen action —quantified 
mathematically by a variable called free energy (FE). Crucially, recent proposals have illustrated 
how emotional experience may emerge within AI as a natural consequence of t he brain keeping 
track of the success of its model in selecting actions to minimize FE. In this paper, we draw on the 
concepts and mathematics in AI to highlight  how different computational strategies can be used 
to minimize FE—some more successful ly than others. This affords a characterization of how 
diverse individuals may adopt unique strategies for achieving high SWB . It also highlights novel 
ways in which SWB could be effectively improved. These considerations lead us to propose a novel 
computational framework for understanding SWB. We highlight several parameters in these 
models that could explain individual and cultural differences in SWB, and how they might inspire 
novel interventions. We conclude by proposing a line of future empirical research based on 
computational modelling that could complement current approaches to the study of wellbeing and 
its improvement.

1. Introduction 
Understanding and improving subjective wellbeing (SWB) is important in promoting resilience, 
social support, physical health and longevity, work performance, and broader contributions to 
society (De Neve et al., 2013; Diener et al., 2017) . Previous research has shown that individuals 
reporting higher SWB tend to be healthier and live longer, due in part to more frequent 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   103 
engagement in health behaviors (Danner et al., 2001; Diener & Chan, 2011; Lyubomirsky et al., 
2005; Steptoe & Wardle, 2011) . They also have more successful marriages  (Lucas et al., 2003; 
Luhmann et al., 2013) , more friendships  (Moore et al., 2018) , and both greater reported job 
satisfaction and better job performance (Borman et al., 2001; Tenney et al., 2016). In addition, they 
return to healthy emotional states more quickly after negative life events (Fredrickson et al., 2003). 
Although much of the research in this area is correlational, there are also established mechanisms 
through which emotional health can promote physical health  (Slavich & Irw in, 2014) , and 
arguments can be made that causal influences between each of the aforementioned measures are 
synergistic and bidirectional (Diener et al., 2018). 
To date, the primary measures used to study SWB —and which have led to the important 
findings discussed above—are based on self-report (Diener et al., 1985; Diener et al., 2018; Diener 
et al., 2010; Pavot et al., 1991; Sandvik et al., 1993; Weziak -Bialowolska et al., 2021) . In a few 
studies, this approach has been supplemented with other methods, such as third -party reports 
from friends, family, and co -workers, with results supporting convergent validity (Pavot et al., 
1991; Sandvik et al., 1993; Schimmack & Oishi, 2005; Schneider & Schimmack, 2009) ; for other 
work supporting combinations of self -report and quantitative measures (e.g., the Human 
Development Index), see (Anand & Sen, 1992; Sen, 1985) . In a small number of studies, report -
based SWB measures have also been associated with objective measures such as smiling intensity 
(Seder & Oishi, 2012), the emotional valence of word choice (Schwartz et al., 2013), and peripheral 
physiological measures of stress and health (Steptoe et al., 2005). There have also been efforts to 
improve SWB through interventions focused on exercise, mindfulness, and/or metacognitive 
training (reviewed in (Varshney & Barbey, 2021)). However, conventional descriptive approaches 
within SWB research have been limited in their ability to provide insights beyond associations 
between variables of interest.  As such, the mechanistic and biobehavioral basis of SWB remains 
poorly characterized and our understanding could be greatly advanced by applying 
complementary approaches in neighboring fields.  
One promising set of complementary approaches comes from computational neuroscience, 
and its clinically-focused sister discipline of computational psychiatry. Various lines of work in 
these fields have focused on understanding the mechanistic basis of individual differences in both 
pathological and sub-clinical levels of emotional symptoms—such as depression/anxiety and the 
way they interfere with overall life functioning —with clear connections to differences in SWB 
(Friston et al., 2014; Huys et al., 2016; Montague et al., 2012) .  Computational approaches focus 
on mathematical models of brain processes to explain complex patterns of learning/behavior and 
may therefore offer a complementary approach for improving understanding of the 
neurocognitive mechanisms underlying previ ously observed differences in SWB based on self -
report.  
As we will describe further below, these approaches may offer at least two specific 
advantages to the field of SWB research. One is that they facilitate construction of general theories 
with broad ex planatory power. For example, constructivist and descriptive perspectives have 
highlighted how conceptualizations of emotion and wellbeing can differ based on cultural and 
historical context (Barrett, 2017; Lomas et al., 2021). However, once such differences are identified, 
conventional descriptive approaches in SWB research may have difficulty explaining why these 
differences exist. In contrast, if knowledge of the more general neurocomputational processes

Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   104 
underlying cognition and behavior can be incorporated, the origin of such differences may be 
accounted for within a single model (e.g., based on specific learning mechanisms or inference 
processes). A second advantage is that mathematical models of cognition offer an additional type 
of predictive ability. This is because they allow for quantitative simulation of non -trivial 
counterfactual changes in cognition/behavior under different circumstances. For example, one 
could simulate (and therefore predict) how someone would act if  they were to have one set of 
experiences vs. another or if they were to have one set of beliefs vs. another. The predictions that 
emerge from such simulations can then be evaluated empirically. In turn, experimental results 
can refine available models before further rounds of simulation, prediction, and testing—forming 
in an iterative process of data -driven improvement of current theories. Importantly, this 
simulation approach can also be applied to hypothetical interventions. Namely, mathematical 
models can be used to simulate the outcomes of a proposed intervention and then studies can test 
whether the predicted outcomes occur. 
Motivated by these possible advantages, in this paper we will first provide a brief 
introduction to computational approaches for wellbeing researchers and social psychologists 
who do not have background in this area. We describe the mathematics at a conceptual level and 
provide thorough explanation of any equations shown. We then discuss how computational 
approaches might yield nove l lines of research on SWB. While we will touch upon multiple 
computational models, we focus primarily on the active inference framework and the additional 
resources it may offer, including: 1) novel theoretical conceptualizations of SWB, and 2) 
additional analytic tools that could be used to advance empirical research on the mechanisms and 
determinants of SWB (and behaviors that promote SWB) . As we describe in more detail below, 
this approach affords behavioral measures of individual differences in  a range  of 
neurocomputational processes, including those underlying flexibility in the future-directedness 
of planning, motivation to seek out information, beliefs about environmental predictability, the 
influence of expectation on perception, and the sophistication with which individuals understand 
emotions, among others. Gathering such information will allow assessment of the mechanisms 
contributing to differences in SWB and could inspire novel interventions for improving SWB by 
targeting those mechanisms. 
 
2. Computational approaches and conceptual links to wellbeing 
2.1 Reinforcement learning 
One widely established branch of computational neuroscience is reinforcement learning (RL). 
Within RL, it is assumed that individuals make decisions to maximize expected reward. One way 
they can do so is by maintaining an internal model of the world (so -called “model-based” RL), 
and using that model to plan the sequence of actions that would maximize cumulative reward 
(this type of internal model can also be used  to facilitate learning through internal simulation; 
(Sutton & Barto, 1998)). Because model-based RL is computationally expensive (and in some cases 
intractable), many applications have instead focused on “model -free” RL, where individuals 
learn by trial-and-error without making explicit predictions about the future situations that will

arise1. Instead, they simply learn an expected reward value for each possible action in a given 
situation and then choose the action with the highest expected value (often with a certain amount 
of randomness built in). Learning in these models is ba sed on so -called “reward prediction 
errors” (RPEs). Briefly, when the expected reward following an action does not match observed 
reward, this mismatch (prediction error) updates the expected reward value of that action 
(increasing it if better than expected, decreasing it if worse than expected). We can calculate this 
prediction error as follows: 
 
𝑅𝑃𝐸 = 𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 − 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 
 
The expected reward of the action that led to the RPE is then updated based on the following rule: 
 
𝑁𝑒𝑤 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 = 𝑂𝑙𝑑 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 + (𝑅𝑃𝐸 × 𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒) 
 
Here the learning rate is a value that controls how strong the change in expected reward is after 
each RPE. In tasks expected to have stable reward probabilities, learning rates should be low 
(since unexpected rewards may just be low -probability events). In contrast, if reward 
probabilities are expected to change every so often (i.e., the environment is “volatile”), learning 
rate should be high, since unexpected rewards are more likely to indicate that the underlying 
reward probabilities have changed. If one can quantify an individual’s learning rate, this may 
therefore provide information about how stable/predictable they expect the worl d to be (e.g., a 
low learning rate would entail the belief that previously learned action-outcome probabilities are 
unlikely to change). 
To date, some work within the RL framework has linked emotional states and moods with 
patterns of recent rewards and RPEs (Blain & Rutledge, 2020; Eldar & Niv, 2015; Eldar et al., 2018; 
Eldar et al., 2016; Mason et al., 2017; Rutledge et al., 2014, 2015; Vanhasbroeck et al., 2021) . For 
example, greater momentary happiness during reward learning tasks has been associated with 
stronger positive RPEs in recent trials (Rutledge et al., 2014; Vanhasbroeck et al., 2021) . This 
relation to momentary happiness also appears to be related to how surprising a reward is, rather 
than the magnitude of reward per se; (Blain & Rutledge, 2020)). That is, individuals report greater 
momentary increases in happiness if they are more surprised that a reward was received. 
Individuals also report greater momentary happiness in probabilistic learning tasks with more 
stable/predictable reward probabilities (i.e., those with lower volatility), whereas tasks in which 
probabilities change unpredictably are instead associated with greater self -reported negative 
emotion and stress (Blain & Rutledge, 2020; de Berker et al., 2016). This line of work has therefore 
provided important insights. However, these studies have focused primarily on momentary 
happiness, as opposed to the computational basis of general life satisfaction or overall life 
functioning. Thus, more research is needed to understand the relationship between t hese 
computational reward learning processes and established SWB measures. 
 
 
1 There are also several hybrid or intermediate algorithms that have been proposed, such as two-system architectures (where model-
based and model-free systems cooperate/compete) and successor representation algorithms, among others (e.g., appealing to the 
role of long-term memory).

2.2 Active inference 
Another conceptually rich computational framework, which we focus on here, is active inference 
(AI; see Figure 1 below). This framework describes how individual s select sequences of actions 
(called “policies”, denoted by the variable 𝜋) based on their expected sensory consequences (often 
called observations or outcomes, denoted by the variable 𝑜). These observations can include 
rewards as well as other sensory inputs capable of reducing uncertainty about the underlying 
states of the world that must be inferred (denoted by the variable 𝑠) (Smith, Friston, et al., 2022). 
For example, hearing a barking sound (observation) may allow one to infer that a dog is most 
likely nearby (state), although one cannot see the dog directly. Unlike model-free RL, this type of 
decision process requires the brain to maintain an internal model of the world that can simulate 
predicted patterns of observations under different possible actions. It can then select the actions 
expected to generate the most preferred/informative outcomes. Crucially, behavior will quickly 
become maladaptive if predictions become inaccurate. Therefore, the brain’s internal model must 
also be continually updated and revised in light of new sensory input. The AI framework suggests 
that this is accomplished by finding an updated set of beliefs after each observation tha t 
minimizes prediction error. Unlike RL, however, this is not an RPE. Instead, this more general 
prediction error can reflect a deviation between any predicted and observed sensory input. 
Importantly, however, there are typically multiple sets of new belie fs that could minimize 
prediction error, which means some further criterion is also needed to select among those 
possibilities. This criterion corresponds to parsimony; namely, beliefs should minimize 
prediction error while also changing as little as possible. Put another way, the brain should identify 
the simplest possible (or least “complex”) change in belief that is necessary.  
To capture this, AI formally models the brain as seeking to minimize a quantity called 
variational free energy (VFE), which represents a trade-off between minimizing prediction error 
and minimizing the complexity of change in belief. Without introducing the detailed 
mathematics, we can represent this as: 
 
𝑉𝐹𝐸 = 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 + 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 
 
Importantly, previous literature has suggested that negative emotion may be a consequence of a 
chronic failure to successfully minimize VFE (or simply prediction error; e.g., see (Barrett et al., 
2016; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013; Stephan et al., 2016)). This suggests that successful minimization of 
this quantity could also correspond to high SWB. However, this has not been empirically tested 
(although we discuss studies that have tested related hypotheses below). 
While VFE relates beliefs to current observations, selecting actions requires the prediction of 
future observations (“what will I observe if I do this or that?”). This means the brain must evaluate 
expected free energy (EFE; denoted by variable 𝐆 in Figure 1). Conceptually, minimizing EFE can 
be described as selecting actions e xpected to maximize both reward and information gain. This 
can be represented as: 
 
𝐸𝐹𝐸 = −𝐸𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑐 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 − 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑

Notes. Arrows denote asymmetric dependencies (e.g., the expected observation, 𝑜 , depends  on the 
underlying state of the world, 𝑠). The general notation 𝑝(𝑥) indicates the known probability for each 
possible value of some variable 𝑥, whereas 𝑞(𝑥) denotes an  approximation or “best guess” about those 
probabilities (also referred to as a “posterior” belief, because this guess is updated after one makes a new 
observation). The notation 𝑝(𝑥|𝑦) denotes the probability of each possible value of some variable 𝑥 after 
one has learned the value of some other variable 𝑦. See text for further explanation. As illustrated here, the 
underlying states of the world change over time, and the way they change can depend on one’s chosen 
sequence of actions (𝜋). Actions are chosen based on a combination of habits, the expected free energy, and 
beliefs about the reliability or “precision” of expected free energy (described further in the text). After each 
new observation, an individual can use this model to come up with a best guess about how the state of the 
world has changed (based on minimizing variational free energy or prediction error) and then select actions 
expected to maximize both reward and information gain (based on minimizing expected free energy). For 
a detailed walkthrough of the mathematics, see (Smith, Friston, et al., 2022). Minimizing both types of free 
energy can be conceptualized as maximizing SWB, and the success with which one does so will depend on 
the values of various parameters in the model. This is described further in the main text.  
 
Here, the “epistemic value” term refers to how much one’s uncertainty would be reduced by an 
expected observation (i.e., how much it would increase one’s confidence in the underlying state 
of the world). The consequence of this equation is that individuals who do not know how to reach 
their goals will first explore their environment to gain more information. Once uncertainty is 
resolved, actions will then become reward-seeking (i.e., seeking the observations with the highest

values encoded in the preference parameters within 𝐂 in Figure 1). Active inference models can 
also include other elements, such as learning rates, habits, and vola tility beliefs, among others 
(for a summary of relationships between AI and RL, see Table 1 below). However, their main 
distinguishing features from traditional  RL approaches are: 1) prediction error (VFE) 
minimization as the basis of perception (traditional RL models do not include perception), and 2) 
information-seeking during action selection (alt hough some more recent RL models have 
incorporated additional elements to drive strategic exploration; e.g., see (Gershman, 2018)). For a 
formal graphical depiction of active inference and some additional technical details, see Figure 1 
and the associated legend. For a detailed walkthrough of the mathematics, see (Smith, Friston, et 
al., 2022). 
Aside from the model structure depicted in Figure 1 , there are also related model 
architectures based on free energy minimization (i.e., minimization of prediction errors weighted 
by their estimated reliability), with a primary example being the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter 
(HGF; (Mathys et al., 2014) ). One advantage of the HGF is that it explicitly models volatility 
estimation (which then continuously updates learning rates after each new observation). In 
contrast, the simplest version of the AI architecture depicted in Figure 1  only includes static 
learning rates. However, there are extensions to standard AI architectures tha t can perform 
explicit volatility estimation as well (Sales et al., 2019). 
 
3. Potential relationships between free energy minimization and subjective wellbeing 
There are fairly straightforward theoretical connections between EFE and SWB. If an individual 
continually fails to attain preferred observations (i.e., if EFE estimates continually fail to promote 
actions that achieve those observations), this would suggest they have a poor model of the world 
and are unable to improve it —perhaps resulting in feelings of helplessness and lack of control 
associated with low SWB. Previous theoretical work has also shown how the brain may keep 
track of the reliability/precision of its own EFE estimates (i.e., the parameter 𝜸 in Figure 1). In this 
case, a belief that EFE estimates are unreliable would be expected to promote negative affect 
(Hesp et al., 2021; Hesp et al., 2020) —because it entails an unsuccessful model of the world (i.e., 
a model that is not reliable in its ability to achieve preferred outcomes). Conversely, a consistent 
belief that one’s model is successful at guiding action toward achieving one’s goals could 
contribute to higher SWB. Two empirical studies to date have observed the expected correlation 
between negative affect (self -reported anxiety/uncertainty) and EFE reliability/precision 
estimates (using a model of participant behavior during an approach -avoidance conflict task 
(Smith, Kirlic, Stewart, Touthang, Kuplicki, Khalsa, et al., 2021; Smith, Kirlic, Stewart, Touthang, 
Kuplicki, McDermott, et al., 2021) ), and three other studies using active inference models have 
linked related measures of precision to depression, anxiety, and/or substance use disorder 
severity (Smith, Kuplicki, Feinstein, et al., 2020; Smith, Schwartenbeck, et al., 2020; Smith, Taylor, 
Stewart, et al., 2022) . One study has also identified neural correlates of EFE estimates using 
functional neuroimaging (Schwartenbeck et al., 2015) . However, possible links to measures of 
SWB have not been examined.

Crucially, difficulties minimizing EFE can occur with respect to both internal bodily states 
(interoception) as well as external circumstances. For example, Stephan et al. (2016) have 
proposed that depressive symptoms develop due to a chronic failure to minimize interoceptive 
prediction error—associated with reduced confidence in the ability to successfully regulate the 
body and maintain preferred interoceptive observations (reduced “allostatic self-efficacy”). This 
also relates to interesting recent modelling work aiming to capture the computational basis of 
stress habituation —a phenomenon in which some individuals show reduced physiological 
responses to repeated presentation of the same stressor (Hartwig et al., 2022) . This modelling 
work propose s that stress habituation can be capture d as a reduction in the strength of the 
expected reward component of EFE (technically, a reduced precision of the distribution encoding 
preferred outcomes). In brief, when no course of action can be found to reduce EFE, a last resort 
option is to reduce the reward-seeking motivation itself. This means that the individual ceases to 
experience aversive stress responses (i.e., EFE is reduced), but at the cost of no longer expecting 
to achieve outcomes consistent with high SWB (e.g., remaining in unhealthy relationships or low 
socio-economic status environments, etc.). This computational model also introduces a parameter 
to account for the fact that some individual s show stress habituation and others do not. This 
highlights how there are trade -offs and individual differences in the way people may go about 
reducing EFE, not all of which are equally likely to promote high SWB. 
While the theoretical relationship betwee n SWB and EFE is fairly straightforward, possible 
links to VFE are more complex. Intuitively, one might simply equate higher SWB with lower 
levels of VFE (Joffily & Coricelli, 2013). At a biological level, this idea can be motivated by the fact 
that VFE minimization provides a generic means of describing successful survival and 
environmental adaptation (Friston, 2019; Kirchhoff et al., 2018) . The mathematics behind this 
idea—referred to as the “free energy principle”—are beyond the scope of the present paper, but 
the key premise is that observations consistent with an organism’s survival must be those 
expected to have the highest probability in that organism’s model (e.g., if healthy levels of 
hydration were not observed with high probability, an organism would not survive). It follows 
that there will be large prediction errors (i.e., greater VFE) when survival-consistent outcomes are 
not observed. This formulation therefore entails that successful organisms act to mini mize VFE, 
where this success at maintaining survival-consistent outcomes would be expected to promote 
higher SWB. 
However, this is likely oversimplified when considering the study of human SWB. One basic 
reason for this is that minimizing VFE is also accomplished by arriving at new beliefs that 
minimize prediction error (in the simplest way possible) —and sometimes the most accurate 
beliefs can promote low SWB (e.g., believing that one is worthless may best minimize prediction 
error in some circumstances). Another reason is that even very simple organisms can be described 
as acting to minimize VFE as a means of survival, while there is substantially greater subjectivity 
and complexity associated with self-reported SWB in humans. This is because self-reported SWB 
depends on abstract beliefs about oneself, which requires an internal model of the world that can 
support this type of advanced cognition  (Hesp et al., 2021; Hesp et al., 2020) . Crucially, this can 
include abstract expectations about the conceptual requirements of SWB that go beyond, or even 
work against, biological fitness (e.g., some individuals may believe they need to be rich to be 
happy, while others do not; or some individuals may value self -sacrifice over personal safety, 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   111 
while others do not). Another complexity is that there are different concepts of wellbeing (e.g., 
hedonic vs. eudaimonic; (Ryan & Deci, 2001) ). While momentary reductions in VFE might 
plausibly influence short-term hedonic wellbeing in some circumstances (e.g., when a return to 
homeostasis leads to positive emotion), eudaimonic wellbeing involves learned normative beliefs 
about what the requirements are for living (or having lived) a meaningful life that can counteract 
biological fitness (e.g., preferring states of “suffering in support of a meaningful cause” over states 
of “meaningless pleasure”). Given learned preferences for outcomes consistent with eudaimonic 
wellbeing, individuals will plausibly minimize EFE to realize them, but VFE could be minimized 
by inferring either high or low levels of eudaimonic wellbeing (i.e., depending on which inference 
best minimizes prediction error with respect to current observations).  The role of inference 
through VFE minimization—whether those inferences promote eudaimonic wellbeing or not—is 
also exemplified by related work that has characterized det erminants of feeling meaning in life 
(reviewed in (Kim et al., 2022) ). This work suggests that several types of beliefs c ontribute to 
feelings of meaning, including: 1) that the various aspects of one’s life are consistent and cohesive 
with one another; 2) that one’s life has a purpose (it is working toward valued goals); and 3) that 
one’s existence matters in the sense of having value, importance, and significance in the world. 
Meaning in life is also greater in those who show an intrinsic appreciation for various experiences 
(e.g., music, nature, interactions with family/frie nds; (Kim et al., 2022) ). In active inference, the 
presence or absence of each of these beliefs would in part reflect inferences based on current 
observations—that is, the inferences that minimize VFE. However, some  of these beliefs clearly 
also depend on expected future states and observations, which means EFE would also play a role 
similar to that described above. Levels of eudaimonic wellbeing will therefore reflect a complex 
mixture of VFE and EFE (with respect to beliefs about the present and future, respectively). 
These considerations illustrate why the potential relationship between VFE minimization and 
SWB is not as straightforward as is the case with EFE. While VFE can be understood to track basic 
biological fitness, this is neither necessary nor sufficient for an individ ual to report high SWB. 
Rather, both hedonic and eudaimonic SWB are learned concepts used to evaluate one’s 
experience, and self-reported SWB depends on how these learned concepts are encoded within 
the structure of an individual’s internal model (e.g., an  individual could potentially learn to 
associate low levels of hedonic SWB with high levels of eudaimonic SWB). The theoretical 
complexity here can also be highlighted by noting again how a model with beliefs about SWB 
will require hierarchical structure, which can allow VFE to be high at some levels and low at 
others. For example, consider an individual who values the idea of “hard work” and comes home 
feeling exhausted after a long day at their job. This feeling of exhaustion may reflect high VFE at 
a biological level (i.e., low metabolic resources); yet, that same feeling may lead to an elevated 
sense of self -worth (i.e., being exhausted provides evidence that one is a hard worker). This 
suggests that VFE minimization at some levels of processing may be more plausible correlates of 
SWB than others. However, despite these theoretical complexities, we will see below that—in the 
context of practical applications of active inference to SWB research —there may be several 
promising research directions to pursue.

4. Computational phenotypes: Multiple strategies for minimizing free energy 
Based on the theoretical foundations discussed above, this section expands on the active inference 
framework and provides concrete examples of how SWB research could be advanced by applying 
computational concepts and approaches. While we focus on active inference due to the richer set 
of constructs it allows us to draw from, we note that—because minimizing EFE includes a reward 
maximization component with some mathematica l similarities to RL (Da Costa et al., 2020) —
some points made below may also apply to elements of that framework. One main message of 
this section is that there ar e likely multiple computational strategies that can successfully 
maintain high SWB. These strategies correspond to different internal model structures or 
“computational phenotypes” (Schwartenbeck & Friston, 2016) , which can vary in the degree to 
which they adaptively capture the structure of the local environment (especially the local 
sociocultural environment). Computational phenotypes are defined in terms of the values of 
model parameters that best describe an individual’s behavior. Below we will describe six different 
example model parameters, how they have been used in existing studies employing active 
inference models, and how they may explain differences in SWB. 
 
4.1 Precision of prior beliefs over states 
In a given context, an internal model—technically referred to as a “generative model” (because it 
generates predictions)—will include prior beliefs about what will be perceived (both dependent 
and independent of one’s actions; encoded in parameters within 𝐃 and 𝐁 in Figure 1 ). If an 
individual is highly confident in their prior beliefs (if those beliefs are very “precise”), they will 
lead to a strong interpretive bias favoring expectations. Depending on the content domain, such 
prior beliefs could either promote or fail to promote SWB. For example, individuals with a precise 
prior belief that others tend to be friendly and supportive in social contexts may be more likely 
to interpret social signals in a positive manner —likely leading to actions that garner ad ditional 
social support and promote greater SWB. Pessimistic prior biases, as in emotional disorders, can 
instead bias perception toward interpretations of threat and social rejection—generating chronic 
negative affect (Smith, Alkozei, et al., 2018) . However, it is important to consider that, while an 
optimistic social interpretation bias could be helpful to a certain degree, it is also crucial that these 
expectations do not deviate too far from the true statistics of the environment. For example, a 
prior expectation that individuals are friendly could promote poor and unsafe choices in socially 
hostile environments and thus generate circumstances hindering SWB. Thus, there is not one 
optimal prior belief. It depends on the content domain and on a matc h with the environment. 
Model accuracy can be optimized so long as individuals also believe the sensory signals from the 
environment are reliable. If sensory signals are believed to be unreliable —referred to as having 
low “sensory precision” estimates (enc oded within 𝐀  in Figure 1 )—prior beliefs will more 
strongly dominate perception and potentially promote false beliefs. 
The combination of socio -behavioral tasks and computational modeling can measure the 
precision of prior beliefs in perception at the ind ividual level, providing one dimension of each 
participant’s computational phenotype. For examples of studies measuring individuals’ prior 
perceptual beliefs and sensory precision estimates in other content domains, see (Powers et al., 
2017; Smith, Kuplicki, Feinstein, et al., 2020; Smith, Kuplicki, Teed, et al., 2020; Smith, Mayeli, et 
al., 2021). To our knowledge, no study has measured prior beliefs or sensory precision estimates 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   113 
in relation to measures of SWB in social decision tasks (for related theoret ical work linking 
imprecise prior beliefs to racial discrimination, see (Varshney & Varshney, 2016)). This therefore 
represents one promising avenue for future research. 
 
4.2 Learning rates, forgetting, and volatility estimates 
A second important dimension of a computational phenotype describing the way individuals try 
to minimize VFE/EFE corresponds to learning rate. Learning rates were briefly introduced above 
in the context of RL models, where greater learning rates imply a belief that previously learned 
action-outcome probabilities are unstable over time (i.e., the environment is highly volatile). If 
volatility estimation processes function appropriately, these beliefs will reflect the true statistics 
of the environment, but individuals can also have inaccurate beliefs about volatility, which can 
lead to maladaptive learning rates. High learning rates p romote forgetting previously learned 
reward probabilities in favor of patterns in more recent observations. Because learning reward 
probabilities is implemented differently in AI, there is an associated distinction between learning 
rates and forgetting rates. Learning rates in AI control how quickly beliefs “solidify” and become 
resistant to change, which has the effect of reducing exploratory behavior, while forgetting rates 
control how quickly new observations “over -write” previous learning (and are there fore more 
similar to learning rates in RL models). To be adaptive, both learning rates and forgetting rates 
need to match the true statistics of the environment. Otherwise, beliefs may either become 
rigid/overconfident or beliefs will be unstable/underconf ident. Learning/forgetting rates also 
need not be the same for all types of observations. For example, in previous studies on substance 
use disorders using active inference models, healthy participants were found to selectively show 
faster learning rates f or losses than substance users, which also predicted changes in symptom 
severity over time (Smith, Schwartenbeck, et al., 2020; Smith, Taylor, Stewart, et al., 2021) . In 
addition to different learning/forgetting rates for different observations, some related models also 
assume individuals maintain explicit beliefs about volatility and update those beliefs over time 
(Mathys et al., 2014) —allowing for changes in the rate of learning/forgetting after each 
observation. 
When considering plausible mechanisms linked to greater SWB, one useful phenotype could 
correspond to a combination of optimistic prior beliefs and slow forgetting rates (assuming this 
also matches the statistics of the environment they occupy). This would entail that an individual’s 
optimistic expectations would be resilient to many negative experiences before having strong 
negative effects on perception and behavior. Another useful phenotype might involve a 
moderately fast forgetting rate in contexts where one is transitioning f rom socially hostile to 
friendly environments —which might prevent pre -existing pessimistic prior beliefs from 
promoting behavior that could prevent garnering social support. 
 
4.3 Information-seeking and sensitivity to uncertainty 
A third relevant aspect of how individuals seek to minimize EFE is through a type of curiosity or 
exploratory drive—captured by the epistemic value term described in the previous section. One 
consequence of the equation for EFE is that the value of the expected reward term  controls how 
driven an individual is to seek information vs. reward (Schwartenbeck et al., 2019; Smith, Friston, 
et al., 2022) . Technically, the expected reward term in EFE takes the form of a probability 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   114 
distribution over observations, where observations that are more “probable” are those that are 
more rewarding (encoded by the parameters within 𝐂  in Figure 1 ). If this “preference 
distribution” is highly precise (corresponding to one observation having a very high reward 
value), then reward -seeking will dominate —leading to a type of “risky” behavior in which 
individuals try to maximize reward before exploring the environment to identify the optimal 
strategy. Conversely, a very imprecise preference distribu tion drives a type of “risk -averse” 
behavior in which individuals engage in excessive information-seeking (i.e., continually trying to 
reduce uncertainty beyond what is necessary) and take too long to become confident in the best 
reward-maximizing strategy. In other words, they act as though they are overly concerned that 
they will make the wrong decision once they begin seeking reward. Empirical studies in AI have 
only very recently begun to examine differences in preference precision (and hence information-
seeking; see (Smith, Schwartenbeck, et al., 2020; Smith, Taylor, Stewart, et al., 2021) ). However, 
work on exploratory drives within expanded RL models has suggested altered patterns of 
information-seeking in depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders (Aberg et al., 2022; 
Fan et al., 2021; Smith, Taylor, Wilson, et al., 2021; Waltz et al., 2020) . Whether and how 
information-seeking drives relate to SWB has not been empirically assessed (for some interesting 
recent theoretical discussion, see (Miller et al., 2022) ). Here, one might hypothesize that SWB 
would be facilitated by a moderate information -seeking drive that supports informed goal -
seeking, while preventing individuals from “jumping to conclusions” too early or remaining 
uncertain after gathering sufficient information. 
 
4.4 Prior beliefs about EFE precision 
As described earlier, AI suggests the brain can learn to be more or less confident in its model’s 
ability to use EFE to optimize action (the paramet er 𝜸 in Figure 1). In these models, individuals 
also start with a prior belief about this EFE precision (the parameter 𝜷 in Figure 1), which can be 
estimated in individuals based on task behavior. This can be viewed as a type of metacognition, 
in that it  involves inferring beliefs about the reliability of one’s beliefs (Hesp et al., 2021 ). One 
study ha s shown how this relates to dopamine -related brain regions during neuroimaging 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2015), and two other studies have linked this measure to differences in self-
reported negative affect and decision uncertainty (Smith, Kirlic, Stewart, Touthang, Kuplicki, 
Khalsa, et al., 2021; Smith, Kirlic, Stewart, Touthang, Kuplicki, McDermott, et al., 2021). Therefore, 
one might predict that a stronger prior belief that EFE precision is high should be a mechanism 
promoting SWB. High EFE precision also leads behavior to be less random and/or less habit -
driven (i.e., it down -weights the influence of the habits  encoded in the E vector in Figure 1)—
making behavior more driven by explicit future predictions, which could help account for 
bidirectional links between SWB and adaptive behavior (Diener et al., 2018). As EFE precision can 
be understood as a metacognitive belief and has been related to self -reported decision 
uncertainty, it also has potential links to other work suggesting the importance of metacognitive 
abilities in promoting SWB (Varshney & Barbey, 2021). 
 
4.5 Planning horizon and decision tree pruning 
A further possible dimension of a computational phenotype pertains to prospective planning. 
This form of planning involves imagining different sequences of actions (policies; encoded by 𝜋 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   115 
in Figure 1) and their future outcomes ( 𝑜). One individual difference in this context is planning 
horizon, which corresponds to how many steps into the future one considers while making 
decisions (i.e., the length of the action sequence encoded in each possible policy). If this horizon 
is short, dec isions will focus on optimizing short -term outcomes, while a long horizon will 
optimize long-term outcomes (e.g., even if they require enduring a negative short-term outcome). 
Another important individual difference corresponds to something called “decisio n tree 
pruning” (Huys et al., 2012; Lally et al., 2017), which arises from the fact that it typically takes too 
much time to imagine the distal future outcomes of all possible plans (i.e., policies). Therefore, a 
mechanism for focusing on only a few possible plans is needed (metaphorically “pruning away” 
other branches in a tree of possible diverging paths). This mechanism involves ceasing to 
simulate/imagine the rest of a possible action sequence once short -term negative outcomes are 
expected (i.e., one does not “think it through” to consider the possibility of a positive long -term 
outcome). These two differences —planning horizon and pruning —also represent plaus ible 
mechanisms for promoting behaviors that would maintain high vs. low SWB. Both a short 
planning horizon and too much pruning will lead to myopic planning. For example, this type of 
planning might prevent an individual from beginning a promising career trajectory because the 
initial starting position is not enjoyable or respected. Or it could prevent an individual from 
offering a difficult apology to maintain a fulfilling friendship. Yet, too little pruning is also 
maladaptive, as decision -making can bec ome inefficient and overwhelming. It is also ideal for 
planning horizon to be flexible, as distal future outcomes can in some cases be too unpredictable 
to consider. In other cases, survival can also require fast decisions focused on the immediate 
future. Thus, one would expect individuals would have higher SWB if they are capable of long 
planning horizons, but where deployment of this ability is flexible and optimized to the relevant 
context. Behavioral planning tasks are available that could be used to examine potential relations 
between these mechanisms and SWB (Huys et al., 2012; Lally et al., 2017) , but this remains 
untested. 
 
4.6 Granular state spaces 
The fi nal element of a generative model that we will consider as a potential dimension for 
computational phenotyping pertains to the specificity of categories used to understand the world 
(i.e., technically, the number of possible states within the state-space of a model; encoded within 
𝑠 in Figure 1). Unlike some other model elements discussed above, this is not a single parameter. 
Instead, it is a more general attribute of the structure of a generative model. One relevant example 
of this pertains to the specificity of emotion concept learning, and i ts relation to constructs such 
as emotion differentiation (Kashdan et al., 2015), emotional complexity/diversity (Kang & Shaver, 
2004; Quoidbach et al., 2014), emotional awareness (Lane & Smith, 2021; Lane et al., 2015; Smith, 
Killgore, & Lane, 2018), and alexithymia (Bagby et al., 1994; Lane et al., 2021; Maroti et al., 2018; 
Trevisan et al., 2019), all of which share the notion of granularity. Individuals with low emotional 
granularity tend to use broad, non-specific emotion categories (e.g., “good”, “bad”). This can be 
understood as a generative model with only two possible states or hypotheses (Smith, Lane, et 
al., 2019; Smith, Parr, et al., 2019), which constrains the amount of information available to guide 
adaptive choice. In contrast, those with high granularity have many specific emotion concepts 
(e.g., many types of “bad”, such as sad, angry, afraid, guilty, jealous, etc.). This corresponds to a 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   116 
generative model with a large number of possible states that can explain many unique patterns 
of sensory input and provide precise information to  guide effective emotion regulation and 
adaptive social decision-making (Satpute et al., 2020; Satpute et al., 2016; Smith, Killgore, Alkozei, 
et al., 2018; Smith, Killgore, & Lane, 2018; Smith & Lane, 2016).  
This computational formulation of emotion concept granularity may therefore offer a novel 
perspective on the beneficial role of emotion knowledge in cognition. For example, it illustrates 
how a larger and more fine-grained state space for emotion concepts can offer precise predictions 
to adaptively guide choice. This could also be extended to consideration of unique emotion 
concepts present in different languages/cultures (Majid, 2012; Russell, 1991; Satpute et al., 2020), 
and how such concepts could be uniquely helpful in navigating those specific sociocultural 
contexts. This also supports previous suggestions that adaptive emotional functioning could be 
increased by acquiring new emotion concepts from other  languages/cultures (Barrett, 2017) . 
However, as with other model parameters, more granularity will likely only be useful to  the 
extent that the environment truly has many underlying states. For example, if one grows up in 
an emotionally impoverished environment where people only express coarse-grained emotional 
signals, then it may be most adaptive to maintain a model that is not overly complex and assumes 
there is more variation than is actually present (Smith, Steklis, et al., 2022; Smith, Steklis, et al., 
2020). While simulations of such differences have been reported using AI (Smith, Lane, et al., 
2019; Smith, Parr, et al., 2019) , no behavioral tasks have yet been developed to study the 
granularity of individua ls’ generative models. This represents an important future direction, 
which could potentially draw on existing paradigms used to study cross -cultural differences in 
other perceptual categorization processes (e.g., color categorization (Twomey et al., 2021; 
Winawer et al., 2007) ). It is also important to note that, while we have used emotio n concept 
specificity as a concrete example, the notion of state -space granularity can be applied to many 
other relevant domains (e.g., coarse- vs. fine-grained beliefs about personality types, differences 
in social status, etc.), which will be important to consider in future work as well. 
 
5. Potential empirical applications 
As each of the model elements discussed above can differ across individuals, they afford possible 
explanations for individual differences in perception, learning, and decision -making—each of 
which could lead to differences in SWB. By extension, these model elements also offer possible 
explanations for cultural differences, which can be viewed as computational phenotypes that are 
similar in individuals within a culture but differ from individuals in other cultures. For example, 
perhaps some cultures place more value than others on reflective practices  (e.g., heightened 
attention to one’s own uncertainty, more frequent engagement in prospection/retrospection) that 
would be expected to increase  information-seeking and planning horizon (e.g., see (Fan et al., 
2021; Gershman, 2018; Jackson et al., 2020; Kaplan & Friston, 2018; Smith, Taylor, Wilson, et al., 
2022)). Or perhaps some cultures tend to share implicit expectations that the social environment 
is more volatile than others. SWB could also have unique computational correlates in different 
cultures.  Such hypotheses could be tested using standard methods in computational psychiatry 
to examine significant differences between cultural groups as well as the correlates of within -
culture variability (for a summary of possible empirical approaches, see Table 2  below). For 
example, if groups of individuals from two distinct cultures were each asked to complete widely-

      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   117 
used decision tasks designed to test for differences in information -seeking/preference precision 
(e.g., (Smith, Schwartenbeck, et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2014) , distal planning (e.g., (Huys et al., 
2012)), or volatility beliefs (e.g., (de Berker et al., 2016; Diaconescu et al., 2017; Iglesias et al., 2013; 
Lawson et al., 2017)), hypotheses could be tested that significant group differences in these traits 
would be observed. Within each cultural group, possible relationships could also be tested 
between these traits and SWB. For example, perhaps volatility beliefs are correlated with SWB in 
some cultures but not in others.

A further consideration is that, because cultural norms and practices are passed on through 
learning, computational models of learning in both RL and AI can offer hypotheses about this 
learning process. However, unlike the generic model parameters discussed above, cultural norms 
and values are content -specific (e.g., that it is acceptable or unacceptable to strive for personal 
over collective benefit). As such, the approach to testing such hypotheses would instead require 
model comparison (Rigoux et al., 2014) . This entails specifying a number of different mechani stic 
Subjective wellbeing and active inference 
Smith et al. 
 
      www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org                   119 
hypotheses—formalized as different generative models—that could explain such differences. For 
example, one candidate model might specify that people within collectivistic cultures learn a 
generative model in which self -serving choices are expected to generate non -preferred social 
feedback, which then deters the selection of those behaviors. In contrast, another candidate 
generative model might specify that individuals learn preferences for observing prosocial 
behavior in both themselves and others. In this latter case, behavior would not be driven by 
expected social feedback, but by the intrinsic desire to observe prosocial behavior. A more 
complex model might include a competition between the precision of preferences for personal 
and societal benefit, with a parameter that weights their relative influence. Once a space of 
possible models is constructed, each model can be fit to available data. One can then perform 
model comparison to identify which model best accounts for the way this cultural differenc e is 
acquired (i.e., which model can best reproduce the experimental data in simulations). 
The approaches described in this section can also be applied to many other related 
phenomena. For example, people in individualistic cultures tend to prefer high-arousal emotions 
more than those in collectivistic cultures (Lim, 2016). Within AI models there are several possible 
mechanisms through which these distinct value systems could be acquired during development, 
each representing a unique hypothesis to be tested. For example, this might involve learning 
distinct preference distributions (i.e., within 𝐂 in Figure 1) over high arousal sensations based on 
what was experienced most frequently during development, or it could involve associative 
learning processes (within 𝐀 in Figure 1 ) in which an individual has learned to predict th at 
displays of high-arousal emotions will be met with non-preferred outcomes (e.g., negative social 
feedback). Or perhaps individuals in collectivistic cultures learn to expect that high-arousal states 
threaten the successful minimization of VFE and EFE (i .e., that action outcomes are less 
predictable and that the value of 𝜸 in Figure 1 is low).  
Another hypothesis is that emotions are conceptualized in distinct ways in different cultures, 
and that it is this difference in conceptualization that explains d ifferences in emotional 
experience. In other words, different cultures have different emotion categories that can be 
inferred to explain their experience, which would be encoded within 𝑠 in Figure 1). This type of 
emotion concept inference process has bee n simulated in previous work, but cross -cultural 
variation has not been addressed (Smith, Lane, et al., 2019; Smith, Parr, et al., 2019) . Emotion 
concept learning in this context can be modeled as learning the probability of making various 
internal and external observations under different emotional states, 𝑝(𝑜|𝑠) . For example, 
observations of threat, high arousal, and avoidance motivation may have high joint probability 
under the concept of “fear”, while observations of pleasant sensations, high arousal, and 
approach motivations may have high joint probability under the concept of “excite ment”. 
However, these probabilistic mappings are learned and can differ by culture (Barrett, 2017; 
Russell, 1991; Smith, Killgore, & Lane, 2018; Widen & Russell, 2008) , which means the same 
experiences can be interpreted as different emotions in different cultures. In computational terms, 
this would mean that different cultures have different numbers/types of possible states (i .e., 
different levels of granularity) and different emotional state -observation mappings encoded in 
their internal models.  
In support of this, different languages often include emotion concept terms that are difficult 
to translate. For example, the concep t of “wabi -sabi” in Japanese roughly corresponds to

“appreciating beauty in imperfection” and the concept of “schadenfreude” in German 
corresponds to “feeling pleasure in response to another person’s suffering or misfortune”. These 
concepts do not have 1 -to-1 translations to English words. The degree to which this influences 
emotional experience is an open question, but both active inference and related theories of 
emotion (e.g., constructivism; (Barrett, 2017)) would predict meaningful influences. As in the 
previous cases we have described, this could also be tested through model comparison. For 
example, emotion induction procedures could be combined with behavioral tasks that require 
decisions to be made based on perceived emotional states. Then m odels with different 
numbers/types of emotion concepts could be compared in their ability to account for differences 
in self -reported emotions and patterns of choice behavior. If different models best explained 
behavior in different cultural groups, this would support the idea that they use different models 
as a means of understanding their emotional experience (i.e., different inferences best minimize 
variational free energy and make different predictions about the choices that will minimize 
expected free energy). 
One additional area of research on SWB that could be opened up using computational 
approaches is modeling multi -person interactions. In this case, two (or more) individuals 
cooperate or compete when completing a behavioral task —allowing models to be fit to the 
behavior of each individual as they react to each other’s choices. This can offer the opportunity 
to evaluate individual differences in parameters of one individual’s model of another person (i.e., 
corresponding to the neurocomputational processes underlying mentalization or theory of mind 
(Amodio & Frith, 2006; Friston & Frith, 2015; Frith & Frith, 2006, 2012; Lombardo et al., 2010; 
Schurz et al., 2014)). To date, a small number of studies have begun to examine how individuals 
minimize “social prediction error” in such tasks (Diaconescu et al., 2014; Diaconescu et al., 2017), 
illustrating sensitivity to beliefs about volatility in the intentions of others, relationships to self -
reported empathy, and the potential role of specific neuromodulatory systems, but this work has 
not focused on individual differences in SWB. Complementary work within the RL framework 
has also shown that happiness ratings are lower in such tasks when interaction partners are 
inequitably rewarded (Rutledge et al., 2016) , but has not focused on inference processes within 
internal models of others or the potential role of free energy minimization. Future research could 
build upon this work by using such tasks in combination with AI models to examine additional 
hypotheses. For example, perhaps individuals with precise prior beliefs that others tend to be 
altruistic (and therefore behave in more cooperative, trusting ways) will a lso be more likely to 
report higher SWB. Or perhaps individuals that more fully consider the predicted effect of their 
current choices on the distal future choices of their interaction partner (i.e., greater planning 
horizon) will also report greater real -world social success  (e.g., attainment of greater social 
support, more meaningful relationships, etc.).  
Another complementary research direction could be to use multi-agent simulation to identify 
public policies that better promote SWB in societies of a given culture (e.g., by formalizing multi-
agent interactions in which one agent corresponds to the government and has a particular set of 
“policy-making” actions to choose from). A branch of game theory called mechanism design, which 
can be thought of as the “engineering” side of economic theory, is one appropriate mathematical 
approach for identifying policies in this manner (Maskin, 2008). Based on the present discussion, 
future work might consider mechanism design using agents that are themselves engaged in active

inference (e.g., within a general equilibrium macroeconomic model that is being utilized to 
understand a country’s SWB (Hill et al., 2021)). Parallel work in the RL literature has developed 
similar large-scale simulations to develop dynamic taxation and subsidy policies that consider 
multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic actors that optimize 
for their indiv idual objectives (Trott et al., 2021) . A taxation policy from such reinforcement 
learning simulations can even outperform optim al static policies in terms of productivity and 
equity (Zheng et al., 2021) . Thus, it would be interesting to see whether the active inference 
framework could offer any additional benefits in this line of research. 
 
6. Summary and conclusion: Integrated phenotypes for free energy minimization 
We have outlined several computational  model parameters that can be configured in unique 
ways in different individuals —representing distinct computational strategies one might use in 
attempt to minimize free energy. We have also considered how each of these parameters could 
(alone or in combination) either promote or hinder maintenance of high SWB depending on the 
values they take and their match to the statistics of the local environment. Figure 2  (below) 
provides a visual summary of these parameters and their interactions. 
These parameters may link to SWB in at least two ways. First, parameters like EFE precision 
(and perhaps prior beliefs about states) may have close internal connections with feelings of 
wellbeing. Second, many other parameters may contribute to wellbeing i ndirectly through their 
influence on behavior. That is, if they match well with the local environment, behavior may be 
more likely to cultivate the career success and social support that contribute to satisfaction with 
life. 
We suggest that the reconceptua lization of SWB we have described in terms of levels of 
success in free energy minimization, and the methods offered by computational modeling to 
empirically test this new framing, each represent important means of advancing our 
understanding of SWB. It may offer a novel behavioral approach and set of tools/measures that—
while potentially showing convergent validity with standard SWB measures —can also offer 
novel types of relevant information. It may help to identify specific mechanisms that promote or 
hinder wellbeing on an individual basis and therefore potentially facilitate the development of 
personalized interventions aimed at improving wellbeing. We look forward to seeing the 
potentially important outcomes of this line of future research.
