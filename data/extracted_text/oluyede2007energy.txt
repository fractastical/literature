Abstract 
 
This paper presents a new weighted distribution which is known as the Double Weighted Rayleigh Distr ibution 
(DWRD).  This distribution is constructed and studied.  The statistical properties of this distribution are discussed 
and obtained, including the mean, variance, coefficient of variation, harmonic mean, m oments, mode, reliability 
function, hazard function and the reverse hazard function.  Also the parameters of thi s distribution are estimated 
by the method of moment and the maximum likelihood estimation method. 
 
Keywords: Weighted distribution, Double Weighted distribution, Rayleigh distribution 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
Weighted distribution provides an approach to dealing with model specification and data interpretation problems. 
Fisher [3] and Rao [10] introduced and unified the concept of weighted distribution. Fisher [3] stud ied on how 
methods of ascertainment can influence the form of distribution of recorded ob servations and then Rao [10] 
introduced and formulated it in general terms in connection with modeling statistical data where the usual practice 
of using standard distributions for the purpose was not found to be appropriate. In Rao's paper, he identified 
various situations that can be modeled by weighted distributions. These situations refer to instance s where the 
recorded observations cannot be considered as a random sample from the original distributions. This may occur 
due to non-observability of some events or damage caused to the original observation resulting in a reduced value, 
or adoption of a sampling procedure which gives unequal chances to the units in the original. 
 
Weighted distributions occur frequently in research related to reliability, bio -medicine, ecology and branching 
process can be seen in Gupta and Kirmani [5], Patil and Rao [13], Gupta and Keating [4].  Das and Ro y [2] 
discussed the length-biased Weighted Generalized Rayleigh distribution with its properties, also they develop the 
length-biased Weighted Weibull distribution. Patil and Ord [12] introduced the concept of size biased sampl ing 
and weighted distributions by identifying some of the situations where the underlying models retain their form. 
Kareema and Hantoosh [7] studied the Double Weighted Exponential distribution and some of its structural 
properties. Shi et al [14] studied the theoretical properties of weighted Generalized Rayleigh and r elated 
distributions. Rashwan [11] presented the generalized gamma length biased distrib ution with its properties.  For 
more important results of weighted distributions see Oluyede and Terbeche [9], Oluyede and George [8], Jing [6].

Depending upon the choice of the weight function w(x), we have different weighted models. Clearly when
xxw )(  , the resulting distribution is called length-biased whose pdf is given by:

In this paper we present the Double Weighted distribution (DWD), taking one type of weight function xxw )( , 
and using the Rayleigh distribution as original distribution, we derive the pdf and some useful prop erties of 
Double Weighted Rayleigh distribution.

6.  Estimation of the Parameters  
 
In this section, estimates of the two parameters (λ, α) of the Double weighted Rayleigh distribution  are estimated 
and obtained.  Method of moment (MOM) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are presented. 
 
6.1 Method of Moments 
 
Let nxxx ...,,, 21  be an independent random sample from the DWRD with parameters   and c.  The method of 
moment estimators are obtained by computing the population moments and equating to sample moments i,e

To find the maximum likelihood estimators of  and c we have solve the above system of non -linear equations 
with respect to  and c. Since this system has no closed form solution. Thus we use a iterative technique such as 
Newton-Raphson method to obtain the solution.  
 
7.  Numerical Example 
 
This section illustrates the usefulness of the Double weighted Rayleigh distribution to real data to  see how the 
new model works in practice. The real data set corresponds to the exceedances of flood peaks (in m 3 /s) of the 
Wheaton river near Carcross in Youkon territory, Canada. The data consist of 72 exceedances for the years 1952-
1984, rounded to one decimal. The data was analyzed by Akinsete et al. [1] and is given below 
 
1.7,2.2,14.4,1.1,0.4,20.6,5.3,0.7,1.9,13.0,12.0,9.3,1.4,18.7,8.5,25.5,11.6,14.1,22.1,1.1,2.5,14.4,1.7,37.6,0.6,2.2,39.
0,0.3,15.0,11.0,7.3,22.9,1.7,0.1,1.1,0.6,9.0,1.7,7.0,20.1,0.4,2.8,14.1,9.9,10.4,10.7,30.0,3.6,5.6,30.8,13.3,4.2,25.5,3
.4,11.9,21.5,27.6,36.4,2.7,64.0,1.5,2.5,27.4,1.0,27.1,20.2,16.8,5.3,9.7,27.5,2.5,27.0. 
 
The data can be modeled by Double weighted Rayleigh distribution and also we estimate the parameters   and c 
using Newton Raphson method beginning with the initial estimates  004.0

 and 03.0

c . Then the estimate 
values are: 3807.17

 and 0299.0

c , for 2 iterated.
