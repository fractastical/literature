Abstract (200 words):   23 
Ready-to-use supplemental foods (RUSF) are energy-dense meals formulated to prevent and treat 24 
moderate and severe childhood acute malnutrition (MAM and SAM) in high-risk settings. Although 25 
lifesaving, the degree and durability of weight recovery with RUSF is unpredictable. We examined 26 
whether environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and gut microbiota perturbations are risk factors for 27 
RUSF failure in a birth cohort of 416 rural Pakistani children followed for growth, common childhood 28 
illnesses, and biomarkers from blood, urine, and stool. Infants who developed wasting (weight-for-length 29 
Z score <-2, n=187, 45%) during surveillance received Acha Mum (a chickpea-based RUSF) daily for 30 
eight weeks. Machine learning identified seven biomarkers that predicted RUSF response (n=75) vs. non-31 
response (n=112) with 73% accuracy. Remarkably, gut microbiome composition predicted RUSF 32 
response with 93% (pre-supplementation) and 98% (post-supplementation) accuracy. Seven outliers 33 
whose microbiome falsely predicted positive response experienced extraordinary burdens of inflammation 34 
and illness during supplementation. These findings identify gut microbial signatures and biomarkers of 35 
gut and systemic inflammation as robust predictors of RUSF response in infants free from intercurrent 36 
illness during recovery, setting the stage for predictive models to guide precision use of RUSF and 37 
adjunct therapies in undernourished children. 38

Introduction 44 
The 2025 WHO Global Nutrition Targets call for dramatic and overdue reductions in the global burden of 45 
childhood wasting (acute undernutrition) and stunting (chronic undernutrition) [1]. Persistent health and 46 
economic disparities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to impede progress toward 47 
these goals [2]; hence, the timely application of effective public health interventions as well as an 48 
improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying childhood undernutrition in LMICs will be crucial 49 
to success [3]. Ready-to-use supplemental foods (RUSFs) have emerged as a key strategy for the 50 
prevention and treatment of moderate and severe acute malnutrition (MAM, -2> weight-for-height Z 51 
(WLZ)>-3; SAM, WLZ<-3 SD) in community-based settings. Efforts to encourage the local production 52 
of RUSF, enhance efficacy and adherence, and reduce gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., vomiting) are on 53 
the rise [4]; however, RUSF interventions continue to show inconsistent efficacy and durability for 54 
growth recovery [5]. Optimizing RUSF composition, duration, monitoring, and adjunctive therapies to 55 
maximize nutritional benefit is currently constrained by a lack of precision tools to identify those children 56 
least likely to respond. 57 
 58 
Childhood growth faltering in LMICs is closely linked to environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a 59 
subclinical enteropathy characterized by gut and systemic inflammation, intestinal barrier dysfunction, 60 
and malabsorption [6]. It is not yet clear to what extent EED impairs the efficacy of RUSF in childhood 61 
wasting. Intensive nutritional and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) interventions against childhood 62 
stunting have so far produced only modest benefits, raising concerns that the derangements in gut 63 
structure and function seen in EED undermine these strategies [7]. Recently, causal links between gut 64 
microbiota and early childhood undernutrition have been identified, leading to investigations exploring 65 
microbiota-directed complementary foods (MDCF) [8, 9]. Although the role of EED in stunting pathways 66 
is increasingly appreciated, the degree to which EED impairs the efficacy of RUSF and MDCF is not yet 67 
understood. 68 
  69 
Building on these observations, we explored whether host-microbiome factors influence RUSF response 70 
in acutely undernourished children to address the following questions: 1) To what extent do EED and 71 
systemic inflammation undermine the efficacy of RUSF?; 2) Do baseline differences in gut microbiota 72 
prior to RUSF administration predict clinical outcomes?; and 3) Do RUSF-driven shifts in gut microbial 73 
communities differentiate responders from nonresponders? Here, we report findings from secondary 74 
analyses of the Study of Environmental Enteropathy and Malnutrition (SEEM)-Pakistan in which 187 75 
children with recalcitrant wasting received a chickpea-based RUSF.  We find that: 1) biomarkers of 76 
systemic inflammation, EED, and nutritional status (fecal myeloperoxidase and neopterin; serum 77 
prealbumin, glucagon-like peptide-2, and C-reactive protein; and urine claudin-15 and creatinine) 78 
collectively predict RUSF response, 2) pre-RUSF microbiome composition predicts RUSF response and 79 
3) RUSF expands the relative abundance of Negativicutes (including Veillonella chickpea fermenters) in 80 
wasted infants, with responders displaying greater relative increases in Negativicutes and Clostridia, and 81 
decreases in Gammaproteobacteria, relative to non-responders.       82

Results  84 
Participant characteristics 85 
We enrolled 416 newborns (3-to-6 months of age) in the rural Matiari 86 
district of Sindh, Pakistan. We monitored their weight and length monthly 87 
for six months or longer then classified study participants as either well-88 
nourished controls (WLZ ≥0, LAZ ≥-1, n = 51) or undernourished cases 89 
(wasted with WLZ ≤-2, n = 365) based on two consecutive months of 90 
anthropometry Fig 1A). Baseline clinical characteristics for case and control infants for whom 91 
complete biomarker and fecal 16S microbiome data were available are summarized in Table 1. Maternal 92 
and paternal BMI as well as birth anthropometrics were significantly lower in cases vs. controls (P 93 
<0.05), differences that became even more pronounced by nine months of age (P <0.05). Breastfeeding 94 
patterns were similar between groups over the first six months of life. Cases in whom complete biomarker 95 
data were available were broadly representative of the larger SEEM cohort, as shown in S Table 1.  96 
 97 
Beginning at age 9 months, wasted infants (WLZ < -2, n = 187) whose growth did not improve after their 98 
primary caregiver participated in an intensive nutritional education intervention were provided Acha 99 
Mum, a locally produced chickpea-based RUSF, daily for 8 weeks. We collected blood, fecal, and urine 100 
samples prior to initiation of RUSF, allowing us to determine baseline EED biomarker and 16S fecal 101 
microbiome profiles (Fig 1B). We performed 16S sequencing of fecal specimens from four timepoints: 102 
(pre-intervention (age 9 months), one week post-intervention (age 12 months), one month post-103 
intervention (age 13 months), and six months post-intervention (age 18 months) in three subgroups of 104 
participants: 1) the 30 best RUSF responders (RUSF-R), 2) the 30 worst RUSF non-responders (RUSF-105 
NR), and 3) 28 controls who did not require nutritional interventions during the study. To quantify RUSF 106 
response, we calculated WAZ velocity (ΔWAZ/month) during the course of the 8-week intervention 107 
rather than WLZ velocity, given that changes in infant length are more challenging to reliably measure 108 
and detect over an 8-week nutritional intervention relative to changes in infant weight. 109 
  110 
Ponderal growth responses to RUSF administration  111 
 112 
RUSF resolved wasting within one week of completing the 8-week intervention in only 41% of cases 113 
[10]. Of the 187 wasted infants who received RUSF, 75 (41%) showed improvements in WAZ (positive 114 
response); 112 (59%) did not. The 30 best responders (RUSF-R) demonstrated a mean WAZ velocity of 115 
0.413 over the course of the intervention (Fig 2A, Table 2). RUSF-R showed significant improvements in 116 
overall nutritional status; severe acute malnutrition (SAM) declined from 33% to 0% and moderate acute 117 
malnutrition (MAM) declined from 63% to 20% (Fig 2B). In contrast, the 30 worst nonresponders 118 
(RUSF-NR) demonstrated either no improvements in WAZ or a decline, with a mean monthly WAZ 119 
velocity over the intervention of -0.081. The proportion of children with SAM increased in the RUSF-NR 120 
from 27% at baseline to 57% post-intervention. WAZ and WLZ scores were slightly lower in RUSF-R at 121 
baseline, indicating RUSF response was neither due to better nutritional status at baseline nor regression 122 
to the mean. Of note, RUSF-R were less wasted at birth relative to RUSF-NR (S Table 1). All other 123 
baseline indices were similar between groups, including RUSF adherence and illness burden ( Fig S1A). 124 
We tracked growth trajectories in RUSF-R and RUSF-NR beyond completion of supplementation (Fig 125 
2C). Improvements in WAZ and WLZ continued in RUSF-R after the intervention was completed, 126 
persisting until the end of follow-up at 24 months, indicating a durable RUSF effect. RUSF-NR did not 127 
respond immediately to nutritional intervention; however, we noted improvements in ponderal growth 128 
beginning at age 13 months (Table 2). Length-for-age Z (LAZ) scores remained largely unchanged in 129 
both RUSF-R and RUSF-NR over the course of intervention and during follow-up. In controls who did 130

not require nutritional intervention, anthropometric indices gradually declined over the course of follow-131 
up. Taken together, this suggests that RUSF was ultimately beneficial even for RUSF-NR. 132 
Serum, urine, and fecal biomarkers distinguish wasted children from controls 133 
 134 
We hypothesized baseline biomarkers of growth, inflammation, and EED would be distinct in wasted 135 
infants compared to well-nourished controls. All available biomarker data from the entire cohort (n = 136 
235) were compared using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify global group differences (Fig 137 
3A). Our model was able to separate cases and controls along Principal Component 2 (PC2), with 138 
variation driven by biomarkers of growth and nutritional status (IGF-1, prealbumin, GLP-2, and leptin) as 139 
well as acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and AGP (Fig S2A). Control samples clustered 140 
tightly, whereas cases displayed a more heterogeneous distribution along PC1, with a subset of 141 
participants designated as cases regardless of nutritional status. PC1 represented most of the variation 142 
within the model, primarily driven by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. The 143 
PCA of the 88 study participants, selected for RUSF sub analysis (30 RUSF-R, 30 RUSF-NR, and 28 144 
controls), showed similar a pattern of clustering (Fig S2B), indicating that biomarker profiles from these 145 
subgroups were broadly representative of the total cohort. 146 
 147 
PCA findings were confirmed by univariate analyses. Biomarkers of growth and nutritional status, 148 
including IGF-1, prealbumin, GLP-2, and leptin, were significantly elevated in control samples compared 149 
to cases (Fig 3B-D). Cases displayed evidence of systemic inflammation, with significantly higher 150 
concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Of note, the 151 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also higher in cases vs. controls, suggesting feedback regulation. In 152 
addition, the urinary excretion of the intestinal tight junction protein claudin-15 was significantly higher 153 
in cases, consistent with previous associations of urinary claudin-15 with decreased gut barrier function 154 
observed in EED [11, 12]. Fecal markers of increased intestinal inflammation were similar across cases 155 
and controls: fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neopterin (NEO) levels were similar between groups, and 156 
fecal lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was elevated in controls compared to cases. 157 
 158 
Pre-Intervention Biomarkers Predict RUSF Response 159 
 160 
The heterogeneity of biomarker profiles observed in cases suggested a mixed population among this 161 
group, therefore we hypothesized biomarkers would help identify which undernourished infants were less 162 
likely to respond to RUSF. Relabeling cases by nutritional response (RUSF-R vs. RUSF-NR) supported 163 
this hypothesis; the majority of samples that failed to cluster with control samples belonged to the 164 
nonresponder group (Fig 4A). Heterogeneous samples were more likely to be RUSF-NR; however, 165 
RUSF-R and RUSF-NR groups as a whole did not cleanly separate, indicating overall broad similarity in 166 
biomarker profiles. In univariate analyses, fecal NEO, serum CRP and IL-10 were significantly higher in 167 
RUSF-NR vs. RUSF-R prior to intervention, however, we identified fewer significant differences than 168 
what we observed between cases and controls (Fig 4B-D). Therefore, we took a machine learning 169 
approach to identify biomarkers more predictive of RUSF response. 170 
Biomarkers were incorporated into an ensemble of Random Forest (RF) models with 20-fold cross-171 
validation. Using this approach, biomarker data was able to correctly predict response to nutritional 172 
intervention with 60% accuracy (Fig 4E). A distinct set of nine features (GLP-2, MPO, prealbumin, NEO, 173 
claudin-15, creatinine, CRP, IL-10, and MCP-1) representing a mix of growth and inflammatory 174 
biomarkers were identified as most important for distinguishing responders from nonresponders. We 175 
observed a trend towards increased markers of growth and nutritional status (GLP-2, prealbumin, 176 
creatinine) in responders, consistent with the elevation of these markers in control samples relative to 177 
cases. We also noted a trend towards increased intestinal inflammation (MPO, NEO) in nonresponders–a 178 
difference not seen in comparisons of cases and controls. IL-10 was significantly higher in responders and 179

CRP was significantly higher in nonresponders, highlighting elevated systemic inflammation as 180 
predictive of failure to respond. To interrogate the importance of individual biomarkers, a logistic 181 
regression model was trained based on these nine biomarkers. This model correctly predicted response 182 
with 68% accuracy on training set data and 73% accuracy on withheld test set data (Fig 4F). Regression 183 
models built using either individual biomarkers or the collective top 4 biomarkers according to random 184 
forest performed poorly, with accuracy ranging from 50-60%. Broadly, these results indicate that 185 
biomarkers of growth, in conjunction with biomarkers of intestinal and systemic inflammation, can 186 
reliably distinguish RUSF responders and nonresponders prior to intervention. 187 
Gut microbiome diversity differs between wasted children and controls 188 
 189 
Next, we explored the fecal microbiome community profiles of cases (including responders and 190 
nonresponders) and controls. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing on stool samples collected at baseline 191 
(pre-intervention) and at several time points post-intervention to identify amplicon sequence variants 192 
(ASVs), representing unique biological sequences that can be assigned a taxonomy. We first looked 193 
broadly at group differences in alpha (within the sample) and beta (between samples) diversity. Alpha 194 
diversity was significantly lower in controls compared to cases (Fig 5A). This was true when measuring 195 
observed ASVs as a measure of richness (how many unique taxa are present) and when measuring 196 
Simpson’s Diversity, which accounts for both richness and evenness (how evenly the relative abundance 197 
of taxa are distributed). Cases and controls also displayed significantly different beta diversity, as 198 
visualized using nonparametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) on a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity matrix 199 
(Fig 5B). These results suggest that wasted children in our cohort had a distinct microbiome from 200 
controls, characterized by increased diversity and greater evenness of taxa.  201 
 202 
We next determined which specific phylogenetic groups were different between cases and controls. 203 
Consistent with the decreased diversity observed in controls versus cases, the community composition of 204 
control samples was largely dominated by Actinobacteriota, whereas this phylum made up a significantly 205 
smaller proportion of the total community in cases (Fig 5C). The lower relative abundance of 206 
Actinobacteriota in cases was compensated by a significant increase in Proteobacteria and trends towards 207 
increased Firmicutes and Bacteroidota relative to controls. These changes were also reflected at the class 208 
level (Fig 5D), with a relative decrease in Actinobacteria in cases and increased Gammaproteobacteria 209 
and trends towards increased Bacteroidia, Negativicutes, and Clostridia.  210 
 211 
Finally, a LASSO regularized, orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) 212 
model was constructed to discriminate between case and control samples and identify ASVs that best 213 
discriminate between groups (Fig 5E). The model outperformed all 1000 randomly permuted models (p < 214 
0.001) and achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 78% (Fig S3A). Variable Importance in Projection 215 
(VIP) scores were plotted for top features and reflected ASV important for discriminating between groups 216 
(absolute value of VIP >1 is an important feature, with the sign of VIP indicating which group it is related 217 
to) (Fig 5F). This analysis identified ASV1620, a member of the Bifidobacterium genus, as particularly 218 
important in discriminating between cases and controls. Univariate analysis showed ASV1620 was 219 
significantly enriched in control samples (Fig S3B). This ASV is a member of the Actinobacteriota 220 
phylum and Bifidobacterium genus, which are known to be important in early life [21]. As LASSO hides 221 
features that are linearly correlated to key driver features, ASVs with high correlation to those identified 222 
in the model may also be significant and are shown in a correlation network (Fig S3C). Taken together, 223 
our results show greater microbiome diversity at the expense of Bifidobacteria species is a signature 224 
feature of undernourished cases prior to RUSF.  225 
 226 
ASV-level differences reliably distinguish responders from non-responders among wasted children 227

We next sought to identify compositional differences in gut microbial communities of RUSF responders 229 
and nonresponders—both baseline differences and longitudinal changes post-intervention. We observed 230 
no significant differences in either alpha or beta diversity between responder and nonresponders prior to 231 
RUSF (Fig 6A-B), indicating the gut microbiota of these groups are broadly more similar to one another, 232 
relative to more striking diversity differences between cases and controls. Community composition in 233 
RUSF-NR mostly consisted of enrichment in Actinobacteriota, whereas RUSF-R exhibited a significantly 234 
lower proportion of Actinobacteriota and increased Proteobacteria (Fig 6C-D), similar to the differences 235 
we observed in cases versus controls. Parallel trends were seen at the class level, where the relative 236 
abundance of Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were significantly higher and lower in RUSF-R. 237 
In addition, we noted trends towards a higher relative baseline abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum 238 
level and Negativicutes at the class level. 239 
 240 
We then generated a LASSO regularized, orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-241 
DA) model to distinguish responders from nonresponders based on gut microbiome composition prior to 242 
RUSF. Remarkably, this model outperformed all 1000 randomly permuted models (p < 0.001) and 243 
achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 93%, indicating distinct differences at the ASV level between 244 
RUSF-R and RUSF-NR (Fig S4A). VIP scores were plotted and used to determine ASVs important for 245 
discriminating between groups (Fig 6E-F), with univariate analysis showing significant enrichment in 246 
several of the important features (Fig S4B).  ASVs with a high correlation (70%) to those identified in the 247 
model that may also be of significance are shown in a heatmap (Fig S4C). This analysis points to a 248 
distinct pre-RUSF microbiome state characterized by increased colonization of Proteobacteria in children 249 
whose ponderal growth markedly improved after RUSF.  250 
 251 
Responders display shifts in gut microbiome composition during RUSF; microbiome composition in 252 
responders and nonresponders converge in the aftermath of RUSF  253 
 254 
We next turned our attention to longitudinal changes in the microbiome over RUSF supplementation. 255 
Alpha diversity increased during the intervention among responders and nonresponders (Fig 7A), a 256 
pattern also observed in controls (Fig S5A). We identified no significant shifts in RUSF-NR microbiota at 257 
the phylum or class levels. In contrast, in RUSF-R, we identified a significant decline in the relative 258 
abundance of Proteobacteria, largely driven by reductions in Gammaproteobacteria and an increase in 259 
Clostridia. Importantly, we observed a robust increase in the relative abundance of Negativicutes in 260 
RUSF-R relative to RUSF-NR (Fig S5B) pre- and post-RUSF (Fig 7B, Fig S7C). In RUSF-NR, taxa 261 
were not immediately different pre- vs. post-intervention. At the family level, shifts in the Negativicutes 262 
class were driven by members of Veillonellaceae, Proteobacteria by members of Enterobacteriaceae, and 263 
Actinobacteria by members of the Bifidobacteriaceae family (Fig 7C).  264 
 265 
To identify specific ASVs associated with RUSF response, we constructed a LASSO regularized OPLS-266 
DA model to discriminate between RUSF-R and RUSF-NR samples immediately post-intervention (12 267 
months of age) (Fig 7D-E). The model outperformed all of 1000 randomly permuted models (p < 0.001) 268 
and achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 98% (Fig S6A). A plot of VIP scores showed several ASVs 269 
as important in discriminating between responder and nonresponder samples post-intervention. ASV2304, 270 
a member of the Lachnoclostridium genus, was the most important feature of RUSF-NR samples (Fig 271 
7E). Univariate analysis showed this ASV to be present significantly more often in nonresponder samples 272 
than in responder samples. The most important microbial feature relevant to RUSF-R samples was 273 
ASV578, a member of the Veillonella genus and Negativicutes class that was present more abundantly in 274 
responders (Fig S6B). ASVs with a high correlation (>70%) to those identified in the model that may also 275 
be of significance are shown in a heatmap (Fig S6C). Together, this analysis shows a RUSF-driven 276 
transformation of the gut microbiome in RUSF-R distinct from that observed in RUSF-NR over the 277 
course of the nutritional intervention. This transformation is characterized by a robust decrease in 278 
Gammaproteobacteria and an increase in Negativicutes.  279

Systemic inflammation identifies RUSF-NR outliers with responder-like microbiome profiles 281 
Among the 30 worst RUSF-NR, we identified seven individual nonresponders with distinct biomarker 282 
profiles relative to either controls or RUSF-R. These profiles were primarily driven by a significant 283 
elevation in biomarkers of systemic inflammation (Fig 8A). We next asked whether these individuals 284 
harbored distinct microbiota relative to other RUSF-NR. The microbiomes of inflamed RUSF-NR 285 
showed greater similarity to RUSF-R than to non-inflamed RUSF-NR (Fig 8B). This was most evidenced 286 
by lower levels of Actinobacteriota and increased levels of Proteobacteria in inflamed versus non-287 
inflamed RUSF-NR. Inflamed RUSF-NR also exhibited distinct growth trajectories, with higher WAZ 288 
scores prior to RUSF followed by marked decreases in WAZ during the intervention. Follow-up analysis 289 
also showed that these infants experienced higher rates of diarrheal episodes and acute respiratory 290 
infections (Fig S7A-B, Supp Table 3). These findings suggest that microbiome structure and function 291 
play an important role in RUSF response; however, systemic inflammation and acute illnesses can 292 
undermine that response.  293 
 294 
Validation of the predictive model 295 
After pinpointing microbial taxa with strong predictive potential, we validated our findings in an 296 
independent Bangladeshi cohort of young children. As limited studies were suitable for validation, we 297 
selected the 2022 study by Chen et al [13]  due to its utilization of a chickpea-based MDCF. We utilized 298 
the data of  60 children who received the MDCF, and categorized them into three groups based on 299 
changes in WAZ during the intervention (Fig S8A). The fecal microbiome was compared between 300 
children showing the most favorable response and those showing the least. Unlike our dataset, at the pre-301 
intervention stage, significant differences in Proteobacteria or Negativicutes abundance in the Chen et al. 302 
study were not seen (Fig S8B). To uncover any consistent microbial taxa with predictive potential across 303 
cohorts, we first used principal component analysis on pre-intervention composition data (Fig S8C) and, 304 
seeing no significant batch effects, trained an OPLSDA model using pre-intervention microbiome data 305 
from the SEEM study and applied it to the pre-intervention validation dataset (Fig S8D). Although our 306 
model identified several taxa significantly linked to response, it only classified patients with 54% 307 
accuracy in the validation dataset. While this accuracy is only marginally better than chance, it 308 
underscores the microbiome composition variations between cohorts and studies. 309 
 310 
Discussion:  311 
 312 
We identified host-microbiome determinants of RUSF efficacy among a birth cohort of rural Pakistani 313 
infants at high risk for moderate and severe acute malnutrition. Through a comprehensive assessment of 314 
1) baseline biomarkers of EED and systemic inflammation, 2) the structure and flux of gut microbial 315 
communities before and after RUSF, and 3) ponderal growth responses to RUSF, we uncovered several 316 
findings with important implications for the evaluation and treatment of acute childhood undernutrition in 317 
LMIC community settings. First, pre-RUSF biomarker profiles reliably distinguished RUSF responders 318 
from nonresponders; children with heightened gut and systemic inflammation were less likely to respond 319 
to supplementation. Second, we identified key baseline differences in the gut microbial community 320 
structure of nourished infants, RUSF responders, and RUSF nonresponders. Third, in contrast to 321 
nonresponders, RUSF responders displayed significant shifts in gut microbiota over the course of 322 
supplementation. Fourth, in a small group of outliers whose gut microbiome would have otherwise 323 
predicted positive RUSF response, high burdens of inflammation and infections undermined RUSF 324 
efficacy. Lastly, the predictive power of these and other measurable host-microbiome factors sets the 325

stage for precision nutrition approaches to not only tailor the formulation of RUSF, or microbiome-326 
directed complementary foods, to achieve greater efficacy but also shape the timing, duration, and 327 
adjunctive therapies to RUSF to promote optimal and durable growth outcomes. 328 
 329 
RUSF responders weighed more at birth, further supporting the role of antenatal care and birth dynamics 330 
in establishing childhood growth trajectories [14]. Univariate comparisons of biomarkers revealed 331 
increased intestinal inflammation in RUSF-NR and increased markers of muscle mass (urinary creatinine) 332 
and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in responders. Our models identified a set of nine biomarkers 333 
with acceptable predictive accuracy for children at risk of RUSF nonresponse. These included established 334 
biomarkers for growth (prealbumin, creatinine, leptin, GLP-2, and IGF-1) as well as commonly measured 335 
markers of gut and systemic inflammation (fecal MPO, serum AGP, and CRP). These biomarkers were 336 
tested because of the known microbial infections in environmental enteropathy [15, 16].  Together, 337 
increased growth biomarkers and anti-inflammatory cytokines may indicate that RUSF-R was primed to 338 
break out of the vicious cycle of inflammation and undernutrition once supplementation began. Our 339 
analysis provides valuable insights into the role of baseline biomarkers in identifying those who may 340 
require longer or additional therapeutic interventions in community settings.       341 
RUSF responders and nonresponders displayed significant differences in microbiome composition pre-342 
intervention. Although diversity indices were similar, responders harbored higher levels of 343 
Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes and lower levels of Actinobacteria prior to RUSF. A PLS-DA 344 
model trained to predict who would respond to RUSF based on the relative abundance of pre-intervention 345 
ASVs was able to classify responders with 93% accuracy, identifying several ASVs correlated with 346 
response versus nonresponse. Another key observation was that nonresponders exhibited minimal 347 
changes in gut microbiome composition, whereas responders displayed a high degree of microbiome 348 
restructuring over the course of supplementation. Gammaproteobacteria, a large class of bacteria that 349 
includes the pathobionts Klebsiella, Salmonella, and Shigella, were found in higher numbers before the 350 
intervention and decreased significantly thereafter in responders. We speculate that the high prevalence of 351 
these facultative anaerobes prior to intervention may have contributed to earlier growth faltering in these 352 
children. RUSF appeared to sufficiently restructure the microbiome of responders towards growth-353 
conferring taxa, with significant increases in Negativicutes, including Megasphera and Veillonella. 354 
Recent studies show these taxa ferment chickpeas to release beneficial metabolites [17], which might 355 
account for their increased presence in Acha Mum responders. 356 
In concordance with prior observations that inflammation and repeated infections abrogate catch-up 357 
growth in childhood [18, 19], we found that nonresponders with the highest burden of inflammation, 358 
diarrhea, and respiratory infections harbored microbiomes more similar to responders rather than typical 359 
RUSF nonresponders. This may indicate that this small group of infants was primed to respond to RUSF 360 
but derailed by acute illness and inflammation. Hence, gut and systemic inflammation and the state of the 361 
gut microbiome may jointly coordinate the metabolic response to RUSF. Future studies should explore 362 
targeting the reduction of acute inflammation and/or infection before or during the administration of 363 
RUSF as a strategy to increase RUSF efficacy [20, 21].  364 
We attempted to validate the findings of this study in another cohort of malnourished children. We found 365 
that while the pre-intervention time point data could predict response with high accuracy in this dataset, 366 
the key taxa that distinguished responders and nonresponders differed from our cohort. While the Chen et 367 
al dataset was the best match for our study and used a chickpea-based intervention, there were several key 368 
differences in their study design. First, while our study took place in an arid rural region in Pakistan, the 369 
validation study occurred in Dhaka's humid urban environment. Second, while our study included 370 
children with both SAM and MAM, the validation study included only children with MAM. Finally, in 371 
our study, the intervention began at 9 months of life, whereas the validation study took place between the 372

12th and 18th months of life. Together, these factors may all contribute to the different trends observed in 373 
microbiome restructuring.  374 
This study benefited from several strengths. First, we included well-nourished controls from the same 375 
rural settings who did not require RUSF, providing a set of local, age-matched controls. Second, we 376 
tested various blood, stool, and urine biomarkers to distinguish relative contributions from EED versus 377 
systemic inflammation. Third, the longitudinal collection of fecal samples enabled us to observe the 378 
restructuring of the microbiome and correlate this restructuring with the RUSF response. Lastly, by 379 
monitoring anthropometrics up to 24 months of age, we explored the intervention's long-term effects and 380 
identified delayed onset improvements in ponderal growth among RUSF nonresponders. The limitations 381 
of our study include performing serial 16S rRNA fecal analyses on only 28 to 30 samples per group. Our 382 
focus on extreme RUSF responders and nonresponders to interrogate WAZ-associated microbial taxa may 383 
have missed more subtle host-microbiome interaction in children who showed a mild benefit from the 384 
intervention. We did not collect fecal samples during the intervention, which might have better captured 385 
the dynamics of microbiome transformation. With the limited sequencing depth provided by 16S rRNA 386 
analysis, confirming any potential probiotic/symbiotic candidates in gnotobiotic animal models or human 387 
nonclinical models, such as EED-on-a-chip [22], would be important prior to clinical interventions. 388 
Lastly, although machine learning and other computational tools allowed us to identify important ASVs, 389 
the heterogeneous nature of gut microbiota means important features should be interpreted with caution.  390 
 391 
For future studies of RUSF, we recommend exploring longer durations of intervention, especially in 392 
primary nonresponders—a group in whom we observed later convergence in the transformation of several 393 
ASVs. In responders, growth improvements with RUSF were durable; however, continued monitoring 394 
and support during critical growth periods is warranted. The correlations we identified between 395 
birthweight and RUSF response at 9 months of age underscore the importance of healthy pregnancy and 396 
birth anthropometrics in establishing growth trajectories. Our finding that common illnesses and 397 
inflammation undermined RUSF response re-emphasizes the importance of clean water, sanitation, and 398 
hygiene practices and access to essential drugs in optimizing the individual and community impact of 399 
RUSF. Adjunct therapy with probiotics tailored to RUSF or MDCF composition and the predominant 400 
infant gut microbial signatures of at-risk populations may enhance outcomes and is an ongoing area of 401 
study [23]. We suggest that future studies aimed at identifying bacteria associated with response to a 402 
nutritional intervention be designed to include multiple sites to better account for and understand how 403 
cohort setting impacts response. Finally, for children with either microbiome or inflammatory states 404 
associated with nonresponse, administering an antibiotic or anti-inflammatory medication prior to RUSF 405 
might conceivably prime the microbiome and gut for a more beneficial ponderal growth response.  406 
 407 
We conclude that birth weight, gut and systemic inflammation, and gut microbial community composition 408 
profoundly influence the ponderal growth response of acutely undernourished infants to RUSF. The 409 
transformation of gut microbial community structure over RUSF supplementation further shapes this 410 
response. Multi-centered studies designed to validate promising biomarkers, microbial targets, and RUSF 411 
formulations–using harmonized methods across LMIC settings where the burden of acute and chronic 412 
childhood undernutrition is greatest–are urgently needed to develop scalable solutions toward global 413 
reductions in childhood wasting, underweight, and stunting. 414

Study participant details: Study participants were drawn from the SEEM-Pakistan birth cohort study 417 
(n=416) conducted in Matiari, Sindh. We selected participants for microbiome analysis based on the 418 
availability of longitudinally collected fecal samples. SEEM-Pakistan explored gut tissue histology, 419

The study was approved by the Aga Khan University Ethical Review Committee (ERC # 2021-0535-421 
19973), and written informed consent was obtained from the participant’s parents. The study was 422 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03588013, and the SEEM protocols were published [24].  423 
Newborns were enrolled at 0-3 months of age and followed monthly for growth monitoring. On the basis 424 
of two consecutive months of anthropometric measurements, 9-month-old infants were classified either as 425 
controls (WLZ ≥0, LAZ ≥-1) or wasted cases (WLZ ≤-2). Out of 350 cases, 187 were selected for RUSF 426 
nutritional intervention after not responding to a caregiver nutrition education program. Response to the 427 
Acha Mum RUSF intervention was monitored as improvement in WLZ ≥ -2 at one week after post-428 
intervention, irrespective of their WLZ at the pre-intervention timepoint. 41% of cases responded in the 429 
SEEM study. For this study, of those 41% of cases who responded to the intervention, we selected 30 430 
children with best response that is a maximum gain in WAZ (change > 0.5) and classified them as RUSF-431 
R while from those 59% nonresponders; we selected the children (n=30) who experienced a decline in 432 
WAZ or no change and labeled them as RUSF-NR . The fecal samples of these thirty best responders and 433 
thirty worst non-responders based on the change in WAZ were selected for the 16S analysis in this sub-434 
study.  435 
Data collection: Information on general demographic characteristics was collected by trained community 436 
health workers through interviews with the mothers, which included children’s birth data, breastfeeding 437 
history, and parental parameters. Anthropometric measurements were performed using standard 438 
procedure and equipment, with weight measured to the nearest 20g precision electronic scale (TANITA 439 
1584) and length to the nearest 1 mm using a rigid length board with a movable footpiece. These 440 
measurements were collected monthly for up to 24 months and converted to z scores using the WHO 441 
Anthro 3.2 application. Based on established cut-offs for nutritional indicators, the participants were 442 
categorized as stunted (LAZ< -2), underweight (WAZ < -2), at risk of wasting (WLZ <-1 and ≥ -2), 443 
moderately wasted (WLZ < -2) and severely wasted (WLZ < -3), respectively.  444 
Sample collection for inflammatory biomarkers: Blood, fecal, and urine samples were collected from 445 
participants at nine months of age (Fig. 1A). 1 to 2 ml of blood was collected from which serum was 446 
aliquoted in small volumes to avoid freeze-thawing and transported at 4°C from the field site lab to the 447 
Infectious Disease Research Laboratory (IDRL) where they were stored at -80°C until processed. 448 
Commercial ELISA kits were used for estimation of GLP-2 (USCN, Life Sciences Inc, Wuhan, China) 449 
while CRP, ferritin, and AGP were analyzed using a Hitachi 902 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Holliston, 450 
MA), and IGF-1 was measured using a LIAISON (Diasorin Saluggia (VC) Italy). All assays were 451 
performed following manufacturer protocols. For fecal samples, the child's caretaker collected the sample 452 
using a wooden spatula and put it into a clean container provided in the stool collection kit. The fecal 453 
sample was transferred into multiple cryogenic vials for long-term storage. Commercial ELISA kits were 454 
used for the estimation of MPO (Immunodiagnostic AG, Stubenwald-Allee, and Bensheim) and NEO 455 
(GenWay Biotech, San Diego. CA). Fecal lipocalin (LCN2) was measured by DuoSet ELISA DY1757.  456 
All plates were read on Biorad iMark (Hercules, CA) plate reader.  457 
For the evaluation of serum cytokines, a commercially available MILLIPLEX MAP Human 458 
Cytokine/Chemokine (MERCK) kit was used. The screening panel including IFN-γ (interferon- γ), IL-10, 459 
IL-12 (IL-12p70), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 (Interferon-gamma-induced protein 10, also called as 460 
CXCL10), MCP-1(Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, also called as CCL2) and TNF-α (Tumor 461 
necrosis factor) as per manufacturer’s instructions using Bioplex- 200 instrument. The data was analyzed 462 
using Bioplex Manager 6.1.  463 
Administration of nutritional intervention: Enrolled cases with WLZ < -2 at nine months were selected 464 
for nutritional intervention. Acha Mum, a ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF), was given at a dose of 465 
one sachet per day to cases with MAM (WLZ scores between -2 and -3), while children with SAM (WLZ 466

< -3) were administered sachets as per child’s weight (200 kcal/kg/day) [25]. Acha Mum composition is 467 
provided in the supplementary material. This eight-week intervention was monitored through weekly visits 468 
by the local team to document compliance, side effects, needs for medical assistance, and other details. 469 
Compliance was calculated (weekly) based on the empty wrappers returned by mothers [Compliance = (Total 470 
packet used/total packet given) *100]. One week after the completion of the intervention, the response was 471 
measured as the overall change in the WAZ of the children.  472 
Longitudinal fecal sample collection for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing: Mothers of study 473 
participants were trained to collect the fecal samples and provided with mobile cards for timely 474 
communication with the collection team in the field. As described above, the mothers collected the fecal 475 
sample and sent an immediate message to the field team to pick up the sample within 30 minutes. Overall, 476 
four samples were collected from each child: one sample at nine months to capture microbiota at the pre -477 
intervention stage, while three samples were collected at twelve, thirteen, and eighteen months to evaluate 478 
post-intervention taxa (Fig. 1B). Fresh samples were transferred into a pre-chilled cryovial, snapped to the 479 
aluminum cryo cone and placed into a freezing container (Coleman) at 2° to 8°C. The time taken from the 480 
passage of fresh stools to being snap -frozen in a dry shipper was less than 30 minutes. The Coleman was 481 
carried in liquid nitrogen dry shipper to the local laboratory and later shifted to IDRL, AKU on dry ice 482 
where samples were stored at -80C until shipped to BGI Genomics (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute). 483 
A 30ng qualified DNA template was tested for sample integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis and 484 
concentration by a microplate reader (Qubit fluorometer). The quantified samples (6 -100ng/uL) were 485 
normalized to 30ng DNA per reaction. fusion primers were designed to include Illumina adapter sequences, 486 
an 8-nucleotide index sequence, and a gene -specific primer and added to the Polymerase chain reaction 487 
(PCR) reaction system. All PCR products were purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads, dissolved in an 488 
Elution Buffer, and labeled for library construction. Library size and concentration were detected by Agilent 489 
2100 Bioanalyzer. Qualified libraries were sequenced pair -end on the HiSeq 2500 platform according to 490 
their insert size. The raw reads were filtered to remove the adapter and low-quality bases. Paired-end reads 491 
were added to the tags by Fast length Adjustment of the Short read program (FLASH, v12.11). The 492 
sequence data are deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Alpha rarefaction curves were 493 
generated to assess the effect of sampling depth on ASV abundance (S FigA). The plots indicate that the 494 
detection of ASVs had already attained a plateau of 60,000 reads. This trend was separately confirmed in 495 
the three groups.    496 
16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis and statistical analysis: Sequence analysis was performed in R 497 
using DADA2 (version 1.22.0) [26]. The forward read was truncated to 200 base pairs, and reads with 498 
ambiguous ‘N’ bases and >2 expected errors were removed. Chimeras were removed. Forward and 499 
reverse reads were aligned, resulting sequence variant counts (SVs) and taxonomic calls were assigned 500 
using the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database. Models were created, and data were analyzed in R using 501 
the following packages: Phyloseq (v. 1.38.0), caret (v. 6.0.92), GGplot2 (v. 3.3.6), mixOmics (6.18.1) and 502 
in python using Jupyter notebooks, pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Venn diagrams were 503 
created using the R packages VennDiagram (1.7.3), and ggvenn (0.1.9). Radar plots were created using 504 
the R package fsmb (0.7.3). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the alpha diversity and genus 505 
relative abundances. To calculate statistics, either the Python package Scipy.Stats package or R was used.  506 
Model generation: The R package randomForest (4.7-1.1) was used to generate a Random Forest (RF) 507 
model to classify the samples according to the response to the nutritional intervention and determine 508 
important features. Relative SV counts were used to train the RF. The forest used has 1000 trees with a 509 
node split (mtry) set to the default of the square root of the number of samples. Biomarkers that were 510 
important for classifying patient response to the nutritional intervention at 9 months were also identified 511 
using an RF model. Patients with more than one missing test and biomarkers with more than 3 missing 512 
patients were removed. After this filtering, we had 148 observations (children) and 23 variables 513 
(biomarkers listed in the supplementary file).  514

O-PLSDA models were created using MATLAB using a custom pipeline initially developed by Remziye 515 
Wessel. Lasso regularization is used better to guide the feature selection and model fitting process and 516 
improves classification by allowing the selection of a subset of the covariates instead of using all of them. 517 
Here, a 5-fold cross-validation was repeated 1000 times to calibrate the model's performance. Permutation 518 
testing results shuffling the labels of the samples show the goodness of fit of the model vs a null 519 
distribution, and the cross-validation accuracy showing the stability of the model are reported in 520 
supplemental figures. Principal component analysis was performed in R and plotted using ggbiplot (0.55). 521 
Correlations between SV abundance and biomarker levels were plotted using corrplot (0.92). 522 
All code and data are available on github (https://github.com/gabehanson/SEEM_microbiome_analysis) 523 
Validation modeling: 524 
Raw sequencing data from Chen et al [13] was processed in R according to the DADA2 pipeline as 525 
described above. Change in WAZ was calculated by comparing the WAZ score pre-intervention (day 0 in 526 
the original paper) and post-intervention (day 90 in the original paper). Children were ranked according to 527 
the change in WAZ and the best 20 and worst 20 responders were compared. Data was transformed into 528 
percent composition at the phylum, class, and family levels. These data were imported into Python and 529 
combined to form a matrix with percent composition data across the 3 taxonomic levels, and this process 530 
was repeated for the SEEM data. Principal component Analysis and PLS modeling were performed using 531 
the sklearn package in Python [27]. 532

†Values for between-group difference at baseline were derived from a linear model predicting anthropometric 646 
features at start of treatment as a function of treatment group. Values for between-group difference in growth rate 647 
per month during the treatment period and during follow-up were derived from a mixed-effects linear model 648 
predicting anthropometric features as a function of the interaction between treatment group and the number of weeks 649 
since the initiation of nutritional supplementation after adjustment for the baseline variables as well as number of 650 
weeks of treatment, treatment group, and a random intercept for each participant to account for the within-651 
participant correlation. Positive values indicate a faster growth rate in responders. 652 
‡ Values for the rate of growth per month during six months of follow-up were derived from a mixed-effects linear 653 
model. This model predicts anthropometric features as a function of the number of weeks since the initiation of 654 
nutritional supplementation after adjustment for the baseline variables plus a random intercept for each participant to 655 
account for the within-participant correlation.  656

0.001). (D) Scatter plot of the X scores on latent variables 1 and 2 (LV1 & LV2), where each point 733 
represents one sample. (E) Bar plot shows the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores, artificially 734 
oriented in the direction of loadings on LV1 and colored according to their association with responder or 735 
nonresponder samples. VIP scores > 1 indicates a variable with greater than average influence on the 736 
projection. 737 
Figure 8: RUSF nonresponders with high levels of inflammation harbor fecal microbiota that 738 
resemble those of responders. (A)  Principal component analysis displaying the relationship between 739 
biomarkers and cytokines measured pre-intervention from patients with matching microbiome data in the 740 
responders (n=30), nonresponders (n=30) and control groups (n=28). Black circles denote nonresponder 741 
samples with high levels of inflammation selected for downstream analysis. (B)  Comparison of the 742 
average relative abundance of microbial taxa at the phylum level in responder, nonresponder, and 743 
inflamed nonresponder stool samples prior to the nutritional intervention. (C) Longitudinal change in 744 
WAZ score for control, responder, nonresponder, and inflamed nonresponder children over the first two 745 
years of life. 746 
List of Supplementary Materials 747 
Fig S1: Responders and Nonresponders show similar compliance patterns during the nutritional 748 
intervention: (A) Adherence to nutritional intervention by the group as shown by the percentage of 749 
Acha-mum packets consumed out of the total packets distributed for each child during the intervention. 750 
(B) The mean number of vomiting episodes per week of the intervention in each group and error bars 751 
show standard deviation. (C) Mean number of diarrheal episodes per week of the intervention in each 752 
group, error bars show standard deviation. 753 
Fig S2: PCA of cytokines in SEEM cohort measured at 9 months colored by nutritional status. 754 
Arrows show loadings for each variable. Principal component analysis of serum, urine and fecal 755 
biomarker profiles from (A) the larger SEEM cohort, wasted children (n=148) and healthy aged-756 
matched children (n=39) and (B) wasted cases (n=60) and controls (n=28).  757 
Fig S3: Additional OPLS-DA figures for Fig 5 (A) Results of permutation testing for OPLSDA model 758 
in figure 5. The plot shows a histogram of cross-validation accuracy for 1000 randomly permuted models. 759 
The correctly labeled model is shown as a red star. (B) Jitter plots showing ASV counts per sample for 760 
VIPs identified in OPLSDA analysis. (C) The heat map shows a correlation between important ASVs 761 
identified in OPLS-DA and other ASVs with >70% correlation, which were removed as linearly 762 
correlated. The X-axis has only important features labeled, while the y-axis has correlated, and important 763 
features labeled. 764
