Expected to Work for Free:
Social Work’s Complicity in its
Own Devaluation
Erin D. Carreon1
Abstract
By reviewing the historical gender, race, and class-based devaluation of community and social ser-
vice work, this in-brief article reveals how the profession of social work continues to contribute to
this devaluation through expectations for unremunerated work. The profession communicates
these expectations through the Code of Ethics, unpaid studentﬁeld placements, and managerialist
workplace stratiﬁcation. Social work professional, educational, and employing organizations have a
responsibility to demonstrate the value of social service workers and the communities they serve by
eliminating expectations for unpaid labor, encouraging staff to track and report unpaid hours, and
supporting the organizing efforts of the social service workforce.

The U.S. economy depends on unrecognized acts of care to hold together our communities and work-
places (Folbre, 2001). Over time, the economy’s simultaneous dependence on and devaluation of
care has led to a shortage of care workers toﬁll the roles society needs to thrive (Fraser, 2016).
As the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this shortage, policymakers started to move toward improv-
ing job quality for workers providing child, elder, and health care. The community and social service
workforce has been neglected in this discourse even though they too provided essential care through-
out the pandemic for low pay and at high personal cost. The obligation to perform this work has dis-
proportionately fallen on women of color due to both their social proximity to those with unmet
needs and discriminatory barriers to moreﬁnancially valued jobs (Banks, 2020; Hodges, 2020).
This brief explores the ways in which the social work profession is itself complicit in the historical
and present devaluation of theﬁeld.

The Devaluation of Care Work in the U.S. Historical Context
The years following the American Revolution provided fertile ground for growing essentialist justi-
ﬁcations that transformed existing gendered and racializeddivisions of labor into gendered and
racialized “deﬁnition[s] of labor” (Boydston, 1990, p. 55; Roediger, 2007). White men secured a
privileged position in new wage labor markets by embracing the essentialist assumptions that
women were naturally predisposed to caregiving and that Black people (regardless of gender)
were predisposed to enslavement and physically-demanding agrarian labor. The romanticization
of the domestic sphere as a feminized retreat from the masculinized alienation of industrial labor con-
tributed to the development of thecult of true womanhoodin the nineteenth century, setting expec-
tations of submission and altruism for white women while obscuring the exertion involved in care
work (Leotti, 2022). At the same time, a series of controlling images about Black women served
to dehumanize them to justify their exploitation, including the depiction of themammy as a“faithful,
obedient domestic servant,” (Collins, 2002, p. 72).
These expectations normalized women’s engagement in unpaid and underpaid care work. Trade
unions dominated by white men reiﬁed labor divisions by excluding women and people of color from
much unionized work (Du Bois, 1918; Hartmann, 1979). Even feminist social reformers contributed
by embracing the nuclear family ideal and emphasizing the helplessness of women to achieve policy
changes (Kelley, 1897/1998; Kemp & Brandwein, 2010; McDonagh, 1999). With few job prospects
for middle-class women, many volunteered in charity organization societies, settlement houses,
social clubs, and reform movements. The idea that volunteer work is altruistic, while working for
survival or wages is corruptive continues to obscure the contributions made by racialized and
working-class women to the development of the social work profession (Wright et al., 2021).
These contributions include traditions of mutual aid, community leadership, and activism
(Carlton-LaNey, 2001), as well as indirect support through devalued domestic labor that afforded
more privileged women the time to volunteer.
The introduction of the“family wage”ideal in the early twentieth century further reiﬁed the norm
of the nuclear family, promising the highest wages to white men. While World War II offered new
job opportunities to many women, after the war men again pushed women out of the best paying jobs,
aided by the media and reduced childcare supports. Even in the feminizedﬁeld of social work, men
disproportionately assumed leadership positions with scientiﬁc expertise displacing maternalism as
the profession’s dominant rhetoric (Kemp & Brandwein, 2010).
As U.S. factories began to lay off large numbers of workers in the 1970s, the care economy
grew to new proportions in response to increasing demands for professional care due to the
aging population, the growing number of women in the workforce, and the hollowing out of
the middle class (Dwyer, 2013). These feminized and racialized jobs— which evolved not only
from volunteer work, but also from legacies of domestic servitude, slavery, and the struggle
for community survival (Glenn, 1992; Harley & Logan, 2002)– did not have the same levels
of union representation, wages, beneﬁts, and employment stability as the industrial jobs that
were lost (Fraser, 2016).
Unpaid Care Work as Both an Essentialist Expectation
and a Form of Resistance
Women of color have long engaged in unpaid community care work as a strategy of survival to resist
racial oppression and meet the needs of communities disregarded by the larger society (Banks, 2020).
This tradition of resistance has carried over to social service workers who often do extra work to
make up for gaps in the social safety net (Cunningham et al., 2017; Stacey, 2005). In a study of
social workers, Baines and von den Broek (2017) found:

One of the most widespread resistance/coping practices was undertaking unpaid care work such as
extending their work hours, taking work home, working through lunch and breaks, and so forth.
While these practices involved self-exploitation and extended the capacity of the agency to provide ser-
vices, most workers ascribed oppositional meanings to these activities such as pushing back at an uncar-
ing management, government and/or larger society. (p. 135)
This quote demonstrates how workers in social service occupations often take on unpaid work to
preserve “their own ethic of care” (Stacey, 2005, p. 838). These workers will continue to do so
whether the social work profession encourages them to or not. However, encouraging workers to
assume these burdens makes the profession complicit in pushing the costs of care onto the most mar-
ginalized populations. Without a structural solution, social service workers with the closest proximity
to those with unmet needs will continue to bear the brunt.
Social Work’s Expectations for Unpaid Work
There are three primary ways the social work profession presently contributes to its own gender, race,
and class-based devaluation: (1) through theﬁrst ethical principle in the National Association of
Social Workers’(NASW) Code of Ethics that encourages social workers to volunteer a portion of
their time; (2) through unpaid studentﬁeld placements; (3) through stratiﬁcation in social service
organizations.
NASW Code of Ethics
Although NASW introduced theﬁrst Code of Ethics for professional social workers in 1960, the
expectation to volunteer ﬁrst appeared in the 1997 revision and remains prominently situated
within the Code’s very ﬁrst ethical principle:“Social workers are encouraged to volunteer some
portion of their professional skills with no expectation of signiﬁcant ﬁnancial return (pro bono
service)” (NASW, 2021). On a superﬁcial level this language appears gender and race neutral, espe-
cially in its use of the law profession’s “pro bono”terminology, which is notably absent from the code
of ethics of other helping professionals such as physicians, nurses, and educators (Burghardt, 2021).
In the social work context, where median pay is less than half that of lawyers (BLS, 2022), this ask
exacerbates the historical feminized and racialized patterns that undergird the devaluing of care work.
The 1994–1997 NASW Code of Ethics Revision Committee made its appeal to voluntarism in the
spirit of promoting altruism (Reamer, 2006, p. 14). The sociopolitical context was undeniably inﬂu-
ential. The committee drafted and published this revision in the wake of heightened neoliberalism
and Clinton-era austerity politics. While the state divested from supporting social welfare, individ-
uals who cared for struggling relatives, friends, and communities were left to accept theﬁnancial
obligations of supporting them through voluntarism, often by assuming debt through increasing
access to credit (Cooper, 2017). Ronald Reagan was one of the staunchest promoters of this
scheme, asserting“Voluntarism is a means of delivering social services more effectively and preserv-
ing our individual freedoms” (Reagan, 1981). Encouraging social workers to volunteer aligns with
this call to reduce government responsibility for social services and assistance. This rhetoric also
privileges the freedom of white men by obscuring the feminized and racialized nature of the labor
of caring for family and community.
Field Placements
Another way the social work profession embeds the expectation for unremunerated labor is through
students’ﬁeld placements. Social work students fund their work in these placements by accumulating
14 Afﬁlia: Feminist Inquiry in Social Work 39(1)
debt. Over the last several decades, the increased use of student loans forﬁnancing post-secondary
education has shifted theﬁnancial costs of training from the state to workers (Cooper, 2017). Social
work graduates coded as Black and Hispanic report especially high debt burdens at $92,000 and
$79,000, respectively (Salsberg et al., 2020). Outside of social work, physicians have long been
paid during their training as medical interns and residents (Harmon, 1978). Businesses have also
moved towards paid internships to promote more equity of opportunity across race and class lines
and to comply with the Federal Labor Standards Act, which stipulates that employers must pay
interns if they substitute for regular employees or if the business beneﬁts from their work (Keiser
et al., 2013). Unpaid social workﬁeld placements not only exacerbate theﬁnancial burdens of train-
ing and promote inequity of opportunity, but also socialize students into a workplace culture that
legitimates expectations for unremunerated work.
Workplace Stratiﬁcation
The social work profession’s normalization of unpaid and underpaid labor trickles down from social
workers who occupy managerial and supervisory positions to the entire social services workforce,
including to workers at the bottom of workplace and identity-based hierarchies who receive little
autonomy, stability, pay, and opportunity for advancement (Laubach, 2005; Watkins-Hayes,
2009). To justify expectations that these workers put in unpaid overtime or take on extra responsi-
bilities, employers and clients engage theone-of-the-family concept originally used to justify the
exploitation of domestic workers (Nadasen, 2015; Stacey, 2005) in which all staff are expected to
“share the same (management) goals” (Cunningham et al., 2017, p. 374) even when they do not
reap equitable beneﬁts. This is especially problematic given the increasing polarization of wage dis-
tributions in care work occupations since the early 1980s (Dwyer, 2013).
Market pressures to adopt managerialist practices that prioritize productivity, accountability, efﬁ-
ciency, and standardization over social work mission and values exacerbate expectations for unpaid
work by increasing work pace, case load size, and documentation requirements while reducing super-
visory supports (Zelnick & Abramovitz, 2020). For example, Stacey (2005) found that home care
aides supervised by social workers reported that“the inattentiveness of agencies shifted responsibil-
ity–and risk— into their untrained hands”(p. 841). These pressures can also lead agencies to neglect to
consider frontline workers’ perspectives on how to best meet client needs, pushing workers to go
beyond their job descriptions toﬁll service gaps outside of work hours or with their own resources
(Baines & von den Broek, 2017).
Conclusion & Implications
An historical review of the devaluation of community and social service work exposes problematic
practices that remain within the social work profession, impeding job improvement. The roots of the
devaluation lie in the race and class-based dehumanization of the communities that social work
serves as well as the historical essentialist assumption that care work comes naturally to women.
This assumption and division of labor serves the accumulation of wealth, which depends on care
work to keep the economy operating, even as it devalues it.
In the context of austerity-induced market pressures, when the social work profession encourages
social workers to volunteer their labor it becomes complicit with pushing the cost of providing care
on to students and those at the bottom of organizational hierarchies, exacerbating structural inequities
based on gender, race, and class. This happens as social service agencies adopt managerialist prac-
tices that give the lowest-paid workers and unpaid interns more responsibilities and less supervisory
support (Zelnick & Abramovitz, 2020).

Social work activists are already drawing attention and offering remedies for the issues high-
lighted in this article. For example, the Social Worker Equity Campaign has proposed language to
revise the Code of Ethics (SWEC, 2022), the student-led Payment for Placements (P4P) movement
has brought its demands for paid ﬁeld placements to over three dozen schools of social work
(Arrojas, 2023), and social service workers are starting local grassroots organizations to improve
their working conditions and organize across the sector (Zelnick et al., 2022).
Schools of social work have varied in their responsiveness to the P4P movement since its emer-
gence in 2021 (Arrojas, 2023). As it continues to grow, schools need to step up to develop funding
strategies, such as seeking funds from private donors, university endowments, grants, and public
appropriations like the federal work-study program. For example, University of Michigan ’s
School of Social Work formed a student-faculty commission that worked with the NASW state
chapter and other schools to successfully support state legislation funding public school social
work placements (Michigan Senate Bill 1012) and created a fund to encourage private donations,
yet still has more to do to fund all placements (Rich, 2022). In addition, schools of social work
should take advantage of and alert incoming students to CSWE’s policy permitting students who
are working in relevant positions to complete theirﬁeld placements at their place of employment
(Commissions on Accreditation & Educational Policy, 2022). National social work organizations
like NASW and CSWE will also need to work with the P4P movement to develop more universal
approaches for funding placements.
Social work professional associations, schools, and agencies should also prioritize addressing
workplace stratiﬁcation by (1) actively and explicitly supporting the organizing and collective
action of community and social service workers and their clients, (2) encouraging workers to
track the unpaid time they contribute to make this labor more visible to funders and the public,
and (3) removing barriers to career advancement for workers at the bottom of workplace hierarchies.
These issues require the profession’s urgent action to better equip social service agencies to commit
to social work values over market pressures (Zelnick & Abramovitz, 2020). It is only by recognizing
the dignity and worth of students and social service workers that theﬁeld will manage to address the
crisis of care it currently faces, a crisis that is increasingly evident in agencies’persistent high turn-
over rates and stafﬁng shortages as workers refuse to continue carrying the burden of the costs of care
through their endurance of poor and inequitable working conditions.
