Listening to speech in the presence of irrelevant sounds is ubiq uitous in
the modern world, but is generally acknowledged to be both eﬀort ful and
unpleasant. Here we argue that this problem arises largely in circumstances that
our human auditory system has not evolved to accommodate. The so undscapes
of the Anthropocene are frequently characterized by an overabund ance of
sound sources, the vast majority of which are functionally irrele vant to a given
listener. The problem of listening to speech in such environme nts must be
solved by an auditory system that is not optimized for this tas k. Building on
our previous work linking attention to eﬀortful listening and incorporating an
active inference approach, we argue that the answers to these quest ions have
implications not just for the study of human audition. They are also signiﬁcant for
the development and broad awareness of hearing aids and cochlear i mplants,
as well as other auditory technologies such as earbuds, immersive auditory
environments, and systems for human-machine interaction.

/one.tnum Introduction
The Anthropocene, a term referring to our current era within the geological epoch
of the Holocene, is marked by human activities that radically alter our soundscapes,
see
Habib et al. (2007); Swaddle et al. (2015); Slabbekoorn (2018) . Modern soundscapes
incorporate sounds produced by large numbers of people, traﬃc, machinery, phones,
radios, televisions, etc. but also the indirect sounds produced by reverberations from
installed man-made objects and infrastructure. In the acoustically rich and complex
soundscape of the Anthropocene, the amount and variety of unimportant and unwanted
sound subsumed as ”noise” has steadily increased (
Habib et al., 2007 ; Slabbekoorn, 2018).
The development of transportation systems, encompassing vehicles, aircraft,
and maritime vessels, has extended noise pollution into previously remote areas.
Industrialization, through activities such as mining and energy production, further
exacerbates noise pollution. These drastic changes in the soundscape clearly impact wildlife
but also human habitats (
Habib et al., 2007 ; Swaddle et al., 2015 ; Slabbekoorn, 2018 ).
Similarly, anthropogenic climate change has indirect eﬀects on natural soundscapes by
altering weather patterns, habitats, and animal behavior, but also reshapes regional sound
compositions critical to human wellbeing (
Lorenzi et al., 2023 ).
Frontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org

Overall, the Anthropocene has ushered in a notable escalation
in human-induced noise pollution, necessitating concerted eﬀorts
in sound monitoring, regulatory measures, and the adoption of
quieter technologies to mitigate its adverse eﬀects on ecosystems,
wildlife, and human health.
With respect to anthropogenic changes that directly aﬀect
human listening, the most signiﬁcant of these is urbanization,
which has introduced heightened levels of human-generated
sounds, and concentrated humans together in unprecedented
numbers.
Thus, there has been a change in the soundscape, but also in
what we need to get from the soundscape. In earlier eras such as
the Pleistocene epoch, the time period in which modern humans
evolved (
Tooby and Cosmides, 1992 ), listening to the non-human
world was much more important for survival, for example in order
to avoid threats and achieve goals (hunting, gathering, etc.). Sudden
and/or high-intensity, ”attention-grabbing” sounds were likely to
be important for survival, potentially signaling signiﬁcant changes
in the immediate environment, and thus early auditory systems
(i.e., those inherited by early hominins) would likely have already
evolved to treat them with priority. Surrounding speech was likely
produced by known individuals, and was likely to be important for
social interaction and, ultimately, survival. In the Anthropocene,
we use our senses in a very diﬀerent way than in the deep past. We
are (mostly) not threatened by anything that makes sound but is not
human. A sudden sound like the breaking of a nearby branch, or the
warning call of a bird or small mammal, is functionally irrelevant to
most humans in the Anthropocene. Even the sound of a neighbor’s
car door slamming, or the clatter of glasses in a restaurant kitchen,
while attention-demanding, is generally functionally irrelevant.
The relative signiﬁcance of exogenously-directed auditory attention
has changed radically in many modern contexts, typically with far
less relevance to immediate survival except, quite notably, in the
case of avoiding traﬃc. And yet, despite the decline in the ﬁtness
beneﬁt of orienting toward sudden, loud, warning-like sounds,
there are ever more sounds in the environment that may cause an
involuntary switch of attention—for instance, the squeal of a tram,
the slam of a door, a car horn. Even though none of these sounds
may be relevant, they all exhibit acoustic properties that make them
attentionally demanding, i.e., distracting, and the repeated capture
of attention by irrelevant sounds quickly becomes annoying and
stressful.
Using careful but extremely incomplete phylogenetic
information from
Ackermann et al. (2014); Gintis (2011); Chen and
Wiens (2020) , we have loosely sketched the changing complexity
of soundscapes in urbanized areas (see also Slabbekoorn, 2018 )
and auditory capacity in a conceptual time relation. The point is to
show that evolutionary timescales and the timescale of changing
soundscapes of the Anthropocene diﬀer vividly. Here, we are
deliberately vague as to what exactly constitutes auditory capacity,
though for the present, we can roughly deﬁne it as the ability for
sound processing and production in acoustic communication in
vertebrates (in the Mesozoic Era) and our lineage in primates later
in the Cenozoic Era. In primates, sophisticated vocal learning,
speech, and comprehensive musicality seem to be speciﬁc to
humans ( Homo sapiens ) (
Dichter et al., 2018 ; Aboitiz, 2018 ; Patel,
2021), though some aspects of spoken language were likely present
in other now-extinct Homo species, including neanderthalis
(Conde-Valverde et al., 2021 ) and erectus (Swedell and Plummer,
2019; Everett, 2017 ). In fact, auditory capacity has not changed
much since Homo sapiens appeared (approx. 300,000–200,000
years ago), see
Everett (2017) . For a more general review on the
development of acoustic communication and auditory capacity
within mammals, we refer to
Grothe et al. (2004); Sterbing-
D’Angelo (2009); Ackermann et al. (2014); Manley (2017); Chen
and Wiens (2020)
.
Since the arrival of Homo sapiens, beside genetic drifts ( Star
and Spencer, 2013 ) and epigenetic factors ( Ashe and Colot, 2021 ),
cultural evolution has far outpaced any changes due to evolution.
Cultural change has altered our environmental soundscapes in
urbanized areas drastically, in particular since the industrial
revolution and the exponentially increasing use of technology, see
Figure 1. Note that this discussion does not include the acceleration
of human adaptive evolution due to gene-environment interactions
and a gene-culture co-evolution (e.g., see
Hawks et al., 2007 ; Gintis,
2011) or factors which are not directly related to the “auditory
capacity”. It is also worth emphasizing that, in the following section,
we focus on deeply anchored auditory attention mechanisms in
Homo sapiens and not on culturally dependent learning and
adaptation mechanisms of the attention system within our species
(
Boduroglu and Shah, 2017 ; Jurkat et al., 2020 ) in the modern age.
/two.tnum Conceptual model for
understanding speech in noise
So how do attention mechanisms in hearing from the times of
hunters and gatherers ﬁt the modern world? Listening occurs in
a soundscape that is always present. Outside the hearing clinic or
laboratory it is virtually impossible to ﬁnd a single acoustic event
occurring in isolation. The ability to subset sensory space to better
distinguish relevant from irrelevant phenomena is ecologically
essential (
Stevens, 2013 ; Lev-Ari et al., 2022 ; Bruner and Colom,
2022), and plays a particularly important role in social primates
(Schülke et al., 2020 ). However, unlike in vision, humans and apes
do not signiﬁcantly move their pinnae toward sounds, even though
we retained a vestigial pinna-orienting system that has persisted
as a “neural fossil” within in the brain for about 25 million years
(
Hackley, 2015; Strauss et al., 2020 ). So, we cannot move our ears as
we can move our eyes to focus on a part of the visual scene. We do
not have an auditory fovea, at least not in a physical sense. Thus in
listening, unlike in vision, the neural representation of the physical
world remains unchanged by the peripheral sensor itself. In order
to tune in to a particular auditory object within a soundscape
(auditory scene) we need to use attention (
Shinn-Cunningham,
2008).
Here, to distinguish between the target sound and the unwanted
sound, i.e., the noise, we can employ the binary ﬁgure (target) and
background (noise) principle from vision, see
Marr (1982) . The
idea of ﬁgure and background is very important because there is
always a whole soundscape. What distinguishes ﬁgure from ground
are the “goals” of the listener. Note that, although typically such
“goals” are considered in terms of explicit representations (e.g. “I
want to listen to that person, not this one”), we prefer to consider
them more broadly, even including such “corporeal beliefs” as “I
want to avoid danger” (see
Parvizi-Wayne, 2024 ). Thus, a voice

technological revolution.
might shift from background to foreground either because I choose
to attend to it, or because it has become louder and higher pitched,
as it might if the speaker is angry and potentially becoming a threat.
In the pre-Anthropocene era, many sounds in the soundscape
were crucial for survival, and natural selection would over time
have tuned our senses, and our attention, to better respond to
them. In the sense of
Parvizi-Wayne (2024) , rapid response to
sudden, loud sounds, for example, should be deeply entrenched
in the predictive model that guides what we pay attention to.
Thus, an animal hunting or foraging in a small group might
be listening primarily to the environment, highly sensitive to
any change that might signal the approach of a threat or loss
of an opportunity. In species that forage in groups, including
both baboons and chimpanzees, this includes listening not just
to the sounds of the environment, but also to one’s friends and
neighbors, who are often both allies and potential rivals. That is,
although we often focus on the survival beneﬁts of listening in
the context of predator/prey interactions, it seems likely that, in
a social animal the ability to listen to relevant communication
(directed both to the listener and to others) is at least equally
signiﬁcant (
Schülke et al., 2020 ).
/two.tnum./one.tnum Segregating the target from “noise”
There is a strong link between diﬀerent modes of attention
and eﬀortful listening to speech as a target in noise (see Strauss
and Francis, 2017 ). Typically, one starts with the classic taxonomy
of exogenous attention (bottom-up, automatic, unconscious)
and endogenous attention (voluntary/top-down, goal-directed) in
sensory processing (see
Müller and Rabbitt, 1989 ; Jigo et al.,
2021; Ren et al., 2021 ) frequently applied in auditory scene
analysis (Bregman, 1990). However, understanding the distribution
of attention does not necessarily depend on a strict division of
these concepts. For example, following
Parvizi-Wayne (2024) , the
exogenous attraction of attention by an external stimulus (e.g., a
sudden, loud sound) can still be understood as the deployment
of attention toward a stimulus on the basis of goals, albeit goals
that may be deeply entrenched in the predictive, hierarchically
organized model of the environment (e.g., “Identify the source
of sudden, loud sounds”) as a result of millennia of natural
selection. Thus, for example, attentional focus can be modeled by
a continuous (probabilistic) stream selection model depending on
weights related to exogenous and endogenous processes (
Trenado
et al., 2009 ; Strauss et al., 2010 ) or by a single-agent model when
using active inference, which does not need a dichotomy of these
attention concepts (see
Parvizi-Wayne, 2024 and below). In either
case, the probabilistic selection scheme in Trenado et al. (2009)
is akin to the biased competition model in visual perception
(
Desimone and Duncan, 1995 ); see also Shinn-Cunningham (2008)
for an adaptation of biased competition to the auditory modality
and
Strauss et al. (2010) for a mapping to eﬀortful listening.
The two-competitor as well as taxonomic models of attention in
eﬀortful listening are summarized in
Figure 2, showing a typical
cocktail party situation where two people are having a conversation
(target) in a noisy background (see also below).
The predictive (generative) hierarchically organized model
of the environment employed in
Feldman and Friston (2010);
Clark (2013); Parvizi-Wayne (2024) might, for the sake of
simplicity in structure, be mathematically seen as a generative
spatiotemporal scale space, i.e., a nested structure encompassing
multiple spatiotemporal scales of the (predicted) environment.
This scale space covers predictions about mostly fast and nearby
events at an evolutionarily deeply entrenched core of the model.
The further we move away from this core, the more complex
and forward-thinking (in time and space) these predictions might
be. Building on
Feldman and Friston (2010) that treats biased
competition in terms of an active-inference framework, Parvizi-
Wayne (2024) draws on Friston’s free energy minimization theory
(Friston, 2010 ) to represent the often distinct ideas of exogenous
and endogenous attention in a unitary, active inference framework.
As this framework comprehensively supports a mapping of the
relation between perception and action in eﬀortful listening, let us
take a more formal look at its structure.
Frontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org
Strauss et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/three.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum
/two.tnum./two.tnum Free energy principle in eﬀortful
listening
In real-world scenarios such as the cocktail party in
Figure 2,
listening is not happening in isolation, e.g., deprived of the other
senses. Regularities across senses, e.g., integrating lip reading
or posture with listening, are crucial for understanding speech
in noise, see, e.g.,
Rosenblum (2008) and also our discussion
of relation between perception and action below. However, to
avoid an over-generalization, we focus on the auditory modality
in the following formal discussion, assuming implicitly that
the brain has an internal scale space representation of the
entire multisensory environment. We formulate the free energy
according to
Parr et al. (2022) as follows for our auditory
setting; The internal state of the generative scale space model
corresponds to a distribution Q(s), which captures the brain’s
expectations and prior beliefs about the acoustic scene s (including
both ﬁgure and background across spatiotemporal scales). Let
o represent sensory input, such as the mixture of sounds
in a cocktail party scenario. The free energy F(Q, o) can be
expressed as:
F(Q, o)
 
free energy
= EQ(s)[− ln p(s, o)]  
expectation term
− H[Q(s)]  
entropy term
⩾ − ln p(o)  
surprise
In this formulation, Q(s) serves as both the approximate
posterior distribution and the internal state itself, representing the
brain’s model of the acoustic scene. The ﬁrst term (the negative
expected log joint probability, also known as the energy) measures
how well the brain’s internal model predicts auditory input given
its current beliefs. The second term H[Q(s)] which measures the
entropy of this distribution, quantiﬁes uncertainty in the brain’s
beliefs about the acoustic environment. A higher entropy value
implies greater uncertainty in the listener’s beliefs, making it more
receptive to new sensory observations. This adaptability aligns with
the Free Energy Principle, which suggests that the brain minimizes
free energy by reducing uncertainty and reﬁning its internal model
to optimize perception and action in a dynamic environment
(
Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2022 ).
Minimizing free energy requires balancing consistency with
the generative model (expectation term) while maintaining
appropriate uncertainty through the entropy maximization. In the
absence of precise prior beliefs, this formulation follows Jaynes’s
maximum entropy principle, suggesting the perceptual system
should maintain maximum uncertainty about hidden states when
information is limited (i.e., higher entropy enables more ﬂexible
adjustment of internal models). Importantly, the inequality in the
free energy formulation indicates that free energy always provides
an upper bound on “surprise”—the unexpectedness of sensory
input. By minimizing free energy, the perceptual system indirectly

The relation between attention and eﬀort in listening: (A) Model of the attentional competition between auditory target and b ackground based on a
modiﬁed version of the two-competitor model in Strauss et al. (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/four.tnumb). It is a dynamical model in which eﬀort varies in the /two.tnumD plane, and we have to
invest eﬀort to keep the attentional focus vector on the target. (B) The associated eﬀort of the target processing when employing the t axonomic

is driven by the internal demand d i (e.g., requiring attention to working memory objects to make sense of complicated spoken sentences) and the
external demand de (e.g., requiring attention to perform stream segregation to separ ate the target from the “noise”), see Strauss and Francis (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum);

minimizes surprise, making auditory inputs more predictable and
allowing for more eﬀective processing of complex acoustic scenes.
This interaction of perception and action might occur quickly
and automatically at the evolutionarily deeply entrenched core
of the scale space model but also more slowly due to the
engagement of more complex and thoughtful schemas as we
move away from the core. As predictions and expectations
drive attention (e.g., see
Grossberg, 2005 ; Strauss et al., 2010 ;
Clark, 2013 ; Parvizi-Wayne, 2024 ), fast and automatic links
between perception and action are associated with the “exogenous
weights” and slower, reasoning based loops with the “endogenous
weights” in the classic terminology (
Strauss and Francis, 2017 ;
Strauss et al., 2024b ). Parvizi-Wayne’s model ( Parvizi-Wayne,
2024) emphasizes in this context the importance of “precision
weight optimization” over “precision optimization”. This involves
not only making predictions across spatiotemporal scales more
accurate but also determining the importance (weight) of diﬀerent
pieces of information in their scale space representations (i.e.,
the multiscale prediction error of perceptual beliefs). If these
pieces of information are representations of predicted auditory
objects (
Shinn-Cunningham, 2008 ), the following discussion will
clarify how this model maps the cocktail party situation illustrated
in
Figure 2. As we will see, these weights depend on the
auditory scene, the context, and the generative model including
learned experiences. Precision weight optimization would also map
enhanced representations of attended auditory objects along the
hearing path due to attention “gain” (or “noise suppression”) neural
mechanisms (
Strauss et al., 2024a ), see Parvizi-Wayne (2024) for
more detailed discussions.
Minimizing free energy and surprise directly answers the
question of what motivates us to follow a “listening goal”. This
“motivational aspect” involves long-term and reasoning-based
minimization of (negative) surprises across spatiotemporal scales.
For instance, assume the man in
Figure 2 is telling the woman
what changes are being planned in the dean’s oﬃce for next
week or at the federal level regarding energy prices next winter.
As she does not want to encounter surprises in these matters,
she is motivated to exert attentional eﬀort in the conversation
(
Strauss and Francis, 2017 ). However, free energy minimization
also applies to the here and now, providing an almost instantaneous
and automatic analysis of sudden loud sounds in the acoustic
scene, causing a free energy spike (
Parvizi-Wayne, 2024). Consider
an abrupt background sound like laughter or clinking glasses at
the cocktail party in
Figure 2. These automatic processes stem
from an evolutionarily deeply entrenched core of the scale space
model, securing survival in the present moment. No matter
how interesting the conversation about future events is, these
acoustically salient events compete for our attention, distract us
from the conversation, and cause increased attentional eﬀort to
follow the conversation and minimize free energy about future
events (called exogenous override in
Strauss et al. (2024b) ).
Here it does not matter that clinking glasses do not need our
attention at the cocktail party. As we have stated before, we
are not evolutionarily optimized for cocktail parties or other
features of modern urban environments. In the modern world,
there is an abundance of these free energy spikes caused by
sounds addressing the “survival core” of our generative hierarchical
model of the environment and also an abundance of acoustic
information that might be worth following when minimizing
surprises. It is also important to note that attentional shifts in
noisy environments can arise from individual priors (i.e., learned
experiences) embedded in the brain’s internal model, causing
one person to focus on a background stimulus linked to past
experiences, while another perceives it as irrelevant. For instance,
the ringtone of a cell phone might capture more attention if it is
the same as one’s own, or the sound of a falling tablet could be
associated with a threatening situation at a previous cocktail party
based on individual experience. Turning to our major theme, the
Anthropocene is inducing more free energy in listening situations
in multiple ways, vastly increasing the eﬀort of maintaining simple
conversations at a cocktail party, let alone in Times Square at
rush hour.
/three.tnum Discussion and technological
implications
Technological advances have signiﬁcantly altered even modern
soundscapes within a single human lifetime ( Habib et al., 2007 ;
Swaddle et al., 2015 ; Slabbekoorn, 2018 ). Cultural evolution,
driven by technology, has far outpaced biological evolution ( Boyd
et al., 2013 ), leaving us with a sensory processing and perceptual
system naturally equipped for environments vastly diﬀerent from
our world today (e.g., see
Gazzaley and Rosen, 2016 ). Our
arguments allow us to look at the idea of restoring hearing to
its “natural” state from a new angle as our auditory system
evolved for vastly diﬀerent environments. Rather than simply
restoring hearing, augmenting hearing through technologies such
as noise suppression and directional microphones enables a
technological adaptation to Anthropocene soundscapes rather
than simply restoring Pleistocene capabilities (see
Figure 1 and
Tooby and Cosmides, 1992 ). For the hearing impaired, hearing
aids can leverage the hard attentional competition between
ﬁgure (speech) and background (noise), e.g., by using directional
microphones, maybe even informed by physiological signals
related to our listening intention (
Mikkelsen et al., 2015 ; Schäfer
et al., 2018 ; Schroeer et al., 2023 , 2024). Features such as
exogenous cue weighting or dynamic processing modes, informed
by evolutionary insights, may improve both safety and user
experience in diverse environments (
Carretié, 2014 ; Strauss et al.,
2024b; Edwards, 2007). For example, the silent operation of electric
cars poses risks by reducing the salience of auditory warning
cues (
Clendinning, 2018 ). Artiﬁcially adding sound reintroduces a
natural correspondence between auditory salience and threat but
increases noise pollution (
Hegewald et al., 2020 ; Gilani and Mir,
2021). An alternative is sonifying dynamic traﬃc information (see
ETSI, 2011 ) via bone-conduction devices, enabling the auditory
system to use novel input sources while maintaining its evolved role
as a 360 ◦ early-warning system (
Strauss et al., 2020 ; Olszanowski
et al., 2023). This approach highlights how hearing technologies can
integrate evolutionarily honed mechanisms with modern demands.
Numerical simulations of conceptual eﬀortful listening models
(e.g., see
Schneider et al., 2019 ; Strauss and Francis, 2017 ) can
further contribute to optimizing hearing aid designs, supporting
users in navigating modern soundscapes.

Eﬀortful listening arises from mismatches between auditory
input and the brain’s predictions, linked to increased free energy
(
Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016 ; Strauss and Francis, 2017 ). Predictive
models show that internal demands related to a conﬂict of
expectations across spatiotemporal scales and uncertainty drive
listening eﬀort, particularly in noisy environments. This framework
connects listening eﬀort to broader principles of brain function
and allows for experimental exploration of multimodal integration
(
Calvert et al., 2004 ; Schulte et al., 2023 ) in eﬀortful listening.
Eﬀortful listening informs the design of acoustic human-machine
interfaces, particularly in noise-heavy environments like factories
or vehicles (
Neumann et al., 2021 ; Damian et al., 2015 ; Gonzalez-
Trejo et al., 2019 ). Neuroergonomic approaches ( Parasuraman,
2003) can minimize cognitive load by aligning design with the
attentional system’s evolutionary strengths, creating more intuitive
and eﬀective interfaces (
Mehta and Parasuraman, 2013 ). Thus,
the computational implementation of the concepts presented in
Section
2 (see also Bogacz, 2017; Strauss et al., 2024b ) might support
the optimization of neuroergonomic designs in medical, human-
machine-interaction, and entertainment applications dealing with
eﬀortful listening.
/four.tnum Conclusions
We have considered the understanding of speech in noise
within Anthropocene soundscapes from an evolutionary
perspective. We propose that there have been, at most, marginal
changes in auditory capacities over the last 200,000 years and
essentially no changes in the last 2,000 years. However, the
soundscape has changed drastically in just the last 200 years.
Consequently, we propose that much of the eﬀortful and
unpleasant nature of extracting target speech and suppressing
background noise stems from our auditory system not being
adapted to modern acoustic environments. Using models that link
eﬀortful listening to attention, we examined the binary attentional
competition between ﬁgure and background. We integrated
these models into the free energy minimization framework to
conceptualize attentional eﬀort in listening. This evolutionary
cognitive neuroscience approach and active inference model
have implications for studying human audition and developing
auditory technologies, including earbuds, hearing aids, immersive
environments, and human-machine interaction systems.
