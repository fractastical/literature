Abstract 
 
We aimed to investigate the frequency, changes, and chaotic correlation dimensions of fetal 
facial expression videos using artificial intelligence (AI) and speculate the state of the fetal 
brain activity. We applied our original AI for classifying fetal facial expressions to 57,208 
frames, total of 95.27 minutes, from 47singleton pregnancies at 28 to 37 weeks of gestation, 
obtained at Miyake Clinic between December 2023 and February 2024 at 0.1-second 
intervals. Time, transitions and correlation dimensions of the facial expressions were 
investigated. There was a significant difference between expressions. Neutral and mouthing 
showed significantly longer durations; 71.0, 9.4 – 174.8 (Mean, 5 – 95 %ile) and 53.3, 0.7 – 
127.3 seconds for neutral and mouthing, respectively. The longest transitions were neutral to 
mouthing at 2,237.5 seconds. The median correlation dimensions for before, during, and 
after neutral and mouthing were 1.14, 1.22, and 1.23, and 1.07, 1.15, and 1.24, respectively. 
Analyzing fetal facial expression videos using AI may raise the possibility of being able to 
indirectly quantify brain activity. The ability to infer fetal brain activity via fetal facial 
expressions both qualitatively and quantitatively might be considered to have significant 
biological implications.

Introduction 
Development of the fetal brain function is not yet fully understood. To understand brain 
function and the existence of consciousness, it is necessary to observe external output 
information from the brain1; therefore, at some point, the fetus may become conscious. 
Since there is no accurate method for observing electrical signals and metabolism in the 
brain from outside the body, muscle contractions caused by electrical signals from the brain 
may be considered representative of external output that can actually be observed. Facial 
expressions result from the integrated contraction of several groups of facial muscles; thus, it 
is considered reasonable to observe facial expressions to infer brain function. Advances in 
ultrasound technology have led to the widespread use of three-dimensional (3D) and four-
dimensional (4D) ultrasound imaging to display fetal expressions in three-dimensions, 
making it possible to observe fetal expressions from outside the body. Various studies on 
fetal expressions using ultrasound have been conducted; however, in all cases, the 
ultrasound probe was placed on the mother's abdomen and fetal expressions were observed 
continuously, with the examiner recording only when changes in expression were noted 
2,3,4,5. Therefore, it was always difficult to recognize subtle facial expressions in a very short 
period and make diagnoses with minimal subjectivity. The potential development of a 
method to recognize facial expressions in a short period using a method with minimal 
subjective judgment may be useful for evaluating fetal brain function. In recent years, many 
artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been reported in the field of obstetrics and 
gynecology6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Using original AI that can classify fetal expressions by creating 
confidence scores for each of seven types of expressions on static images16, we analyzed the 
collected fetal expressions and performed chaotic dimensional analysis, revealing that there 
are at least two different states of fetal expressions17. By interpreting this fluctuation using 
the free energy principle that is based on a variational Bayesian estimate to provide a 
comprehensive explanation of perception, action, emotion, sentiment, and decision-
making18,19,20,21,22, we quantitatively demonstrated the possibility of fetal brain activity. 
We applied this AI to fetal videos and conducted expression analysis at 0.1-second intervals. 
This is a method of investigating fetal expressions qualitatively, quantitatively, and 
objectively. Previous studies demonstrated that chaotic dimensions could be calculated from 
fetal facial expressions and we, in this study,  investigated the frequency, changes, and 
chaotic correlation dimensions during major expressions in fetal expression videos using AI, 
both qualitatively and quantitatively, and report our considerations as a hypothesis on the 
state of the fetal brain indicated by these expressions.

Materials and Methods 
Acquisition of fetal facial expression data 
The method for acquiring fetal facial expression data was detailed in our published paper (Y . 
Miyagi, 2022)17. Informed consent was obtained from all participants at Miyake Clinic 
between December 13, 2023, and February 21, 2024, with all data being anonymized. This 
retrospective, noninterventional study was performed in line with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of Miyake Clinic (Jan 
22, 2024. No. mcg2024-1)16,23. 
 
Videos of fetal faces from consecutive normal singleton pregnancies at 28 to 37 weeks of 
gestation were recorded in MP4 format at 10.008 frames per second using 4D ultrasound 
with GE Voluson E10 BT20 (GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) and a curved array trans-abdominal 
transducer (GE eM6C G2, 2 - 7 MHz). These videos were transferred to an offline AI system16 
at Medical Data Labo, Japan. The development of the AI classifier with the original deep 
neural network architecture consisted of 13 layers; 2 convolution layers, 3 rectified linear 
unit layers, 2 pooling layers, 1 flatten layer, 3 linear layers, 1 batch normalization layer, and 1 
softmax layer. The number of fetus/images were 237/1,457 and the number of 
test/validation/ training dataset for creating the AI with data augmentation, five-fold cross 
validation, L2-reglarization and early stopping was 251/1,536/11,248. The 
accuracy/sensitivity/specificity values were 0.996/0.964/1.000, 1.000/1.000/1.000, 
0.996/1.000/0.994, 1.000/1.000/1.000, 1.000/1.000/1.000, 1.000/1.000/1.000, and 
1.000/1.000/1.000 for eye blinking, mouthing, neutral, scowling, smiling, tongue expulsion, 
and yawning, respectively. Each video frame was converted into JPG-format images, cropped 
to 100 × 100 pixels, and divided by an AI classifier into seven confidence scores for each 
expression category such as eye blinking, neutral, mouthing, scowling, smiling, tongue 
expulsion, and yawning16,17. A seven-dimensional (7D) vector that consisted of confidence 
scores of the time-series per fetus was obtained: 
𝒙𝑡 = {𝑥𝑡1,  𝑥𝑡2, … ,  𝑥𝑡7}𝑇 
where xt: seven elements of fetal facial expressions at time t. The vector with the largest 
value is determined as the expression.  
We applied the 7D vector to a practical algorithm to determine the character of strange 
attractors24,25,26,27,28 to analyze multi-dimensional data. For a 7D vector of a time-series, we 
reconstructed the vector xi by shifting time τ:

𝑡 , 𝒙𝑗,𝑘+τ 
𝑡 , …, 𝒙𝑗,𝑘+(m−1) τ 
𝑡 }, (k = 1, 2, ..., Ni) 
where τ is the time, j is the facial category number, m is the embedding dimension, and N is 
the number of video frames. 
We then calculated the correlation dimension, D2, as follows:

Changes in fetal facial expressions 
We determined the spatial relationships of facial features from 922 images in seven 
categories used for AI created with 14,208 images from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 
2020, (IRB No.: 2019-10)23. Then, quantitative transition patterns of facial expressions, 
focusing on the duration of each transition, were sought for a completely different video 
collected for this study between December 13, 2023, and February 21, 2024. Using our 
original AI for classifying fetal facial expressions reported in 202116, the last NetPort and 
softmax layer of AI were removed and facial features were extracted so that facial 
expressions could be placed in 2D and 3D space based on their relevance. 
The number of expression data was unified to the minimum number of images obtained, 
then principal component analysis29 was used for dimension reduction. The norm from the 
coordinate center was calculated, and a dimensional reduction method with no difference 
was selected to create 2D and 3D spaces, to which the video data obtained this time were 
applied. 
Next, when a representative expression observed over a long period of time lasted for more 
than one second, the duration of that expression and expressions before and after it were 
analyzed. This is because the time required for the appearance of facial expressions from the 
recognition of facial expressions from others is a neuroscientific issue, and there does not 
appear to be an established time frame even in adults. Therefore, in this study, we assumed 
for convenience that stable fetal facial expressions last for more than one second. Types of 
facial expression transitions and time required for the transition were investigated.

Analysis of observed fetal facial expression time 
We analyzed the representative expression and the total observation time by counting the 
frame length for each expression based on all confidence score information. For each image 
frame, the fetal expression that shows the maximum value among the 7 confidence scores 
was selected. When transition from facial expression A to facial expression B, the time of 
facial expression A is measured. For the facial expressions that were seen frequently, we 
examined the facial expressions before and after them. 
Changes in correlation dimension of brain activity inferred from 
fetal facial expressions 
We selected representative expressions that were observed for a relatively long time from all 
expressions, and when those expressions lasted for more than 25 seconds, corresponding to 
the minimum 250 time-series data-points required to calculate the correlation dimension in 
this study, we examined changes in the correlation dimension of the confidence score for the 
25 seconds before and after the expression regardless of whether the confidence score of 
the original expression is included or not. We interpreted the results based on the free 
energy principle. 
 
Free energy principle for fetal facial expressions 
The free energy, F, in generating fetal expressions using the free energy principle is as 
follows: 
𝐹(õ, 𝜇) = 𝐷𝐾𝐿[𝑄(𝑠̃, 𝑢̃|𝜇)||𝑃(𝑠̃, 𝑢̃|õ)] − ln 𝑃(𝑜̃|𝑚𝑑𝑙) 
𝜇𝑡 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝜇 𝐹({𝑜0, … , 𝑜𝑡+1}, 𝜇)

Results 
 
Acquisition of fetal facial expression data 
There were 47 videos from the target patients, with an average age of 30.69 ± 5.27 years 
(mean ± standard deviation: SD), and the minimum and maximum ages were 22 and 39 
years, respectively. Gestational age was 32.87 ± 3.05 weeks, with a minimum and maximum 
of 28 and 38 weeks, respectively. There were 24 primi- and 23 multiparous women, 
respectively, with 25 male and 22 female fetuses. The total observation time was 95.27 
minutes, 57,208 frames. The recording times were 138.8 ± 56.8 (mean ± SD) seconds, 27.8, 
210.2, 151.6 and 41.9 – 200.7 seconds for minimum, maximum, median and 5-95 %ile 
values, respectively. 
Analysis of observed fetal facial expression time 
The observed frames for eye blinking, neutral, mouthing, scowling, smiling, tongue 
expulsion, and yawning were 127, 2,706, 8,732, 1,052, 157, 43 and 618, 141, 7,380, 8,632, 
563, 50, 28 and 1,023, 452, 13,908, 16,008, 570, 557, 237 and 2,374 in from 28 to 30+6, from 
31 to 34+6 and from 35 to 37+6 weeks of gestations, respectively. The gestational age had no 
effect (P=0.8789). As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, when all confidence scores were 
collected, neutral had the highest number of observations at 47 times, with 71.0 ± 52.3, 9.4 – 
174.8 (mean ± SD, 5 – 95 %ile) seconds, followed by mouthing at 45 times with 53.3 ± 45.9, 
0.7 – 127.3 seconds. There was a significant difference in variation between expressions (P = 
3.47×10-16). Among the expressions, neutral, mouthing, and both neutral and mouthing were 
significantly longer in duration (P <0.05).

SD: Standard deviation 
As shown in Table 2, there were 36 patterns of transition between facial expressions. The 
duration of the observed facial expressions was 158.79 ± 434.56, 0.7 – 1469.7 (Mean ± SD, 5 
– 95 %ile) seconds, with the longest being 2,237.5 seconds and shortest at 0.7 seconds. 
Facial expression transitions occurred on 9.97 ± 10.26, 1 – 44 times. There were significant 
differences in the observed time intervals among the 36 groups (P = 2.64 × 10-16). There were 
42 possible variations in facial expressions, and the following six were not noted: tongue 
expulsion to smiling, tongue expulsion to eye blinking, scowling to smiling, smiling to tongue 
expulsion, smiling to scowling, and yawning to tongue expulsion. The total of duration of 
facial expression before the expression change accounted for 2,237.5 seconds (39.14%) of 
the total observation time of 5,716.3 seconds, with the longest transition being from neutral 
to mouthing, followed by mouthing to neutral at 1,469.7 seconds (25.71%). Combined, these 
two transitions accounted for 64.85% of the total observation time.  
Placing facial expressions in space using dimensional reduction methods, we chose principal 
component analysis, which did not significantly differ in the norm of each facial expression. 
The norm values (mean ± SD, 5 – 95 %ile) for eye blinking, neutral, mouthing, scowling, 
smiling, tongue expulsion, and yawning were 10.92 ± 2.17, 9.06 – 14.63, 11.42 ± 1.74, 8.96 – 
13.53, 12.04 ± 1.43, 10.55 – 14.27, 9.87 ± 1.59, 7.82 – 12.37, 13.05 ± 1.11, 11.95 – 14.63,

of yawning was the largest in both 2D and 3D spaces. Figure 2 shows how the coordinates for 
each expression were established in 2D and 3D spaces. The coordinates of neutral and 
mouthing expressions were close to each other in both spaces, with frequent transitions, 
especially from neutral to mouthing and vice versa.  
 
Figure 2: Facial expressions placed in 2D and 3D spaces and facial expression transitions. This 
figure shows how the coordinates for each expression were established in 2D (a) and 3D (b) 
spaces, using data from 922 labeled images of fetal expressions. 
We applied a principal component analysis method that showed no significant differences in 
norm from the coordinate center. Video data from this study were then integrated into these 
spatial models for improved visualization of facial expression relationships. The size of each 
circle or sphere indicates the observation duration, while arrow colors correspond to the 
initial expression, with arrow diameters reflecting the transition frequency. Neutral and 
mouthing expressions are close to each other, with frequent transitions, especially from 
neutral to mouthing and vice versa. 
 
As shown in Table 3, neutral expressions lasting for more than one second showed significant 
differences in duration before and after neutral (P =0.00004 and P =0.00002, respectively). 
Mouthing before neutral lasted for 16.40 ±16.49, 0.4 – 54.5 (Mean ± SD, 5 – 95 %ile) seconds 
(87.3% of total duration before neutral) and mouthing after neutral lasted for 13.49 ± 18.56, 
0.1 – 64.9 seconds (90.5% of total duration after neutral). Neutral was reached 5.72 ± 6.45,

were significant differences in duration before and after (P =9.57×10⁻⁶). Neutral before 
mouthing transitioned to mouthing after 11.43 ± 11.49, 0.7 – 35 seconds, and neutral after 
mouthing averaged 17.63 ± 16.09, 0.8 – 53.3 seconds. Mouthing occurred 5.04 ± 3.88, 1.2 – 
11.42 seconds after the preceding expression, and the next expression transitioned after 5.33

Table 3: Before-and-after expressions and their duration when neutral (upper panel) and 
mouthing (lower panel) facial expressions lasted for more than 1 second. There was a

±16.49, 0.4 – 54.5 (Mean ± SD, 5 – 95 %ile) seconds (87.3% of the total duration of facial 
expressions before neutral) before transitioning to neutral. The average post-neutral mouthing 
time was 13.49 ± 18.56, 0.1 – 64.9 seconds (90.5% of the total duration of facial expressions

Discussion 
Using AI for fetal facial expression recognition, it has now become possible to analyze fetal 
facial expressions in detail on a frame-by-frame basis from ultrasound videos. In previous 
studies, much time and effort were required, and the determination of events was based on 
subjective judgment. Here, by quantitatively analyzing a total of 95.27 minutes, 57,208 
frames, of video on a frame-by-frame basis and in single-frame increments, we were able to 
clarify the characteristics of fetal facial expressions. Based on frequency, neutral and 
mouthing were significantly more common, so both were considered important information. 
Mouthing is frequently observed in studies and considered an important expression2. It was 
significantly more frequent than other facial expressions early in the third trimester4, being 
consistent with our results. We consider that this study provides important new insights by 
quantitatively demonstrating for the first time the possibility that neutral expressions have 
meaning, which has not been emphasized to date.  
The gestational age had no effect for the observed time for facial expression profiles. Figure 1 
and Table 1 show significant differences between facial expressions, suggesting that fetal 
facial expressions have meaning beyond reflexes. Table 2 also presents significant 
differences, with six of the 42 facial expression transitions not observed, indicating that facial 
expression manifestation is not random but suggests some brain function. Furthermore, 
there were mutual changes in expressions between neutral and mouthing, with transitions 
between the two accounting for 64.85%.  
As the method of dimensional reduction based on our AI, we selected principal component 
analysis; a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of data by transforming it 
into a new set of orthogonal axes that capture the most variance29. The flow map showed 
that neutral and mouthing were close to each other in both 2D and 3D spaces (Figure 2). 
Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the duration of expressions before and 
after neutral and mouthing that lasted for more than one second (Table 3). Therefore, it was 
considered that neutral and mouthing were the basic states of fetal facial expressions. 
The correlation dimension of confidence scores for each 25 seconds before and after neutral 
and mouthing sustained for more than 25 seconds suggested that there would be some brain 
activities when facial expression changes. We proposed the hypothesis that when the chaotic 
dimension of the 7D time series vector created by AI from fetal facial expressions is large, 
brain activity and free energy are both high, and when the dimension is low, that are 
consequently both low30,31. The free energy principle with active inference is a theory 
explaining cognition and brain behavior. It uses variational Bayesian estimates to describe 
ARTICLE IN PRESS

perception, action, emotion, sentiment, and decision-making. To maintain equilibrium, an 
agent minimizes informational free energy and prediction error. This involves adjusting 
internal states and environmental sampling to reduce free energy18,19,20,21,22. Biologically, the 
relationship between chaotic dimensions such as correlation dimensions derived from fetal 
expressions and brain activity has not been proven. Although no significant differences were 
noted in this study, Figure 3 might suggest the existence of fluctuations in correlation 
dimensions. In living organisms, brain activity optimizes and minimizes energy consumption 
for survival, and only very slight dimensional changes might be able to be observed, and 
there might be no difference significant enough to reach the typical biological significance 
level of α error = 0.05. There are no reports in fetuses regarding of this hypothesis. However, 
we speculated that the fluctuations in the correlation dimension obtained from fetal facial 
expressions might be a clue to access the fetal brain activity. Neutral may have high free 
energy, similar to after mouthing. Incidentally, while we attempted to infer brain function 
using ultrasound, there are reports of detecting brain damage in rabbit fetuses via MRI as a 
model for cerebral palsy32.  
This pilot study demonstrated that AI could enable quantitative observation of fetal facial 
expressions using non-invasive ultrasound. Regarding the application of AI using dynamic 
and static ultrasound, there are studies comparing AI with diagnoses made by 
ultrasonographers and cardiologists in heart failure patients33. However, our current study 
did not compare human versus AI performance; instead, we observed outputs from AI that 
humans cannot produce. As seen in rats with severe uncontrolled maternal hyperglycemia 
leading to neurodevelopmental delay, abnormal conditions such as maternal hyperglycemia 
in humans may also affect the fetal brain, causing the fetus to develop pathological 
conditions and exhibit characteristic changes in facial expressions34. Since the data did not 
compare normal fetuses with pathological fetuses in this  pilot study, no normal values were 
established. However, accumulating data in the future may enable determination of what 
constitutes normal. Observing fetal facial expressions during ultrasound examinations is 
easily feasible in routine clinical practice. Recording a few minutes of video allows obtaining 
the frequency and duration of each expression, as well as chaotic dimensions, for individual 
fetuses. Comparing these to future normal values could enable clinical classification based 
on facial expressions. Since facial expressions are thought to correlate with brain function, 
this research method may indirectly assess fetal brain development.  
Further studies with longitudinal design of increased sample size would be needed. 
Furthermore, if methods for evaluating the neurophysiological functions of the fetal brain are 
ARTICLE IN PRESS

established in the future and their relationship with fetal facial expressions is clarified, the 
meaning behind changes in fetal facial expressions may become clearer. However, evaluating 
brain function requires caution due to ethical and clinical implications. Diagnosis and 
interpretation must consider various confounding variables, potentially necessitating 
consensus involving not only physicians but also ethicists or the public. 
 
Limitations 
As for limitations, firstly, the details of fetal facial muscle contraction are unclear. Current 
diagnostic devices cannot resolve muscle contractions shorter than 0.1 seconds. The 
refractory period of human skeletal muscle is approximately 1–5 msec35, and imaging at 
shorter intervals would enable observation of detailed muscle contraction fluctuations. In 
the future, if the frame rate of 4D ultrasound diagnostic devices increases to 1,000 frames 
per second (100 times the current rate), it would then be possible to perform precise 
physiological analysis. Secondly, approximately 250 images seemed to require calculating the 
chaotic dimension. Therefore, the frame rate is important, and currently it takes about 25 
seconds (250 images). If there is a device with a high frame rate, this time can be shortened. 
Using a device with a frame rate 100 times higher than the current one, it will be possible to 
calculate the dimension of facial expressions in 0.25 seconds. However, regarding the 
statistical analysis of chaotic dimensional fluctuations, if the number of cases increases, it is 
expected that a significant difference will be observed even with the current device. Third, 
since this analysis combines all cases between 28 and 38 weeks, changes in development 
based on week classification are unclear. However, if we analyze the data by week 
classification, we may be able to see changes in development. Fourth, we used principal 
component analysis for the spatial flow map of facial expressions, but depending on the 
dimension reduction method used, neutral and mouthing may not be located close to each 
other, and the flow map may vary depending on the AI. Fifth, the relationship between REM 
and non-REM states of the brain and fetal facial expressions remains unclear. Although REM 
has been reported in fetuses36, until a method capable of simultaneously collecting facial 
expression and REM information is developed, this relationship will remain unclear. Sixth, 
sample size might not be large enough, resulting in possible limitation statistical reliability. 
 
Conclusions 
ARTICLE IN PRESS
ARTICLE IN PRESS
 
Development of the fetal brain remains largely unknown. However, analyzing fetal facial 
expression videos using AI suggests the possibility of being able to indirectly quantify brain 
activity. Even indirectly, inferring fetal brain activity qualitatively and quantitatively would be 
considered to have significant biological implications. In the future, we hope to analyze 
information on brain activity in various environments to enable intrauterine diagnosis of fetal 
stress. The methodology demonstrated in this study might provide clues for delivering 
appropriate care to improve the fetal environment.
