Editorial on the Research Topic
Temporal structure of neural processes coupling sensory, motor and
cognitive functions of the brain, volume II
Information processing is inextricably linked to the multi-scale temporal structure of
the brain and the physical surroundings. The contributions to the Volume II of Frontiers
Research Topic, “ Temporal Structure of Neural Processes Coupling Sensory, Motor and
Cognitive Functions of the Brain, ” brings us a step closer to understanding how the coupling
between the temporal structures of neuronal spiking activities and external events would
contribute to voluntary motor behavior and perceptual functions.
Shannon and Weaver
(1949) argued that an information source generates a message, which is transmitted to a
recipient. In the case of the brain, the activities of the cortex resulting from the sensory
inputs and motor activities constitute the information source. Sensory inputs and motor
actions, stemming from the interaction of the brain with external stimuli, encode messages
in the brain’s activity patterns that are decoded by the temporal coupling of neuronal
spikes of the brain [i.e., the association between neural activities, reﬂecting increased mutual
information (
Gupta and Bahmer, 2021 )] due to the demands of a task ( Gupta and Bahmer,
2019). Temporal coupling reduces average uncertainty in the message, which results in the
“knowledge, ” underlying voluntary motor control and perception.
The message/information from the sources in the brain, such as the concerted activities
of sensory and motor areas during a task execution is assessed by the measurement of
average uncertainty or Shannon entropy, hereafter called entropy. As the amount of entropy
(the message/information that has to be decoded) gets bigger, then the voluntary control
exerted by the individual improves, as well as there is an increase of the likelihood of
veridical outcomes derived from sensory tasks. Consistent with the preceding,
Wang et al.
reported that there is an increase in motor variability whenever the subjects received negative
feedback regarding performance in a motor timing task. In this task, the subjects made
delayed saccadic eye movements or button presses in response to a cue. An increase in motor
variability implies an increase in the average uncertainty or entropy, which means that there
is an increase in the amount of processed information for achieving better control of the
timing task in the next trial (i.e., heightened voluntary regulation of movements).

Gupta et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fncom./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/four.tnum/four.tnum
Wang et al. proposed that feedback is used to tune the motor
variability in humans. To study their hypothesis, they compared
diﬀerent recurrent neural network (RNN) models, which included
graded recurrent units (GRU), a vanilla autoregressive neural
network (ARNN), and weight-varying ARNN (vARNN) to analyze
which one best captures experimental human data. vARNN stood
out as the best network model in terms of its prediction accuracy
based on the history (previous trial). In vARNN architecture, an
adjustable noise level was added to the connectivity between units,
which was modulated, on a short-term basis, by feedback. The
authors contend that feedback may be responsible for modulating
the motor variability in humans, that is, “reducing the variability
when the outcome is better than expected (less exploration) and
increasing the variability when the outcome becomes worse.”
Boenke et al. studied pre-stimulus alpha and beta wave
modulation in a self-paced, cue-independent, spatialized temporal
order judgment (TOJ) task in auditory and visual modalities.
Boenke et al. reported “on the group level: (1) Veridical auditory
TOJs, relative to non-veridical, were associated with higher (pre-
stimulus) 20 Hz (beta) power over central electrodes, and (2)
veridical visual TOJs showed higher (pre-stimulus) 10, 15 Hz (alpha
beta) power over parieto-occipital electrodes.” Moreover, in this
study, “the individual-level modulation pattern was variable and
included activations opposite to the group mean.” The authors also
observed that the direction of individual activation of electrodes
over auditory brain regions and parietooccipital electrodes was
always negatively correlated in the respective TOJ conditions.
Based on this, the authors argue against dismissing individual
variations as outliers. Instead, they argue that there are diﬀerent
strategies (reﬂected in opposite directions of modulations of brain
oscillations) used by the brain leading to the same outcome, namely
veridical TOJs in their study. Thus, as advised by the authors,
a general description of brain activity during the processing of
incoming information should account for variability in modulation
directions at both the group and individual levels.
Also note that positive modulation, which is synchronization,
will concentrate spiking activities to one particular phase of the
oscillation cycle, reducing the entropy; and negative modulation,
which is desynchronization, will increase entropy in spiking
patterns. Furthermore, desynchronization frees up neurons from
the restriction of spiking only during a certain phase of oscillations.
Therefore, desynchronization will promote the temporal coupling
between neuronal activities, given the constraints of interactions
involving external stimuli. In this context, it is also noteworthy
that a decrease in the synchronization of beta oscillations across
sensorimotor areas is seen during movement execution (
Barone
and Rossiter, 2021 ), which will immensely increase entropy during
the post-stimulus phase.
Based on the preceding discussion, the ﬁndings by Boenke
et al. may also be interpreted in the light of information-theoretic
considerations of cognitive functions ( Gupta and Bahmer, 2019 ),
as one can argue that lower entropy measured at the beginning of
the task (the observed high pre-stimulus modulation) would lead
to a greater quantitative increase in entropy, which will increase
the chances of a veridical TOJ. In this context note that a greater
increase in entropy would allow greater levels of reduction of
average uncertainty (entropy) in the brain activities via temporal
coupling, resulting from the speciﬁc constraints for successful
task completion. Since, at the group level, there is an increase
in alpha/beta modulation in the pre-stimulus stage, consequently
lower initial entropy, it will lead to a greater increase in entropy
as the task is completed, contributing to its success. However, at
an individual level, there may be a negative modulation in the
respective modality, which is, however, accompanied by positive
modulation in the non-attended modality. In those individuals,
there still could be a net decline in entropy in the pre-stimulus stage
due to positive modulation of brain oscillations in non-attended
modality areas, contributing to an overall increase in the amount
of entropy as the task is completed. However, it is not clear how
a quantitative increase in information (entropy) is responsible for
veridical TOJs. A net increase in entropy could be related to an
enhanced state of alertness, resulting from the ability for a greater
decrease in uncertainty via temporal coupling.
Liu et al. used a biologically constrained, large-scale neural
network model (LSNM) of short-term memory to study how
endogenous (top-down) and exogenous (bottom-up) attention
are controlled in an intersensory auditory- and visual-perception
paradigm. The LSNM consists of several interconnected modules,
which were embedded into the structural connectome of
Hagmann
et al. (2008). The modules are made of arrays of basic units,
each consisting of one excitatory subunit and an inhibitory
subunit, mimicking cortical minicolumns. The authors have
used simulated subjects, created by slightly varying interregional
structural connection weights through a Gaussian process. Two
types of tasks are used: delayed match-to-sample and Sternberg
tasks. Whenever there is a match of the probe stimulus
with previously presented stimuli during a task, the response
submodule issues a response. The visual or auditory stimuli
are sent to a buﬀer simulating working memory processes by
increasing endogenous attention from low (0.1) to high (0.3).
The exogenous attention to stimuli, including distractors, is
augmented by increasing stimulus saliency. The results show that
increasing the working memory load in one modality would
reduce distraction from the other modality. Simulated fMRI data
were also generated. The authors hope that these predictions
can be tested on human subjects although they argue that
computational modeling can be a powerful tool for interpreting
and integrating neuroimaging data coming from diﬀerent sources
(human and non-human).
Löﬄer and Gupta presented a computational model, using
three ensembles of neurons, for reduction in spatiotemporal
overlap of spiking patterns resulting from diﬀerent inputs. Three
ensembles include input (I), R (temporal separation), and E
(temporal separation to spatial separation). I neurons are randomly
connected to R neurons. In this model, a traveling Excitatory
Post-Synaptic Potential (EPSP) wave activates a spatially diﬀerent
E neuron when the peak of the traveling EPSP wave coincides
with output from R neurons. This leads to a perfect conversion
of temporal separation patterns into spatial patterns. Thus, a
temporally separate output will activate a diﬀerent neuron/or
minicolumn in a contiguous area of the cortex. Activations of
separate minicolumns or cortical neurons can be independently
temporally coupled to each other, based on the constraints
resulting from a task, argued to play a role in voluntary motor

control and perception ( Gupta and Bahmer, 2019 ). The authors
also studied object identiﬁcation. They used three inputs into
eight I (input) neurons, representing three colors, three shapes,
and the two sizes of an object (18 diﬀerent objects). The
spatiotemporal separation, representing three groups of features,
was about 90%. Since spatiotemporal separation does not exceed
100% in the above example, this mechanism may not lead
to an increase in entropy, given the completion of a task.
Nonetheless, this model provides a mechanistic basis for the
spatial separation of input patterns that would play a role in
object identiﬁcation.
The contributions in this Research Topic shed light on how
the temporal structure, represented at multiscale levels, may aﬀect
information processing underlying cognitive functions of the
brain.
Wang et al. show that negative feedback immediately
increases motor variability, which may be a response to
reduce errors in a motor timing task. A quantitative increase
in entropy, a measurement of the amount of information,
appears to be a common feature in disparate strategies to
achieve veridical TOJs in the study by
Boenke et al. . Papers
by Liu et al. and Löﬄer and Gupta show how diﬀerent
computational approaches can be useful in understanding
the complex dynamics of information processing underlying
cognitive functions.
