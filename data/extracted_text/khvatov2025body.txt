Simple Summary
Body size awareness is an animal’s ability to take its own dimensions into account when
negotiating obstacles. We examined this ability in reedfish, a long, bottom-dwelling species.
In a tank we installed a partition with three openings. In Experiment 1 all three openings were
passable but differed in size. In Experiment 2 only one opening was passable, whereas two
larger ones were not. Fish first approached any opening, but they attempted to pass almost
exclusively through the truly passable one; after such attempts, they always entered the target
compartment. When all openings were passable, choices were at chance: fish did not favor
the largest opening but simply used one that was “big enough”. These findings indicate that
the pass/not-pass decision is made at close range, likely using tactile and hydrodynamic cues
from the head. The study extends evidence for body size awareness to a phylogenetically
distant fish and may inform better husbandry and environmental enrichment for aquatic
species, as well as bio-inspired navigation strategies in confined spaces.
Abstract
Body size awareness—a component of bodily self-representation—allows animals to match
their own dimensions to environmental constraints. This study tested whether reedfish
(Erpetoichthys calabaricus), a benthic ray-finned species with limited vision, can evaluate
aperture passability relative to their body size. Eight fish performed a “body-as-obstacle”
task. After training, each individual completed 36 trials in Experiment 1 (three passable
circular apertures of different diameters) and 72 trials in Experiment 2 (one small passable
and two larger non-passable apertures). We scored first approach, first penetration attempt,
and full passage; data were analyzed with generalized linear models. In Experiment 1,
choices were random, unaffected by aperture size or position. In Experiment 2, first
approaches were random, but first penetration attempts—and ensuing passages—were
directed almost exclusively to the single passable aperture. These results indicate near-field
formation of pass/not-pass judgments, likely via tactile and hydrodynamic sensing. The
behavioral dissociation between exploratory (epistemic) and goal-directed (pragmatic)
actions supports a modular model of self-representation, where distinct sensorimotor loops
underlie information gathering and goal execution. Thus, reedfish demonstrate body-size
awareness and contribute to comparative evidence that modular self-representation and
embodied anticipation may extend deep into vertebrate evolution.

1. Introduction
By self-representation we refer to the ability of an organism to construct and use an
internal, multimodal model of itself—integrating interoceptive, exteroceptive, and proprio-
ceptive information within sensorimotor loops—to distinguish its own body and actions
from those of other agents and from the surrounding environment [1–6]. Within this broad
framework, body size awarenessdenotes a specific and operationally testable form of bodily
self-representation, in which an individual takes its own physical parameters (size, shape,
and mass) into account when planning or executing goal-directed interactions with the
environment [1,3]. Evidence for this mechanism in taxa phylogenetically distant from hu-
mans argues against a strictly binary view of self-awareness [3,4] and even against a single
gradualist ladder culminating in humans [4,5]. In line with the modular cognitionapproach,
we regard self-representation as an array of functionally specialized, partially independent
cognitive components that evolved to meet different ecological demands—such as moni-
toring one’s own body boundaries, mapping the relation between self and environment,
and distinguishing self-generated from external actions [ 6,7]. This modular framework
shifts the focus from mirror-based assays to embodied, ecologically valid challenges (e.g.,
matching the body to obstacles), where adaptivity-based hypotheses and cross-species
comparisons are appropriate.
The principal behavioral approach to assess “body size awareness” is the body-as-
obstacle paradigm: an animal is confronted with a barrier containing openings (or other
narrow passages) of varying size and shape, and researchers evaluate whether it can
prospectively—before physical contact—select the only passable option by matching its
own body dimensions to the geometry of the obstacle [6,8,9]. Canonical implementations
present choices among several apertures where only one is traversable (sometimes of
smaller area), while configurations are alternated to minimize learning effects [2,10]; com-
parable procedures have been used with birds required to pass through holes of different
height/width to reach a reward [10]. Using variants of body-as-obstacle, body size aware-
ness has been demonstrated in children (18–26 months) [9], chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) [11] domestic dogs C and cats (Felis catus) [13] (sequen-
tially decreasing apertures), budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) [14] and bumblebees
(Bombus) [15] (during flight through apertures), hooded crows (Corvus cornix) [16], domestic
ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) [2], Wistar laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus domestica) [10]
(choosing the sole passable hole prior to contacting the partition), radiated ratsnakes
(Elaphe radiata) [17] and hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus) [18].
In this study, we aim to test the presence of body size awareness in reedfish
(Erpetoichthys calabaricus). This species is a suitable model due to its lifestyle and sensori-
motor profile: reedfish are benthic, predominantly crepuscular/nocturnal predators that
exhibit benthic feeding in water and make regular terrestrial excursions under labora-
tory conditions; activity increases under low light, and high-speed recordings document
infrared-lit benthic and terrestrial prey capture with a “lifted-trunk” mechanism, alongside
water-to-land transitional locomotion [19]. Together with documented withdrawal/fast-
start responses to head/tail stimulation, this indicates a sensorimotor specialization for
near-field, head-first interactions with substrates and obstacles—highly relevant to “body-
as-obstacle” tasks [20]. Available evidence on polypterid sensory systems further supports
this view: the closely related Polypterus senegalusshows very low spatial visual acuity in
optokinetic tests (0.05–0.075 cycles/deg), whereas the cranial lateral-line system is well de-
veloped (canals and neuromasts), consistent with short-range mechanoreception; moreover,
nocturnal amphibious ray-finned fishes display convergent expansions of the olfactory
system at both receptor and processing levels [21–23]. Finally, behavioral work on reedfish
and polypterids documents flexible transitions between aquatic and terrestrial locomotion
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 3 of 18
and terrestrial prey capture, which—together with a benthic lifestyle—strengthens the
expectation that tactile/mechanosensory probing underpins assessment of passability in
narrow spaces; to our knowledge, however, no study has directly tested aperture nego-
tiation and body size awareness in reedfish [ 19,24]. Given their predominantly tactile
and mechanosensory mode of spatial perception, reedfish provide an excellent model for
studying how animals with limited visual input assess the relation between their own body
dimensions and environmental constraints.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals
We tested eight reedfish Erpetoichthys calabaricus(4 males, 4 females; total length, TL,
32–34 cm) obtained from Aqua-Logo (Moscow, Russia). Sex was determined by anal-fin
morphology (males showing a broader, more fleshy anal fin) [ 25]. All fish were group-
housed in a single 500 L glass tank with a tight-fitting lid; freshwater was maintained
at 24–28 ◦C and pH 6.5–7.5 with 10–15% weekly water changes. The bottom substrate
consisted of fine rounded gravel, with floor-level shelters (PVC pipes/caves, driftwood).
Continuous access to the air–water surface was ensured. Filtration was moderate with
gentle flow (external canister filters). Lighting was dim (≈100 lx at the water surface) under
a 12L:12D photoperiod. Fish were fed Gammarus and bloodworms three times per week.
All animal procedures complied with the ARRIVE guidelines and the European Union
Directive 2010/63/EU [26] on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The
study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Moscow
Institute of Psychoanalysis.
2.2. Experimental Setup
The experimental apparatus consisted of a glass tank (800 × 400 × 400 mm; water
depth 300 mm) with a tight-fitting lid; the substrate, water parameters, and filtration
matched the pre-experimental housing conditions. The setup was placed in an isolated
room to minimize extraneous light and noise.
An opaque black full-height partition (4 mm thick) made of non-transparent glass was
positioned at mid-length, dividing the tank into two equal square compartments (“Start”
and “Finish”). The partition contained three arched apertures: circular openings of 60 mm
diameter truncated at the bottom by a straight chord (aperture height 50 mm); the flat edge
faced downward and was positioned 10 mm above the tank bottom. Each aperture could be
individually occluded with an opaque acrylic insert (square plates,100 × 100 mm) that slid
into guide slots located on the “Finish” side of the partition, allowing rapid configuration
changes between trials (see Figure 1).
In the “Finish” compartment, lighting matched the baseline housing conditions; a
tubular shelter (300 mm in length, 120 mm inner diameter) was centered across the width
and oriented with its opening toward the partition with the apertures.
The “Start” compartment was kept under constant dim illumination of approximately
100 lx at the water surface, with no shelters. Video was recorded using a PanasonicHC-V260
camcorder (Panasonic Holdings Corp., Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia) mounted on a
tripod behind the “Finish” compartment and aimed to capture the apertures in the partition.
All tank dimensions, aperture geometries, and lighting conditions were precisely
measured and recorded to allow full reproducibility of the setup.

Figure 1. Experimental apparatus (isometric view): glass tank 800 × 400 × 400 mm with 300 mm
water depth; an opaque midline partition divides the tank into “Start” and “Finish” compartments.
The partition contains three arched apertures positioned 10 mm above the bottom: circular openings
of 60 mm diameter truncated at the bottom by a straight chord (aperture height 50 mm), with the flat
edge facing downward. A tubular shelter (300 mm in length, 120 mm inner diameter) is placed in the
“Finish” compartment with its opening toward the partition. See Section 2.2 for details.
2.3. General Procedure
Before testing, all three apertures in the partition were fully occluded with inserts.
The focal fish was placed in the “Finish” compartment and kept there for 5 days; feeding
followed the pre-experimental schedule. This period served to habituate the animal to the
“Finish” compartment.
Experimental trials were conducted after the 5-day habituation, during the dark phase
of the light cycle. At the start of each trial, a predefined aperture configuration was set in
the partition (see “Experiment 1” and “Experiment 2” for details). The shelter tube with the
fish inside was then removed from the “Finish” compartment and transferred to the “Start”
compartment. The fish was gently released from the shelter, after which the shelter was
returned to the “Finish” compartment and oriented with its opening facing the partition
bearing the apertures.
During a trial, the fish was motivated to leave the more brightly illuminated “Start”
compartment, which contained no shelters, and to pass through one of the apertures into
the darker “Finish” compartment containing the shelter tube (see Figure 2). A trial was
considered complete if the animal exited the “Start” compartment within 15 min. The next
trial was initiated only after the fish, having entered the “Finish” compartment, re-entered
the shelter tube and remained inside for at least 10 min.
Each fish completed 117 trials in total (9 training, 36 in Experiment 1, and 72 in
Experiment 2), with 10–12 trials conducted per day. Initially, additional rest periods be-
tween daily sessions were planned to prevent fatigue or habituation. However, behavioral
observations revealed no signs of reduced activity, avoidance, or stress throughout the
testing phase. The fish consistently displayed exploratory behavior and stable response
latencies. Therefore, no extra rest days were required, and all experimental sessions pro-
ceeded as scheduled.
All trials were performed sequentially for each individual; upon completion of the
full set, the fish was transferred to a post-experimental holding tank, after which the next
subject was introduced into the apparatus and the cycle repeated.

in the partition—two large non-traversable vertical openings (left and center) and one smaller
traversable circular opening (right); the frame shows the fish approaching the traversable aperture
(see Section 2.7.1 for details).
2.4. Odor Control
To preclude olfactory “track” cues across trials, all handling of panels/inserts was
performed with powder-free nitrile gloves. Prior to first use, cast-acrylic panels and holders
were degreased with 70% ethanol and triple-rinsed with dechlorinated water. Between
consecutive trials, panels were removed, triple-rinsed with water from a separate reservoir
(temperature and pH matched to the tank), blotted with resin-free lab wipes, and reinstalled
in the new configuration; metal tools (tongs/keys) were likewise rinsed each time. To
minimize residue buildup, we used two identical panel sets in alternation: while one set was
in use, the other was air-dried for≥30 min in a clean cabinet. Between subjects, panels were
additionally flushed for 10 min under running dechlorinated water, followed by triple rinse
and complete air-drying. No detergents, scented materials, or disinfectants were used near
the apparatus; filtration and gentle flow were kept constant, and aperture configurations
were quasi-randomized, preventing the fish from exploiting potential chemical cues.
2.5. Training
The training series familiarized subjects with the procedure and comprised nine trials
per individual. In each trial, only one of the three apertures was fully open, and trials were
arranged in a quasi-random order under two constraints: (i) in each successive trial the
open hole occupied a new position relative to the previous one (left/center/right), and
(ii) each position was presented exactly three times. Training was deemed complete when
the fish entered the “Finish” compartment within three minutes; by the last two trials, all
subjects completed the transition in under 30 s.
The number of training trials (n = 9) was defined a priori to achieve minimal yet
sufficient counterbalancing and to limit animal burden: each of the three aperture positions
(left/center/right) was presented exactly three times (3 × 3), providing balanced control
of positional effects without overtraining. We adopted the same training dose as in our
methodologically comparable paradigms in mammals, where exit latencies stabilized
within this range while maintaining a moderate workload for the subjects.
2.6. Experiment 1
2.6.1. Experimental Procedure
The aim of Experiment 1 was to determine whether reedfish preferentially choose
larger apertures to access the “Finish” compartment. In pilot testing, the largest individual
was able to pass through a circular opening of 15 mm in diameter. Accordingly, the smallest
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 6 of 18
“passable” opening in the main experiment was set conservatively at 17 mm to avoid
discomfort or injury.
Each trial presented three circular, traversable apertures of distinctdiameters—17 mm
(small), 22 mm (medium), and 27 mm (large)—mounted in the central partition (see
Figure 3). The horizontal position of each aperture (left, center, right) varied according to a
quasi-random schedule under two constraints. First, across the entire series each aperture
size appeared equally often in each of the three positions, i.e., 12 presentations per position
(36 trials total). Second, from one trial to the next, an aperture of a given size was not
allowed to remain in the same position, thereby reducing simple positional strategies.
Figure 3. Arrangement of the inserted panels with holes in the first three trials of Experiment 1. Trial
numbers are shown on the left. Letters indicate the types and sizes of the round holes: a—small
(Ø 17 mm), b—medium (Ø 22 mm), and c—large (Ø 27 mm). Semicircular apertures of maximal size
in the partition are depicted in gray; the white circles mark the holes actually used in each trial.
The trial count per series was defined a priori as 36 to yield a fully balanced
3 (size) × 3 (position) design with four repetitions per cell for each subject. This length
allows us to (i) equalize marginal frequencies of sizes and positions, (ii) implement first-
order carryover control (a given size does not remain in the same position across consec-
utive trials), and (iii) achieve sufficient group-level precision (~32 observations per cell
across 8 fish) without imposing excessive burden on the animals. The same trial dose
has been used in our methodologically comparable paradigms in mammals, facilitating
cross-species comparability.
The complete trial sequences, including the order and combinations of apertures used
in each experimental series, are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
2.6.2. Recorded Variables and Statistical Analysis
We recorded three quantitative dependent variables per trial:
1. First approach to a given hole: the fish’s snout came within ≤15 mm of the partition
at a specific aperture without making physical contact with the rim.
2. First attempt to enter a given hole: any instance in which part of the snout penetrated
the aperture.
3. Full passage through a given hole: the fish traversed an aperture with the entire body,
leaving the “Start” compartment.
All analyses were conducted in R version 4.5.0. In the overwhelming majority of cases
(279 out of 288), the fish ultimately passed through the same hole it had first approached.
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 7 of 18
Accordingly, in subsequent analyses the chosen hole was operationalized as the hole of
full passage.
Statistical analyses were performed using generalized linear models. We initially
fitted a binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a logit link, in which
the probability of hole choice (CHOSEN) was modeled as a function of hole size (small,
medium, large), hole position (left, center, right), and trial number (TRIAL), with subject
identity (FISH) included as a random factor. However, this model resulted in singular fit
(variance of the random effect estimated as zero). Therefore, we discarded the random
factor and used a generalized linear model (GLM) with fixed predictors only.
The full model was compared against the null (intercept-only) model using likelihood
ratio tests and AIC. Model diagnostics were conducted with the DHARMa package, includ-
ing tests for dispersion, residual uniformity, and temporal autocorrelation. Multicollinearity
was evaluated using variance inflation factors (VIF). Explained variance was quantified
with McFadden’s pseudo-R2 and Tjur’s R2. Post hoc pairwise comparisons for the factors
“hole size” and “hole position” were performed with Tukey’s correction.
2.7. Experiment 2
2.7.1. Experimental Procedure
Experiment 2 assessed whether reedfish can select the single traversable aperture
among three when the two alternatives are larger in area. Pilot observations showed that
the largest individual could pass through a 15 mm circular opening; therefore, the minimum
passable diameter in the main test was conservatively set to 17 mm to avoid discomfort.
The series comprised 72 trials of two types distinguished by hole shapes: 24 test trials
and 48 background trials. In test trials, the partition contained one small passable aperture
and two large non-traversable ones. Small passable apertures were: (b1) a circle Ø 17 mm
and (b2) a 17 × 17 mm square (Figure 4). Large non-traversable apertures had an area
equal to 154% of the Ø 17 mm circle and came in two variants: (a3) a horizontal rectangle
50 × 7 mm and (a4) a vertical rectangle 7 × 50 mm. Test trials were counterbalanced
according to two rules: (i) from one test trial to the next, the position of the small passable
hole (left/center/right) always changed; (ii) the shapes and their pairings alternated evenly
so that each of the four combinations occurred six times: circle + horizontal rectangles;
circle + vertical rectangles; square + horizontal rectangles; square + vertical rectangles. This
prevented reliance on simple shape-based heuristics.
In background trials, the configuration was inverted: the partition held two pan-
els with large passable apertures and one with a small non-traversable aperture. Small
non-traversable shapes were: (a1) a circle Ø 7 mm and (a2) a 7 × 7 mm square; large
passable shapes were: (b3) a horizontal rectangle 50 × 17 mm and (b4) a vertical rectangle
17 × 50 mm (Figure 4). Background trials were counterbalanced by (i) changing the position
of the small non-traversable aperture from trial to trial, and (ii) alternating shape pairings
evenly so that each of the four combinations occurred twelve times (circle + horizontal;
circle + vertical; square + horizontal; square + vertical).
Across the series, two background trials always preceded one test trial, and the
sequence started with background trials. This alternation was designed to prevent the
formation of a simple rule to pass either the smallest hole or, conversely, the largest ones
relative to their neighbors.
The total of 72 trials in Experiment 2 (24 test, 48 background) was defined a priori to
achieve full counterbalancing of shapes and positions with a minimal yet sufficient data
volume and moderate animal burden. Test trials implemented four combinations (small
passable: circle/square × large non-traversable: horizontal/vertical rectangles), each pre-
sented six times (24 tests), with the position of the small passable hole changing from trial to
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 8 of 18
trial and being evenly distributed across left/center/right. Background trials mirrored this
structure with four combinations (small non-traversable: circle/square × large passable:
horizontal/vertical rectangles), each presented twelve times (48 backgrounds), under the
same positional control. The fixed sequence of two background trials followed by one test
trial (series starting with background) prevented learning a simple “always choose the
smallest” or “always choose the largest” rule, thereby targeting body size awareness rather
than heuristic responding. This design yields six observations per combination at the indi-
vidual level (and 48/96 at the group level across eight fish), providing adequate precision
for GLM estimation and Tukey post hoc contrasts while maintaining comparability to our
previous protocols.

Section 2.7.1). Gray shapes depict the partition’s maximal-size arched apertures, while white shapes
mark the holes actually used in each trial.
The complete trial sequences, including the order and combinations of apertures used
in each experimental series, are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
2.7.2. Recorded Variables and Statistical Analysis
We quantified three dependent measures per trial:
1. First approach to a specific aperture (snout within ≤15 mm of the partition without
contacting the rim);
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 9 of 18
2. First penetration attempt at a specific aperture (partial insertion of the snout into
the hole);
3. Full passage through one of the apertures (the fish entirely leaves the“Start” compartment).
Operational details follow Section 2.6.
Data from the second experiment were analyzed using generalized linear models
(GLMs) with a binomial error structure and logit link function. Two sets of analyses
were conducted: (1) for the first penetration attempts made by the fish, and (2) for the first
approaches towards an aperture within each trial. In both cases, the dependent variable was
a binary outcome (0/1), indicating whether a given aperture was chosen in the respective
context (attempt or approach).
Fixed predictors included aperture penetrability (b1, b2 = penetrable; a3, a4 = non-
penetrable), small-hole shape (round b1 vs. square b2), large-hole shape (horizontal a3 vs.
vertical a4), aperture position (Left, Center, Right), and trial number (continuous covariate).
Initial models specified fish identity as a random effect (GLMM), but these models were
singular (random-effect variance ≈ 0). Therefore, final analyses were conducted using
GLMs with fixed effects only.
For each model, we evaluated: likelihood ratio tests against the null model, Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC), pseudo-R2 measures (McFadden’s and Tjur’s R2), dispersion,
residual uniformity, and temporal autocorrelation using DHARMa simulations, multi-
collinearity diagnostics (variance inflation factors, VIF).
Post hoc analyses were conducted using the emmeans package, including contrasts
comparing penetrable vs. non-penetrable apertures, small-hole shape (round vs. square),
large-hole shape (horizontal vs. vertical), and pairwise Tukey-adjusted comparisons across
the three positions.
2.8. Use of AI-Assisted Tools
During manuscript preparation, we used ChatGPT 5 (OpenAI) solely for translating
draft Russian text into English and for minor language editing (style/wording adjustments
without altering the scientific content). All sections, data, conclusions, and interpretations
were written and validated by the author; any machine-generated suggestions were re-
viewed and edited by a human. No AI tools were used for data generation/processing,
statistical analyses, figure preparation, literature selection, or research decision-making.
3. Results
3.1. Experiment 1
The binomial GLM revealed that neither hole size, hole position, nor trial number
had any significant effect on fish choices. All predictor coefficients were close to zero (all
p > 0.79), whereas the intercept corresponded to a choice probability of ~0.33, i.e., chance
level across three alternatives. Comparison of the full and null models confirmed the
absence of predictor effects (χ2(4) = 0.09, p = 0.999; ∆AIC = +7.9).
Pseudo-R2 values indicated no explained variance (McFadden’s R2 = 0.0001; Tjur’s
R2 = 0.001). Post hoc Tukey comparisons showed no differences among hole sizes (L–M,
L–S, M–S, all p > 0.96) or among positions (left–center, left–right, center–right, all p > 0.96).
Model diagnostics with DHARMa indicated no problems: residuals were uniformly
distributed (p = 0.26), dispersion was adequate (p = 0.95), and no temporal autocorrelation
was detected (DW = 1.79, p = 0.074).
In summary, fish chose among the three holes at chance level, with no detectable effect
of hole size or position (Figure 5).

(small/medium/large). Bars show per-fish means with 95% CIs; the dashed line marks chance
level (1/3). Neither hole size nor position affected choice (see Section 3.1).
3.2. Experiment 2
In this section we report analyses for the 24 test trials only. The 48 background trials
served as an anti-heuristic scaffold (inverting the “small/large” contingencies to prevent
simple rule learning) and were not included in the inferential models for Experiment 2.
This decision was made a priori to avoid mixing data with different task contingencies and
to provide an undiluted estimate of the target effect—selection of the single traversable
aperture under test configurations.
3.2.1. Choice of Hole for the First Approach
The analysis of first approaches revealed no effects of any predictors. The full model
did not differ from the null (LR χ2(6) = 0.96, p = 0.99), and explained-variance measures
were negligible (McFadden’s R2 = 0.0013; Tjur’s R2 = 0.002).
For TYPE, no significant differences were detected: the contrast comparing penetrable
(b1,b2) versus non-penetrable (a3,a4) holes was non-significant (z = 0.18,p = 0.86) (Figure 6).
Likewise, there were no differences between the two penetrable shapes (b1 vs. b2) or
between the two non-penetrable shapes (a3 vs. a4) (both p > 0.44). POSITION had no effect
on first approaches; Tukey pairwise comparisons among left, center, and right positions
indicated no differences (all p ≥ 0.97). TRIAL also showed no effect (p = 0.97).
Descriptive statistics supported a random distribution of first approaches across hole
types. Mean per-fish proportions ( ±95% CI) were: b1 = 0.312 [0.251; 0.374], b2 = 0.365
[0.282; 0.447], a3 = 0.344 [0.303; 0.384], a4 = 0.318 [0.292; 0.344], with substantial overlap
among confidence intervals. Thus, first approaches were effectively random and did not
depend on hole penetrability, shape, position, or trial number.

Figure 6. Experiment 2 (test trials only)—first approaches to apertures: proportion of approaches by
hole type. b1 and b2 denote penetrable openings (circle Ø17 mm; square 17 × 17 mm); a3 and a4 are
non-traversable (horizontal rectangle 50 × 7 mm; vertical rectangle 7 × 50 mm). Bars show per-fish
means with 95% CIs; dots represent individual fish. First approaches were distributed at chance level
and did not depend on aperture type (see Section 3.2.1).
3.2.2. Choice of Hole for the First Penetration Attempt
The binomial GLM revealed that hole penetrability was the decisive factor for fish
choice. Fish almost exclusively selected penetrable holes (b1 or b2), whereas non-penetrable
holes (a3, a4) were virtually never chosen (Figure 7). The effect of TYPE was highly
significant (χ2(3) = 669, p < 0.0001), and the full model was strongly superior to the null
(∆AIC = –657).
Post hoc contrasts confirmed that penetrable holes were chosen significantly more
often than non-penetrable ones (z = 9.85, p < 0.0001). No differences were detected between
the two penetrable types (b1 vs. b2, p = 0.56) or between the two non-penetrable types (a3
vs. a4, p = 0.57).
The factor POSITION had no influence on choice (χ2(2) = 1.04, p = 0.59), and pairwise
Tukey comparisons indicated no differences between left, center, and right positions (all
p > 0.58). The effect of trial number (TRIAL) was also non-significant (p = 0.92).
Model diagnostics with DHARMa indicated no problems: dispersion was adequate
(p = 0.97), residuals were uniformly distributed (p = 0.67), and no temporal autocorrelation
was detected (Durbin–Watson = 1.82, p = 0.20). Measures of explained variance showed
that the model accounted for nearly all variability in fish behavior (McFadden’s R2 = 0.91;
Tjur’s R2 = 0.95).
It should be added that whenever a penetration attempt targeted a penetrable hole (b1
or b2), it invariably resulted in full passage into the “Finish” compartment.
In summary, fish clearly distinguished between penetrable and non-penetrable holes,
almost always selecting the penetrable option, while hole shape, position, and trial number
had no effect on choice.

Figure 7. Experiment 2 (test trials only)—first penetration attempts: proportion of choices by aperture
type. b1 and b2 denote penetrable holes (circle Ø17 mm; square 17 × 17 mm), a3 and a4 are non-
penetrable (horizontal rectangle 50 × 7 mm; vertical rectangle 7 × 50 mm). Bars show per-fish means
with 95% CIs; dots represent individual fish. Fish directed their first attempt almost exclusively to
the penetrable apertures (b1, b2), whereas attempts toward non-penetrable ones (a3, a4) were near
zero (see Section 3.2.2).
4. Discussion
4.1. Experiment 1
When all three apertures were traversable and varied in diameter and position, reedfish
showed no preference for size or location: choices were at chance. In other words, the
operative principle here is not “the bigger, the better,” but “sufficient to pass.” Given
equally traversable options, fish did not maximize aperture width, indicating a strategy
that matches bodily limits to the minimally required resource (passability) rather than
seeking redundant clearance.
A comparison with taxonomically distant mammals tested in a methodologically simi-
lar paradigm highlights cross-species differences. Ferrets consistently preferred the central
hole irrespective of size, interpreted as selecting the shortest path through the partition [2].
In contrast, rats tended to avoid the center and favored the left or right hole, which aligns
with their tendency to minimize exposure to open, less protected spaces [10]. In our study,
neither a central nor a peripheral bias emerged—reedfish distributed choices evenly.
We propose that, when several options are equally passable, reedfish effectively adopt
a “first available contact” strategy: they pass through the first aperture they approach. This
pattern accords with the species’ sensory profile—low visual spatial acuity and reliance
on near-field cues [21–23]—and we elaborate on these mechanistic underpinnings in the
discussion of Experiment 2.
4.2. Experiment 2
Experiment 2 revealed a clear phase split. First approaches were randomly distributed
across apertures, whereas the first penetration attempt (followed invariably by full passage)
was directed to the single traversable aperture—even though it was smaller in area than
the other two. In short, exploration showed no selectivity, while the decision to penetrate
was virtually error-free.
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 13 of 18
This pattern supports a two-stage process: the “pass/not pass” judgment emerges
at near range, immediately prior to action [ 7]. It aligns with a modular account of self-
representation: (i) a scouting/orientation module and (ii) a body-to-obstacle matching
module, recruited in different phases of the same goal-directed sequence [27,28]. Given
the polypterid sensory profile (low visual spatial acuity and high reliance on near-field
mechanosensory/tactile cues [21–23]), the transition from distal scanning to contact with the
aperture rim is precisely where the geometry of the head/body is matched to the opening.
This two-phase organization maps naturally onto epistemic versus pragmatic
actions [29,30]. Our first approaches are epistemic acts: they do not aim to achieve
the outcome per se but to gather information—any approach “at random” yields tac-
tile/hydrodynamic input sufficient to assess passability. By contrast, first penetration
attempts are pragmatic acts, i.e., the use of accumulated information to attain the goal (en-
try into the target compartment): at this stage, choice ceases to be random, and fish reliably
select the traversable aperture. Taken together, the data provide direct evidence that reed-
fish take their own body limits into account when choosing among competing openings.
This behavioral dissociation between exploratory (epistemic) and goal-directed (prag-
matic) actions can be interpreted through the lens of embodied and predictive frame-
works. In predictive-processing terms, epistemic actions minimize uncertainty about affor-
dances, while pragmatic actions minimize expected free energy during goalattainment [30].
Within an embodied cognition perspective, these two phases correspond to distinct con-
trol loops within sensorimotor coupling—an information-gathering loop and an execu-
tion loop—which jointly constitute an adaptive body-scaled interaction with the envi-
ronment [31]. This interpretation aligns with the modular account of self-representation
proposed in this study: epistemic and pragmatic loops can be viewed as separable yet
interacting modules that jointly support body-size awareness and action control.
Controlling Alternative Explanations
First, the design precluded learning of simple rules. A fully balanced 3×3 “size × position”
plan with four repetitions per cell and quasi-random reassignment of apertures across consecu-
tive trials prevented strategies such as “always center,” “always edge,” or “always the largest.”
The null effect of TRIAL and the lack of differences across positions and sizes in the model
confirm the absence of trend learning and sequence heuristics.
Second, lateral biases were explicitly tested and ruled out: no left–center–right effects
were observed. Finally, routine odor/trace controls (panel rotation and rinsing, stable flow)
minimized potential chemical cues. Together, these controls support the interpretation that
fish were genuinely indifferent to superfluous clearance when all options were traversable,
rather than being driven by procedural artifacts.
4.3. General Discussion
Our findings fit within the expanding body of research on body-size awareness while
highlighting species-specific adaptations shaped by sensory ecology and morphology.
To facilitate cross-species comparison, we organize the discussion along three heuristic
dimensions: (i) sensory ecology, the dominant information channels and spatial scale of
sensing; (ii) action policy, the relative balance between exploratory (epistemic) and goal-
directed (pragmatic) control; and (iii) evolutionary and eco-morphological context, the
niche constraints and body plan that shape passability judgments.
4.3.1. Sensory Ecology
In studies employing the same or closely related “body-as-obstacle” paradigms with
warm-blooded vertebrates—rats [10], ferrets [2], and crows [16]—subjects typically directed
their first approach, first attempt, and subsequent passage immediately to the single
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 14 of 18
traversable aperture. In contrast, reedfish displayed random first approaches but almost
exclusive selection of the passable hole on the first penetration attempt. This two-phase
organization—non-selective scanning followed by decisive discrimination—suggests that
passability is evaluated only at near range.
Such divergence is consistent with differences in sensory resolution. Visual acuity is
high enough in rats (~0.9–1.0 cpd [32]), ferrets (~0.65 cpd [33]), and corvids (~8.4 cpd [34])
to allow remote visual assessment of passability. In contrast, related polypterids exhibit
extremely low acuity (~0.05–0.075 cpd in Polypterus senegalus[21]). Consequently, reedfish
likely rely on tactile, lateral-line, and proprioceptive inputs to assess aperture size only at
close distance. This sensory profile explains the random exploratory approaches and the
near-deterministic choice at the attempt stage.
In reedfish, visual acuity is likely insufficient for remote passability assessment, sug-
gesting that near-field mechanosensory systems play a major role. Based on polypterid
morphology and behavior, the most plausible contributors are cranial lateral-line sensors,
tactile receptors around the head and mouth, and hydrodynamic feedback generated dur-
ing close inspection of the apertures [20,22,35,36]. These modalities likely operate in concert,
providing real-time estimates of spatial constraints through water displacement and sur-
face contact. Although the present study was not designed to isolate these components,
future experiments could systematically test their relative contributions—for instance, by
temporarily attenuating lateral-line input, manipulating water flow, or modifying aperture
texture—to determine the specific mechanistic basis of passability judgments.
4.3.2. Action Policy
Within a cognitive framework, this behavioral pattern supports a modular view of
self-representation: behavior separates into epistemic actions (initial approaches serving in-
formation gathering) and pragmatic actions (penetration attempts and passages that utilize
the acquired information) [29,30]. Reedfish express these phases sequentially within the
same episode, whereas in visually oriented species the epistemic phase is externalized—it
occurs before approach and relies primarily on vision. Thus, differences in sensory ar-
chitecture and ecological niche (benthic, crepuscular lifestyle in reedfish) can account for
cross-species variation in temporal dynamics of body-size–related decisions, while preserv-
ing the shared underlying mechanism—evaluating bodily limits to select a passable route.
4.3.3. Evolutionary and Eco-Morphological Context
Our results converge with data on Elaphe radiata [17], obtained in a similar two-
compartment, three-aperture setup. Snakes developed body-limit awareness and behav-
ioral flexibility, but only after series-level learning. Reedfish, in contrast, displayed the
same functional outcome—matching body size to aperture constraints—without extended
training, relying on near-field sensory evaluation. Both species reach the same cognitive
goal through different temporal and sensory pathways.
Despite methodological differences, these and related paradigms all operationalize
the same construct: judging “passable vs. non-passable” as a body-scaled affordance.
Therefore, the construct validity of cross-species comparison remains robust.
Comparable evidence in toddlers (door-choice task [9]) shows developmental progres-
sion from body-representation errors to accurate scaling of one’s own body dimensions. In
dogs [12], body-size representation guides route selection between a too-small door and a
detour, with decisions made largely without trial-and-error. Reedfish achieve an analogous
outcome on a different sensory footing: random exploratory approaches followed by pre-
cise, pragmatic attempts at the traversable aperture—behavioral proof of self-scaling at the
moment of action.
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 15 of 18
Similar discriminative behavior appears in single-aperture paradigms with dogs [6,12],
cats [13], birds [14], and insects [15], where individuals anticipate passability before entering
narrow spaces. Despite their low vision (~0.05–0.075 cpd [ 21] vs. 7–10 cpd in dogs [ 37],
7.7–10 cpd in budgerigars [38], ~3–9 cpd in cats [ 39] and ~0.21 cpd in bumblebees [ 40]),
reedfish achieve the same functional outcome as visually guided taxa—accurate matching
of body boundaries to environmental constraints.
Finally, convergence extends beyond vertebrates. In terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita
compressus [18]), individuals preferentially select shells whose external geometry allows
escape through a gauged opening—an “extended body” version of the same self-scaling
principle. Across these diverse taxa, body-size awareness emerges as a general solution to
the problem of adaptive interaction between body and environment, implemented through
different sensory modalities and morphologies.
From an ecological standpoint, body-size awareness in reedfish is likely an adap-
tive specialization linked to their benthic and crepuscular lifestyle. Erpetoichthys calabari-
cus frequently occupies dense submerged vegetation, rock crevices, and burrow systems
in slow-flowing West African waters, where successful navigation depends on precise
body–environment matching. The ability to evaluate passability at near range would
facilitate access to refuges, prey pursuit within confined spaces, and rapid retreat from
predators. This interpretation accords with the species’ elongated morphology and am-
phibious behavior, which together demand continuous recalibration between aquatic and
aerial locomotion [19,24]. Similar ecological pressures—predator avoidance and use of
narrow shelters—have been proposed as selective contexts for body-size awareness in
other taxa [1,10]. Therefore, in reedfish, the observed two-phase sensorimotor strategy
likely reflects an ancient, ecologically grounded mechanism of embodied spatial cognition
supporting survival in structurally complex habitats.
4.4. Practical Implications and Potential Applications
The present findings may have relevance beyond basic comparative cognition. First,
understanding body-size awareness in non-mammalian vertebrates contributes to refining
welfare practices for benthic and semi-amphibious fish in laboratory and aquaculture
settings. Recognizing that reedfish adjust behavior according to body–environment fit
suggests that enclosure design should provide spatial affordances allowing animals to
exercise such sensorimotor judgments, reducing stress and injury during exploration
or maintenance. Second, these data may inform bio-inspired robotics, particularly the
development of soft or flexible robots operating in cluttered or aquatic environments. The
two-phase control strategy observed in reedfish—initial exploratory (epistemic) sampling
followed by precise, goal-directed (pragmatic) adjustment—parallels adaptive sensorimotor
loops currently modeled in embodied robotics and active perception systems [ 41–43].
Translating these behavioral principles into robotic architectures could enhance navigation,
self-calibration, and obstacle negotiation in confined or dynamic settings.
4.5. Limitations of the Study
First, the generalizability of our findings is constrained by the sample size and com-
position: eight laboratory-housed individuals from a single supplier, with a balanced
sex ratio (4♂/4♀) but a narrow size range (32–34 cm TL) and no systematic coverage of
age/maturity. Because the random-effects model yielded a singular fit (FISH variance ≈ 0),
we adopted GLMs with fixed effects, which reduces our ability to formally quantify
between-subject variability.
Second, our conclusions about the sensory basis (near-range mechanosensory/tactile
dominance under low visual acuity) are inferential. We did not directly manipulate the
Animals 2025, 15, 3231 16 of 18
lateral line/olfaction/vision nor did we measure visual acuity in reedfish within this
protocol. Despite odor/track controls (panel rinsing, constant flow, alternating panel sets),
micro-hydrodynamic or chemical cues cannot be entirely excluded; future work should
instrumentally monitor microflow and include “carryover” controls for residual odor cues.
Third, the task geometry was limited: fixed water depth, three apertures, and a finite
set of shapes/sizes. We did not derive a psychometric passability function around the
13–16 mm threshold, nor did we vary illumination, background contrast, temperature,
flow speed, or camera vantage, any of which could modulate approach strategy. The
motivational context favored a single outcome (leaving a brighter compartment for a
shelter); alternative reinforcers (e.g., food) and fatigue across 10–12 trials/day were not
systematically assessed. Finally, we did not implement formal observer blinding in video
scoring (if this is accurate; replace accordingly if blinding was used), leaving a residual risk
of observer bias.
Together, these constraints do not undermine the central pattern (chance performance
when all apertures are traversable; near-perfect targeting of the single traversable aperture
at the attempt stage), but they delineate clear avenues for follow-up studies: larger and
more diverse samples, direct sensory manipulations, richer stimulus spaces, psychophysical
thresholding, and strengthened controls for potential microcues and observer effects.
5. Conclusions
Reedfish (Erpetoichthys calabaricus) exhibited behavioral evidence of body size aware-
ness in a “body-as-obstacle” task. When all apertures were traversable (Experiment 1),
choices were at chance, indicating no maximization of aperture size under equal pass-
ability. In contrast, with a single traversable option (Experiment 2), first approaches were
exploratory and random, whereas the first penetration attempt—and the ensuing full
passage—was directed almost exclusively to the traversable hole.
Taken together, these findings indicate that the pass/not-pass judgment is formed at
near range, relying on sensorimotor cues that match head/body limits to environmental
constraints. This aligns with a modular view of self-representation: reedfish behavior sepa-
rates epistemic actions (information gathering) from pragmatic actions (using information
to achieve the goal). Thus, we extend the comparative landscape of body size awareness to
a taxonomically distant, benthic fish with low visual acuity.
Methodologically, our strictly counterbalanced three-aperture paradigm robustly
isolates the “passability assessment” module from potential heuristics (position, shape,
order). Future work should quantify passability thresholds (psychophysical functions) and
manipulate sensory channels (e.g., lateral-line perturbations, illumination) to directly test
the near-field mechanism implied by our data.
