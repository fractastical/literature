ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY OF INDIAN AGRICULTURE: ARE 
ENERGY GUZZLING DISTRICTS GENERATING HIGHER 
AGRICULTURAL VALUE?

ABSTRACT  
 
Groundwater irrigation has been central to India’s irrigated agriculture. India is the 
largest extractor of groundwater, pumping nearly 250 km3 every year for irrigation. The 
abstraction of groundwater is closely coupled with acc ess to subsidized or free 
electricity in the country. Supply of free electricity has led to the perverse groundwater-
energy nexus in the country. This nexus has resulted in grave economic and 
environmental repercussions. There is a mounting fiscal burden of energy subsidies in 
the country, which has led many power utilities at the helm of bankruptcy. At the same 
time, free power has attributed to the groundwater depletion at an alarming rate in many 
parts of the country. Hence, i t becomes important to understand whether these 
economic and environmental costs of groundwater irrigation are commensurate with its 
benefits. This study takes a look at the energy productivity of groundwater irrigated 
agriculture in the districts of India and asses ses its contribution to the agricultural 
output.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Groundwater irrigation is the mainstay of Indian agriculture. It meets around 60% of 
India’s irrigation needs and plays a crucial role in feeding 170-180 million populaces of 
the country (Zaveri et al. 2016). India’s groundwater consumption dramatically 
increased from 50 km3 in 1970 to 250 km3 in 2010 [Shah 2014]. Of 250 km 3, more 
than 90% is used for irrigation alone. In terms of area, groundwater irrigated area 
increased from 12 million ha to 40 million ha in between 1970-2010 (MoSPI 2015). In 
between 1990-2010, 90% of the total incremental net irrigated area was contributed 
through groundwater alone. Some of the major drivers of this spectacular growth in 
groundwater irrigation have been: [a] the mounting population pressure on farmlands; 
[b] failure of c anals in providing year-round, on-demand water supply in most places; 
[c] technological advancements leading to cheap and easy access to pumps and drilling 
equipment; and [d] most importantly, the availability of free or highly subsidized 
electricity for pumping (Shah 2009, Mukherji et al. 2012). The low or marginal cost of 
groundwater extraction due to highly subsidized energy played a major role in 
expanding groundwater irrigation in the country. Power utilities of India passed 
electricity subsidies worth Rs. 369 billion (~US$ 7 billion) to the farmers for groundwater 
pumping in 2012 (Gulati & Pahuja 2015). However, free or subsidized electricity has 
subsequently led to groundwater overexploitation due to inefficient and unregulated 
pumping in many parts of the country (Kumar 2005, Shah et al. 2003). 
 
Since groundwater is a finite resource and a large amount of energy being used for its 
extraction on the expense of public money, it is important to understand the utilization 
of these resources and their contribution in agricultural production. This study attempts:

to do a comparative analysis of the most energy-efficient districts and the least energy-
efficient districts; and [c] to discuss the contribution of energy use in India’s agricultural 
output using a logarithmic input-output function. 
 
2.  DATA AND METHODS 
 
2.1  Data 
 
We compiled district -level data from various sources, as shown in Table 1. The 
datasets don't pertain to a single year. However, we assume this to be an acceptable 
limitation considering the scale and scope of the study. The district boundaries used in 
the paper relate to 593 districts in Census 2001. All the data has been converted to the 
same 593 districts against the current 707 districts. Of the 590 districts covered, data 
of 468 districts were considered for analysis.122 districts were left partly due to a very 
low quantum of groundwater use and partly due to unavailability of complete datasets. 
 
Table 1. Data Used in the Study with Sources 
 
 
Districts of the hilly and mountainous states of India were not included because of its 
unique agro-ecosystem, which is mostly dependent on rainfall, springs and local water 
bodies. For the  econometric analysis, 468 districts have been classified to regional 
dummies (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) based on Minor Irrigation (MI) Census to take into 
consideration the variability of agro-climatic and groundwater use variations across the 
districts (see Figure 1).

2.2  Energy Use Estimation 
 
The study estimates the energy use from groundwater pumping using the latest Fifth 
Minor Irrigation Census dataset. Annual energy consumption for each electric-powered 
pump and the diesel-operated pump is estimated separately, and then aggregated for 
20.5 million groundwater wells to estimate the national -level energy consumption  
(see eq. 1).  
 
Energy Use (in kWh) = [∑ (Pe*He) * 0.746]/ (ƞ*T) + [∑(Pd*Hd) *0.746]/ ƞ………(eq. 1)  
Where, Pe= Electric-pump size in HP, He= Hours of operation of electric pumps, Pd = 
Diesel-pump size in HP, Hd = Hours of operation of diesel pumps, ƞ = Pump Efficiency, 
T= Transmission loss. Conversion factor of 0.746 was used to convert Horse power 
(HP) into kilowatt.  
 
Energy use from groundwater pumping is sensitive to pump efficiency. Nelson et al. 
(2009) reported that energy consumption can be reduced by 30 -50% by increasing 
pump efficiency from 0.2 to 0.3. The estimated value of pump efficiency in India varies 
between 30-40% across the studies (Patle et al. 2016, Shah 2009, Nelson et al. 2009, 
Rajan & Verma 2017) reported that the on-farm energy consumption by electric pumps 
was closest to the electricity supplied to agriculture at 40% pump efficiency. For this 
study, we have computed energy use and emissions at an efficiency of 40% for electric 
pumps. For diesel pumps, the computations have been done at an efficiency of 30% 
(Shah 2009). We have assumed the transmission and distribution losses (T&D) to be 
20% in case of electric pumps based on a recent T&D estimation done by  the 
Government of India (CSO 2017). 
 
Energy productivity is defined as the agricultural output produced using per unit of 
energy (Upadhyaya and Sikka 2016). Energy productivity is expressed in terms of Rs. 
per kWh in the study. 
 
2.3  Value of Crop Output Estimation 
 
Value of Crop output (VoP)is the aggregate value of all crops in the year 2010 -11 (in 
Indian Rupees at constant prices of 2004 -05) at district-level. To estimate the energy 
productivity, the study only accounts for VoP coming from groundwater irrigated areas. 
Public datasets don’t provide such information. In order to estimate the VoP from 
groundwater, we apportioned the VoP among groundwater irrigated area, surface 
water irrigated area and rainfed area using productivity weights. The weights of  
productivity were surmised to be 1.6:1.2:1 between groundwater irrigated area, surface 
water irrigated area and rain -fed area, and sourced from  Goswami et al. 2017. 
Goswami et al. 2017 estimate that crop -output of 1 ha of groundwater irrigated area 
and 1 ha of surface water irrigated area are 1.6 and 1.2 times of 1 ha of rainfed area. 
Overall, VoP of groundwater irrigated area is estimated to be Rs. 4.2 trillion -around 
48% of the total value of crop output. 
 
3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Energy Use in Groundwater Irrigation in India 
 
Energy consumption in agriculture has rapidly surged since the ushering of the Green 
Revolution. According to CEA, electricity supply to agriculture, around 90% of it being 
used for groundwater pumping, has increased 54 times in between 1970-2016 - from 
3,857 GWh to 1,87,493 GWh (Dharmadhikary et al. 2018). Use of diesel-oil increased 
from 1 million tonnes in 1980 to around 8 million tonnes in 2006 in the agriculture sector 
(Jha et al. 2012). Roughly 25-30% of total diesel consumption in agriculture is used for 
pumping groundwater. Our estimations from the latest Fifth MI Census showsaround

220 GWh of energy was consumed by groundwater irrigation in 2013. Of 221 GWh, 
electric pumps accounted for roughly 179 million kWh; diesel pumps accounted for 41.2 
million kWh; and other sources like solar, wind, etc. did marginal contribution of 0.8 
million kWh. 82% of India’s total energy use in agriculture is sourced from electricity. 
Figure 2a shows the divide in energy use in groundwater  irrigation. Incidence of very 
high energy use (>1500 kWh/ha) can be observed in the districts of Punjab, Haryana, 
western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. Groundwater stressed 
western and southern India -from Punjab in the north to sou thernmost state of Tamil 
Nadu- has relatively high energy use when compared to the groundwater-rich, eastern 
India (CGWB 2013). Cost of pumping varies from US $ 0 -5 per MWh in the western 
and southern India because of supply of free or highly subsidized electricity; whereas 
the cost of pumping in diesel -dominated eastern India is US $ 350 MWh (Shah et al. 
2018). Pricing of energy is one of the key drivers in determining the energy use in the 
country. 
 
On equating the energy consumption figures with annual groundwater draft for irrigation 
in 2013 (i.e. 228 bcm) (CGWB 2013), it comes out that, on an average, 1 kWh of energy 
is used to draft 1 m3 of groundwater in the country. Figure 2b maps the district -wise 
energy used to draft 1 m3 of in the country. Energy use per m3 is relatively very high 
in the western and southern states of India when compared to the eastern states. 
Possible reasons behind the high energy use in the region can be partly due to 
inefficient pumping practices because of free or subsidized p ower and partly in 
response to depleted aquifers. High energy use for pumping has high economic and 
environmental costs associated with it. 
 
However, majority of the farmers don’t bear the actual energy cost of groundwater 
extraction but there is a huge public investment being done for groundwater access. It 
will be interesting to understand how efficiently energy is being utilized in agricultu ral 
production.

from every unit of energy. Whereas the majority of the districts located in western and 
southern India, where energy use is high (see Figure 2a), generates the lowest output 
from the energy used.

States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh 
emerged as the most inefficient in terms of energy use (Figure 4). These states 
consume the maximum energy to yield a unit of groundwater and generates the lea st 
value of output using the energy consumed. Together these states consume around 
44% of the total energy used for pumping in the country and account for only 18% of 
the total crop output. Inefficient pumping practices

Kerala and West Bengal (WB) have the highest energy productivity among all the 
states. Two broad reasons for their better performance: [a] energy requirement to 
extract a unit of groundwater i.e. 0.25 -0.35 kWh/m3is low in both the states; and [ii]

water extracted is used for cultivation for high-value crops. High-value crops3 account 
for 90%, and 62% of the value of crop -output in Kerala and WB respectively. With its 
high energy productivity, West Bengal (WB) stands apart from its adjacent states of 
Bihar and Assam, which have similar hydrogeology and agro-climatic conditions 
 
Figure 4 shows that energy used to yield one unit of water is almost similar in WB, 
Bihar, and Assam. Groundwater pumping is dominated by cost-intensive diesel pumps 
in all the three states - more than 70% of total pumps are diesel-powered. Despite these 
similarities, WB has high-productivity because of large-scale cultivation of high -value 
crops like potato. Potato alone accounts for around 45% of WB’s crop output comes. 
On the contrary, agriculture in Bihar and Assam are still paddy -wheat centric, which 
consumes more water. High -value crops roughly contribute to 27% and 23% of the 
value of crop-output in Bihar and Assam respectively. WB makes the most out of its 
costly diesel -based irrigation by cultivating potato - which requires less water and  
generates more value in comparison of paddy and wheat. 
 
3.3  Are Top Energy-Guzzling Districts Generating High Agricultural Value?  
 
This section investigates the performance of top energy consuming districts of India 
and assesses how efficiently they utilize their energy resources. India's 50 districts with 
the highest energy consumption belong to the western and southern states majorly 
(Figure 5). These 50 districts account for 25% of total groundwater wells, and draft 27% 
of total groundwater used for irrigation i n the country. However, these districts 
disproportionately use 46% of the country’s total energy used in groundwater pumping 
to abstract this volume of water. None of the 50 highest energy consuming districts 
overlaps with the highest energy productive districts (see Figure 5).

abstract this volume of water. None of the 50 highest energy consuming districts 
overlaps with the highest energy productive districts. 
 
Table 2 compares the fifty highest energy consuming districts with fifty highest energy 
productive districts (see Figure 5 ). Both energy productivity and water productivity of 
this 50 energy-guzzling are worryingly low. What troubles more is that energy and water 
applied in these districts are mostly used for subsistence, low-value agriculture. 
 
Table 2: Top 50 Energy Consuming Districts vs. Top 50 Energy Productive Districts 
 
The energy requirement to draw one cubic meter of water is 75% more than the national 
average of 1 kWh per m3in the 50 highest energy consuming districts (see Table 2). 
High energy requirement indicates the precarious groundwater scenario in these 
districts. Of the 50 districts, 21 are in the over -exploited stage of groundwater 
development; and 15 others are in semi-critical and critical stage (CGWB 2013). Due 
to depleted aquifers, farmers in these districts use deeper wells to extract groundwater. 
According to Fifth MI Census, of 2.5 million Deep Tube wells (DTWs) -which operate 
at >70 meters of depth -, around 1 -1.2 million DTWs are concentrated in these 50 
districts. 
 
Drawing water using DTWs from greater depths requires more energy to extract every 
cubic meter of water (). What troubles more is the poor application groundwater in these 
districts. Districts of Punjab and Maharashtra use the cost -intensive and scarce 
groundwater resource to cultivate thirsty crops like paddy and sugarcane. 
 
3.4  Role of Energy as a Modern Input: An Econometric Analysis  
 
This section discusses the relationship between energy use and crop output at the 
district level. An attempt has been done to assess the impact of energy as an input on 
the crop output using econometric analysis. For the present analysis, the following form 
of Cobb-Douglas function has been estimated on the input-output data of 460 districts.

The choice of independent variables i.e. input factors has been done partly by their 
importance as contributors t o the agricultural output and partly by the availability of 
reliable data at the district level. The underlying hypothesis in this production 
relationship is that the district-level production is an increasing function of energy, land, 
labor, irrigation, fertilizers, and rainfall. Consequently, we include 5 dummy variables in 
our model to control for agro -climatic and groundwater use variations across the 
districts in India. 
 
Table 3. Results of Cobb-Douglas Input-Output Regression Function 
 
Notes: Figures in parentheses is standard errors of the coefficients. * and** indicate coefficients significant at 1 percent and 
5 percent level of significance respectively for the two-tailed t-test. 
 
The results of the regression are reported in Table 3 shows that the impact of various 
factors on the agricultural output is positive, statistically significant and on the expected 
lines. The magnitude of the coefficients of the inputs determines their respective 
importance on agricultural output. Impact of inputs can be interpreted as elasticities 
where the magnitude of energy elasticity is the lowest of all the inputs. This indicates 
the lower importance of energy used in agricultural production vis -à-vis other inputs. 
The results can be interpreted as for every 1 % increase in energy used, crop output 
increases by 0.05%. Doubling the current energy use in the country will increase the 
crop output by only 5%. It seems that the large public investments on power subsidies 
have a mild impact on the crop output of the country.

4.  CONCLUSION 
 
Energy is an important aspect of groundwater irrigation. Availability and pricing of 
energy play an important role in India’s groundwater development and agricultural 
output. This energy productivity estimation conducted in this study shows that energy 
productivity varies from Rs. 2 -3 kWh per m 3 in districts of Maharashtra to Rs. 90 -100 
kWh per m3 in some districts of West Bengal. Unmetered and free access to energy for 
pumping has created asymmetries in the groundwater availability and its utilization in 
the western and Southern India. This region uses more energy to abstract groundwater 
because of depleted aquifers, and when extracted, water is inefficiently utilized for 
cultivation of crops like paddy in some pockets. The study also identified the 50 districts, 
which are the hotspots of the inefficient energy utilization for cultivation in the country. 
These districts account for half of India’s total energy consumption for pumping to yield 
a quarter of the total crop output  from groundwater irrigation. The high population of 
deep tube wells, operating on subsidized electricity, has led to the distortions in water-
energy-food equilibrium in these districts. The results from the econometric analysis 
show that energy has a significant and positive impact on crop output, but its impact is 
quite low when compared to other modern inputs. In summary, the massive energy 
subsidies passed to the farmers for easy access to groundwater irrigation is poorly 
utilized for subsistence level cultivation in the country. Policy interventions are required 
to curtail the energy consumption and diversify the cropping pattern to improve the 
energy productivity of the country.
