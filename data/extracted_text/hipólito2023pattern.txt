Abstract 
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of psychedelic therapy for mental health care. However, the psychological experience 
underlying its therapeutic effects remains poorly understood. This paper proposes a framework that suggests psychedelics act as 
destabilizers, both psychologically and neurophysiologically. Drawing on the ‘entropic brain’ hypothesis and the ‘RElaxed Beliefs Under 
pSychedelics’ model, this paper focuses on the richness of psychological experience. Through a complex systems theory perspective, 
we suggest that psychedelics destabilize fixed points or attractors, breaking reinforced patterns of thinking and behaving. Our approach 
explains how psychedelic-induced increases in brain entropy destabilize neurophysiological set points and lead to new conceptual-
izations of psychedelic psychotherapy. These insights have important implications for risk mitigation and treatment optimization in 
psychedelic medicine, both during the peak psychedelic experience and during the subacute period of potential recovery.

Introduction
The increasing societal acceptance and stigmatization
of psychedelic (for a classification and characterization of 
psychedelics, see Kelmendi et al. 2022) substances have opened 
up novel avenues of scientific inquiry into their potential thera-
peutic applications for psychopathology (Dos Santos et  al. 2020, 
Marks and Cohen 2021). Emerging experimental data suggest 
that psychedelics could potentially serve as a transformative 
new treatment paradigm for psychiatric, social, and palliative 
care (Byock 2018a, Gründer 2021, Gründer and Jungaberle 2021 , 
Hutchison and Bressi 2021, Enos 2022), albeit with attendant risks 
and critique (Johnstad 2021, Hall 2022). A salient advantage of 
psychedelics is their relatively low potential for addiction and 
physical side effects, rendering them potentially superior to sev-
eral current pharmacological treatments for mental health care 
(Read and Williams 2018, Davies et al. 2019 , Jauhar et al. 2019 , 
Guy et al. 2020, Lewis 2021).
Recent scientific findings suggest that psychedelic therapy has 
the potential to generate significant and sustained antidepressant 
and anxiolytic effects, including for individuals with treatment-
resistant depression (Carhart-Harris et al. 2018b, Stroud et al. 
2018, Muttoni et al. 
 2019, Fauvel et al., 2023, Hesselgrave et al. 
2021). Additionally, positive outcomes have been observed in cases 
of high 
suicidality (Byock, 2018a) and psychological distress asso-
ciated with a terminal illness (Schimmel et al. 2022). Psychedelic 
therapy could also prove beneficial in cases of post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) ( Doblin 2002, Davis et al. 2020, Figueiredo 
et al. 2021, Rubin-Kahana et al. 2021, Henner et al. 2022), eat-
ing disorders (Renelli et al. 2020 , Spriggs et al. 2021 , Teixeira 
et al. 2021), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Ehrmann 
et al. 2021), and other common mental health conditions
2 Hip ́olito et al.
(Krebs and Johansen 2013, Nutt and Carhart-Harris 2021, Simons-
son et al. 2021).
A plethora of empirical evidence indicates that the qual-
ity of the acute psychedelic experience is a strong predictor of 
long-term mental health improvements (Letheby 2021 , chaps. 2 
and 3, Roseman et al. 2019 ). This suggests that the subjective 
effects of psychedelics may be crucial for the maintenance of 
therapeutic outcomes (Yaden and Griffiths 2020, Lutkajtis 2021). 
Notably, psychedelics often elicit experiences that are perceived 
as insightful and imbued with profound meaning by participants 
(Johnson et al. 2019, Hearn 2021, Pedersen et al. 2021). Therefore, 
therapeutic progress with psychedelics is epistemic or learning 
based, which could account for its sustained efficacy and failures 
when the experience falls short. This epistemic dimension of 
psychedelic therapy underscores the importance of integrating it 
with a psychologically sophisticated approach, including adept 
and sufficient psychotherapeutic support (Nayak and Johnson 
2021
).
A comprehensive biological understanding of psychedelics is 
imperative, in conjunction with the application of expert psy-
chological knowledge. The former could help circumvent risks 
associated with their misuse, as well as dispel fallacious philo-
sophical suppositions, such as the notion that they do not exert 
a fundamental influence on brain function ( Timmermann et al. 
2021). Additionally, resolving uncertainties surrounding the bio-
logical mechanisms of psychedelic action could substantiate their 
medicinal properties and worth, such as by validating the clini-
cal benefits observed in recent trials as more than just a placebo 
response (Luoma et al. 2020).
The current study draws from a complex systems theory (CST), 
which offers a framework that can be applied to both psycho-
logical and neurological phenomena by identifying fundamental 
shared mechanisms at the appropriate dynamical systems level. 
In this context, we propose that psychedelics act as destabilizers 
at both the experiential and neurophysiological levels, by influenc-
ing set points or ‘attractors’—system-level substates that become 
stereotyped in psychopathology due to repetition and reinforce-
ment. Our findings suggest that destabilizing these ‘re-functional’ 
set points is a critical factor in the potential therapeutic benefits 
of psychedelic therapy, as well as the associated risks if misused 
or applied incorrectly.
Shaking up the brain: how psychedelics act 
as neurological destabilizers
The treatment effect of psychedelics has often been described 
in reference to the destabilization or disruption of globally dis-
tributed brain dynamics. Empirically, this idea is inspired by find-
ings showing that the psychedelic experience coincides with an 
increase of entropy in properties of spontaneous brain activity 
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2014, Carhart-Harris 2018), an effect that is 
likely to be most pronounced in the cortex (Bergström 1969, Kuang 
et al. 2021). Entropy, in its purest informational sense, is a dimen-
sionless metric that captures the unpredictability or randomness 
of a dynamical phenomenon such as a time series.
Applied to the brain, an increase in entropy may indicate that 
neuronal circuits are exploring a wider array of patterns of activity, 
with potential departures from the ‘normal’ repertoire of states. 
The principle that brain entropy increases under psychedelics has 
been supported by a large number of empirical findings ( Alonso 
et al. 2015, Lebedev et al. 2016, Liechti 2017, Schartner et al. 2017, 
Viol et al. 2017, Lyons and Carhart-Harris 2018, Timmermann et al. 
2019
, Herzog et al. 2020, Varley et al. 2020, Jobst et al. 2021, Luppi 
et al. 2021, Savino and Nichols 2021, Toker et al. 2022), and more-
over, the principle that brain entropy tracks a principal dimension 
of conscious experience is increasingly well supported—now well 
beyond just research with psychedelics (John 2002, Carhart-Harris 
2018, Keshmiri 2020). When we look at the brain as a hierar-
chical prediction engine—e.g. as one does under the so-called 
free-energy principle (FEP) ( Friston 2010, 2013, 2019, Karl 2012, 
Parr et al. 2022), an increase in the entropy of spontaneous brain 
activity can be related to a decrease in the precision weighting—
or the stability or reliability—of prior assumptions. Indeed, this is 
what is proposed in the so-called RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics
(REBUS) model (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019 ) a unifying the-
ory of the brain and psychological action of psychedelic com-
pounds that bears relevance to their therapeutic potential. (The 
strengthened beliefs under psychedelics (SEBUS) model proposes 
that psychedelics enhance navigation abilities across belief land-
scapes, and this idea is not incompatible with the notion of a 
flattened landscape. A flattened landscape does not preclude the 
ability to navigate across belief landscapes; rather, it indicates that 
the system is not trapped in a fixed mode of interactions with 
interconnected systems. By engaging in a range of activities within 
a state space, the system can reduce free energy. Therefore, the 
formulation presented in this paper is consistent with the SEBUS 
model. Specifically, our argument suggests that the system is pro-
pelled out of a stuck state, thereby leading to greater navigation 
abilities across/through belief landscapes.)
According to the FEP and the ‘active inference’ component 
that it subsumes, the brain and behaviour (self) organize or are 
volitionally organized to minimize surprising encounters in the 
world by maximizing the reach, reliability, and efficiency of its 
internal models and behavioural schemas, in a fashion that is 
consistent with Hamilton’s principle of ‘least action’ (Hanc and 
Taylor 2004). Building on this, the REBUS model proposes that 
the entropy-enhancing action of psychedelics works against this 
imperative—i.e. psychedelics flatten the dynamical global land-
scape of brain states (Cruzat et al. 2022 , Vohryzek et al. 2022 ), 
allowing for an easier escape from local optima, including ones 
that may have become excessively reinforced in pathology, but 
also creating a basal sense of felt uncertainty as the content of 
consciousness becomes unpredictable and ‘enriched’ relative to 
normal waking consciousness (Pollan 2018). (Flattening the land-
scape refers to a process that involves temporarily increasing the 
free energy within a system. When a system is trapped in a local 
minimum with high uncertainty, it becomes unable to evolve fur-
ther from that point, as it has reached the maximum level of 
free-energy minimization. To transition the system away from this 
stuck state, it is necessary to perturb the system with just the right 
amount of uncertainty, i.e. the flattening of the landscape leads 
to a temporary increase in uncertainty and free energy. This per-
turbation allows the system to ‘bounce back’ and move towards 
another attractor or even undergo a critical transition, which can 
signify significant life changes.) This principle has been supported 
by recent experimental work on the acute action of psychedelics—
finding a flattening of the brain’s energy landscape (Singleton et al. 
2021), as well as the collapse of the brain’s principal hierarchi-
cal gradient (Girn et al. 2022 ), and the disruption of processes of 
Bayesian inference ( Rajpal et al. 2022). Electroencephalography 
work has also substantiated the close relationship between brain 
entropy and the felt ‘richness’ of conscious experience (T ́ofoli and 
de Araujo 2016, Scott and Carhart-Harris 2019, Timmermann et al. 
2019).
In the domain of perception, the downregulation of precision 
weighting on priors—as postulated by the REBUS model—will have 
Pattern breaking  3
various predictable effects, such as causing the instability of oth-
erwise stable top-down perceptions (Carhart-Harris and Friston 
2019). One might also hypothesize that the so-called learning 
traps and associated cognitive misadjustments may be impacted by 
psychedelics in a potentially useful way (Gopnik 2020), potentially 
yielding performance benefits—similar to those that have been 
observed in children’s healthy learning flexibility ( Arán Filippetti 
and Krumm 2020). Evidence of increased learning rate under lyser-
gic acid diethylamide (Kanen et al. 2021 ) and subacute cognitive 
flexibility after psychedelics (Wießner et al. 2022) may be relevant 
in this regard. However, we wish to caution that performance may 
be vulnerable to generalized deficit confounds under psychedelics, 
meaning that any hypothesized performance enhancement is 
likely to be dose dependent (i.e. establishing the right dosage 
for a specific case), ‘topping out’ into nonspecific deficits above 
a certain dose range—e.g. see Bayne and Carter (2018)  for evi-
dence of decreased cognitive flexibility under the acute effects of a
psychedelic.
Overall, the REBUS model integrates the entropic brain hypoth-
esis and the FEP framework ( Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019). 
Central to this integration is that the entropic brain and the 
FEP inter-relate in that they share the notion of entropy as a 
dimensionless measure of uncertainty that can be applied to the 
brain, mind and behaviour as complex dynamical phenomena. 
The REBUS model has been supported by a number of empiri-
cal findings. Firstly, there is now substantial evidence to support 
the entropy brain principle, in terms of increased brain entropy 
in relation to the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014 ), 
and other flexible mental states such as rapid eye movement sleep 
(Lee et al. 2013) and dreaming (Nardelli et al. 2019), jazz improvi-
sation (Simon 2005), and deep meditation ( Li et al. 2011, Kumar 
et al. 2021)—and reduced brain entropy under states of reduced 
consciousness such as deep sleep (Kung et al. 2022), the anaes-
thetized state ( Fuentes et al. 2022) and disorders of conscious-
ness (Visani et al. 2022). More specific support for REBUS can be 
found in perceptual changes under psychedelics (Kaiser and Gold 
1973
), altered beliefs under ( Safron 2020) and after psychedelics 
(Timmermann et al. 2021, McGovern et al. 2022), and other trait 
changes (Aday et al. 2021), as well as decreased top-down pro-
cessing seen through such metrics as travelling waves (Alamia et 
al. 2020), dynamic causal modelling (Muthukumaraswamy et al. 
2013), and transfer entropy (Vicente et al. 2011 , Barnett et al. 
2020, Wang et al. 2022) reduced hierarchical organization under 
psychedelics (Girn et al. 2022 ) and the flattening of the brain’s 
energy landscape under (Singleton et al. 2021 ) and after (Daws 
et al. 2022) psychedelics.
It is important to note a more recent account, the Lyser-
gic Acid Diethylamide (ALBUS) model, which partially sup-
ports the REBUS model by proposing that psychedelics can 
enhance navigation abilities across belief landscapes. This con-
cept is not necessarily contradictory to the notion of a flat-
tened landscape (Safron 2020 ). However, ALBUS also suggests 
that psychedelics can both directly and indirectly reinforce or 
relax beliefs depending on the individual and the context. By 
using the complex systems approach in this paper, we can build 
upon the REBUS model by considering the ease of tipping in 
relation to the topology of the landscape. Additionally, we can 
expand on the ALBUS model by examining both the geometry 
of the landscape and the strength of tips as sources of control
energy.
As mentioned earlier, we have briefly summarized how an 
increase in the entropy of spontaneous cortical activity during 
the psychedelic state can be understood from an empirical and 
computational framework. In this paper, we will leverage these 
dynamical aspects to model the effect that psychedelics have on 
the psychological domain using dynamical/CST.
How psychedelics and psychosocial context 
shape mental health
There is growing evidence that psychedelics can have a pos-
itive impact on mental health, particularly when applied as 
psychedelic-assisted therapy ( Reiff et  al. 2020 ). There is also 
robust and reliable evidence that the subjective effects of 
psychedelics can be predictive of their enduring therapeutic 
effects ( Yaden and Griffiths 2020 , Lutkajtis 2021 ). Future work 
is required to test whether these subjective effects are paral-
leled by tightly coupled and equally predictive brain activity
markers.
We also hypothesize that the entropy or complexity of spon-
taneous cortical activity, as such can be indexed by metrics such 
as the Lempel–Ziv complexity or other compressibility algorithms 
(Carhart-Harris 2018a), will emerge as valuable explanatory and 
predictive markers of action. We believe that such discoveries 
will lend support to a unified model of the potential therapeutic 
action of psychedelics that places emphasis on an acute entropic 
brain action and related relaxation of assumptions (i.e. the REBUS 
model)—yielding an opportunity for the revision of pathologically 
reinforced patterns of cognition and/or behaviour underpinning 
symptoms of psychiatric illness.
In the present work, in keeping with a biopsychosocial 
approach to medicine, we wish to give an appropriate level of 
attention to psychosocial factors relevant to the psychedelic expe-
rience. In this regard, we adopt a relational, context-sensitive, and 
dependent approach, whereby we see individual experiences as 
coloured by personal historical and sociocultural factors (Carhart-
Harris 2018b). This perspective is consistent with the philosophical 
psychology of Ludwig Wittgenstein and recent accounts of enac-
tivism and ecological psychology (Wittgenstein 1953, Gibson 1978, 
Maturana and Varela 1987, Anscombe et  al. 1991 , Varela 1997, 
Hutto 2013 , Hutto and Myin 2017 ) that aim to situate the cul-
tural and personal significance of experiences, emotions, and 
behaviours. According to this view, psychological objects or events 
have no absolute truth conditions but rather exist in a web of 
relations or mutual interdependencies.
The goal and approach of many psychotherapies are not 
to make difficult memories or emotions ‘disappear’ but rather 
to place them in a perspective whereby they can be better 
contextualized and understood, e.g. with greater equanimity. 
The so-called third-wave psychotherapies such as acceptance 
and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based cog-
nitive therapy place particular emphasis on allowing for the 
expression and mindful awareness of negative feeling states, 
as a method for processing and, ideally, dissipating their
influence.
It could be said that the aim of these and other psychothera-
peutic approaches is to replace ‘unhealthy’ patterns of thinking 
and behaving with ‘healthier’ ones, where what determines the 
‘health’ of a cognitive style or behaviour rests on its embeddedness 
within a complex network of largely consensual norms and values, 
e.g. that view drug addiction, suicidal intent, chronic under-eating, 
or compulsive hand-washing as dysfunctional in relation to these 
norms and values.
Conversational psychotherapy can seek to better align a 
patient’s cognition and behaviour with societal norms and val-
ues, but this process is slow and difficult and may be even more 
4 Hip ́olito et al.
effectively achieved if the patient discovers their own desire for 
better alignment or ‘connectedness’ (Carhart-Harris et  al. 2018a) 
through a transformative experience and an epistemic process of 
self-realization—as such can occur via psychedelic therapy (Reiff 
et al. 2020).
In the following section, we propose a conceptual framework 
to understand psychopathology by examining its connection to 
dynamical systems theory (DST) at a specific level of analysis. This 
approach aims to establish meaningful connections between the 
subjective experience of psychopathology (phenomenology) and 
the underlying dynamics of the brain. By adopting this approach, 
we seek to identify heuristic and conceptually satisfying equiva-
lences between these two domains.
Complexity science: essential terminology
Let us now introduce some fundamental ideas from complexity 
science, which will be instrumental in the development of our 
approach in the following sections. A complex system is a sys-
tem whose behaviour results from a highly nontrivial aggregation 
of interactions, both between the parts of the system and also 
between the system and its environment (Mitchell 2009 , Fieguth 
2017
, Thurner et al. 2018). Systems are complex to the extent that 
these relationships involve multiscales, complex external influ-
ences, nonlinearity, feedback loops, and multiplicity, which, in 
turn, may give rise to self-organization and emergent phenom-
ena (Turkheimer et al. 2021). CST is an interdisciplinary research 
programme that aims to understand the underlying common fea-
tures of complex systems that arise in different levels of nature—
from physics, chemistry, and biology to sociology, economics, 
and art—by studying them with a range of tools including sta-
tistical physics, information theory, nonlinear dynamics, systems 
theory, self-organization, nonlinear systems, and network the-
ory (Fig. 1). (CST is an interdisciplinary research programme that 
aims to understand the unifying features of complex systems that 
arise in different fields of science, including meteorology, soci-
ology, economics, philosophy, psychology, and biology ( Waldrop 
1993
). For this purpose, CST leverages methods of different disci-
plines including statistical physics, information theory, nonlinear 
dynamics, anthropology, and computer science.)
For reasons not yet entirely understood, complex physical sys-
tems and biological processes can self-organize without external 
direction or control, e.g. via an outside or centralized system 
(Karsenti 2008, Rosas et al. 2018, Kimura 2022).
This is a particular feature of complex living systems, and 
when it occurs, such systems attain states of ‘spontaneous’ order 
which seem to defy the second law of thermodynamics—i.e. 
the natural tendency for structures to degrade, dissipate, or die 
(Cilliers 2002, Gentili 2018). Self-organization typically occurs 
within complex nonequilibrium systems, i.e. systems that are 
not thermodynamically relaxed, but rather are subject to reg-
ular, complex interactions between and within their parts, and 
between the system and complex external influences, i.e. their 
‘environments’ (Marzo Serugendo et al. 2003 , Wolf and Holvoet 
2004
).
Theories of self-organization try to explain how different 
systems naturally tend towards distinctive types of intrinsic 
dynamical organization. One leading theoretical approach to self-
organization is the notion of ‘self-organized criticality’, which 
studies how dynamical systems spontaneously tend towards dis-
tinct recurring patterns or states, i.e. attractors ( Jensen 1998, 
Pruessner 2012, Bak 2013). As the name implies, self-organized 
criticality is often found close to a phase transition (or ‘critical 
point’ or zone) beyond which the system degrades into disor-
der or randomness (Bak et al. 1987), i.e.  high entropy. Thus, 
critical systems can be viewed as exhibiting a functionally use-
ful balance between self-maintenance and adaptability. In a 
poetic sense, they ‘surf’ uncertainty (Clark 2015 ) or entropy
(Carhart-Harris 2018b).
Complex systems can also be studied as dynamic processes, to 
the extent that a dynamical systems theory (DST) toolbox is used 
to make sense of transitions in their trajectories and patterns of 
behaviour. A system’s evolution can be mapped as a trajectory in 
time, which illustrates a system’s behaviour. The trajectory shows 
this behaviour as tending to fixed stable or semistable points, 
known as attractors, and avoiding fixed unstable points, known 
as repellers. The future state of a complex system is generated by 
its current state in the interaction with its external environment, 
which can be cast under a dynamic rule. A more complex system 
such as an adaptive system entails a more complex geometry of 
fixed points (Carmichael and Had ̌zikadi ́c 2019).
Studying an adaptive system’s behaviour can help us to gain 
insight into its function, such as how the system adapts in rela-
tion to changing environmental circumstances. Studying this can 
also inform us about the system’s features or properties, such as 
its nonlinearities and interdependencies. The emergent complex-
ity of a complex system arises precisely from the consequences 
of nonlinearities in the dynamics of the interacting subsystems, 
which are reflected in patterns of interactions among them at var-
ious timescales. One approach to conceptualize the complexity of 
a system is by how difficult it is to model a resulting behaviour 
(Crutchfield et al. 2009, Mitchell 2009). Modelling approaches that 
fail to acknowledge complexity—e.g. by reducing complexity to 
linear processes—will necessarily generate models that are not 
explanatory nor epistemically useful (Zeng et al. 2017). This is par-
ticularly important when planning interventions, e.g. a too simple 
model could cause us to intervene in a way that obtains an oppo-
site effect from the one originally intended (Curtis 2016). This is 
crucially important for mental health interventions, as we develop 
in the following sections.
Sudden transitions can have a huge, potentially irreversible 
impact on a complex system—such as global changes in climate, 
shifts in ecosystems, crashing in financial markets, and sudden 
iatrogenic transitions in one’s psychological status, e.g., into a 
psychotic or depressive episode. Some sudden transitions can be 
described as ‘tippings’. These can occur when tiny changes to 
one or more of the system’s parameters lead to deep qualitative 
changes in the state of the global system. In nonresilient complex 
systems, tipping in one subsystem can result in tipping cascades 
and turbulence in the whole system (Carreras et al. 2002, Krönke 
et al. 2020, Klose et al. 2021, Sharpe and Lenton 2021 ). Interest-
ingly, tipping and cascading may not necessarily have detrimental 
effects, e.g. if these phenomena can be planned for and harnessed 
for functional purposes, such as large-scale information trans-
fer or functionally useful global system transformations (Brouwer 
and Carhart-Harris 2021).
The prediction of tipping can be useful for preventing, prepar-
ing for, or controlling their occurrence or consequences (Peng et al. 
2019). Tipping can be induced in complex systems by intentional 
perturbations such as ‘temperature’ increases, causing bifurca-
tions, fluctuations or noise near critical states, and rate-dependent 
variations of drift in control parameters of the dynamics (Ambika 
and Kurths 2021). Some of the points identified as critical for typ-
ing cascades include basins of attraction and fractality-induced 
Pattern breaking  5
tipping, as well as topological complexity of connections and 
interactions (Kaszás et al. 2019, Suchithra et al. 2020).
Materials and method
Here, we apply a complexity theory approach to our understand-
ing of psychopathology. As already stated, CST lends itself well 
to bridging phenomenology and psychopathology as it arguably 
approaches both at a functionally meaningful mechanistic level, 
where natural mappings between brain and experience can be 
made. We seek to bring CST to psychopathology by focusing 
on three main components: the emergence from wholeness, a spe-
cific pattern or order, and the notion of stuck states . To address 
the challenges of recovering from the latter, psychotherapeutic 
intervention can be thought of as aiding recovery via intentionally 
causing an initial and arguably vital destabilization. Indeed, 
empirical evidence for the value of destabilization in the thera-
peutic process already exists (Hayes et al. 2015, Olthof et al. 2020), 
and the theme of ‘sudden gains’ in psychotherapy is also relevant 
here (Shalom and Aderka 2020); notably, quantum change empha-
sizes the persisting consequences caused by the experience (Miller 
2004
, Cole-Turner 2022).
When studied from a complexity theory perspective, psy-
chopathology can be seen as a specific type of dynamic pattern 
emerging from self-organizing interactions involving various bio-
logical, social, and psychological components of an adaptive 
system and its environment. According to our perspective, psy-
chopathology cannot be properly understood by decoupling the 
individual from his/her environment. In this regard, it is crucial 
to take into account ALBUSs (Safron 2020) both strengthened and 
relaxed beliefs, which can enhance an individual’s connections 
to meanings and others in the world. By examining the relation-
ship between an individual’s beliefs and their environment, we 
can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that 
contribute to the development of psychopathology. Moreover, psy-
chopathology is seen as an emergent phenomenon, in the sense 
that it depends on the coupling between the individual and his/her 
environment, and hence it cannot be reduced to the sum of the 
parts in isolation (Mediano et al. 2022).
Thus, we see psychopathology as a dynamic process, a self-
organized pattern that arises from a specific type of interdepen-
dence between biopsychosocial components. This implies that 
psychopathology cannot be properly understood by isolating sepa-
rate contributions of parts of the system but has to be understood 
and treated as a whole (Kelty-Stephen and Wallot 2017, van Geert 
and de Ruiter 2022). Understanding patients and psychopathology 
as complex ‘wholes’ means advancing an explanation that unifies 
the various scales that constitute the whole, which includes the 
psychological experience situated in a sociocultural setting.
Seeing psychopathology from the lens of complexity science 
also lends support to the controversial position that symptoms 
of mental illness should not necessarily be seen as reflective of a 
discrete disorder per se, rather they may be seen as reflective of a 
different kind of order (Olthof et al. 2020), i.e. an effective ‘next best’ 
order when, for quite logical and rational reasons, circumstances 
do not allow for a ‘healthy’ order, as it is generally understood. 
Here, we use ‘reorder’ and ‘reordering’ to refer to the abnormal but 
not necessarily ‘dysfunctional’ order that underlies symptoms of 
mental illness.
Thus, from this arguably more human and empathic perspec-
tive, psychopathology corresponds to a particular type of reorder-
ing that arises when specific patterns form within a complex 
dynamical process. Hence, while still being regarded as a men-
tal health condition or disease, psychopathology is not seen as 
a disorder disrupting an otherwise healthy pattern—such as an 
imbalance in individual parts, i.e. neurotransmitters, hormones,

behaviour of multisystem interactions

or personality traits (DeYoung and Krueger 2018), but as a dynam-
ical pattern itself. In other words, psychopathology is seen as a 
kind of order that is distinct from the dynamical patterns that we 
typically associate with the absence of a certain mental condition 
typically associated with health ( Bosman 2017 ). [Notably, psy-
chopathology can also be understood in terms of the absence of 
certain forms of order. This perspective provides a possible expla-
nation for why the general factor of psychopathology, also known 
as the ‘P-factor’, appears to be inversely related to the meta-
trait of Stability, which is a shared variance of conscientiousness, 
agreeableness, and inverse neuroticism. In terms of personality, 
the approach outlined in this article emphasizes the significance 
of increasing the meta-trait of ‘Plasticity’, which represents the 
shared variance of Openness and Extraversion and exists in a state 
of dynamic tension with Stability (Safron and DeYoung 2021)].
This dynamical view of psychopathology can be further devel-
oped following an enactive approach ( Varela et al. 1992 ) opera-
tionalized via tools from DST. In this framework, individuals are 
seen as evolving coupled with their sociocultural environment, 
namely enacting their environment, which can be interpreted as 
a dynamical process whereby a system traverses a given ‘phase 
space’—i.e. the set of possible states or configurations available 
to the individual. In enacting their environments, the specific 
properties of how the individual is presently coupled with their 
environment result in the dynamical trajectory being more or less 
attracted to certain behaviours, represented by the system persist-
ing on different regions of the phase space. DST then tells us that 
such attractor sets can be of different types: single stable points, 
periodic cycles, or the so-called strange attractors of complicated 
geometries (Ruelle and Isola 1989). Moreover, a given system can 
have multiple attractors and dynamically switch between them, 
which gives rise to metastable behaviour—which has been shown 
to be important for biological and social systems (Kelso 2012, 2021, 
Tadi ́c and Melnik 2021).
The ways in which an individual navigates the geometry of 
its attractors determines its behaviour, which in turn feeds back 
into its environment and determines the future dynamical geom-
etry that it will observe. This process can introduce bifurcations 
(i.e. the rupture of one attractor into two separate attractors) or 
more general dynamical phase transitions in which qualitative 
changes alter the attractor landscape, which characterize impor-
tant processes of change in living systems (Sardanyés and Solé 
2006).
Emotional states themselves can be seen as attractors—e.g. 
sadness can be operationalized as a fixed-point attractor that, 
depending on how the individual is coupled with their environ-
ment, might exert more or less influence over an individual’s 
trajectories. Importantly, biological beings are a consequence of 
their actions, which implies that—all coupling conditions remain-
ing equal—the more the system visits that attractor point, the 
more the system will be likely to visit it again, like running 
water carving out channels or canals ( Waddington 1959). This 
process is consistent with experience or activity-dependent plas-
ticity, Hebbian plasticity, and reinforcement learning. Individuals 
can also develop cycle attractors, e.g. becoming stuck in periodic 
shifts between being melancholic and euphoric—such as occurs 
in bipolar disorder (for illustration of these states as attractors, 
see Fig. 2).
Figure 2 A depiction of how a system’s state (represented with a dot at time 4.8) evolves with a tendency towards certain ‘attracting’ points (basins of 
attarction or valleys) and avoiding repelleter (at time 1.8)
Importantly, the same attractors can exert a stronger or weaker influence over a system, represented here by the depth of the valley—the deeper it is, the harder it 
is to go away from it and the easier it is to fall into it and become stuck. Psychedelics may flatten the attractor landscape (e.g. move from deep valleys in black to 
shallow valleys in blue), increasing the probability of the system’s state moving between attractors and hence promoting more flexible, adaptive, and metastable 
dynamics
Pattern breaking  7
Importantly, such experience-dependent reinforcement is the 
process by which attractors deepen, a process commensurate with 
increasing the precision weighting on priors if cast in a manner 
that is consistent with the FEP and its use of predictive cod-
ing and the Bayesian brain (Friston 2018). Here, the steepness of 
the sides of attractors or canals is directly proportional to the 
magnitude of the precision weighting of the relevant prior, sub-
state, pattern, or attractor. Moreover, we argue that the process of 
carving out deep and abnormal attractors or priors can describe 
features of development and perpetuation of symptoms of men-
tal illness, i.e. the brain and behaviour continue to adhere to the 
FEP (i.e. the minimization of uncertainty), but they do so via dif-
ferent, ‘abnormal’ strategies. While excessive canalization can be 
detrimental, a lack of stability can also be problematic for condi-
tions such as schizophrenia. In addition to overly strong negative 
beliefs, insufficiently strong positive beliefs can also contribute 
to depression and anxiety. However, solely focusing on flexibility 
may overlook the importance of cultivating positive psychological 
factors and the potential risks of excessive destabilization from 
the unskilful use of psychedelics and certain forms of meditation. 
Self-organized criticality is characterized by a delicate balance 
of order and disorder, which is essential for the possibility of 
(generalized) evolution (Safron et al. 2022).
We acknowledge, however, that the term ‘abnormal’ could be 
questioned here given that certain ‘defensive’ strategies, e.g. inter-
nalizing in depression or escaping and relieving in addiction, are 
not uncommon.
Lastly, it is important to note that excessive chaos and high 
uncertainty, resulting in a flattened landscape, can have nega-
tive implications on the adaptation and mental well-being of a 
system. Mental health should not be associated with an overall 
general rule of fattening the landscape, which should be viewed 
simply as a therapeutic strategy. Rather, the key to avoiding psy-
chopathology is achieving multistability. More precisely, systems 
must engage with the environment to avoid becoming isolated, 
as this creates a network of multistability that enables them to 
rebound from environmental stressors. Multistability refers to the 
ability of an individual’s psychological system to attain multiple 
stable states or attractors in response to changing environmental 
conditions. These attractors can correspond to various patterns 
of thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and beliefs. The ability to 
transition between these states is considered indicative of psy-
chological flexibility and resilience. Thus, mental health is defined 
by the capacity to achieve and sustain a variety of stable states 
or attractors (multistability). This capability permits individuals 
to adjust to fluctuating circumstances, cope with stressors, and 
interact with the world in an adaptable and effective manner. Con-
versely, mental illness or psychopathology is the result of being 
confined to a rigid, single state (stuck state), unable to transition 
between states, leading to maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and 
behaviours.
Biological systems are always subject to external perturbation 
that cannot be predicted or controlled. It introduces small fluc-
tuations in the system’s dynamics, nevertheless, attractor states 
represent favoured states that the system tends to stabilize into. 
In principle, this property of attractors imbues biological sys-
tems with favourable properties such as robustness or resilience, 
but it can become problematic when the attractor becomes too 
reinforced or rigid—e.g. aligning with cognitions or behaviours 
that clash with societal norms and values—such as it the case 
with most symptoms of psychiatric illness (Wichers et  al. 2019). 
The paradox of stable attractor states is that they can provide 
an attractively low level of uncertainty, e.g. by finding solace in 
the effects of a drug of addiction or the apparent ‘safety’ of a 
‘dark room’ of depression. However, a too-stable attractor or ‘stuck 
state’ affords reduced degrees of freedom, i.e.  fewer possibili-
ties for other forms of thought or action. It, therefore, affords a 
‘narrower’ state of being. Here, we argue that this stereotypy—
closely linked to excessive precision weighting on priors in a 
free-energy framework, or excessive experience-dependent plas-
ticity in reinforcement learning—is the first component of mental 
illness. This is qualified to some extent by whether the relevant 
stereotypy is at odds with the norms and values of a given soci-
ety or culture and by how pronounced this is, i.e. how reinforced 
or heavily (precision) weighted it is. These qualifiers should help 
to determine whether an ‘expert’ who has developed his/her 
experience-dependent expertise through extensive practice does 
or does not exhibit psychopathology. For example, they may not if 
their expertise is valued by a given culture or society, or if it is only 
moderately weighted.
An example of a common ‘stuck state’—that is often (but 
not always) regarded as pathological—is rumination. Rumination 
involves repetitive or stereotyped patterns of thinking that fea-
ture a pull towards a thematic core that is difficult to escape 
from. Although rumination begins with a desire to resolve a psy-
chological issue—i.e. to examine, make sense, or learn from a 
social dilemma, major surprise, or trauma (Andrews and Thom-
son 2009)—it can easily turn into a psychopathological condition 
(as defined earlier). One can easily imagine a scenario where what 
might have started as an attempt to understand or resolve a past 
action/event (‘why didn’t I yell more loudly?’, ‘it was my fault 
for driving on the freeway in heavy rain’) leads to a stuck state 
(‘I’ll never get over this; I’ll never live a normal life again’). In 
depression, patients often continually ruminate about their fail-
ings, reiterate thoughts of guilt, and engage in self-critical inner 
narratives. In addiction, drug craving drives behaviour that is 
specific, narrow, and rigid; individuals with addiction ruminate 
on their preferred substance(s) of abuse: why they cannot get 
away from it, where they need to go, or what they need to do 
to get it and pay for it. In OCD and anorexia, there is excessive 
rumination about threats to the person, i.e.  the effects of eat-
ing or overeating. As with addiction, ancillary behaviours such as 
paying for drugs via prostitution or binge purging in eating disor-
ders can work to further reinforce the disorder through repeated 
and reinforced feelings such as shame. Similarly, although often 
inadvertently, interpersonal relations can shape around the ill-
ness, creating a psychosocial matrix of continued reinforcement, 
e.g. living among fellow drug addicts. All these factors and 
others will work to entrench canalized thought and behaviour
(Waddington 1959).
Building upon the ideas exposed earlier, psychopathology can 
be better understood not by the nature of the beliefs supporting 
given thoughts or behaviours but by the weight they are given—
in a free-energy sense, the problem lies more with the precision 
weighting of priors than whether they are inherently ‘false’ or not 
(Hesp and Hip ́olito 2022). (Excessive precision weighting can lead 
to the reinforcement of beliefs beyond a reasonable threshold, 
resulting in the generation of “false” or overly generalized con-
clusions.) Thus, in a CST sense, the problem lies not with what 
an attractor encodes but with the depth or steepness of its attrac-
tion, i.e. the relative difficulty (if not apparent ‘impossibility’) of 
moving away from the state. Said differently, the illness rests not 
with the content of specific states but with their inter-relations 
and dynamics. For example, it is reasonable and healthy that 
certain events should cause stress and/or anxiety, but healthy sys-
tems and individuals are able to bounce back from these stressors 
8 Hip ́olito et al.
rather than become pulled into a web of mutually reinforcing 
thoughts, actions, and relations (Masten et al. 2021). According to 
our scheme, psychopathology is the excessive difficulty of moving 
away from a state or states, i.e. being in a stuck state that clashes 
with the norms and values of a given society or culture and does 
not allow for the psychological freedom that is the sine qua non of 
health.
Stuck states are closely related to how agents deal with uncer-
tainty. Following the FEP ( Friston 2013 ), one can operationalize 
surprise (although the psychological notion of surprise is distinct 
from the information theoretical formalization of it, in practice 
these two notions generally have good correspondence; infor-
mation theory conceptualizes surprise simply as a measure of 
improbability) as the difference between an agent’s assumptions 
about the world and the world they actually encounter.
Agents adapt to their environments in the ways they adjust to 
surprising events—including whether they can ‘bounce back’ from 
such surprises. T ypically, as mandated by the FEP, one recalibrates 
from a surprising event by updating one’s assumptions or by alter-
ing one’s behaviour—or the world itself, such that surprises are 
less likely (Friston et al. 2012 ). However, agents do not simply 
find a dark corner and stay there—what is known as the ‘dark 
room’ problem, but minimize surprise within a longer, more far-
sighted time horizon ( Millidge et al. 2021), which usually leads 
them to act in specific ways. [‘A dark, empty room presents few 
surprises. The information reaching the eyes is constant, uni-
form, and unremarkable; effective soundproofing could do the 
same for the ears. Add some creative seating, and the whole expe-
rience will be as dull and predictable as any experience could 
be’ (Sun and Firestone 2020 ).] When confronted with a surpris-
ing event, an agent has at least two options: either (I) to tend 
towards a stuck state or (II) to reduce its surprise by adapting 
to the environment. An agent taking the former option, i.e.  tend-
ing towards a ‘stuck state’, can be seen as potentially entering a 
phase transition towards a psychopathological situation, a dark 
room, or an oxbow lake forming apart from the main, freely flowing
river.
Some environments lead to more surprising events than oth-
ers; for example, people in the army often experience events 
with high levels of surprise while having few forms of action for 
reducing it, thereby adapting to the environment. From a psy-
chopathology point of view, this means that it is likely that, faced 
with prolonged high levels of surprise, an agent will be ‘stuck’ in 
that state, even after being removed from that environment—a 
psychological condition that may be associated with PTSD.
Lastly, a third strategy for dealing with surprise is to tolerate 
a high amount of it. The so-called tolerance of uncertainty trait 
(Strout et al. 2018 ) is a useful construct in this regard, where a 
high tolerance of uncertainty may be conducive to resilience and 
thus good psychological health—as has been shown ( Rettie and 
Daniels 2021). Here, one might surmise that the agent employs an 
especially broad time horizon for the minimization of free energy, 
i.e. by accepting a higher-than-average level of uncertainty they 
may more easily explore and thus broaden their models of the 
world and self, which they then ‘hold lightly’—as they recognize 
they may not apply absolutely.
One might connect this broad, patient, and flexible style of 
free-energy minimization and ‘light belief’ with Buddhist philos-
ophy and practice as well as third-wave psychotherapies, such 
as ACT (Hayes 2019). Indeed, this explains the contention that 
Buddhist practice (Batchelor and Smith 2002) and third-wave 
cognitive behavioural therapies may be a particularly ‘good fit’ 
for psychedelic-assisted therapy ( Fauvel et al. 2023), as well as 
the view that a combination of psychedelic drug administration 
and evidence-based psychological therapy is most beneficial, if 
not essential for reliable positive outcomes ( Weston et al. 2020, 
p. 1261). Meditation practices are known for their effectiveness in 
cultivating compassion, acceptance, and self-awareness (Chilson 
2018, Giraldi 2019, Hammer 2019, Tifft et al. 2022 ). With profes-
sional guidance, meditation may be a useful supplement to the 
psychological integration process (Craven 1989, Travis et al. 2018, 
Villamil et al. 2019). Indeed, as we shall discuss later, integra-
tion is considered by many to be a critical component of safe and 
effective psychedelic therapy (Carhart-Harris et al. 2018, Watts 
and Luoma 2020, Gründer and Jungaberle 2021), safeguarding 
against the risks associated with psychological destabilization and 
exploiting its potential benefits.
Taking inspiration from psychedelic therapy, here we argue 
that in order to confront the possibility of entering a stuck state 
rather than bouncing back from adversity or the actuality of hav-
ing fallen into such a stuck state—and now needing to get out of 
it—a therapeutic intervention requires the induction of destabiliza-
tion. Destabilization is hence defined as the induction of a dynam-
ical phase transition involving either or both: (I) more energy or 
‘temperature’ in the system to drive more random fluctuations—
commensurate with higher entropy—or (II) the lowering of steep 
basins of attraction. We argue that the first process (i.e. a tem-
perature or entropy increase) is the most accessible and manip-
ulable, whereas the latter arguably requires more time, i.e. the 
longer the agent is away from an old attracting state or visiting 
others, the weaker the old attracting state will become—a pro-
cess commensurate with extinction learning. We further argue 
this latter component may depend on the quality of integrative 
support and behavioural change after the psychedelic experi-
ence, e.g. removing or revising situational reinforcers—including 
interpersonal relationships that explicitly or inadvertently work 
to support the maladaptive habits. The ideal consequence of 
psychological destabilization and good subsequent integration is 
that a broader, more flexible global state space is promoted and 
sustained.
The process of destabilization may cause the enhancement 
of features of criticality ( Chialvo 2010) as the global system 
moves out of a subcritical regime associated with ill health 
(Carhart-Harris 2018). Such features might include critical fluc-
tuations, cascading, long-range correlations, scale-free or fractal 
dynamics, and critical slowing down (e.g. Kelso 1997). It is telling 
that many of these signatures of criticality have been observed 
in the brain under psychedelics ( Luppi et al. 2020, Varley et al. 
2020, Jobst et al. 2021, Toker et al. 2022). Here, we argue that 
the phenomenon of destabilization applies at social, psychological, 
and biological scales—as is the characteristic of CST mechanics. 
The next section expands on the notion of destabilization and 
explains how psychedelics act as destabilizers to promote mental
health.
Results
The next generation of medical interventions will arguably tar-
get stability and change (Olthof et  al. 2020, Wichers et al. 2020). 
Broadly defined, destabilization has been a prominent concept in 
psychotherapy, often identified as a key mediator of psychological 
and clinical change (Mahoney 1991, Hayes et al. 2007, Bendit 2014, 
de Felice Msc 2014, Gelo and Salvatore 2016, Haynes et al. 2020). 
Notably, emphasizing active engagement with the world from an 
accepting and compassionate perspective can increase the impact 
of targeting stability and change.
Pattern breaking  9
Correspondingly, in CST, destabilization can be studied as a 
loss of pull from particular attractors, e.g. principally, by inject-
ing noise, energy, excitation, or temperature into the system. 
In a free-energy scheme, the lowering of basins of attraction 
is commensurate with reducing their precision weighting—and 
thus, in a Bayesian formulation, the precision weighting of pri-
ors ( Friston 2018 ). When this process occurs in a system that 
could be tuned closer to criticality (as opposed to over a tip-
ping point into white noise—or pure randomness), such changes 
can give rise to interesting dynamical phenomena such as criti-
cal fluctuations and critical slowing down (Das and Green 2019 ,
Olthof et al. 2020, Boers and Rypdal 2021)—which can be mea-
sured and quantified. Evidence shows that psychological desta-
bilization, measured as increased fluctuations in psychological 
states, is a predictor of clinical change in both coded observational 
data of therapy sessions and repeated self-ratings ( Hayes and 
Andrews 2020, Olthof et al. 2020). Such psychological destabiliza-
tion can be interpreted as early indicators for upcoming clinical 
transitions (Scheffer et al., 2009 , Helmich et al. 2021, Dablander 
et al. 2022).
Destabilization could also be measured neurobiologically, 
e.g. via measures of brain entropy, diversity, or complexity 
(Breakspear et al. 2010, Nilsen et al. 2020, Sarasso et al. 2021). 
When destabilized, a system can gain more diversity in its dynam-
ics or range of possible behaviours—i.e. it gains more degrees of 
freedom. This may have a number of interesting consequences 
if, e.g., destabilization tunes the system closer to criticality. For 
example, systems tuned closer to criticality often exhibit a longer 
recovery time after a given perturbation—a phenomenon known 
as ‘critical slowing’ ( Hesse and Gross 2014 ) [phenomena such as 
critical slowing or susceptibility to catastrophic events can indi-
cate the presence of hazardous forms of instability (Goekoop and 
de Kleijn 2021)]. One can draw parallels between critical slow-
ing in CST and sensitivity to perturbation. In psychedelic ther-
apy, greater sensitivity to perturbation could be related to the 
strongly hypothesized exaggerated influence of context on out-
comes (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), some concrete examples 
of which include sensitivity to the therapeutic alliance (Murphy et 
al. 2022), suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al. 2015), and the music 
played during the dosing session (Kaelen et al. 2018). If the contex-
tual conditions are adverse, however, one can imagine how small 
perturbations could cause spiralling ruminative ‘loops’ that are 
difficult to break out of.
Another way we can view critical slowing is in relation to 
the ability to ‘bounce back’ from adverse conditions, where 
increased critical slowing would parallel a reduced ability to 
bounce back, or rather a greater sensitivity to perturbation. On 
a trait level, one might hypothesize that highly sensitive or sus-
ceptible individuals—or the so-called orchids—should be more 
susceptible to mental illness, a relationship for which there is 
much evidence ( Homberg and Jagiellowicz 2022 ). This relation-
ship may also bear relevance to the sometimes described ‘thin-
skinned’ or ‘open-hearted’ quality of individuals in the aftermath 
of a psychedelic experience, where interpersonal support and 
a grounded psychosocial matrix (Eisner 1997 ) may be vital for 
a positive therapeutic trajectory [see Hayes and Andrews (2020) 
for relevant material]. Conversely, if the psychosocial matrix is 
adverse for such thin-skinned individuals, analogous to ‘return-
ing to earth with a bump’—there could be a heightened risk of 
iatrogenesis. These insights could inform therapeutic approaches 
in psychedelic therapy, where, e.g., once the psychopathologi-
cal attractor is destabilized, subsequent treatments targeted at 
supporting an alternative, healthier state space are promoted—
a process also known as integration (Hayes et al. 2015, Schiepek et 
al. 2016).
This process may work best if participants are not too heavily 
primed with new belief systems and behavioural schemas. One 
can easily imagine how priming could go awry or raise ethical 
objections if not professionally managed. For example, objections 
could be raised regarding the manipulation of impressionable 
individuals via the pro-plasticity effects of psychedelics. This mat-
ter touches on old controversies in psychotherapy that could 
easily re-emerge in the context of psychedelic therapy if not pre-
empted and safeguarded against. For example, the problem of 
‘false memories’, the implanting or priming of false or question-
able inferences and relational or sexual ‘boundary crossing’ are 
relevant here (Flom et al. 2003 , Healy 2021)—and have already 
been reported in the context of psychedelic therapy. One way to 
tackle these risks is to address them in therapist training and to 
monitor preparation, dosing, and integration sessions to ensure 
good practice. Briefly, the ideal is to promote an open enquiring 
mindset, not one that is indoctrinated or manipulated in a specific 
way (Pilecki et al. 2021). Indeed, the latter could be seen as serving 
experience-dependent plasticity rather than the more general-
ized, nonspecific plasticity that is, arguably, the fundamental 
action of psychedelics.
This generalized plasticity is intimately related to the desta-
bilization that we emphasize in this paper. This action can pro-
mote the breaking up of persistent, overly reinforced patterns of 
thinking and behaving, an action commensurate with ‘extinction 
learning’ (Glavonic et al. 2022). A light, undirected but empathetic 
approach from therapists is arguably the best way to avoid new 
reinforcements or even, in the worst of cases, retraumatization 
via the unprofessional repetition of boundary incursions. As seen 
in the section ‘How psychedelics and psychosocial context shape 
mental health’, the goal of psychotherapy is to weaken unhealthy 
patterns of thinking by bringing memories, feelings, thoughts, 
actions, and relationships into perspective, i.e. by nesting them in 
an extended context of mutual dependencies and relations that 
can then be slowly processed and understood. More traditional 
psychotherapeutic techniques and methods, as well as a spiritual 
practice, can help to achieve these aims, but the processes that 
lead up to such epistemic development can be greatly catalysed 
by the basic destabilizing action of psychedelics. The challenge 
for psychedelic therapy is to do this in a way that is sustainable 
and does not, e.g., involve the bypassing of a full maturational 
development (Kornfield 2001).
The basic entropic action of psychedelics is linked to a rich 
psychological experience that enables novel or diverse cognitive 
and affective perspectives. Richness and novelty are arguably the 
inverses of the narrow, canalized cognitive, and behavioural styles 
that characterize psychopathology. Subjective rating scales exist 
for measuring aspects of the psychedelic experience, such as the 
Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (see also Roseman et al. 2019), 
the Mystical T ype Experience Questionnaire (Hood 1975, see also 
Siegel and Emmert-Aronson 2021), the Psychological Insight Ques-
tionnaire (Peill et al. 2022), the Challenging Experience Question-
naire (Barrett et al. 2016), and the Altered States of Consciousness 
scale (Studerus et al. 2010). There are also useful scales that are 
arguably best applied in the days after a psychedelic experience 
(the so-called afterglow’ period), such as the Psychological Insight 
Scale (Peill et al. 2022). Some researchers have also made use of 
simple single-item ratings, measuring such phenomena as the 
‘richness of experience’ (D’Agostino et  al. 2020), ‘ego-dissolution’ 
10 Hip ́olito et al.
(Nour et al. 2016), and the intensity of complex and simple visual 
imagery (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016). Viewing these scales and the 
experiences they pertain to can enable us to understand dynam-
ical processes of destabilization and the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ 
psychological phenomena that parallel them, by which we mean 
phenomena that are gained or enhanced (i.e. positive) or lost 
or diminished (i.e. negative). Examples of positive or ‘gain’ phe-
nomena include ‘insight’, ‘visions’, ‘challenging states’, ‘mystical 
type experiences’, and ‘emotional breakthroughs’—and exam-
ples of negative or ‘loss’ phenomena include ‘ego-dissolution’. 
The notion of ‘emotional breakthrough is becoming particularly 
relevant as a strong predictor of positive therapeutic outcomes 
(Aday et al. 2020, Roseman et al. 2019 , Nutt et al. 2020 , Spriggs 
et al. 2021, Kuc et al. 2022, Peill et al. 2022).
It is important to emphasize that specific experiences should 
not be viewed as reliable effects of a direct drug action but rather 
experiences whose likelihood of occurring is increased by a direct 
drug action but that critically depend on contextual influences 
(Wolf and Hopko 2008 , Carhart-Harris et al. 2018). The popular-
ized term ‘set and setting’ is often used in relation to psychedelic 
experiences (Leary et al., 2017 ), with ‘set’ referring to the prepa-
ration of the individual (including his/her personality structure, 
expectations, and mood at the time), while ‘setting’ accounts for 
(physical, psychological, and sociocultural) the characteristics of 
the environment in which the experience takes place (Schneegans 
and Schöner 2008, Schilhab and Esbensen 2019).
Overall, in this section, we have cast the destabilizing action 
of psychedelic drugs in the context of psychedelic therapy. Lever-
aging principles from complexity science, we explored the idea 
that psychotherapy may trigger clinical change by destabiliz-
ing unhealthy patterns of thinking and that psychedelics can 
be strong candidates for catalysing this. The widening of a self-
centred point of view is ideally paralleled by a generalized sense of 
connectedness, tenderness, and peace that enables an unhurried 
reprocessing of one’s past, present, and future that is practised 
and realized (Peill et al. 2022).
Discussion
We propose that incorporating insights and methods from dynam-
ically CST, adaptive networks, and the FEP framework ( Friston 
2019, Hipolito 2019, Parr and Friston 2019, Da Costa et al. 2020) 
can enhance our understanding of the cognitive neuroscience 
of conscious experience and the basic and therapeutic action of 
psychedelic compounds. In contrast to eliminativist or excessively 
brain-centric approaches to consciousness and the psychedelic 
experience, we believe that CST offers an approach that respects 
the phenomenology of lived experience and acknowledges the rel-
evance of emergent and dynamical phenomena in psychology, 
mental health, and psychedelic therapy. By incorporating insights 
from CST, we can gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity and 
nonlinear dynamics underlying the psychedelic experience and 
the therapeutic mechanisms that underlie its efficacy. This may 
ultimately inform the development of more effective and person-
alized psychedelic-assisted therapies for a range of mental health 
conditions.
Applying CST to psychedelic therapy for common mental 
health issues enables us to explain their action under a unified 
framework. One popular interpretation of psychedelic action is 
the REBUS model ( Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), which sug-
gests that psychedelics work by relaxing high-level priors, allow-
ing for new perspectives and interpretations of oneself and the 
environment. The REBUS model integrates the entropic brain 
hypothesis and the FEP framework, proposing that the entropy-
enhancing action of psychedelics flattens the mind and brain’s 
dynamical landscape, thereby increasing uncertainty, allowing the 
global system to escape from overly reinforced local optima (e.g. 
associated with symptoms of mental illness) and explore a more 
diverse and balanced global state space over time. In this way, 
healthier ways of thinking and behaving can be cultivated.
The destabilizing effects of psychedelics are closely tied to 
their ability to increase entropy and relax beliefs, which in turn 
corresponds to their potential to dismantle heavily reinforced 
attractors or rigid patterns of thought and behaviour that underlie 
symptoms of mental illness. By incorporating a complex systems 
perspective into our understanding of psychedelic therapy, we 
aim to provide a more comprehensive account of how the mind 
and brain can be reconfigured through the destabilizing effects 
of psychedelics, as well as other interventions that share this 
fundamental property.
Taking a CST approach to understanding the REBUS model 
offers a framework to explore the relationship between a range of 
psychological constructs, including destabilization, uncertainty, 
conscious experience, beliefs, assumptions, habits, belief relax-
ation, precision weighting, confidence, learning, reinforcement, 
de-weighting, emotional breakthrough, insight, integration, and 
more. This approach not only helps us to better understand the 
psychological effects of psychedelic therapy but also provides a 
foundation for investigating their neurobiological underpinnings 
through techniques such as brain imaging.
One interesting offshoot of our application of CST to 
psychedelics is what it implies about the nature of psychological 
health. That is, according to our model, health may be defined 
by the depth of inter-relations and free-flowing exchange between 
different patterns of mind, brain, and behaviour, where, e.g., 
no one pattern is too dominant or weighted. Thus, healthier 
global patterns or dynamics should feature the dynamic nesting 
of psychological states (and the brain states they relate to) in an 
extended set of harmonious patterns that share the information 
they encode. This general rule of deep nesting and information 
exchange relating to healthier and happier feeling states should 
apply within the brain, as well as between the brain and body and 
between the body and other living beings and systems. For exam-
ple, the rhythms and dynamics of these various systems and their 
subsystems should ideally inter-relate in a mathematically logi-
cal way, as is the case, e.g., with harmonics in sound and music. 
Empirical research demonstrates that brain waves in specific fre-
quency bands align with distinct cognitive states (Deco et al. 2017, 
Basar 2022, Watanabe et al. 2023), which has been described as a 
resonance music chamber (Cabral et al. 2023).
The presented model is admittedly lacking in detailed expla-
nations, yet it is believed to hold considerable intuitive appeal 
and may aid in understanding the unitive or nondual experi-
ences associated with psychedelics and certain meditative states. 
The sense of interconnectedness that can arise within and after 
psychedelic experiences is also relevant, and the ‘symmetry the-
ory of valence’ (Hesp et  al. 2021, Smith et  al. 2021) and the 
notion that self-organized criticality within and between sys-
tems may relate to positively valenced feeling states ( Carhart-
Harris et al. 2014 ) provide relevant frameworks to consider. We 
believe that this model deserves dedicated empirical investigation, 
particularly given the current lack of comprehensive knowledge 
in cognitive neuroscience about the biology of valence-specific 
emotion (Lindquist et al. 2016) and the potential benefits a bet-
ter understanding could bring to mental health research and
treatment.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our CST-based approach suggests that psychedelics 
act as destabilizers, creating the conditions for the dismantling 
of overly reinforced set points or attractors that underlie symp-
toms of mental illness. The initial entropic and destabilizing drug 
effect can lead to a topological reconfiguration of the global energy 
landscape of the mind and brain. This effect can be harnessed 
by combining psychedelics with appropriate psychological sup-
port, including postdosing integration. Our approach offers new 
insights into the dynamic profile of psychological health and 
has the potential to inspire new investigations and approaches 
to mental health research and care. While there is growing evi-
dence for the therapeutic value of psychedelic therapy, a better 
understanding of how it achieves positive therapeutic results is 
needed.
