To act upon the world, creatures must change continuous variables such
asmusclelengthorchemicalconcentration.Incontrast,decisionmaking
is an inherently discrete process, involving the selection among alterna-
tive courses of action. In this article, we consider the interface between
the discrete and continuous processes that translate our decisions into
movement in a Newtonian world—and how movement informs our de-
cisions.Wedosobyappealingtoactiveinference,withaspecialfocuson

1 Introduction
The nervous system faces a dual challenge in shaping behavior. To in-
duce changes in the external world, it is necessary to contract muscles
or secrete chemicals. Such processes necessarily involve the manipula-
tion of continuous variables—muscle length or chemical concentration.
In addition, animals must make decisions. To do so, they must entertain
several different possible courses of action, or policies. Ultimately, they
must select one of these actions or policies that are necessarily discrete.
We draw on recent work that considers the interactions between the neu-
ronal processing of discrete and continuous quantities (Friston, Parr, &
de Vries, 2017). To make this more concrete, we focus on the oculomotor
system. Sampling the visual world entails decisions about where to look
andtheimplementationofthesedecisionsbycontractionoftheextraocular
muscles.

temthatinvolvesthephysicalimplementationofcategoricaldecisions.The
ideaspresentedinthisarticlecomplementprevioustreatmentsofcognitive
time (VanRullen & Koch, 2003), including the notion of a perceptual mo-
ment (Allport, 1968; Shallice, 1964; Stroud, 1967) and the suggestion that
brain oscillations act as discrete clocks to support this type of computation
(Buschman & Miller, 2009, 2010). They also resonate with recent develop-
ments in machine learning (Linderman et al., 2017) and some of the prob-
lems faced in modern robotics (Cowan & Walker, 2013; Schaal, 2006). In
short,thecouplingofcategoricaldecisionmakinganddynamicperception

ing of perception (and action).
Oscillatoryrhythmsinmeasuredbrainactivityhavebeenlinkedtocycli-
cal perceptual processes (Buzsaki, 2006), with theta and alpha cycles as the
most popular hypothesized units of perceptual time (VanRullen, 2016). In
endorsement of this, the timing of processing relative to the phase of cer-
tain oscillations appears to be important (Buzsáki, 2005). While there is
some controversy concerning the frequency of the perceptual clock, an ad-
vantage to focusing on the oculomotor system is that we can evade this
issue. The frequency of spontaneous saccadic sampling is around 4 Hz,
allowing us to commit to a theta rhythm. Conveniently, this is the fre-
quency often associated with attentional and central executive (decision)
functions (Chelazzi, Miller, Duncan, & Desimone, 1993; Duncan, Ward, &
Shapiro, 1994; Hanslmayr, Volberg, Wimber, Dalal, & Greenlee, 2013; Lan-
dau & Fries, 2012; VanRullen, 2013), as opposed to sensory processes asso-
ciatedwithfasterfrequencies(Drewes&VanRullen,2011;Dugué,Marque,
&VanRullen,2011;Ergenogluetal.,2004;vanDijk,Schoffelen,Oostenveld,
& Jensen, 2008).

2 Active Inference
2.1 Principles of Active Inference.Active inference is the process of
minimizing variational free energy through action and perception (Fris-
ton, Samothrakis, & Montague, 2012; Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel,
2010). The imperative to maintain a low free energy stems from the self-
evidencing(Hohwy,2016)natureoflivingsystems.Ifanorganismsamples
sensory input (e.g., blood pressure, pH, and temperature) compatible with
life, this constitutes evidence for its existence as the sort of thing it is. It is
intuitively sensible that living creatures should act so that they experience
such sensations.
Inmoreformalterms,theadaptivefitnessofacreature’sphenotypicstate
or trait “just is” the probability of a creature being in that state. This prob-
ability can be treated as model evidence by associating the creature with a
model and its sensory exchange with the world with phenotypic or char-
acteristic states. By casting exchange with the world in terms of a random
dynamical system, it is fairly straightforward to show that the states that
constitute the creature must, on average, increase model evidence; hence
self-evidencing. (See Friston, 2013, for details.)
Active inference formalizes this notion by casting behavior as free-
energy-minimizing or self-evidencing processes. Perception follows from
recognizing or inferring the causes of sensory input by optimizing proba-
bilistic representations with respect to free energy. Crucially, these causes
include our own actions. This means action selection can be treated as
“planningisinference”(Attias,2003;Botvinick&Toussaint,2012).Inshort,
perceptual inference underlies action, active sensing informs perception,
and both serve to minimize free energy or maximize model evidence.
Mathematically, the relationship between free energy and model evi-
dence can be expressed through Jensen’s inequality:

erative model,p(y,θ ), that describes how sensory data are generated from
latent (“hidden”) variables,θ. The second is an arbitrary (“recognition”)
distribution,q(θ),thatbecomesanapproximateposteriorwhenthefreeen-
ergy is minimized (Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Friston, 2009):
q(θ) ≈ p(θ|y) ⇔ δF
δq(θ) = 0.
2322 T. Parr and K. Friston
To ensure that free energy minimization is tractable, this distribution is
often assumed to factorize into several marginal distributions. This is re-
ferred to as a mean-field approximation (Feynman, 1998). Although orig-
inally introduced to solve problems in physics, it appears to be consistent
with the anatomical separation of processing streams in the brain (Friston
&Buzsáki,2016).Forexample,thedivisionofvisualprocessingintodorsal
(“where”) and ventral (“what”) streams (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994) sug-
gests that the brain factorizes beliefs about these variables, implementing
something like a mean-field approximation. The approximation takes the
form
q(θ) =
∏
i
q(θi).
If we substitute this into the expression for the free energy above and then
take the variational derivative with respect to these marginals, we find the
optimal value for this distribution (Beal, 2003):
q(θi) ∝ exp

Thissolutioniscommontovariationalinferenceaboutdiscreteandcontin-

each of these domains, we must consider that the form of the probabilistic

As such, (Markov) decision processes are a natural form for the genera-
tive model because they are defined on discrete state spaces (FitzGerald,

for a continuous state-space model. Heuristically, we can think of these (gener-

variables from their prior distributions(e.g.,π, s1, ˜v ), and using these variables
to sample dependent variables (e.g.,s2, ˜x) from conditional distributions. Fi-
nally, the data (˜o, ˜y) can then be generated from the likelihood. In short, a gen-
erative model is just a probabilistic specification of how data are caused. Note
that the prior mean for ˜v is derived from the outcomes of the discrete model.

hidden states undergo transitions that depend on the state at the previous
time.Thetransitionbetweencontrolstatesdependsonthepolicypursued.
In our example, this means that the sequence of fixation locations is de-
termined by the policy. Each state gives rise to an outcome,o.W eu s et h e
notation ˜o= [o1,o2,..., oT]T to describe the sequence of outcomes through
time. The outcome we are interested in here corresponds to “where I am
looking.” Figure 2a shows graphically how one can factorize this kind of
model.
The Discrete and Continuous Brain 2325
The form of this generative model implies that we must perform a
Bayesianmodelselectiontodecideonthebestpolicy(sequenceofsaccades)
to pursue. To do so, we define prior beliefs about the probability of each
policy. Active inference mandates the selection of policies that minimize
free energy. However, free energy is a function of outcomes, which are not
known for future time steps. The solution to this is to select policies that
minimize the expected free energy. To convert the expected free energy for
eachpolicytoaprobabilitydistribution(thatsumstoone),weuseasoftmax

Toaccountforfutureoutcomes,wehaveusedthe(posteriorpredictive)dis-
tribution ˜Q(oτ ,sτ |π) = P(oτ |sτ )Q(sτ |π). Theγ parameter is an inverse tem-
perature parameter (associated with dopaminergic signaling) that weights
how sensitive the prior is to differences in the expected free energy of poli-
cies. The above equation can be expressed in linear algebraic form as (Fris-
ton, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2017):

lnsπτ = lnA· oτ + lnBπτ −1sπτ −1 + lnBπτ · sπτ +1.

It is then straightforward to construct a biologically plausible gradient as-
cent scheme with this solution as its fixed (attracting) point:
sπτ = σ(vπτ ), ˙vπτ = επτ ,
επτ = lnA· oτ + lnBπτ −1sπτ −1 + lnBπτ · sπτ +1 − lnsπτ .

and decision making. For outcomes not yet observed, we can perform a

2.3 Moving the Eyes.At the level of biological effectors (glands and
muscles) and sensory receptors, the variables the nervous system must
deal with are continuous. In other words, to enact a selected policy, it is
necessary to map categorical representations to the physical world with

certainty about the particular location of the target, we can specify the pre-

)
.
Under the Laplace approximation (Friston, Mattout, Trujillo-Barreto, Ash-
burner, & Penny, 2007), the precision of these distributions depends only
on the mean. This means we only need to optimize the mean explicitly. As
this will be the maximum of the distribution, we can evaluate the above
equations at their means and perform a generalized gradient ascent (Fris-
ton, Stephan, Li, & Daunizeau, 2010):

equations,whichmediateperceptualinference,withadifferentialequation
equipping the system with low-level reflexes (i.e., the actions that cause
contractions of the extraocular muscles) (Adams, Shipp, & Friston, 2013).
These also minimize free energy but can be thought of as fulfilling predic-
tions about sensory data by changing the external world:

final thing to specify is the process by which the continuous state-space
model informs the discrete model. In other words, what sort of evidence
is passed from the continuous to the discrete part of the (active) inference
scheme? In brief, the discrete part of the generative model provides prior
constraints on the continuous part, while the continuous part reciprocates
with Bayesian model evidence for the discrete hypotheses entertained by
the discrete part to enable Bayesian belief updating. This updating entails

pers, we show that this is likely to be represented in the mapping from higher
cortical areas (Friston, Rosch, et al., 2017), such as the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, an area that houses representations that endure over a longer temporal
scale (Parr & Friston, 2017d) and connects to the frontal eye fields.
theselectionofalternativehypotheses(outcomes)thatconstituteempirical
priors at the continuous level.
To adjudicate between these hypotheses, we need to compute the pos-
terior probabilities over each outcome (e.g., target fixation). We give an ab-
breviated outline of this (Bayesian model reduction) procedure here (for a
moretechnicalaccount,seeFriston,Litvak,etal.,2016).Giventhattheonly

rule to write the posterior odds ratio between the full and reduced model,
cancelling the likelihood terms:
p(˜v|˜y,om)p(˜y|om)
p(˜v|˜y,o)p(˜y|o) = p(˜v|om)
p(˜v|o)
We can replace the posteriors here with those that we compute using the
Bayesian filtering approach outlined above. Rearranging this, we get
p(˜y|om)q(˜v|om) = p(˜v|om)
p(˜v|o) q(˜v|o)p(˜y|o).
Integrating both sides with respect to the hidden cause gives
p(˜y|om) = p(˜y|o)
∫ p(˜v|om)
p(˜v|o) q(˜v|o)d˜v.
As the free energy approximates the negative log evidence, this can be
rewritten as
F(om) = F(o)− ln
∫ p(˜v|om)
p(˜v|o) q(˜v|o)d˜v
Notably, this means that the free energy of any hypothesis,m,c a nb ec a l -
culated from the free energy of the full outcome model without having to
explicitly compute the posteriors associated with the latent variables inm.
This is a slightly technical point that from a computational perspective, af-
fords a very simple and efficient form of Bayesian model comparison. In
other words, the evidence for different hypotheses or models at the dis-
cretelevelcanbecomputeddirectlyandeasilyfromthesufficientstatistics
of posterior beliefs encoded at the continuous level. In terms of neurobiol-
ogy, this speaks to the biological possibility of belief propagation from the
continuous to the discrete domains.
To convert the evidence for each model back to discrete time, we inte-
grate the model evidence (free energy) over the time period corresponding
to one theta cycle. This is then combined with the prior over the model to
give a vector (E) that can be passed through a softmax function to give the
posteriorovereachoutcomemodel, rτ (Friston,Parr,etal.,2017).Thisplays
the role of a discrete observation or outcome from the point of view of the
MDP(see Figure 3).
This concludes our technical description of belief propagation between
discrete and continuous parts of a generative model. A worked example
of how this sort of belief propagation of message passing could work in
the brain is provided in the final section (using the update equations in
2330 T. Parr and K. Friston

siderthebasicneurobiologyoftheoculomotorsystemandhowitscompu-
tational architecture could support belief propagation of this sort.

3.1 Cerebral Cortex. The cerebral cortex is a laminar structure, with
layer-specific projections and terminations (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991).
The connectivity implied by inference using a Markov decision process
closely resembles this pattern (Friston, Rosch, et al., 2017). Specifically, the
inferenceschemewehavedescribedinvolvesseveraldistincttypesofvari-
ables that receive messages from a subset of the other variables. This im-
pliesastereotypedpatternofconnectivitybetweenthesegroups(orlayers)
ofcomputationalunits.Consistentwithcorticallaminae,externalinputtar-
gets only one layer. Outputs of different types arise from defined popula-
tions. In this section, we use known neuroanatomy to constrain the assign-
ment of computational units to their appropriate laminae.
Layer IV of the cortex receives ascending connections from lower areas
(Shipp, 2007), or from first-order thalamic nuclei. The computational units
that receive this input are the error units,επτ , suggesting that these occupy
this layer. This also implies thatrτ , the subcortical projection to layer IV,
is likely to be represented by neurons in first-order thalamic relay nuclei,
such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (Herkenham, 1980). Layer III gives
rise to ascending connections. These are not shown here but would arise
fromneuronsencodingthestate sτ atthathierarchicallevel(Friston,Rosch,
etal.,2017).Forsimplicity,weconsiderasinglecorticalarea,thefrontaleye

occipital (Bruce & Tsotsos, 2009) contributions to this system.
The Discrete and Continuous Brain 2331
Layer V of the cortex has several subcortical targets (Kasper, Larkman,
Lübke, & Blakemore, 1994; Ojima, Murakami, & Kishi, 1996). It is the layer
that houses the pyramidal cells of Betz in the motor cortex that project to
lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. In addition, layer V gives rise to
projections to the second-order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar, the
superiorcolliculus,andthebasalganglia(Fries,1985;Hübener&Bolz,1988;
Shipp, 2007). As Figure 3 shows, units encodingoπτ send messages to all
of these anatomical homologues. They participate in the evaluation of the
expected free energy in the striatum, the model averaging of continuous
time models by the superior colliculus, and Bayesian model reduction by
the thalamus. That theEτ units of the thalamus receive cortical projections
from layer V suggests that these neurons must be located in second-order
thalamic nuclei (Crick & Koch, 1998; Rockland, 1998; Sherman, 2007).
3.2 BasalGanglia. Asnotedabove,thebasalgangliareceiveinputfrom
cortical layer V, encoding predictions about discrete outcomes. This input,
in addition to a signal from the error units,ςπτ ,i su s e dt oc o m p u t et h ee x -

tobeinvolvedinpolicyevaluation(Gurney,Prescott,&Redgrave,2001;Ja-
hanshahi, Obeso, Rothwell, & Obeso, 2015). Most of the cortical inputs to
the basal ganglia target the striatum (Alexander & Crutcher, 1990; Shipp,
2017), implying the expected free energy is represented by medium spiny
neurons in this structure. These give rise to inhibitory GABAergic projec-

3.3 The Brain Stem.The brain stem is the source of the cranial nerves
to theextraocularmuscles.Thissuggeststhatbrain stemstructures engage
incontinuousmessagepassing.Wehavepreviouslydemonstratedthatthe
anatomyofthismessagepassingisnotonlyconsistentwiththeconnectivity
ofthebrainstem,butalsothatitreproduceselectrophysiologicalresponses
in these structures, and the same deficits as in neurological patients when
lesioned (Parr & Friston, 2018). In addition, these nerves carry propriocep-
tive information from the muscles (Cooper & Daniel, 1949; Cooper, Daniel,
& Whitteridge, 1951), while the midbrain receives optic nerve fibers from
the retinotectal pathway (Linden & Perry, 1983). Given beliefs about the
current position and velocity of the eyes, ˜μx, it is possible to make predic-
tions about the resulting sensory input (Adams, Perrinet, & Friston, 2012;
2332 T. Parr and K. Friston
Friston, Adams, Perrinet, & Breakspear, 2012; Perrinet, Adams, & Friston,
2014). This induces a sensory prediction error ˜εy that is minimized by ac-
tion. This implies that the midbrain and pontine nuclei responsible for sig-
nals to the extraocular muscles must contain neurons that broadcast these
errors. As the brain stem nuclei form the nodes of the network engaged in
continuousinference,theymustreceiveinputfromtheregionmappingde-
cisionsintothisspace.Theobviouscandidateforthisregionisthesuperior
colliculus.
3.4 The Superior Colliculus. The superior colliculus is the interface
between the forebrain and brain stem networks. It is the recipient of cor-
tical (Hanes & Wurtz, 2001) and basal ganglia projections (Hikosaka &
Wurtz, 1983; see Figure 4) and is intimately connected to the oculomotor
system within the brain stem (Sparks, 2002). As such, it sits at the anatom-
ical boundary between the discrete and continuous networks. It is found
in the dorsal midbrain, at the same level as the oculomotor nucleus. Like
the cortex, it is a laminar structure, with different electrophysiological re-
sponses in different subsets of cells. There are three broad groups of these
neurons,asillustratedinFigure4.Thesearetheburst,fixation,andbuildup
cells (Ma, Graybiel, & Wurtz, 1991; Munoz & Wurtz, 1995a).
We have previously argued (Parr & Friston, 2018) that these groups cor-
respond to three different types of computational unit. Burst cells, which
fireatthestartofasaccade,havethepropertieswewouldexpectfromneu-
rons signaling visual prediction error, ˜εy. This is consistent with the fact
that a subset of retinal ganglion cells synapses within the colliculus and
that some collicular cells respond to visual stimuli (Mays & Sparks, 1980;
Wurtz & Mohler, 1976). Fixation neurons are active during fixations, and
wehaveassociatedthesewiththeexpectationneuronsencodingtargetfix-
ation locations, ˜μv . Consistent with the computational anatomy of Figures
3 and 4, it is this group that projects to the brain stem centers for saccade
generation (Gandhi & Keller, 1997).
Buildup neurons show a pattern of activation consistent with a pop-
ulation encoding (Anderson, Keller, Gandhi, & Das, 1998; Lee, Rohrer, &
Sparks, 1988). A traveling hill of excitation moves from a peripheral loca-
tion toward the rostral pole of the colliculus during a saccade (Munoz &
Wurtz, 1995b). At a population level, these neurons can be thought of as
expressing a prediction error between a target fixation and the current eye
position, ˜εv (Sparks,1986).Themovementtowardthepole,representingthe
foveal location, can be thought of as encoding the reduction in prediction
errorastheeyemovesclosertoitstarget.Thatthisoccursatthepopulation
level suggests that buildup neurons individually code for discrete spatial
regions.
The discretized encoding of continuous variables by these units is
consistent with their computational role, evaluating the difference be-
tween ˜η,parameterizingcompetinghypotheticalmodels,andtheestimated

tivity between the neuronal populations in the superior colliculus in greater
detail. The transverse section through the midbrain allows us to depict the ter-
minations in the optic tectum from the optic nerve. We also illustrate the to-
pographicalarrangementofthefixation(rostralpole)andbuildup(distributed
throughout) cells, and the connectivity between these implied by our formula-
tion. Note that burst neurons are the most dorsal, with buildup neurons found
more ventrally. As the schematic shows, this would be consistent with the pro-
posed extrinsic (between regions) connectivity, as each population is oriented
toward the regions it is connected to. The intrinsic (within region) connectiv-
ity between buildup and fixation neurons is shown on the right, conforming
to the knownretinotopyofthe colliculus(Paré, Crommelinck,& Guitton, 1994;

the discrete-continuous interface of the oculomotor system, and the topog-
raphy of buildup and fixation neurons hints at the computational mecha-
nisms that map between them. We next use the neurobiological pointers
2334 T. Parr and K. Friston
established in this section to interpret simulated oculomotor control in
terms of established electrophysiological responses in the oculomotor
system.
4 Simulations
Our aim in performing these (minimal) simulations is to illustrate the in-
teractionsbetweenthediscreteandcontinuousdomainsoftheoculomotor
system. As such, we chose a simple behavioral paradigm with three pos-
sible fixation locations (left, right, and center). We then set the prior pref-
erences (through theC matrix) so that proprioceptive data are preferred
that are consistent with central fixation initially, then with leftward fixa-
tion,rightwardfixation,andfinallycentralfixationagain.Thisisconsistent
with the instruction to look at a sequence of targets at each of these loca-
tions. The structure of the model we used is as depicted in Figure 1. The
continuous part employs the belief that the eyes are drawn toward an at-
tracting location, and this is implemented by an action that has the effect
of a Newtonian torque. The details of this can be found in Parr and Fris-
ton (2018) and are very closely related to those in previous formulations of
oculomotion (Adams et al., 2012; Friston, Adams, et al., 2012; McSpadden,
1998; Perrinet et al., 2014). The discrete part is formally similar to that used
in Mirza et al., 2016 and Parr and Friston (2017b, 2017c).
Figure5showstheresultsofsimulatingactivevisioninthismodel.Cru-
cially, this type of simulation allows us to show what is happening at dif-
ferent neuroanatomical locations simultaneously and gives a sense of the
functional interaction of these areas. The results are presented in the form
of raster plots, as if we had recorded from single neurons in each of the
simulated brain areas. Representations in the cortex and basal ganglia up-
date on a theta cycle (4 Hz), while superior colliculus buildup cells trans-
late this into continuous time for collicular fixation neurons. These induce

eye position, unlike the neurons in the discrete compartments, which en-
code the probability of an alternative fixation point.

ation neuron activity. During the next 100 ms, as the eyes move to fulfill
this belief, we can see the resolution of the prediction error in the superior

trophysiological responses we would expect to observe under the process the-
ory associated with active inference. On the left, we show neuronal firing rates
(representing approximate posterior beliefs), depicted in the form of a raster
plot. These are synchronized across all of the neurons shown. Darker colors in-
dicate a greater firing rate. In the cortex (frontal eye field), we show neurons
representing the possible fixation targets. The first three rows indicate the neu-
rons representing left, center, and right at the first discrete time step (τ = 1).
These three options are then replicated in the next three rows, but reporting
the second time step. The third and fourth steps are similarly represented. In
the striatum, direct pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSN) represent the ex-
pected free energy of each of the three policy options (saccade right, saccade
center, and saccade left). These then inhibit their corresponding neurons in the
substantia nigra pars reticulata that represent the posterior beliefs about these
policies. Note the inversion of striatal activity in the substantia nigra as a re-
sultofthisinhibition.Weshowtheactivityofasuperiorcollicular(SC)fixation

5 Discussion
5.1 Message Passing and Inference. Variational message passing is
not the only local message passing scheme that has been associated with
2336 T. Parr and K. Friston
neuronal signaling. Belief propagation (Pearl, 2014) is one alternative. The
message passing under this approach is perfectly consistent with the free
energy principle, as the requisite messages can be shown to minimize the
Bethefreeenergy(Yedidia,Freeman,&Weiss,2005).However,althoughat-
temptshavebeenmadetolinkbeliefpropagationtoneuralsignaling(Jardri
&Denève,2013),theresultingarchitecturesturnouttobemorecomplicated
than the equivalent variational schemes. The primary reason for this is the
recursivecomputationofsuchmessages.Eachmessageisderivedfroman-
other message rather than from posterior beliefs about each variable. Vari-
ational messages passed from one population of neurons are derived from
the posterior beliefs represented by these neurons, mapped through a set
of synaptic weights. This means that the same set of neurons can be used
to compute multiple different messages. In contrast, a recursive scheme
requires streams of forward and backward messages that do not directly
interact.
A further possibility is that the messages we have described might be
computedthroughsampling,orMonteCarlo,approaches(Hastings,1970).
One argument against this is that these methods tend to take much longer
to converge. In a biological setting (requiring online inference), this means
that animals would spend more time in surprising states (associated with
a lower model evidence). In short, while Monte Carlo approaches may
achieve a greater accuracy, they induce a larger (path integral of the) free
energy than variational approaches.
5.2 Physiology and Behavior.The approach we have described here is
capable of reproducing a wide range of physiological and behavioral phe-
nomenaintheoculomotorsystemandmoregenerally.Inthecontextofthe
oculomotor system, we have previously shown that the signals we have
simulated bear a close resemblance to those measured in brain stem nuclei
(Parr & Friston, 2018). Most striking, we found that simulated collicular
buildup neuron responses qualitatively reproduced single-unit recordings
published in the experimental literature (Munoz & Wurtz, 1995b).
Lesions to these models induce similar behavioral syndromes to those
found in neurological patients with damage to the associated neu-
roanatomy. By disrupting neuronal message passing (i.e. inducing discon-
nection syndromes; Geschwind, 1965), we have simulated visual neglect
(Parr & Friston, 2017b) and internuclear ophthalmoplegia (Parr & Friston,
2018). The white matter disconnections associated with these syndromes
are the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Doricchi & Tomaiuolo, 2003) and
the medial longitudinal fasciculus (Virgo & Plant, 2017), respectively. The
locations of these synthetic lesions constrain the computational anatomy,
and their nature endorses the notion that the brain engages in variational
inference.
More generally, models based on active inference have a high degree
of face validity, in that they reproduce a wide range of neurobiological
The Discrete and Continuous Brain 2337
phenomena. These range from single cell responses, including place fields
(Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2017) and mid-
brain dopamine activity (Friston et al., 2014), to evoked responses, includ-
ing those associated with classic working memory tasks (Parr & Friston,
2017d).Theyhavebeenusedtogeneratebehaviorsasdiverseasexploration
(Friston et al., 2015; Mirza et al., 2016), handwriting (Friston, Mattout, &
Kilner, 2011), eye-blink conditioning (Friston & Herreros, 2016), habit for-
mation (FitzGerald, Dolan, & Friston, 2014), communication (Friston &
Frith, 2015), and insight (Friston, Lin, et al., 2017). In addition to these the-
oretical accounts, active inference has been used pragmatically to model
behavior and to characterize individuals according to the parameters of
their prior beliefs (Adams, Bauer, Pinotsis, & Friston, 2016; Mirza, Adams,
Mathys, & Friston, 2018; Schwartenbeck & Friston, 2016).
5.3 Generalizations. The issues described in this article generalize be-
yond eye movements. Any neurobiological system that needs to make de-
cisions and implement these via some physical effector must solve the
problem we have described here. This is vital for (but not exclusive to)
speech,locomotion,andautonomicregulation.Languageismadeupofdis-
crete units (phonemes, words, sentences) that are expressed as continuous
changes in auditory frequencies generated by contraction of the laryngeal
(and pharyngeal) muscles (Simonyan & Horwitz, 2011). Walking involves
taking a series of discrete steps, each of which requires a careful coordina-
tionofskeletalmuscles(Ijspeert,2008;Winter,1984).Interoceptivestatesare
frequently divided into discrete dichotomies including fed versus fasting
(Kalsbeek, la Fleur, & Fliers, 2014; McLaughlin & McKie, 2016; Roh, Song,
& Kim, 2016), diastole versus systole, and sympathetic versus parasympa-
thetic (McDougall, Münzberg, Derbenev, & Zsombok, 2014; Owens, Fris-
ton, Low, Mathias, & Critchley, 2018). Each of these induces continuous
changesinenzymeactivity,bloodpressure,orsmoothmusclecontractions.
The form of the variational message passing will be very similar for each
of these processes, but the variables represented will differ. This suggests a
similar pattern of cortico-subcortical connectivity, but differing regions of
cortex, and different subcortical components.
In this article, we have chosen to focus on a fairly concrete problem:
deciding where to look and how to do this. For more abstract decisions,
perhaps at higher hierarchical levels in the brain (Badre, 2008; Badre &
D’Esposito, 2009; Christoff, Keramatian, Gordon, Smith, & Mädler, 2009;
Rasmussen, 1985), it may be necessary to integrate beliefs across multiple
modalities. A challenge for future work is to incorporate the set of beliefs
that constitute an emotional state, as emotions are often thought to con-
tribute to “irrational” behaviors. It is not always easy to intuit how such
behaviors might be Bayes optimal.
Onelineofresearchintotheseissuesframesthemasquestionsaboutin-
teroceptive inference (Ondobaka, Kilner, & Friston, 2017; Seth, 2013; Seth
2338 T. Parr and K. Friston
& Friston, 2016). Given beliefs about (abstract) variables that have both in-
teroceptive and exteroceptive sensory consequences, it becomes clear that
policies must minimize expected free energy in both domains. For exam-
ple, abeliefthatapredatoryanimalispresentimpliesthatthesympathetic
nervous system should be active, but also that visual data are consistent
withthepresenceofsaidanimal.Anatomically,thesedependenciesarecon-
sistent with the sensory and autonomic targets of the amygdala (LeDoux,
Iwata, Cicchetti, & Reis, 1988; Ressler, 2010). A tachycardia then carries
(weak)evidenceforthepresenceofascaryanimalandcouldinfluencepol-
icy selection even in the absence of exteroceptive evidence. This suggests a
framework in which an emotional state may influence decision making in
an apparently irrational way that is entirely compatible with the formula-
tion we have described here.
5.4 Future Directions. We hope to further the ideas in this work both
theoretically and empirically. Two important theoretical issues need to be
addressed in greater depth than we have space for here. The first is a thor-
ough comparison of alternative message-passing schemes in relation to
their anatomical and physiological plausibility. The second is a general-
ization of the inferences required for oculomotor decisions (and their mo-
toricimplementation)toothersystems.Whiletheideaswehavepresented
aregenerallyapplicable,itwillbenecessarytospecifythegenerativemod-
els required to solve locomotive, autonomic, and abstract decision-making
problems. Finally, althoughthe computational anatomywe have proposed
hasahighdegreeoffacevalidity,itwillbenecessarytoestablishitspredic-
tive validity.
OnewaytodosowouldbetousecomputationalfMRI(Schwartenbeck,
FitzGerald, Mathys, Dolan, & Friston, 2015), fitting this model to oculomo-
tor behavior, and looking for brain regions that show activity patterns con-
sistent with the simulated neuronal responses. We hypothesize that these
regions will match the computational anatomy illustrated in Figure 3. An
alternative would be to use single-unit responses from each brain area
recorded during an oculomotor task. One could then compare each simu-
latedneuronalresponsetoeachrecordingandconstructaconfusionmatrix
of the evidence for each synthetic signal in each region. We would expect a
greater evidence for each signal that we have associated with each region
above.
