1 Introduction
Anxietyrepresentsanadaptiveresponsetoenvironmentalstres-
sors(DeMartinietal. 2019,Kalin 2020).However,whenexcessive
or prolonged, it can impair cognitive, social, and physiologi-
cal functioning, potentially developing into a clinical anxiety
disorder (DeMartini et al.2019, Jalal et al.2020). A primary
diagnostic challenge lies in objectively distinguishing adaptive
frompathologicalanxiety.Currently,thisdistinctionreliesheav-
ily on clinician judgment (Crocq2015). Despite the operational
criteriaforanxietydisordersprovidedbyDSM-5andICD-11(e.g.,
duration, severity, and functional impairment) (Penninx et al.
2021),theylackmechanisticbiomarkerstovalidatetheseclinical

more, the frequent comorbidity of anxiety with other mental
disorders(Kalin 2020,Bonazetal. 2021,SzuhanyandSimon 2022)
adds another layer of diagnostic complexity, often complicating
treatmentplanning(Penninxetal. 2021,Alonsoetal. 2018,Brewer
etal. 2021).
Anxiety is considered a kind of interoceptive disorder (Abend
2023). This theoretical shift offers a promising path forward.
Specifically, quantifying interoceptive abilities could inform the
development of more precise, biologically grounded diagnostic
criteria (Brewer et al.2021). Moreover, interventions aimed at
improvinginteroceptiveaccuracymaypresentnovelmechanisms
fortreatment(Sugawaraetal. 2020,Quadtetal. 2021).
This review first synthesizes the definitions of interoception,
its physiological foundations, and its computational modeling
hypotheses. Building upon previous studies, we leverage inte-
roceptive computational models to: (1) explain interoceptive
dysfunction mechanisms, (2) decode plausible anxiety disorder
pathogenesis through interoceptive signatures, and (3) propose
testablehypothesesforfutureresearchandsuggesttranslational
pathways.
2 TheDefinitionofInteroceptionandits
RelationshipWithPhysicalandPsychological
Health
The precise conceptualization of interoception remains con-
troversial, particularly regarding the scope of the “internal
states” it encompasses (Toussaint et al. 2024). Historically,
researchfocusednarrowlyonvisceralsensations.However,con-
temporarydefinitionshaveexpandedtoincludeabroaderrange
of signals, such as those from affective touch (e.g., hugs, kisses)
(KhalsaandLapidus 2016,Chenetal. 2021,Y angandZhu2022).
From a neuroscientific perspective, interoceptive signals are
conveyed via the spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn or cranial
nerves (e.g., the vagus) to the nucleus of the solitary tract,
ultimatelyprojectingtotheanteriorinsulaandanteriorcingulate
cortex(Cameron 2001,Craig 2002,Olaussonetal. 2002,Critchley
andHarrison 2013).Thesesignalsoriginatefromdiversetissues,
includingskin,bones,andsmoothmuscles.Behaviorally,intero-
ception is not a unitary process but a foundational component
ofautonomicreflexes,homeostaticdrives,affectiveexperiences,
and cognitive representations of the bodily self (Khalsa et al.
2018). Bonaz et al. further postulate that the continuity of
interoceptive processing is fundamental to the neurobiological
structure of self-awareness (2021). Thus, interoception can be
understood as a fundamental mind-body integration process
thatiscrucialformaintaininghomeostasis,regulatingemotional
balance, and ensuring overall organismal adaptability (Khalsa
etal. 2018).
Traditional perspectives posit that interoception follows a uni-
directional pathway (Berntson and Khalsa2021). Enhancing
interoceptive skills is often viewed as improving the ability
to recognize and interpret bodily states, a process crucial for
maintaininghomeostasis(FotopoulouandTsakiris 2017).When
homeostasis is disrupted, bodily signals are sent to the brain,
triggering internal sensations that prompt regulatory responses
(Paulus et al. 2019). According to this unidirectional model,
interoceptionisthuscharacterizedasapassive,adaptiveresponse
to external stimuli. To survive, an organism must balance envi-
ronmental adaptation with internal stability (Petzschner et al.
2021). However, homeostatic reflex mechanisms face inherent
constraints:innon-stationaryenvironments,rigidreflexarcsmay
provemaladaptive.Moreover,afferentsignalingisoftencontam-
inated by “noise,” impairing signal discrimination (Kavcıoğlu
et al. 2021). Consequently, the unidirectional model appears
insufficient to explain interoceptive complexity, necessitating
morerobustadaptiveframeworks.
Therefore, a growing number of researchers have proposed
variouscomputationalmodelstoexplaininteroceptiveadaptabil-
ity. Notable examples include the allostatic self-efficacy model
within a Bayesian hierarchical framework (Stephan et al.2016),
computational models formed on active inference (Paulus et al.
2019), and the sensory-control loop model (Bonaz et al.2021,
Brewer et al. 2021, Petzschner et al.2021) ,a l lo fw h i c ha r e
discussed in detail in Section3.2 (Table 1). These frameworks
conceptualizeinteroceptionastheprocessinwhichthenervous
system integrates and interprets internal signals to construct a
dynamic representation of the body’s internal state, as well as
the “mapping” between the body and the external environment
(Paulusetal. 2019).Rootedinpredictiveprocessing,thesemodels

representation.(Paulusetal. 2019,Stephanetal. 2016,Barrettand
Simmons2015,PaulusandStein 2010,Aupperleetal. 2014).
Dysregulation in interoceptive signal integration can disrupt
homeostasis and is strongly associated with negative emotional
responsesandpsychosomaticdisorders(Bonazetal. 2021,Brewer
etal. 2021,KhalsaandLapidus 2016,Khalsaetal. 2018,Barrettand
Simmons 2015, Murphy et al.2017). Specifically, dysfunctional
interoceptionhasbeenimplicatedinneurologicaldisorders(both
structural and functional) (Ricciardi et al.2016,K o r e k ie ta l .
2020),psychosomaticdiseases(Icenhouretal. 2017,Mayeretal.
2019, Fournier et al.2020), and psychiatric disorders (including
comorbidities)(Bonazetal. 2021,Quadtetal. 2021,Stephanetal.

These conditions may stem from persistent deviations in real-

3 TheInteroceptiveComputationalModels
Computation theory aims to construct mathematically defined
models that precisely explain adaptive response mechanisms
under varying external stimuli (Khalsa et al.2018). Interocep-
tive computational models are particularly suited to elucidate
organismaladaptationforthefollowingreasons:
For survival, organisms must adapt to ever-changing envi-
ronments. The body mediates this environmental information
exchange (Su and Ye 2021), requiring receptors to flexibly
aligninternalandexternalsignalswhiledistinguishingpastfrom
present states to guide adaptive responses (Møbjerg and Neves
2021,Tsukaharaetal. 2021).AsKleckneretal.emphasize,intero-

3.1 TheNeuralBasisoftheInteroceptive
ComputationalModels
Fromaneurophysiologicalperspective,anorganism’sinterocep-
tionreflectsthedynamicintegrationofphysiologicalsignals(e.g.,
body temperature, blood pressure, bladder pressure, heart rate,
osmotic balance) (Craig2002,V e l t e ne ta l .2018). Specialized
receptors (chemo-, mechano-, and osmoreceptors) detect these
signals and transmit them via bottom-up pathways (Berntson
and Khalsa2021). Peripheral inputs are initially relayed to the
nucleus of the solitary tract (Holt et al.2019), followed by top-
down modulation of visceral states. These descending signals
engageautonomic,endocrine,andimmunepathwaystoregulate
hormone release, autonomic activity, and homeostatic reflexes
(BerntsonandKhalsa 2021,Petzschneretal. 2021).Mousestudies
demonstrate that insular cortex regions encoding hunger/thirst
dynamically update satiety predictions based on environmental
cues(e.g.,food/wateravailability),illustratingcontext-dependent
top-downregulationofinteroceptivecoding(Livnehetal. 2020).
Similarly, the hypothalamus integrates reactive and predictive
control within the endocrine system (Burdakov2019). Tan et al.
identified the dorsal anterior insula as a convergent hub for
interoception, decision-making, and emotion regulation (2022).

Although the bottom-up and top-down pathways serve distinct
functions, their complex interactions complicate the mapping
ofspecificafferent-efferentcircuitsininteroception(JungHoon
et al. 2020). According to Berntson and Khalsa, bidirectional
signaling is central to adaptive interoceptive processing, with
pathway integration being key to understanding organismal
adaptation. This duality—where interoception both generates

LoopModel
Stephanetal.proposedtheallostaticself-efficacymodelwithina
Bayesianframework,theorizingfatigueanddepressionasemer-
gent metacognitive disturbances from interoceptive prediction
failure (2016). This metacognitive theory of illness emphasizes
that higher-order beliefs about the brain’s regulatory capacity
(allostatic self-efficacy) mediate the fatigue-to-depression tran-
sition. Complementing this, Paulus et al. identified two mecha-
nisms in interoceptive dysfunction through an active inference
model: hyperprecise priors (overestimated certain expectations)
and context rigidity (impaired adjustment to environmental
changes) (2019). Expanding the theoretical scope, Petzschner
etal.’ssensory-controlloopmodelunifiedinteroceptivecompu-
tation, body regulation, and predictive forecasting across brain-
body disorders (2021), which comprises three components: (1)
a generative model constructing interoceptive representations,
(2) a regulatory model guiding adaptive responses, and (3) a
predictivemodelupdatinginternalstates(Figure 1).
The generative model, as the loop’s first stage, infers bodily
states from sensory signals by integrating implicit and explicit
knowledge. Under Bayesian principles, the brain weights noisy
sensory inputs against prior expectations to generate optimal
inferences. Mechanistically, higher cortical regions send predic-
tions to lower-level areas, which compare them with ascending
bodilysignals.Whenpredictionsmatchsensoryinputs(minimal
prediction error), receptor inputs are validated as accurate.
Discrepancies trigger dual adjustments: predictions are revised,
and peripheral signals are modulated (e.g., via autonomic path-
ways)torestorehomeostasis.Uncorrectederrorsmaypropagate
maladaptiveinteroception(Petzschneretal. 2021).Thus,intero-
ceptionisacontinuousprocesswherebypredictionsarealigned
withsensoryevidencetominimizeerror.Thisanticipatoryinfer-
ence explains why perceived bodily states (e.g., blood pressure)
often deviate from physiological measurements—prior expec-
tations dominate when sensory precision is low. For instance,
hypertensive patients rarely subjectively estimate extreme pres-
sures (e.g.,> 180/110 mmHg), demonstrating top-down modu-
lation by pre-existing knowledge (Petzschner et al.2021, Hulme
etal. 2019).
After minimizing errors between predictive signals and sen-
sory inputs (prediction errors), organisms must enact adaptive
behaviors to maintain homeostasis. For instance, they may add
clothinginresponsetocoldorceaseeatinguponsatiety.Paulus
et al. frame this regulatory phase as active inference—a process
centraltointeroceptivegeneration.Buildingonthis,Petzschner
et al. and Tschantz et al. (2021, 2022) formalize how predictive
encodingsteersactionselectiontowardhomeostaticallyoptimal
states. Through such actions, individuals refine predictions,
further reducing errors and aligning actual bodily states with
expectedconditions(Paulusetal. 2019,Aupperleetal. 2014,Seth
andFriston 2016,Allenetal. 2023).
The predictive updating phase completes the loop, where the

Asnotedabove,whentheinteroceptionloopfunctionsoptimally,

Within the active inference framework (Paulus et al.2019),

from prior expectations and sensory evidence (Stephan et al.
2016,BarrettandSimmons 2015,PaulusandStein 2010,Aupperle

by both genetic predispositions and experiential learning (Pet-
zschner et al.2021), representing an evolutionary strategy for
survival(Tschantzetal. 2022).Thegenerativemodelsestablished
during the initial phase of the sensory-control loop, alongside

However, the “best estimate” becomes maladaptive when dys-

4 InteroceptiveDysfunctionandAnxiety
Disorders
4.1 InterpretingAnxietyDisordersWithinthe
Sensory-ControlLoopModel
Research suggests that disruptions in interoceptive processing
may foster a cognitive bias toward threat perception, impair
the accurate sensing of bodily states, elevate anxiety, increase
allostaticload,andcontributetomentalhealthdisorders(Paulus
andStein 2006,Hakamataetal. 2010,Sterling 2014,Petersetal.
2017,VandenBerghetal. 2017).Withindynamicenvironments,
individuals with persistent anxiety are particularly susceptible
tothedominanceofpriorexpectationsoveractualinteroceptive
signals(Paulusetal. 2019).Furthermore,studieshavefoundthat
impairedinteroceptiveabilitiesareconnectedtothedevelopment
ofcognitivebias(Smithetal. 2020,Büttikeretal. 2021,V erdonk
et al. 2024). Such cognitive bias is strongly correlated with
persistent anxiety symptoms (Lemente et al.2024). Critically,
anxietyisnotastaticconditionbutadynamicstatewheresymp-
toms fluctuate over time, making their specific manifestation
and timing difficult to predict (Abend2023, Lapate and Heller
2020). Therefore, characterizing anxiety necessitates a dynamic
framework, which the aforementioned computational models
provide by explaining how dysfunctional Bayesian updating
perpetuatessymptomvariability.
Interoceptivedysfunctionprimarilymanifeststhroughtwocom-
putational anomalies: hyperprecise priors and context rigidity
(Paulusetal. 2019).Hyperprecisepriorsreflectanoverestimation
of a certain model during interoceptive inference, leading to
exaggeratedbeliefstates.Contextrigiditydescribesthefailureto
flexibly update these priors in response to changing internal or
external cues (Figure2). Consequently, prediction errors persist
throughoutthesensory-controlloop,disruptinghomeostasisand
perpetuatingdysfunction(Paulusetal. 2019,Tschantzetal. 2022,
Smith et al.2020). This framework aligns with clinical observa-
tionsofanxietyasacontinuumofaberrantdefensiveresponses.
Abend conceptualizes anxiety as characterized by heightened
cognitivevigilanceandphysiologicalarousal—symptomsindica-
tiveofamalfunctioningdefensesystem( 2023).Similarly,Richter
et al. note that panic disorder and agoraphobia represent an
escalation of defensive responses to internal threat cues, with
patients exhibiting heightened interoceptive sensitivity (2021).
These perceived threats often originate from misrepresented
bodily signals, such as arrhythmias or hypoxia (Khalsa et al.
2018, Benke et al.2021). Therefore, in the context of anxiety,
this mechanism of “hyperprecise priors” appears to specifically
manifest as “hyperprecise threat priors,” whereby individuals
disproportionatelyweighexpectationsofdangerorharm.
Considerastormynightasanexample.Anindividualwithmal-
adaptive anxiety may disproportionately weight threat-related

They might misinterpret this sound as an intruder. Crucially,
even after receiving corrective sensory evidence (e.g., visually
confirming it is only the wind), context rigidity prevents prior
beliefupdating.Asimilarstimuluswilllikelyreinstatethesame
threatresponse(e.g., “Perhapsitisanintruderthistime”).This
failure to update beliefs generates persistent prediction errors,
sustaining vigilance and symptoms like tachycardia, tachypnea,
and motor agitation. Later, a new stimulus (e.g., a noise from
bushes afterthe storm)shouldpromptanew assessment.How-
ever,hyperprecisethreatpriorscontinuetodominateperception,
overriding sensory evidence and preventing adaptive responses
(Tschantz et al.2022). This inflexible adherence to maladaptive
modelsamplifiesanxietyandimpedesbehavioraladaptability.In
contrast,neurotypicalindividualscanflexiblyevaluateandweigh
competing expectations (e.g., “It’s probably just a cat”), thereby
minimizing prediction error and stabilizing their physiological
state(Paulusetal. 2019)(seeFigure 3).
When interoceptive functioning is optimal, an organism effec-
tively manages physiological deviations from a homeostatic set
point or adaptively redefines this set point allostatically to
enhancesurvival(McEwen 2017).Inanxietydisorders,thisflexi-
bilityislostduetohyperprecisethreatpriors(rigid,threat-biased
expectations) and context rigidity (an inability to update these
expectations). These misrepresentations are processed through

processing,evenbenignstimuli(e.g.,thesoundofwindandrain)areinterpretedaspotentialthreats.Duetoimpairedweightingofpriorpredictio ns,
internal models fail to update appropriately, propagating errors into subsequent perceptual cycles. For example, when the weather clears and a new

neurochemical responses such as increased norepinephrine

through maladaptive priors, distort metacognition, culminating
in panic-driven emotional and physiological symptoms (Nayok
etal. 2023).Critically,thecoremechanismsustainingthiscycleis

Thebrain’sinabilitytodesensitizeitshyper-precisethreatmodels
via real-time alignment with actual bodily inputs (Paulus and
Stein 2006,M a t h y s2011) results in a state of chronic anxiety.
Minor physiological fluctuations are catastrophically misin-
terpreted, maintaining heightened vigilance and perpetuating
symptoms(SzuhanyandSimon 2022).
Thus, interoceptive impairment diminishes the ability to accu-
rately perceive bodily states, creating a persistent cognitive bias
within the sensory-control loop. This bias primes individuals
with anxiety to anticipate threat in neutral stimuli, triggering
disproportionateresponsesthatmaintainthedisorder.
4.2 InteroceptiveDysfunctionofAnxiety
Disorders
The interoceptive sensory-control loop model provides a frame-
workforunderstandingdysfunctioninanxietydisorders,which
is supported by empirical evidence of aberrant threat reactivity.
Forinstance,researchdemonstratesthatindividualswithGener-
alized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) exhibit hypersensitive responses
tointeroceptivechallenges.
Teed et al. found that women with GAD, compared to healthy
controls,showedheightenedautonomicreactivity(e.g.,increased
heartrate)andsubjectiveanxietytolow-doseadrenergicstimuli,
coupled with delayed neural activation in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (2022). Complementing this, Ver-
donk et al. reported that GAD patients had significantly higher
heart-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes—a neural correlate
of interoceptive prediction error (the discrepancy between pre-
dicted and actual cardiac signals)—even in response to neutral

FIGURE 3 How active inference in the sensory-control loop interprets the mechanism of well-functioned interoception (created on the basis
of (Paulus et al.2019) and (Petzschner et al.2021). In the initial phase of perceptual inference, individuals balance predictive models of threat and
safety. Upon hearing the sound of wind and rain, top-down expectations from higher cortical areas engage in hierarchical comparison with bottom-
up sensory signals. A best-fitting model—in this case, “wind and rain”—is selected to minimize prediction error, leading to an action that further
confirms the stimulus and updates the prior weighting of the predictive model. This revised internal state then informs the next cycle of perception.

Also, Harrison et al. found that anxiety is less tied to low-level

by hyperprecise threat priors—overly rigid and inflated expec-

that paradoxically increases prediction errors, as the brain gen-

2022, Kircanski et al.2018,L e D o u xa n dD a w2018, Joyal et al.
2019), describing symptoms indicative of sympathetic hyperac-
tivity. However, objective physiological assessments frequently
reveal a discrepancy between this subjective distress and mea-
surable bodily states (Adams et al.2022, Verdonk et al.2024,
BrainandBehavior ,2025 7of14
Teed et al.2022, Makovac et al.2019). This mismatch between
perceived and actual physiology highlights a core interoceptive
dysfunction:afailuretoaccuratelyinterpretandintegratebodily
signalsintosubjectiveexperience(Connelletal. 2018,Zhangand
Chen2021).Consequently,commonanxietysymptomsmayorigi-
natefrommaladaptiveinteroceptiveinference,wherefaultyprior
beliefs dominate sensory evidence (Nayok et al.2023), making
interoceptive disruption a potential hallmark of these disorders
(KhalsaandLapidus 2016,Adamsetal. 2022).
A developmental pathway to anxiety may originate in early
temperament. Allen et al. suggest that behaviorally inhibited
infants exhibit heightened physiological reactivity to novelty, a
traitthatpersistsandescalatesintoattentionalandinteroceptive
biasestowardperceivedthreat( 2023,DegnanandFox 2007).This

threat responses and anxiety risk (Allen et al.2023). This foun-
dational dysfunction manifests in adulthood as a core inability
to accurately process bodily signals. Stein’s concept of anxiety
“false alarms” (2006), captures this well: benign internal sensa-
tionsaremistakenlyinterpretedasthreateningstimulirequiring
avoidance (Paulus and Stein2010, Domschke et al.2010). This
imprecision generates profound intolerance of uncertainty—a
hallmarkofpathologicalanxietywhereindividualsholdnegative

and Robinson 2023). These behavioral phenomena are also
supportedbyneuralevidence.Lietal.demonstratedthatpatients

4.3 InterimSynthesisandHypotheses
Synthesizingtheextantliterature,wepositthatanxietydisorders
are fundamentally disorders of interoceptive inference, charac-
terized by a failure to accurately integrate bodily signals with
environmental context. Based on this synthesis, we propose the
followinghypotheses:
1. The Precision Hypothesis: Pathological anxiety arises
from a pathological increase in the certainty assigned to
threat-related prior beliefs. This leads to a cognitive bias
wherein ambiguous interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli
are catastrophically misinterpreted, triggering dispropor-
tionate defensive responses (e.g., heightened physiological
arousal,catastrophiccognition).
2. The Developmental Trajectory Hypothesis:T h ee s t a b -
lishment of these hyperprecise threat priors is facilitated by
early-life factors (e.g., behavioral inhibition temperament),
whereheritablepredispositionsandlearnedexperiencesrein-
force negative associations with internal bodily sensations
andenvironmentaluncertainty.
3. The Cycle of Dysregulation Hypothesis: This initial
deficitinitiatesaviciouscycle:biasedpriorsgeneratepersis-
tent prediction errors, which the dysfunctional system fails
toresolvethroughadaptivebeliefupdatingoraction(context
rigidity).Thischronicmismatchfurtherentrenchesthefaulty

Task, reporting a tendency for patients with panic disorder to
interpret interoceptive cues as threatening (2014). However, the
interpretation of such findings is complicated by methodolog-
ical debates. A primary critique of heartbeat perception tasks
is that they may confound true interoceptive acuity with an
individual’s prior beliefs about their heart rate, rather than
measuringapurephysiologicalability(Paulusetal. 2019,Adams
et al.2022, Desmedt et al.2018, Murphy et al.2018, Zamariola
et al. 2018). Consequently, studies investigating the anxiety-
interoception link with these tools have produced inconsistent
results (Garfinkel et al.2016, Ewing et al.2017, Desmedt et al.
2020, Hickman et al.2020), likely due to heterogeneous clinical
samples and divergent anxiety measures (Adams et al.2022).
Furthermore, these tasks are not process-pure; they engage
multiple physiological and cognitive systems simultaneously,
capturing only a fraction of the broader interoceptive spectrum
(Baranauskas et al.2017). Crucially, the overwhelming focus on
cardiac perception has neglected other interoceptive domains,
limitingthegeneralizabilityofexistingfindingsonanxiety.
Despite methodological debates surrounding heartbeat percep-
tiontasks,evidenceconfirmingthatanxiousindividualsinterpret
interoceptivesignalsasthreateningunderscoresacorecognitive
bias. To move beyond static measures and capture this bias in
dynamiccontexts—whileformallyaccountingfortheroleofprior
expectations—computational modeling is essential. These mod-
els allow researchers to experimentally manipulate predictable
versus uncertain sensory information to test how prior beliefs
shape interoceptive inference (Khalsa et al.2018, Paulus et al.
2019).Researchfoundthatindividualswithpathologicalanxiety
exhibit maladaptive learning patterns characterized by elevated
learning rates for punishment or threat (Homan et al.2019,
Aylward et al.2019, Pike and Robinson2022). This dysfunction
may manifest as hyperprecise threat priors by overweighting
aversive cues or contextual rigidity—impaired adjustment of
beliefs to sensory uncertainty, as demonstrated transdiagnosti-
cally by Smith et al. using the heartbeat tapping task (2020).
These computational distinctions help dissect specific pathways
tointeroceptivedysfunctioninanxiety.

Moreover, the comorbidity of anxiety and depression is highly
prevalent in clinical practice (Bonaz et al.2021), which com-
plicates differential diagnosis. While both disorders involve
impaired interoception (Brewer et al.2021, Paulus et al.2019)

5.2 IntegratingtheInteroceptiveComputational
ModelWithClinicalWorkonAnxietyDisorders
Given that anxiety disorders are marked by significant disrup-
tionsininteroceptiveprocessing,targetingthisdysfunctionrepre-
sentsapromisingtherapeuticavenue.Thisapproachisgrounded
in the computational principle that the brain infers emotional
states from bodily signals. As Paulus et al. argue, interventions
canleveragebottom-uppathwaysbydirectlymanipulatinginte-
roceptive input (e.g., through respiration or thermoregulation).
This helps recalibrate the brain’s maladaptive body-state rep-
resentations, thereby reducing persistent prediction errors and
promotingadaptivebehavioralresponses( 2019).
Computational models are critical for elucidating the mech-
anisms of anxiety interventions, paving the way for precise
treatments. For instance, modeling a drug’s effect on approach-
avoidance behavior can dissect whether it works by enhancing
reward sensitivity, diminishing punishment sensitivity, or both
(Yamamori and Robinson2023). This computational dissection
isessentialbecauseanxiety-relatedlearningdeficitsarenuanced.
PikeandRobinson’sfinding—thatindividualswithpathological
anxiety show accelerated learning from punishment without
heightenedbaselinepunishmentsensitivity( 2022)—exemplifies
thiscomplexity.Itsuggestsadysfunctioninbeliefupdatingrather
thanmereperceptualbias.Therefore,computationalmodelscan
guidethedevelopmentofinteroceptiveinterventionsthatspecif-
ically target these maladaptive learning patterns. For example,
a therapy could be designed to recalibrate the overweighting
of punitive outcomes, thereby improving an individual’s ability
to navigate negative situations and enhancing overall treatment
efficacy.
This computational approach directly informs the design of
interoceptive interventions. The goal is to provide patients with
volitional control over their maladaptive inference processes,
primarily by recalibrating the precision weighting of interocep-
tive signals. For example, individuals can be trained to better
recognize and accurately interpret bodily signals (e.g., distin-
guishing arousal from excitement rather than threat) (Duquette
2020).Alternatively,techniquescanleverageinnatephysiological
mechanisms to attenuate sensory evidence precision, such as
using cutaneous stimulation (e.g., rubbing one’s stomach) to
dampen the perceived intensity of a stomachache (Smith et al.
2020,Kiversteinetal. 2019).Thismechanisticfocusonprecision
regulationunderpinsmanybody-basedtherapies.
Recognized as an interoceptive intervention (Khalsa et al.2018,
Benke et al.2021), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a gold-
standard treatment for GAD, effectively operates by facilitating
this recalibration. (DeMartini et al.2019). Through exposure
and response prevention, CBT helps patients gradually update
their overly precise threat priors by providing disconfirming
sensoryevidence,therebyestablishingnew,adaptiveassociations
(YamamoriandRobinson 2023).BeyondCBT,arangeofinterven-
tionstargetinteroceptiveinferencethroughsimilarmechanisms:
carbon dioxide-assisted breathing training (Meuret et al.2008,
Meuretetal. 2018),mindfulness-basedstressreduction(MBSR),
yoga, meditation, exercise-based interventions (Farb et al.2015,
Wielgosz et al.2019), and floatation-REST therapy (Feinstein
et al.2018a, Feinstein et al.2018b). These approaches integrate
the body’s internal and external processes, highlighting their
beneficial effects on reducing pathological anxiety (Nayok et al.
2023).
Therefore, we propose: future research should leverage com-
putational models to deconstruct these interventions within
the sensory-control loop framework. Specifically, studies must
identify whether therapeutic efficacy stems from correcting
misinterpretations at specific inference stages, improving belief
updating flexibility, or enhancing the ability to act on new
interoceptive insights. This precise mechanistic understanding
is the key to developing targeted, effective, and personalized
psychiatrictreatments.
5.3 ProspectsforEmpiricalResearchon
InteroceptionBasedontheComputationalModels
TowardAnxietyDisorders
Given the challenges in directly quantifying interoception, a
promising alternative is to probe its functional properties indi-
rectlybyexamininghowitismodulatedbyexteroceptivestimuli.
This approach, grounded in computational models, involves
perturbingtheinteroceptivesystemwithcontrolledexternaltasks
andmeasuringtheresultinginferenceprocesses.Paulusetal.sug-
gest that such paradigms can reveal fundamental differences in
perceptualinferenceacrossclinicalpopulations.Forinstance,by

bodilysensation,researcherscanassessnotonlytheaccuracyof
interoceptive perception but also the metacognitive confidence
individualshaveintheirinteroceptivejudgments.Thisprovides
awindowintohigher-ordercognitivebiases(Paulusetal. 2019).
Experimental paradigms based on this principle are already
being used to explore learning and decision-making biases in
anxiety (Yamamori and Robinson2023). The ultimate goal of
this research is to transition from mere assessment to targeted
modulation—developing interventions that can systematically
recalibrate maladaptive interoceptive inference to harness its
therapeuticregulatorypotential.
Neuroimaging research by Wu et al. provides a mechanistic
basis for interoceptive interventions by identifying a shared
neural pathway for interoception and anxiety. Using a novel
BrainandBehavior ,2025 9of14
paradigm that engages interoceptive awareness without requir-
ing focused attention on a single organ, they found that both
processes recruit overlapping circuits for bodily awareness.
This neural overlap suggests that modulating activity in these
shared pathways—for example, through techniques that alter
interoceptiveprocessing—coulddirectlyalleviateanxiety( 2018).
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is one such inter-
ventionthattargetsthisinteroceptive-anxietynexus(Khalsaetal.
2018,F a r be ta l .2015, Kabat-Zinn 2005). It operates through
bidirectional (bottom-up and top-down) modulation of bodily
signals. A core component, the mindfulness body scan, trains
individualstosustainnon-judgmentalattentiononinteroceptive
sensations, beginning with the breath—a key psychosomatic
indicator whose frequency is directly altered by anxiety (Weng
et al.2021, Homma and Masaoka2008, Nardi et al.2009). By
practicing the voluntary regulation of attention and acceptance
of sensations (including potential “threats”), patients can coun-
teractmaladaptivethreatbiasesduringearlycognitiveprocessing
(Ganetal. 2022).Brief,accessibleversionsofthispracticeshow

interoceptive inference cycles characteristic of anxiety disorders
(Kabat-Zinn 2005, Carmody and Baer2009, Sauer-Zavala et al.
2012,Bengetal. 2016).
In summary, building on the synthesis of evidence presented
above, we propose that future research must establish a unified
frameworkfordevelopingpreciseinteroceptiveinterventions.To
thisend,weadvocateforatwo-prongedapproach:1)leveraging
computational models to formalize the mechanisms of existing
techniques (e.g., elucidating how body scans alter the precision
weighting of bodily signals), and 2) employing rigorous experi-
mental paradigms to validate their efficacy. A critical next step
is to conduct double-blind studies that test whether practices
like the body scan directly remediate maladaptive interocep-
tive inference by providing counter-evidence to threat priors.
Thesestudiesshouldmanipulateinteroceptive-exteroceptivesig-
nal relationships (e.g., using delayed cardiac visual feedback) to
provoke and measure prediction errors in anxious individuals.
Simultaneously, neurophysiological markers (e.g., heart-evoked
potentials,insulaactivity)mustbeintegratedtoidentifyobjective
neural signatures of interoceptive bias and its correction (Fein-
stein et al.2018b, Hassanpour et al.2017, Schulz et al.2019).
Ultimately, by grounding intervention research in this compu-
tationally informed framework, we can move beyond generic
treatmentsandtowardtargetedtherapiesthatrecalibratespecific
dysfunctionalnodeswithintheinteroceptiveinferencehierarchy,
thereby significantly improving clinical outcomes for anxiety
disorders.
