Abstract. Here we review recent work attempting to combine the first principles 
formalism of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP -AI) 
framework with a recently proposed integrative model that attempts to ground 
personality as control variables for goa l-seeking systems: Cybernetic Big 5 
Theory (CB5T). First we summarize core aspects of this synthesis, then introduce 
some novel (and speculative) hypotheses, and then finally consider future 
implications for personality modeling with FEP-AI and CB5T. 
Keywords: Personality, Cybernetic Big 5 Theory (CB5T), Free Energy 
Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) Framework. 
1 Introduction 
As AI models continue to gain sophistication, we find ourselves with both new 
opportunities and challenges. In terms of benefits, we have the potential for AIs to act 
as tools for understanding (e.g. computational psychiatry), helpers (e.g. industrial 
applications and labor augmentation), and perhaps even companions (e.g. elder care). 
With respect to risks, we have the possibility of these systems to learn unexpected 
behavior patterns that could have potentially undesirable consequences. In what 
follows, we briefly review some recent work on personality modeling [1], which we 
believe could have far reaching consequences for our abilities to realize positive 
outcomes with respect to a future where AI becomes an increasingly central part of our 
lives. 
Personality can be thought of as a “phenomenological” description of the most 
relevant features for explaining overall behavior  and cognition. In dynamic systems 
terms, we may think of this as a “normal form” description, that attempts to capture the 
maximal amount of detail of a particular system with minimal description lengths  [2]. 
2 
In the realm of psychology, personality can be considered as the ‘essence’ of 
individuality, in terms of describing more enduring features that are stable across 
circumstances. With Cybernetic Big 5 Theory (CB5T)  [3], DeYoung proposes that 
personality is constituted by both “characteristic adaptations” (i.e., policies people learn 
for responding to different classes of situations) as well as the well -known 
(evolutionarily selected) traits such as Openness, Extraversion , Agreeableness, 
Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. CB5T further argues that these traits are best 
understood in the context of modeling individuals in cybernetic terms, or as goal -
seeking systems that are governed by various forms of feedback processes . This kind 
of functional understanding of persons and other complex adaptive systems suggests 
potentially fruitful intersections with computational frameworks, which is the issue we 
turn towards next. 
2 FEP-AI 
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) understands all persisting systems as entailing 
predictive (generative) models of the conditions under which they maintain their 
particular forms through intelligent actions. The processes enacted by generative 
models of per sons come in many varieties, ranging from unconscious habits, to 
emotionally charged reactive dispositions, to declarative knowledge and self -
organization via autobiographical narratives [4], [5]. To the extent that persons have 
identifiable traits and characteristic adaptations (i.e., personalities), these would 
represent enduring parameter values for the generative models governing dynamics, 
where this stability could be due to being genetically specified, epigenetically canalized 
[6], or as stable (to degrees) emergent equilibria. Different personality configurations 
would correspond to different models by which persons attempt to achieve their goals, 
including the primary goal of preserving essential features at the core of identity. 
It is worth emphasizing the extremely broad scope of the FEP, which is as far -
reaching as the purview of generalized Darwinism, with which it may be  fully 
isomorphic [7]. Not only do nervous systems entail predictive models, but so do entire 
populations of organisms and their extended phenotypes as (previously selected, 
teleonomical) ‘predictions’ with respect to evolutionary fitness. By this account, 
nervous systems are merely a (very) special case of generative modelling, where not 
only is it the case that such systems are models in their very existence, but where such 
systems also have models that function as cybernetic controllers [8]–[10]. In these ways, 
active inference provides a formalism in which all persisting dynamical systems can be 
understood as (self -)generative models, grounded in first principles regarding the 
necessary preconditions for continued existence in a world governed by the 2nd law. 
This universal Bayesian/Darwinian account extends all the way down to neuronal 
oscillations [11], to habitual reactions [12], [13], and all the way up to narrative selves 
as stories that achieve degrees of truth with the telling -doing-enacting [5], [14], [15], 
including with respect to shared narratives by which we more effectively collaborate 
with each other in pursuing valued goals [16], [17] . Within active inference, all 
characteristics of persons are selected —in the sense of both generalized Darwinism 
[18] and Bayesian model selection  [19]—according to their relative abilities to 
minimize their respective free energies, which is suggested to be equivalent to 
3 
maximizing self -model-evidence. Specifically, each characteristic of the person 
represents its own replicative dynamic that teleonomically ‘attempts’ to maximize 
model evidence for itself [20], [21] . From this perspective, personalities represent 
relatively stable evolutionary game theoretic equilibria among competing and 
cooperating quasi-species [22]–[25]. 
Work within the FEP paradigm has yielded a normative model of behavior in Active 
Inference (AI) to describe the processes by which free energy is minimized [26]. 
Further, advances in deep reinforcement learning appear to be converging on the kinds 
of solutions that are predicted to be necessary for (bounded) optimality in the FEP and 
Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework [27], [28]. The notion of active inference rests 
on the insight that perception takes place within the context of adaptively shaping 
actions, which alter patterns of likely perceptions. Rather than being the result of 
passive sensations, perception is an active proces s of foraging for information and 
resolving model uncertainty [29]–[31], often driven by discrete actions as a kind of 
hypothesis testing [32]–[35]. Both perception and action are understood as kinds of 
inferences in the FEP -AI framework, in that they both represent means by which 
systems can engage in comparing predictions against sensations. One way systems can 
reduce prediction-error is by updating internal models, thus changing predictions; in 
this way, perception is understood as a kind of best-guess inference as to the causes of 
sensations. However, another way systems can reduce prediction-error is by updating 
the world through action, and thus  making its predictions more accurate by changing 
likely perceptions; in this way, active inference represents a means by which not just 
perception, but also adaptive goal-oriented behavior can be realized via prediction-error 
minimization. The degree to which dynamics are governed by these two strategies—of 
updating of states either internal or external to the system—is determined (by gradient 
descent) according to whichever combination is expected to minimize overall free 
energy (i.e., cumulative precisio n-weighted prediction error)  (Fig. 1) . As we will 
describe in greater detail below, this foundational (intertwined and synergistic) duality 
between perceiving and acting may also have implications for understanding 
fundamental aspects of personality as well (Fig. 2).

Within the FEP -AI framework, all cybernetic systems necessarily minimize free 
energy for their generative models. However, in order to effectively achieve this 
objective, adaptive goal-seeking systems (such as organisms) select actions anticipated 
to result in free energy minimizing consequences in the future. Under this regime of 
expected free energy , model accuracy becomes expected utility, or opportunities for 
realizing the extrinsic value of ensuring preferred outcomes. Further, model complexity 
becomes the ambiguity and risk associated with pursuing particular courses of action, 
or opportunities f or realizing the intrinsic value of reducing uncertainty via learning. 
Optimizing for extrinsic value  involves minimizing discrepancies between preferred 
system-world configurations and observations, which entails pragmatically exploiting 
particular policies (i.e., sets of state -action mappings for goal realization, broadly 
construed to include the covert behavior of cognition) . Optimizing for intrinsic value 
involves model refinement through seeking out sources of uncertainty as opportunities 
for maximizing information gain, so allowing for epistemic exploration of hypothesis 
spaces regarding adaptive actions. These two sources of value relate to 
exploitation/exploration tradeoffs, which in this case are navigated [36] by selecting 
policies based on whatever combination of actions is estimated to most effectively 
minimize overall expected free energy. If these actions occur in the context of a novel 
task environment about which little is known, then policy selection in FEP-AI will tend 
to primarily involve the exploration of optimizing for information gain, followed by a 
shift to more exploitative behavior as the task structure becomes sufficiently clear to 
afford informed actions. However, if actions fail to be as successful as anticipated, then 
this will tend to result in shifting back to exploratory behavior until a better “grip” on 
the situation can be acquired [37], [38] . In this way, given well -calibrated prior 

5 
expectations, agents governed by FEP -AI will tend to exhibit flexibly balanced levels 
of curiosity as they engage in goal-oriented behavior. 
These dual strategies for minimizing expected free energy mean that cybernetic 
systems governed by FEP-AI may decide to forego pursuing a goal in favor of model 
refinement, if the latter will lead to a bigger reduction in prediction error [39]. This may 
be a surprising implication of these models, as certainly evolutionary fitness depends 
more on achieving goals that on enhancing the accuracy of perceptual maps. Refining 
internal models will be preferred over achieving valued goals through acti on only to 
the extent that this choice serves the more fundamental goal of promoting continued 
existence and effective goal pursuit over time [40]. Indeed, evolved cybernetic systems 
will tend to prioritize stable goal pursuit and homeostasis as a pre -requisite for 
existence, with “interoceptive inference” providing a potentially useful case example, 
in terms of those modeling efforts tending to center on the avoidance of excessive risk 
with respect to the preconditions for basic life management [41]. FEP-AI tries to 
address this prioritization in that we should expect “ adaptive priors” to make it such 
that all predictions are ultimately chained to  evolutionary fitness [42], such that we 
would expect  from systems selected to minimize free energy with respect to 
maintaining the preconditions for their existence. 
3 CB5T and cybernetic control variables; focus on Stability and 
Plasticity 
Parallels between FEP-AI and models of personality have recently been explored by 
Safron and DeYoung [1] with respect to Cybernetic Big 5 Theory (CB5T) [3]. In brief, 
CB5T contextualizes the Big 5 trait hierarchy as reflecting evolved control parameters 
for systems that attempt to minimize entropy with respect to the goals by which they 
preserve themselves. This is highly compatible with FEP -AI. Intriguingly, above the 
Big 5 in the trait hierarchy, two higher -order factors have been identified as Stability 
(shared variance of Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and (inverse) Neuroticism) and 
Plasticity (shared variance of Openness and Extraversion). One may be tempted to map 
onto FEP-AI’s dual optimization for extrinsic/pragmatic and intrinsic/epistemic value, 
respectively. However, this potential functional mapping should not be overstated, 
since a cybernetic interpretation of Extraversion as indicating “reward sensitivity” 
could be applied to situations where either pragmatic or epistemic value are at play, 
depending on wha t a particular individual finds rewarding (e.g. persons with high or 
low trait Openness as appreciating intrinsic value to respectively greater or lesser 
degrees). The dynamic tension between Stability and Plasticity has been observed in 
countless systems, with intriguing recent work suggesting that a major dimension of 
cultural variation may exist in the degree of "tight" or "loose" attitudes with respect to 
norms (i.e., relative degrees of precision on prediction-errors that would release policies 
for realizing deontic value) [43], [44]. An integration (and convergent support) between 
active inference and a predominant model of personality has important implications for 
computational psychiatry [2], and variations in the Big 5 trait hierarchy have recently 
been shown to converge with principled taxonomies of psychopathology (e.g. HiTOP) 
[45] (Fig. 3,4).

Interpretations of biophysical processes in terms of parameter settings for FEP -AI 
may help to provide substantial convergent support for CB5T, as well as an additional 
means of interpreting similar phenomena. For example, differing levels of 
dopaminergic function appear to have major impacts on personality with respect to 
Extraversion and probably also Openness/Intellect [46], and has been interpreted as 
indicating tendencies towards exploration (or Plasticity) in CB5T. In FEP -AI, tonic 
dopaminergic function is associated with precision (an inverse temperature parameter) 

7 
over policies, indicating certainty (subjectively, confidence) and more deterministic 
action selection; phasic dopamine, however, indicates changing estimates with respect 
to expected free energy and updating of likelihoods for selecting different policies  for 
enaction, as in reward prediction errors [47]–[50], including overt behavior as well as 
cognitive ‘acts’ [51]. That is, nervous systems tuned to exhibit high dopaminergic 
signaling may more readily deploy mental acts such as discrete attentional shifts and  
more extended  simulated plans, potentially contributing to more exploratory and 
flexible cognitive styles. While utilizing distinct conceptual frames, this account of 
dopamine in FEP -AI has strong correspondences with CB5T’s interpretation of 
dopamine as a “neuromodula tor of exploration” (DeYoung, 2013) and contributor to 
personality Plasticity. Further, FEP-AI’s interpretation of changes in phasic dopamine 
as updating likelihoods for policy deployment has clear parallels with CB5Ts 
interpretations of Plasticity as a capacity for updating strategies for goal attainment 
when confronted with obstacles and associated psychological entropy [52], [53]. 
While CB5T and FEP-AI both associate dopamine with potentially more exploratory 
behavioral and cognitive styles —and possibly more extraverted and open 
personalities—they also emphasize the context -sensitivity of functional consequences 
from varying pattern s of neuromodulation. In both frameworks, overly simple 
exploration/exploitation distinctions are problematized based on the fact that action 
selection is governed by control hierarchies with multiple (potentially nested) goals 
unfolding over varying times cales (DeYoung, 2015; Pezullo, Rigoli, Friston, 2018). 
For example, a person with highly confident beliefs regarding goal realization may 
choose to exploit a particular opportunity, or they may venture out into the unknown 
and explore new territories if th ey predict that course of action could realize even 
greater value. 
The relative positioning of goals  and related representations  within overall 
hierarchies in many ways speaks to the core of what we tend to mean by ‘personality.’ 
That is, we might expect hierarchically higher (or deeper) representations to be 
somewhat shielded from disruption by particular events on account of their being more 
opportunities (or multiple realizability) for minimizing prediction error via 
hierarchically lower patterns. This would be consistent with the ways in which systems 
distal from prima ry modalities have both close connections with neuromodulatory 
value signals, which tend to be most responsive to overall surprisal from relatively 
abstract action-outcome associations (e.g. attainment of particular goals from specific 
patterns of enaction ). If personality is understood as a way of summarizing the most 
impactful and enduring features of a goal -seeking system, then perhaps we should not 
be too surprised to observe that personalities are often most powerfully impacted by 
disruption to hierarc hically higher (or deeper) systems such as the ventral prefrontal 
cortex (c.f. pseudopsychopathy phenomena and the case of Phineas Gage (who became 
“no longer Gage” after a steel rod blasted through his head during a railroad 
construction accident) [54]. 
The hierarchical organization of goals is crucially important for multiple reasons. 
Firstly, the world as a whole tend s to have hierarchical structure with smaller (more 
quickly evolving) things tending to be nested within larger (more slowly evolving) 
things. As such, there could be advantages for reactive dispositions to entities/events at 
these different scales having a  similar kind of organization (cf. optimization via local 
gradients, locality -sensitive hashing, etc.). The attainment of complex goals v ia 
8 
extended sequences necessarily requires larger (and likely more slowly evolving) zones 
of integration, with coherent orchestration among the various sub -goals required to 
achieve the broader aims to which they might contribute (or hinder)  [55]. 
Conscientiousness is the personality trait most associated with the coherent 
management of goal hierarchies, and seems to only be reliably identifiable in animals 
with more complex nervous systems [56]. Speculatively, the nature of 
Conscientiousness (as a feature of cybernetic systems) may provide conceptual linkage 
between consciousness as knowledge and the character virtue of conscience as 
wise/integrated self -knowing and self -governance [57]–[59]. That is, the common 
etymological roots of these words may also point to their overlapping functions and 
potential inter-dependencies during the processes by which personhood is bootstrapped 
in sophisticated cognitive systems, like us [60].  
While the functional significances of the brain’s serotonin systems have not been 
thoroughly explored within FEP-AI, compelling parallels can nonetheless be identified. 
Within CB5T, moderate levels of serotonergic signaling would tend to correspond to 
Stability, or the protection of pre -existing strategies from disruption. These functions 
may have been conserved throughout evolution, as can be observed both in the 
locomotory modes of C. elegans, and even the foraging consequences of single celled 
organisms reducing directed motion upon encountering and consuming nutrient -rich 
meal (tryptophan → serotonin) [61], [62]. In this way, serotonin’s functionality as a 
satiety—and potentially safety and successful sociality —promoting signal would 
provide a countervailing force to dopaminergic disinhibition of action, consistent with 
the opponent -process dynamics that have bee n observed on multiple levels of 
organization ranging from hypothalamic nuclei to frontal lobe attractor dynamics [63]–
[66]. Within FEP-AI, physiological levels of serotonin (potentially resulting in greater 
occupancy of 5-HT1a relative to 5-HT2a receptors) have been associated with greater 
precision over interoceptive states, whose (allostatic) connections to the internal milieu 
and life management would be consistent with an association with Stability in CB5T. 
Notably with respect to computational psychiatry (and also ethology, these are the 
neurotransmitter systems agonized by SSRIs for depression and anxiety (and also 
dominance within social hierarchies). However, extreme levels of serotonergic 
signaling have been associated with the “relaxation” of beliefs and greater exploration 
in FEP-AI [67]–[69]. While CB5T has previously emphasized serotonin’s potential role 
in modulating Stability, potential roles of this system for enhancing Plasticity is a 
promising direction for future research. 
There is increasing interest in the effects of stimulating serotonergic 5-HT2a 
receptors for providing means for “how to change your mind” [70], and for achieving 
“altered traits via altered states” [71]. Compounds that act on these pathways have been 
described with various forms of suggestive terminology including psychedelics (“mind 
manifesting” and “higher states of consciousness”), hallucinogens (perception as 
inference), , entheogens (self -actualization and transpersonal psychology and 
spirituality), and even “entactogens” for non-classic psychedelics (healing from trauma 
and repairing excessively jagged/ruptured —and so non -navigable—free energy 
landscapes) [72]. Openness is the trait most commonly associated with potential change 
under psychedelic psychotherapy [73]–[75], but little work has examined the Big 5 
aspects (where substantial effect sizes are most likely to be observed) [76], [77], nor 
what kinds of personality change could be possible with targeted interventions. With 
9 
respect to specific mechanisms, it is notable that 5 -HT2a receptors appear to be 
particularly concentrated on deep association cortices [78], which would be consistent 
with our suggestion that hierarchically -higher representations may be particularly 
relevant for stabilizing personality.  The possibility for changing persons by changing 
the function of upper levels of cortical hierarchies has been compellingly described in 
terms of  “hub collapse” and disrupted personhood with psychedelics and meditative 
states [79]–[83], the cybernetic properties of bowtie architectures allowing for an 
“allostatic overload” mechanisms for flexibly adjusting functional depth [55], as well 
as in terms of predictive processing and other machine learning principles [67], [68], 
[84], [85]. 
4 A hypothesis on personality aspects and social power 
The discovery of two (and only two) aspects underneath each of the Big 5 trait 
domains could potentially be partially explainable in terms of a fundamental axis of 
variation in active inference: that is, the degree to which prediction-error is minimized 
via either perception (i.e., updating internal models) or action (i.e., updating system -
world states). This may lead to new testable hypotheses r egarding the bio -
computational processes contributing to personality variation . Could personalities be 
influenced by general tendencies with respect to adjusting the relative gain on 
predictions (including actions) or prediction -errors (i.e., sensory observations) in 
different inferential control hierarchies? 
For example, increased gain on interoceptive precision has been associated with 
social power [86], potentially corresponding to more opportunities for inwardly focused 
attention (due to not having to constantly attend outwards in order to monitor 
environmental contingencies). If prediction errors are allowed to ascend to 
hierarchically higher (anterior) levels of the insula, then somatic information may be 
more likely to be accompanied by conscious access, and potentially the disinhibition of 
action (via coupling with frontoparietal control hierarchies over the predictive 
enactment of sequences of prop rioceptive poses). Any neuromodulator or hormonal 
factor that agonizes the mesolimbic dopamine system may further contribute to the 
likelihood of connecting interoceptive percepts with actions, both via lowering 
disinhibition thresholds in the striatum and  increasing coupling between relevant 
networks [87]. In terms of both phenomenology and functional significances, this may 
correspond to the experience of willing and empowerment through the exercising of 
agency [15], [88], [89]. 
Given the fact that sex/gender roles have evolved (on phylogenetic, cultural, and 
ontogenetic levels) in conjunction with power (or dominance) differentials, this could 
potentially help to explain the especially large effects observed with respect to male -
female differences at the aspect level [77]. Similar differences could potentially be 
observed with respect to other social power differentials, such as race or class, and 
across all cases, may help to explain differences in either internalizing or externalizing 
in psychopathology, with the former being more likely to result in autonomic 
dysregulation as observed with respect to cardiac and gastrointestinal dysfunction [90], 
[91], but with the latter being more likely to result in accident proneness —or 
daring/improbable, but potentially great and heroic accomplishments [92], [93] . 
10 
However, given the potentially rapid pace of cultural evolution, we might not expect 
empirical correlations between aspect -level personality traits and gender/race/class to 
be constant over time either across or within individuals [94]–[96]. 
5 Psychological integration, mindfulness, and wellbeing 
FEP-AI and CB5T both emphasize the importance of hierarchical organization for 
achieving complex goals. However, the stable pursuit of complex/distal objectives may 
depend on the integrity of hierarchical active inference [97]. This may further require 
the ability to down -regulate (predominantly interoceptive) prediction errors (i.e., 
emotionally self -regulate), so allowing for flexibility in prioritizing  policies and not 
have the integrity of goal hierarchies be disrupted by p roximal setbacks [56]. This 
flexible balancing of priorities could have transdiagnostic relevance [98], [99] , 
theoretically promoting the formation of a kind of reflective equilibrium where goal -
hierarchies become more elegant/realizable. Over time, this balanced adjustment and 
personal evolution could even help contribute to the kinds of integration and 
individuation discussed by self -actualization psychologists [3]. While the precise 
nature of mindfulness remains unclear in personality psychology [100], this state (and 
possibly a trait) may correspond to one of the most effective means of engaging in the 
kind of emotional self -regulation required for inter -temporally coherent active 
inference [24], [101] . Without this skill at internal navigation, we might expect 
excessive responses to prediction -errors, which may result in elevated Neuroticism 
when considered at the level of personality traits. 
In theory, the difficulty of cultivating the kinds of cognitive (and affective) flexibility 
associated with mindfulness could potentially account for the failure to consistently 
observe a  general factor of personality  (GFP) [102]–[105]. For example, p art of the 
reason that a GFP may not be reliably observed could be due to opposing relations 
between Stability and Plasticity. However, similarly to the relationship between 
epistemic and pragmatic value in active inference, synergy between these objective s 
ought to be possible (and is normatively required). Mindfulness may allow people to 
more readily (and flexibly achieve this dynamic balance, potentially even allowing 
individuals to more robustly occupy  an “edge of chaos” regime where Sta bility and 
Plasticity positively interact/correlate. Even more, mindfulness could promote greater 
control through meta -awareness [106], so allowing one to be more effective in 
occupying inter -regimes without falling into one attractor or another. From this 
cybernetic view, mindfulness could be thought of as adaptively/flexibly  stretching the 
region of phase space where adaptively balanced dynamics are possible [107]. 
Theoretically, systems that succeed in approaching this optimality frontier may 
exhibit the hallmarks of self-organized criticality [108]. The dynamic balance between 
order and chaos is characteristic of governance by critical-point attractors, an essential 
property for adaptive systems [109], and a promising avenue for research. Relationships 
may potentially be observable between personality variables and putative metrics of 
criticality in neural measures such as network flexibility [110], critical slowing [108], 
fractal dimension [111], and power-law distributions [112]. These criticality measures 
may exhibit positive correlations with Plasticity as reflecting a general potential for 
adaptive reorganization. [Relationships between criticality and Stability may be best 
11 
accounted for by an inverted-U function (after controlling for Plasticity).] Correlations 
between these criticality measures, personality, and effectively minimizing free 
energy—as indexed by learning ability or positive affect [113]–[116]—could provide 
compelling evidence that “edge of chaos” dynamics may allow for optimality to be 
achieved across multiple regimes, including persons [99], [117] (Fig. 5,6).

6 Conclusions 
In reviewing points of intersection between FEP -AI and CB5T, our intention was to 
provide a general sense for what might be possible for personality modeling. For more 
details, we refer interested readers to a recent book chapter on this topic [1]. The 
potential intersections of personality science with FEP-AI is a complex and deep topic, 
and as such we consider the preceding discussion to be more of a suggestion of 
potentially helpful directions for future work, rather than a definitive statement of 
canonical cross -mappings. More specifically, we believe it could be useful to 
investigate the following hypotheses: 
• The meta -traits of Stability and Personality can be fruitfully applied to 
cybernetic systems at all scales. 
• These meta-traits may have useful functional mappings with neuromodulators 
(understood as kinds of machine learning parameters) such as dopamine and 
serotonin. 
• The identification of two aspects beneath each of the big 5 trait domains 
suggests potentially functionally significant opponent processes (or opposing 
modes of policy selection with respect to coherent organismic/agentic life 
histories). 
• There may be fruitful correspondences between personality aspects and 
tendencies towards minimizing free energy via updating either internal models 
or external world states via respective perception or overt enaction. 
• Understanding self-actualization may help to illuminate the question of what 
tends to be ‘predicted’ overall by systems such as us, with implications for 
both (multi-level) evolutionary theory and the psychology of wellbeing. 
• Computational frameworks such as FEP-AI may be useful for explaining some 
of the cybernetic significances of major personality traits and their 
neurophysiological and behavioral correlates; e.g. neuroticism as sensitivity 
to overall cybernetic entropy, wit h centralized control structures such as the 
anterior cingulate and amygdala potentially acting as expected free energy 
integrators, and also potential sources of intervention for clinical condition (cf. 
loci for deep brain stimulation in depression). 
We chose to discuss this work here because we are in the early stages of 
implementing a major research program inspired by these theories, where we will be 
demonstrating how stable prosocial personalities (as preferences) can be made to 
emerge in AI agents  as the iteratively select policies and update of priors [118]. This 
project will initially be focused on developing architectures and integrative simulation 
environments for the FEP-AI community and personality modelers. However, we will 
expand this research program over the coming years to develop increasingly powe rful 
(and human(ely) -aligned) agents. As such being able to precisely model the 
personalities of these agents may eventually be a matter of more than academic 
importance.
