Abstract 
Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational 
psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that 
underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level 
parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling 
approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling 
affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find 
that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how 
individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying 
symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are inf luenced by increasing cortical noise 
and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-
reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then pr ovide
testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.

INTRODUCTION 
The study of psychiatric disease has traditionally been split across 
a number of sub-disciplines, from the social to the molecular. 1 
Integrating insights from across these disparate levels of expla-
nation has been challenging, in large part because we have lacked 
a language that can translate f indings from different levels into 
a common framework.
2 The field of computational psychiatry 
has sought to provide this framework through well-defined 
mathematical and algorithmic models that can be fit to data from 
various domains, such as neural responses, choice behavior, and 
self-report. Algorithmic processes and free parameters in models 
capturing such processes can generate individual patient-level 
insights, and these processes can simultaneously be mapped 
to the neural systems that implement them. Specifically , free 
parameters in these models can be estimated a t the individual 
patient level, providing an individual-level measure of a given 
latent process. Thus, these models can serve to provide formal 
links between behavioral, neurobiological, phenomenological,
and social findings.
3 One persistent challenge, however, has 
been the adequate representation of core psychiatric phenomena 
within computational models. In this review, we focus on efforts 
to model one complex, but critical, element of human experience 
commonly affected within psychopathology: affect.
4 
Affect is often understood as an individual’s momentary expe-
rience of valence (pleasant/unpleasant) and arousal (high/low). 
While these basic feelings accompany a wide range of other 
experiences, they are a core feature of emotions. Theories of 
emotion vary , but are often associated with specific situational 
causes, cognitions, bodily/interoceptive responses, and observ-
able behaviors (eg, facial expressions, approach-avoidance drives).

A related construct is mood, which typically refers to more sta-
ble, long-term affective states that are influenced by cumulative 
experience. Here we focus on emotions and mood as phenomena 
with affect as a core element, with the understanding that affect 
is a broader category and that there are important differences in 
timescale. We also consider specific emotion categories, as well as 
relevant cognitive and interoceptive components.
5 
One might argue that a true understanding of any cognitive 
process, especially in the context of psychiatric illness, can be 
obtained only when its interaction with affect has been ade-
quately modelled. Indeed, affect is known to influence behav-
ior, thoughts, attention, viscer al states, perception, and decision-
making.
6-8 Executive function is also so closely tied to affect 
that it is often studied as either “cold” (affectively neutral) or 
“hot” (affectively charged).
9,10 For example, negatively valenced 
states with low arousal (boredom) vs. high arousal (eg, frustration) 
have been sho wn to influence experimental results in important
ways.11,12 
Affect is a key feature of many psychiatric illnesses, from 
depressive disorders to the psychosis prodrome. 13,14 Indeed, the 
prevalence of disturbances in affect and mood in schizophre-
nia has been reported to be around 40%
15 a n d u p t o 8 0 % o f 
patients with chronic schizophrenia hav e experienced a depres-
sive episode.
16 Similarly , negative symptoms in schizophrenia are 
characterized by anticipatory anhedonia.17 In addition, reducing 
the negative affect or distress associated with symptoms, beyond 
reduction of the symptoms themselves, has been proposed to be 
one of the driving factors of the efficacy of psychotropics.
18 
In this review, we will discuss previous approaches to mod-
elling affect in computational psychiatry . We will then discuss 
limitations of this work, and use these limitations to highlight the 
potential for further advances. In service of this, we will examine 
the test case of the psychosis prodrome, demonstrating how the 
role of affect can be integrated into a r ecently developed model of
psychotic symptom development.

Literature Review of Affect in Computa tional 
Psychia try
Affect is often assumed to exist because it carries information 
for an organism that is relevant to survival or reproduction. This 
information (eg, regarding the presence or degree of threat, the 
internal states and intentions of others, or the degree to which we 
find ourselves in a favorable environmental state), can be crucial 
for guiding behavior adaptively .19,20 Yet, it can also guide behavior 
maladaptively , such as in the context of psychiatric illness. If 
we consider affect as a carrier of information used to guide 
infer ence and choice (among other internal processes), models 
of the associated computational processes could offer important
insights.
In this section, we will explore several approaches to modelling 
affect. We will begin with reinforcement learning (RL) models, which 
generally focus on appetitive and aversive aspects of affect. In 
this framework, affect is often conceptualized as a way to mod-
ify sensitivity to rewards. We will then discussactive inference,
21 
which further posits that agents aim to reduce their uncertainty 
and maximize their ability to prospectively predict choice out-
comes. This often takes the form of first acting to gain infor-
mation (exploration) and then using that information to achieve 
reward and remain within desired states (exploitation). In active 
inference, it has often been posited that information contained 
within affect assists in inference over both internal and external 
states, and in predicting the likely outcomes of actions. Following 
active inference, we will also discuss a related model widel y
applied to behavioral and neural data, theHierarchical Gaussian
Filter(HGF).
22 
A complementary modelling framework we will consider, drift-
diffusion models (DDMs), focus on sequential sampling for evi-
dence accumulation toward a choice threshold. DDMs incorporate 
parameters reflecting the rate of evidence accumulation (drift 
rate), the starting bias in evidence accumulation, and the distance 
to a decision threshold. Within these models, affect could be 
posited to modify one or more of these and ther eby explain 
individual differences in choice, such as, for example, incorrect 
responses that occur due to impulsi vity (low decision-bound) vs.
exaggerated uncertainty (low drift rate).
In what follows, we aim to give the reader an understanding 
of selected findings and theories in this literature, with a focus 
on models that offer mechanistic insights into the role of affect 
in mental illness. There are several ways that affect and bias 
towards certain affective states can be captured within existing 
modeling frameworks within the processes of learning and infer-
ence. Formalization using computational models could allow us 
to test these ideas directly , and so we review how each of these 
frame works capture the development of affect and affect bias
below.
While this work is not a systematic review, we endeavor to 
provide comments on the strength of the evidence we discuss, as 
well as a summary of the strength of the evidence at the end o f
each modelling review section.
Reinforcement Learning Models 
RL refers to a class of machine learning algorithms that model 
how an agent takes actions, receives feedback in the form 
of rewards or punishment, and adjusts its expectations and 
behaviour to maximize long-term reward.
23 These models have 
long been used to study how individuals adapt their beha viour 
based on feedback from their environment.
24-26 Within the RL 
framework, affect may track specific patterns in the valence 
(reward or punishment) and magnitude of outcomes, which in 
turn affect learning and action selection. Here, the perceived 
magnitude of a rewarding outcome can be parameterized as a 
“reward sensitivity” parameter that scales its objective reward 
value. It has been shown that reduced reward sensitivity a ffects
the learning process of individuals with depression
27 and that 
anhedonia is specifically related to reduced reward sensitivity 
(motivation to act on rewar d), in the absence of altered learning 
rates.28,29 This reduction in reward sensitivity was observed in a 
metanalysis of six datasets with nearly 400 pooled experimental 
sessions, indicating a robust finding. Dopamine agonism has also 
been shown to modify learning rates in healthy individuals.28 
Another line of work has related momentary happiness levels 
to the cumulative impact of recent outcomes and associated 
patterns of surprise. In one study using a simple a gambling 
task, for example, Rutledge et al. (2014) showed that trial-by-
trial self-reported happiness was predominantly associated with 
the r ecent history of positive reward prediction errors (eg, when 
outcomes were repeatedly better than expected) versus expected 
rewards themselves.
30 This was a robust finding, replicated in a 
sample of 18 420 participants. As prediction errors are weighted by 
learning rates in belief updating, biases in learning rates for posi-
tive versus negative outcomes may also bias individuals toward 
positive versus negativ e mood states (eg, by effectively making 
positive surprises consistently str onger or weaker than negative
surprises).
31 
In these models, one proposed role of affect is to bias reward 
sensitivity . Namely , in a more positive mood, rewards will be
International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8| 3
perceived as more rewarding; in a negative mood, punishments 
will feel more punishing. This can be adaptive in helping an organ-
ism track trajectories of change in the environment (eg, seasonally 
changing resources), but it also creates the potential for instability . 
For example, if this biasing effect is too strong, a stable reward 
level can lead to exaggerated positive expectations, followed by 
disappointment and exaggerated negative expectations, followed 
by positive surprise and exa ggerated positive expectations, and 
so on in cyclic fashion. This offers one interesting computational 
mechanism that could contribute to the emotional instability
observed in bipolar or cyclothymic disorders.
31 Stronger effects of 
current mood on perceived outcomes have been observed in those 
with greater mood instability , though this was in a small sample
of 30 people.
32 Current mood has also been shown to influence 
reward learning: in a sample of 120 participants, Bennett et al. 
(2023) have demonstrated that positive affect induction leads 
to higher reward expectations, while negative affect induction 
leads to lower reward expectations.
33 Reward expectation was 
also driven by affect-related shifts in attention. That is, when 
in a positive affective state, individuals paid more attention to 
positive, high value features of the stimuli, while negative emo-
tional states led individuals to pay more attention to negative, 
low-value features. In schizophrenia, negative symptoms have 
been associated with reduced reward-driven learning,
34 reduced 
reward sensitivity ,35 reduced learning on “Go” trials, as well as 
reduced tendency to explore potential actions (corre lated with
anhedonia).
36 These results, demonstrated in sample sizes of 41-
50 patients in each study , may tie together the early appearance 
of depressive symptoms as well as negative symptoms early in 
the psychosis prodrome.14 However, it should be noted that the 
relationship between exploration and schizophrenia is complex. 
In particular, while reductions in directed exploration (ie, directing 
choice toward more uncertain options) have been seen in some 
work (eg, in this study of 108 patients,
37 other work has instead 
shown increased exploration (often via r andom choice strategies) 
in this population.
38 
It is important to note that, while these RL models have 
included a role for positive or negative valence in action selection, 
there is a much wider array of known influences of affect and 
emotion not captured by this approach. T hus, it will be important 
to find ways in which these other influences (eg, on attention, 
viscer al regulation, interpretation biases, etc.) might be included
in extended models (see
39,40). In general, RL frameworks tend to 
model affect as the result of prediction errors related to rewar ds 
and punishment, with affect then shaping sensitivity to rewards.
The reinforcement learning work described above has mostly 
focused on model-free formulations of RL, in which an agent does 
not possess explicit beliefs about state transition probabilities 
(ie, in common variants, it only identifies its current state and 
compares learned values of actions within that state). However, 
there are also model-based formulations of RL in which agents 
can instead plan prospectively by using learned state transi-
tion probabilities. Although computationally costly , this allows 
an agent to simulate expected outcomes under differ ent possible 
action sequences and to select the sequence projected to pro-
vide the greatest long-term reward. There are also models that 
combine model-based and model-free approaches in an a ttempt
to capitalize on the benefits of model-based planning without
increasing computational costs beyond tractable levels.
Unlike model-free RL, less attention to date has been paid to 
potential roles of affect within model-based algorithms. Here, one 
might expect affective states could influence planning processes 
in various ways. For example, high-arousal states might plausibly 
reduce planning horizon (ie, the number of steps into the future 
one simulates) when urgent action is needed. There is also a 
mechanism called aversive pruning, which curtails simulation of 
any branches of a decision tree when large losses on that branch 
are encountered. This can be helpful in keeping planning pro-
cesses focused on action sequences that appear most promising 
when a vailable time is limited. It is possible that negative affec-
tive responses during simulation underpin this pruning process 
and/or that negative affective states amplify sensitivity to this 
effect. Along similar lines, if negative affect down-weights the use 
of model-based processes, this could reduce horizon-dependent
forms of directed exploration and perhaps promote impulsivity .
Although some work has begun to address such questions,
41-44 
this remains an important topic for future w ork.
Related lines of work in RL have also considered the role of 
latent state inference, which can be integrated with both model-
free and model-based algorithms. For example, this work suggests 
that, with sufficient surprise, an otherwise model-free agent could 
infer that the context has changed, despite this change not being 
directly visible (ie, the new context is “latent”). This entails that it 
should abandon its current beliefs about state-action pair values 
and start learning new values from baseline. However, the agent 
can store in memory what it learned about the previous context, 
and immediately begin to use those values if it believes it has 
returned to that context. These models have been helpful in 
accounting for how individuals learn the structure o f different
tasks, as well as explaining affective phenomena such as return of
fear after exposure therapy .
45,46 They also open up the possibility 
that an agent could infer its own emotional states as latent 
states that explain particular patterns of covariance between 
external stim uli, internal stimuli (eg, interoceptive sensations), 
and specific thoughts and motivations (as modeled in
47,48; s e e 
below). This emotional state inference process could also have 
subsequent effects on learning. For example, an agent might first 
infer that it is anxious based on interoceptive cues, and then infer 
that it is in an unsafe context as a result. This could then drive 
c hanges in how it learns from and samples the environment, 
which could in some cases lead to maladaptive e ffects (we will
discuss this further in the section on Active Inference below).
With respect to quality of evidence, many of the RL findings dis-
cussed, such as altered reward sensitivity in anhedonia, have been 
tested and replicated in large sample datasets, speaking to their 
robustness. While larger datasets were found in mood disorder-
focused studies, smaller datasets of roughly 40–100 patients were 
found in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.
Active Inference 
Active inference is a Bayesian theoretical framework that mod-
els the brain as a predictive agent. In perception, active infer-
ence aims to identify interpretations of sensory input that maxi-
mize the predictive accuracy of an internal (generative) model of 
the w orld; in decision making, it aims to predict which actions 
are most likely to generate preferred (ie, rewarding) outcomes.
21 
The drive to reduce uncertainty through information-seeking 
actions (and thereby improve predictions) is a core feature of 
this framework. Due to its comprehensive nature, active inference 
has emerged as an effective framework for modelling affect, 
suggesting that it may arise, at least in part, from the brain’s 
attempt to predict and explain both the world and internal bodily
sensations
48 using an internal generative model. Dysfunctions 
within that generative model can lead to maladaptive affective 
responses in psychopathology , as the brain is unable to accurately 
predict the world or predict and regulate internal sensations.

A conceptual paper by Biddell et al. (2024)50 outlined a theoret-
ical framework based on active inference for how the interaction 
between affective arousal and perception of bodily signals may 
contribute to both emotional awareness and emotion regula-
tion. Specifically , they propose that affect arises from an infer-
ence process where subjective experience and autonomic ar ousal 
jointly guide decision making toward effective means of reducing 
uncertainty . In this conceptualization, autonomic ar ousal tracks
current uncertainty about one’s environment.
51 Arousal coherence 
is then defined as the alignment of subjective experience and 
autonomic arousal. Building on active inference principles, the 
framework posits that the perception of autonomic arousal guides 
belief updating about a ffective states and leads to effective and 
adaptive regulation of those states;
50 that increased coherence 
is linked to well-being. One key limitation of this framework, 
however, is an assumption that the relationship between arousal 
coherence and emotion regulation is consistent, overlooking cases 
where decoupling of autonomic arousal and subjective experi-
ence might act as a temporary protective mechanism, such as in
PTSD.
52 
The above-mentioned framework also broadly aligns with work 
by Hesp et al. (2021),53 who developed a hierarchical active infer-
ence model to demonstrate how a simulated agent might infer the 
valence of its own affective states. A key piece of evidence in this 
affective inference process in their model is an internal observa-
tion of changes in confidence regarding one’s own action model 
(ie, whether predicted action outcomes are likely to be accurate). 
A key suggestion here was that increases and decreases in con-
fidence act as evidence for positively and negatively valenced 
states, respectively , and that these affective states can then act 
as prior beliefs about future confidence levels. This link between 
affect and changes in confidence bears some similarity to the pro-
posals (and evidence) mentioned above within RL that happiness 
levels go up and down based on positive and negative prediction 
errors. Using this model, they simulated a synthetic rat navigating 
a T -maze with positive and negative reinforcement to show the 
resulting behavioral dynamics. They found that affective states 
could allow for more effective use of recent changes in action-
outcome contingencies (eg, quicker changes in behavior after a 
simulated shock), whereas simulated rats without affective states 
would engage in maladaptive behavior (eg, experiencing mor e 
punishments before learning to change strategy). The behavioral 
dynamics are nuanced, however, as negative affect promotes 
random exploratory behavior in the absence of learned habits, but 
instead causes an agent to fall back on ingrained habits (ie, prior 
expectations about one’s own actions) when these are present. 
While unique in positing a role for affect in governing the degree of 
random exploration (and habitual behavior) this proposal is also 
limited as it d oes not incorporate arousal, physiological states,
attention, and other cognitive processes associated with affect
(most notably perhaps is links between affective states, attention,
and modulation of learning rates; eg, as incorporated in
54 and55. 
In a more comprehensive approach, Smith & Lane (2015) 56 
proposed that embodied emotions (emotions involving perception 
of bodily states) are appraised, perceived, and regulated through 
an iterative and hierarchical system operating at different time-
scales (explaining the rapid and slow components of emotional
responses).
56 In this conceptualization, representations of emo-
tionally relevant stimuli could be triggered by either sensation or 
imagined stimuli. When emotionally relevant content is deemed 
to be present, the body’s internal states can be adjusted while 
changes are made to cognitive processes (such as allocation of 
attention). As certain cognitive processes occur more slowly , they 
can then regulate the initial emotional response in a top-down 
manner. Importantly , they map their proposed hierarchical model 
onto a putative neural hierarchy , implicating key regions for inte-
roception and emotion processing, such as the insula and ante-
rior cingulate cortex. Building on this work, they conceptually 
explored individual differences in emotional experience as being
the result of differences in trait emotional awareness (tEA).
57 
Here, tEA refers to a set of factors influencing the perception 
and understanding of emotions: abstractness (linking sensations 
to concepts), granularity (conceptualizing affective states using 
fine-grained emotion concepts), and self-other distinction (the 
capacity to differentiate the emotions of self and others). They 
ar gue that differences in tEA could explain why people experienc-
ing similar affective triggers may have different experiences and
reactions—a concept familiar to any practicing therapist.
Smith et al. (2019)49,58 subsequently explored how active infer-
ence could be used to model emotion conceptualization (ie, the 
process of assigning conceptual meaning to cognitive and bodily 
responses to emotional stimuli). In their formal simulations, an 
agent was specifically modeled as inferring and reporting its emo-
tional states based on both internal (interoceptive,
59 cognitive) 
and external (contextual) cues ,49 where each emotion category 
was mapped to a specific combination of these cues. In this setup, 
when the model was presented with inconsistent inputs, its confi-
dence in classifying the emotion category decreased. When there 
were unpredictable tr ansitions between emotions, the model also 
showed challenges in maintaining stable emotion concepts, lead-
ing to uncertainty and instability in its emotional state
60 (as 
might be seen, eg, in borderline personality disorder). The model 
could also be initialized with prior expectations about its likely 
emotions. If the model started with biased initial beliefs (eg, 
overrepresenting negative emotions), it took longer to recognize 
other emotions (a state similar to depression). Finally , attention 
allocation was crucial; if the model focused more on external cues 
(eg, social context), it developed weaker awareness towards its 
internal cues. For related proposals on emotion-related conceptu-
alization processes and their link to interoception and predictive
processing, see.
61,62 
Motivated by the different proposals described above, Smith 
et al. (2020) (see replication in 5) applied a Bayesian perception 
model to behavioral and electrocardiogram data in patients with 
anxiety , depression, eating disorders, or substance abuse disor-
ders. Relative to a healthy sample, all patient groups showed a 
reduced ability to infer the timing of their own heartbeats in a car-
diac interoceptive task.
63 Here, the model suggested this was due 
to reduced confidence in the cardiac signal, and not due to altered 
prior expectations. This suggested a specific mechanism whereby 
patients might have difficulty using interoceptive information to 
r egulate visceral states or infer their emotional meaning. This is 
a robust finding, demonstrated in 382 patients across diagnosis,
and replicated.
In other work, active inference has been used to model 
approach-avoidance conflict, with increased decision uncertainty 
and altered drives toward affective avoidance d emonstrated in 
those with anxiety , depression, and substance use disorders.64,65 
This was shown in 478 patients with substance and mood 
disorders,64,65 and then replicated, indicating a robust finding.64,65 
In general, active inference approaches can be used to model 
affect as a state determined by internal and external observations, 
and in terms of the conf idence an agent has in their o wn model
of the world.
As evident in this brief review of example approaches, active 
inference (and related Bayesian models of cognition) may offer
International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8| 5
broader resources than current applications of (model-free) RL 
for capturing the multidimensional nature of affect and emotion. 
However, empirical tests directly comparing these approaches to 
capture emotional dynamics remain to be done. 66 This will be 
an important direction for future work, as will increasing the 
number of studies which examine longitudinal trajectories of 
computational parameters.67 
Overall, with respect to quality of evidence, the active inference 
literature currently suffers from a lack of empirical validation and 
replication. Despite this, a few studies have demonstra ted effects 
in large samples, some of which ha ve also been replicated.
A Note on Potential Biological Implementations 
of Active Inference
In addition to work on the neural basis of other modeling 
approaches mentioned above, it is also worth considering the 
potential neural underpinnings of active inference processes. 
Here, it is first important to note that, as active inference is a 
more recently proposed framework, fewer studies on its neural 
basis have been carried out to date. There are also some additional 
subtleties necessary to consider. First, active inference models 
incorporate a number of elements, including variational message 
passing in perceptual updating, Bayesian learning (typically using 
Dirichlet-categorical models), and use of expected free energy 
as a cost function; and not all of these elements are relevant 
to modeling all tasks. For example, perceptual updating does 
not play a role when modeling most reward learning tasks, and 
expected free energy does not play a role in many perception 
tasks. A related subtlety is that, when applied to a given task, 
the predictions made by active inference can o verlap with 
those made by other models; for example, expected free energy 
decomposes into a value function that motivates exploration 
and exploration, similar to reinforcement learning models that 
incorporate upper confidence bound terms or other information 
bonus heuristics, and other models of perception also incorporate 
Bayesian updating. So clarifying what the unique predictions are 
of active inference is often subtle and relative to the specific
choice of task and generative model (for a systematic comparison
between active inference and reinforcement learning when
applied to a three-armed bandit task, see
44). 
With these complexities in mind, there have been a couple 
empirical studies directly testing relationships between active 
inference and neural responses measured by functional MRI 
(fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). For example , one fMRI
study by
68 found that neural activity in both the midbrain and 
several fronto-parietal network hub regions was associated with 
precision updates on action selection, based on an early version 
of active inference that was fit to behavioral data on a risk-
taking task. An EEG study by
59 also found that posterior neural 
responses were associated with a sensory precision parameter, 
while frontal responses were associated with prior expectations 
and learning rates when an active inference-based perception 
model was fit to behavior on an interoception task. A number 
of other simulation studies have further illustra ted how active 
inference can reproduce fMRI and EEG responses previously 
observed in relation to w orking memory , conscious perception,
and expectation violation, among others.
21,69,70 These simulations 
are based on the hypothesis that measured neural responses 
reflect the rate of change in variational free energy (similar to 
prediction error) during perceptual updating. This and other 
simulation work supports biological plausibility , but are otherwise 
limited in the specific evidence they provide for active inference. 
Also , while some fairly general illustrations have been presented 
regarding how patterns of connections within idealized cortical
columns could plausibly implement the update equations in
active inference,
71 no detailed hypotheses have been tested 
to date regarding possible micro- or macro-scale realizations 
in the brain (eg, more biologically detailed columnar circuitry , 
possible links between cortical regions and state representation, 
or between expected free energy and striatal regions, etc.). Thus, 
considerable animal neural recording and human fMRI work 
remains to be done, ideally based on tasks designed to distinguish 
the predictions of active inference from other related models.
The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter 
The HG F22 is a Bayesian model with links to other Bayesian 
approaches, such as active inference. Like in active inference, it 
assumes that agents model the causes of their sensory input and 
try to predict the inputs they will receive. Its hierarchical nature 
allows for the modelling of different levels of beliefs about sensory 
input and uncertainty about this input. As an example of this, we 
will discuss the modelling of the conditioned hallucinations task. 
In this task, participants learn a Pavlovian association between 
a visual and an auditory stimulus during the presentation of 
v arying levels of auditory noise. They can then hallucinate the 
presence of the auditory stimulus when the visual stimulus is 
presented, but no auditory stimulus is. These “conditioned hal-
lucinations” are increased in people with auditory hallucinations
and with psychosis proneness in the general population and
track hallucination severity over time.
72-74 The HGF applied to 
behavioral data for this task has three levels of beliefs. The first 
tracks whether the participant believes that the auditory stimulus 
was present; the second tracks the association between the visual 
and auditory stimulus; and the third tracks the perceived volatility 
(instability) of the association between the auditory and visual 
stimuli. In addition to these levels, there is a parameter that tracks 
the relative weighting of expectations (known as prior beliefs, or 
priors) and sensory observations. In general in Bayesian models, 
when priors (or other sources of information) are mor e precise (eg, 
more certain or held with greater confidence),they are given more 
weight in perceptual decisions. Using this modelling approach, 
hyper-precise priors have been shown to drive conditioned hallu-
cinations, and have been directly associated with neuroimaging.
72 
The HGF has also widely been used to model behavior in 
various reversal learning tasks. Studies repeatedly show that 
psychotic-like experiences and positive symptoms were associ-
ated with increased perception of environmental volatility across 
social and non-social domains. For example, in social learning 
tasks, where participants need to infer the intentions of a confed-
erate or an avatar, higher environmental volatility was associated
with paranoid ideation,
75,76 and shown to be higher in patients 
with schizophrenia.77 While these effects were demonstrated in 
small patient samples and moderate (n = 151) general popula-
tion samples, they were shown across the psychosis spectrum. 
Similarly , higher environmental v olatility in non-social tasks was 
associated with delusional ideation in non-clinical and with pos-
itive symptoms in a clinical sample.
78 These findings were again 
shown in those with schizotypal traits in a large online sample 
as well as in 100 patients with schizophrenia, suggesting valid-
ity a cross the psychosis spectrum. Interestingly , the HGF has 
been associated with specific types of affect.
79-81 For example, 
expected volatility in the environment (and prior expectations 
about how volatility will change over time) has been associated 
with subjective stress levels,
51 and more anxious individuals have 
shown different patterns of neural responses in the insula linked 
to prediction uncertainty .
82 Related approaches have also shown
6 | International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8
that anxiety is linked to greater tendencies to infer categorical 
changes in the hidden context (latent hidden states) generat-
ing observations,83 following on a prior body of work suggesting 
learning rates are greater, and less flexible, in those with higher 
anxiety . Within the Bayesian inference framework, and evidenced 
by the update equations of the HGF , greater learning rates can 
arise from both greater expected volatility or underestimations of 
sensory or observational noise. Once accounting for both in one 
model, higher schizotypal traits still relate to higher uncertainty 
about the environmental volatility , while subclinical symptoms 
related to depression and anxiety , as well as negative symptoms of 
patients with schizophrenia, are associated with reduced learning
about the reliability of sensory information.
78 Taken together, this 
suggests that while psychotic symptoms are linked with issues 
in building more abstract statistical models of the environment, 
supported by cortical areas, negative affect is linked to misesti-
mation of outcome uncertainty leading to greater expectations 
that the environment will change unpredictably over time, due to 
an aberrant bottom-up signal. Theoretically , this is quite sensible, 
as, if greater negative affect is taken as a sign that one’s current 
model is inaccurate (ie, due to repeated prediction errors in a 
changing environment), it will be optimal to increase trust in new
observations and update beliefs more quickly ,
84 allowing one’s 
model to once again reflect an accurate representation of the 
current environment and reduce the associated negative affect. 
However, if this uncertainty cannot be reduced (perhaps due to the 
source of uncertainty being within the observer rather than in the 
environment, which can at least be sampled differently to reduce 
uncertainty), this may sustain negative affect. This will be crucial 
in our discussion of the psychosis prodrome below. As such, the 
HGF can be used to model affect as a function of (potentially
inaccurate) perceived uncertainty about the environment.
Overall, compared to the RL literature, HGF models have been 
validated in a relatively smaller number of participants across 
existing studies; however, they ha ve been shown to generate 
consistent findings across m ultiple illness severity categories.
A Note on Assumptions Made in the Bayesian 
(Activ e Inference and the HGF) Approaches
The HGF and active inference models rest on explicit Gaussian 
and variational assumptions that yield analytically convenient 
prediction error updates. While the drive to minimise expected 
uncertainty provides a compelling unifying principle, its explana-
tory power is contingent on ho w prior preferences are speci-
fied and on empirical demonstration that epistemic value guides 
action selection, rather than merely correlating with it.
22,85 
At a technical level, both the HGF and active inference for-
mulations begin with a generative model that is hierarchically 
factored: hidden states at each level (x1, x2, . . . ) evolve as coupled 
Gaussian random walks whose log variances govern volatility , 
and outcomes are generated via sigmoid or softmax observa-
tion models. The HGF makes two further approximations: (1) 
posterior beliefs are factorised and represented by their suffi-
cient statistics (means and precisions), and (2) updates follow 
a first order Taylor expansion, yielding precision weighted pre-
diction error terms that are computationally tractable. Active 
infer ence inherits these assumptions but augments the gener-
ative model with actions (
π) whose prior probabilities are set 
by minimising expected free energy (G). Crucially , G decomposes 
into an epistemic term (expected information gain) and a value 
term (expected utility), providing a normative solution to the 
exploration-exploitation trade off. Proponents argue that, because 
any agent that maintains its structural integrity must resist long 
term surprise (eg, finding itself in a state that would be incon-
sistent with its survival), minimising expected uncertainty is a 
biologically plausible imperative that unifies perception, learning,
and action.
86 Empirically , both neural data (eg, precision weighted 
PE signals in EEG/fMRI) and behaviour (systematic information 
seeking in volatile environments) are captured b y models that 
embed an epistemic drive, lending support to this view.68,87-89 
Nevertheless, several critiques deserve mention. First, without 
explicit priors over preferred states, the fr ee-energy principle risks 
unfalsifiability—the well-known dark-room objection.
90 Second, 
organisms occasionally select actions that increase short term 
uncertainty—for example, curiosity driven exploration or risk 
seeking under affecti ve load—behaviours that appear inconsis-
tent with a simple “uncertainty reduction” proposal.
91 Active 
inference accounts accommodate these cases only if epistemic 
value is allowed to dominate pragmatic value transiently , or if 
higher order priors encode preference for novelty . Third, alter-
native normative frameworks (eg, expected utility or KL control 
formulations) explain many of the same phenomena without 
appealing to global surprise minimisation, implying that uncer-
tainty reduction may be a consequence rather than a cause of
adaptive behaviour.
92 
Drift-Diffusion Models 
Roberts and Hutcherson (2019) reviewed the literature test-
ing affective influences o n decision making mechanisms 
within DDMs.93 Four parameters are usually estimated in DDM 
paradigms. The first is drift rate, which represents the speed 
at which information accumulates towards a certain decision 
threshold. In one study , those with high anxiety were found 
to show a higher drift rate towards recognizing threatening 
words, even when the valence of the w ord was irrelevant to
the task.
94 This suggests they treated the threatening stimuli 
as carrying a more reliable signal. The second core parameter 
is the decision threshold, which represents the point at which 
enough evidence has been collected to make a decision. A 
higher decision threshold can lead to more cautious (and slower) 
decisions by favoring accuracy over speed.
93 note the complexity 
of how affect might influence decision threshold. On the one 
hand, negative feedback could increase decision thresholds (ie, 
making behavior more cautious on subsequent trials). However, 
other negative experiences, such as anger, might instead decrease 
decision threshold and make behavior more impulsive. The third 
parameter in DDMs is the initial bias, whic h starts evidence 
accumulation closer to one decision threshold than the other. 
Here, one suggestion is that simple affective priming effects 
could bias this starting point in favor of congruent affective
responses.
95 The last parameter is non-decision time, which 
represents the time required for sensory/perceptual processing 
of the stimuli and action initiation (ie, processes unrelated 
to the decision itself). In this case, arousal levels associated 
with different emotional states, such as anxiety ,
96 may affect 
sensory/perceptual processing time, m odifying non-decision 
time .
93 There is also evidence that drift rates may have direct 
clinical correlates. For example, in 100 undergraduates, Pe et al. 
(2013) found that specific symptoms (rumination) were associated 
with greater drift rate for negative stimuli, potentially linked to 
negative attentional biases.
97 
While simple to use, responsive to affective states, and ma p-
pable to neurobiological processes, 98-100 it is important to high-
light that standard DDM approaches are also limited in a number 
of ways. For example, they do not directly model affect; rather, 
parameter estimates from the model can be correlated with (or
International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8| 7
experimentally modified) by affect in different contexts. In addi-
tion, they are restricted to decision-making contexts (though they 
can be generalized beyond binary decisions)101 and not designed 
to model a number of other cognitive or perceptual processes 
relevant to affect.
Overall, the drift diffusion models reviewed here have been 
validated in moderate sample sizes, but in large part within 
healthy populations. Further work applying these models to dif-
ferent diagnostic groups would be helpful to further v alidate this
approach.
Having reviewed a number of example models and represen-
tative findings related to the role of affect in computational 
psychiatry , we will now consider progress, challenges, and future 
directions for this field. This will serve as a summary which will 
inform our extension of an existing model of psychotic symptom 
development to include affective components; this model exten-
sion comprises the second half of this paper, and serves as an 
example of future directions for affective research in computa-
tional psychiatry .
A note on the relationship computational perspectives the 
broader emotion theory liter ature:
It is also worth considering how our proposal relates to broader 
work on emotion theory within the psychology literature. While 
comprehensive discussion of this literature is beyond the scope 
of the present r eview, a few prominent perspectives are especially 
noteworthy . One such example is appraisal theories,
102,103 which 
broadly propose that affective responses (eg, changes in bodily 
responses, changes in motivation) are related to a series evalua-
tions regarding one’s current situation (or past and possible future 
situations). Although differing somewhat between specif ic pro-
posals,
104 some examples of appraisal dimensions might include 
relevance to current concerns, consistency with norms and val-
ues, and congruency with current goals, among others. In causal 
appraisal theories in particular, it is assumed that appraisals 
cause these affective responses, which are in some way prepara-
tory for the expected actions necessary to address the situations 
in question. The experience of emotion then reflects an inte-
gration of motivational and physiological responses with those 
appraisals to form a combined central representation. Another
prominent perspective comes from constructivist theories,
61,105 
which first propose “core affect” as a 2D space of experience com-
posed of valence and arousal, and then posit that the experience 
of specific emotions depends on a whole-brain conceptualization 
process in which core affect and other elements of the specific 
experience are identified as corresponding to an emotion category 
learned from past experience. This theory focuses less on the pro-
cesses that generate valence and arousal responses, as emotions 
proper do not arise prior to conceptualization. This contrasts with 
older “basic emotion” views that assume the brain instead comes 
innately equipped with circuitry for generating a specific set of 
emotions, such as fear, rage, happiness, etc. that are common
across all mammals.
106,107 
The computational perspectives reviewed above may not have 
a clear mapping to these traditional theories; nor do they include 
models of many processes included in those theories. This is 
important in and of itself, as it highlights that existing com-
putational models of affect are incomplete. On the other hand, 
there are a few points of connection worth highlighting. First, 
broadly speaking, beliefs about the volatility of, and expected 
noise in, the current environment could be thought of as types 
of appraisals. These “appraisals” also do create prior biases in 
cognition, as expected under different affective states. Another 
point of contact is the assumption of Bayesian inference by the 
HGF and active inference, which can be seen as a constructivist
process. Indeed, some simulation work using active inference has
specifically modeled emotion conceptualization processes
58,108 
and highlighted natural ways in which the valence dimension 
of core affect may naturally emerge in these models.
53 Beyond 
these very coarse-grained similarities, however, it is unclear how 
consistent current computational models are with one emotion 
theory vs. another. Going forward, it will be necessary to build 
and test computational models that incorporate more elements of 
emotion theories in psychology (appraisals; modulation of physi-
ological, cognitive, and motivational responses; conceptualization 
and linguistic processes, etc.). Looked at from this perspective, one 
could likely build computational instantiations of several differ-
ent theories of emotion and would need to test each empirically . It 
appears unlikely one should instead expect all aspects of emotion 
to emerge naturally out of foundational computational theories 
themselves . Answering these questions represents an important
direction for future work.
Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions in 
Computational Models of Affect
Recent advances in computational psychiatry have significantly 
enhanced our understanding of affective processes in psychiatric 
disorders. We identify three key strengths in the current literature. 
First, affect and mood are increasingly recognized as contextual 
factors that dynamically alter both current and future expec-
tations, directly impacting learning and decision-making pro-
cesses.
49,58,63,93 This perspective represents a major step forward 
in linking affective states with cognitive and behavioral outcomes 
in a systematic and quantifiable manner. Second, computational 
models have effectively captured the interplay between internal 
experiences and reactions to environmental stimuli, highlight-
ing how individuals may differentially process the same exter-
nal events depending on their internal emotional states and
tEA.
50,56 This interplay suggests a personalized dimension to emo-
tion processing, with implications for conditions such as depres-
sion and sc hizophrenia, where interoceptive disturbances hav e
been observed.
63,109 Third, the literature has begun to integrate 
both state- and trait-like dimensions of affect, providing a more 
nuanced understanding of short-term affecti ve fluctuations ver-
sus stable individual differences in emotional experience.
49,57 
Despite these promising advances, several challenges remain. 
Current models have yet to fully integrate social and contextual 
influences on affect-driven learning and belief updating, limiting 
their applicability to real-world phenomena. Social cognition— 
including trust, cooperation, and emotional conta gion—remains 
underexplored, despite compelling theoretical work suggesting 
that social reinforcement and feedback significantly shape
affective processing.
49,57,58,110 Computational models have largely 
focused on individual decision-making in isolated contexts, 
neglecting the interactive and interpersonal dimensions of affect 
regulation. Another key limitation is the oversimplification 
of affect as a unidimensional (positive–negative continuum) 
construct. In addition, most models and experiments to date 
do not capture the longer-term temporal fluctuations of affect, 
which are dynamically shaped by prior experiences, uncertainty , 
and environmental context. Active inference models have begun 
addressing this issue by considering affect as arising within a 
hierarchical inference process that updates over time, yet the 
interactions between affective states, interoception, and social 
context require further refinement and empirical validation. We 
argue that comparing RL and active infer ence within a unified
framework presents a promising direction for future research.

There is a significant opportunity to use models incorporating 
affect to explore sex differences in the expression and treatment 
of psychiatric symptoms.112,113 The influence of changing hor-
mone levels on cognition and affect throughout the female repro-
ductive lifecycle has often been either ignored or perceived as an 
unwanted source of variance, even though hormones have signifi-
cant neurobiological effects.114 This has led to biased recruitment, 
and a lack of understanding of how hormonal fluctuations can 
influence affectiv e symptoms, such as in the premenstrual dys-
phoric syndrome.115-117 Computational modelling of the dynamic 
interplay between affect, symptoms and hormones in females can 
therefore not only importantly inform future treatment develop-
ment studies but can also serve as an excellent use-case for devel-
oping tools that are sensitive e nough to capture subtle changes in 
affect o ver long time periods.
Taking these strengths and limitations into consideration, one 
key area for further advancement is in understanding the role 
of affect in longitudinal modifications of individuals’ models of 
the world. The seeds of this are present in the current literature. 
For example, in a reinforcement learning context, pathological 
negative affective states may promote biased reward expecta-
tions, which can in turn lead to choices that reflect these (mal-
adaptive) expectations. Howe ver, we argue that the current use 
of affect is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and that the role of 
affect in shaping perception and explanatory models—for exam-
ple, the form and content of prior beliefs that may drive psychotic
symptoms
2,72,118-120—may be more nuanced. In order to illustrate 
this, and provide examples of how consideration of affective 
states can be integrated into future computational psychiatry 
research, we will now turn to a conceptual model that illus-
trates a putative role for affect in the development of psychotic
symptoms.
Potential Role of Affect in the Psychosis Symptom 
Dev elopment and the Prodr omal Period
The earliest phases of psychosis constitute an affectively charged 
period. Retrospective studies of prodromal symptoms observed 
that depressive symptoms often emerge first, followed b y negative 
symptoms, and then by attenuated psychosis symptoms.14,121-123 
Delusional mood,124,125 a sense of enhanced significance in the 
environment that needs explanation, occurs often prior to the 
development of frank delusions, whic h themselves tend to be neg-
atively affectively valenced.
126,127 Finally , both people with clinical 
psychosis and those at high risk for psychosis are known to have 
increased sensitivity to str essful events, suggesting a phenotype 
of affective vulnerability .
127,128 As such, from the earliest phases 
of the prodrome to frank psychosis, there is a prominent role of 
affective symptomatology . Despite this, computational accounts 
of psychosis development have not comprehensively addressed 
the role o f affect in a longitudinal sense. Here, we will attempt to 
extend our recent model of psychotic symptom development
2 to 
include an affective dimension, more full y encompassing known 
phenomenology .
Our model posits that the development of psychosis begins 
with increased cortical noise due to neurobiological factors such 
as NMDA receptor dysfunction. This increased cortical noise leads 
to aberrant prediction error signalling and impaired capacity 
of the brain to communicate and incorporate new information 
effectively . This intrinsic source of noise provides the germ for 
delusional belief formation, which has previousl y been linked
to aberrant prediction error signalling (see
2,129,130). From this 
point, multiple routes towards psychotic symptoms may be 
possible.
One possibility is that this biologically generated noise 
leads the brain to overestimate noise within sensory signals 
generated by the environment. If so, sensory inputs would be 
treated as unreliable sources of information, leading to a relative 
up-weighting of prior beliefs and slow learning (eg, one would be 
more likely to perceive what is expected). This increased weight 
on prior beliefs is consistent with results of multiple studies using
the conditioned hallucination task.
72-74 When making decisions, 
this high expected noise would also reduce confidence in one’s 
model’s ability to generate desired outcomes, corresponding to 
negative affect as posited within the active inference framework 
(as described above). In other words, the agent would experience 
negative affect because it infers it is not able to improve its ability 
to predict and control sensory input through action.
An alternative possibility is that this biologically generated 
noise is mistakenly treated as signal (ie, as though it is reliable). 
In this case, instead of overestimating environmental noise, it 
would instead be forced to explain this input by inferring the state 
of the world is constantly changing (ie, it would form the belief 
that environmental contingencies are highly unstable/volatile). 
This inference that the world is ever-changing would entail a 
down-weighting of prior beliefs and fast learning. In other wor ds, 
the model would begin to overfit to noisy biological signals and 
show unstable fluctuations in beliefs over time. This is consistent 
with other work suggesting overfitting of visual and somatosen-
sory/proprioceptive sensory input in psychosis (eg, alterations in
visual pursuit and force-matching, among others; see
131). Even 
in this case, however, over longer timescales one might expect 
higher levels of processing to infer these constantly shifting 
beliefs are not effective at explaining sensory data and that this 
data may in fact be less reliable than initially estimated. This is 
speculative, but could represent a more indirect route to even-
tually down-weighting sensory signals and up-weighting prior
beliefs.
Thus, one might assume that under both possibilities the 
longer-term result is a reduced reliance on sensory signals and a 
relative increase in reliance on prior beliefs. This compensatory 
increase in dependence on prior beliefs would then set the stage 
for frank psychosis. Specifically , psychosis onset could represent 
the point at which over -weighted (hyper-precise) priors finally 
overwhelm the corrective influence of sensory information, 
which had, until then, prevented these priors from generating
threshold-level percepts.
118,119 Under this model, the attenuated 
psychotic symptoms seen in the prodrome would simply be 
caused by a less severe v ersion of the imbalance between priors 
and sensations pr esent during frank psychosis.
While this model does explain many of the observ ations in psy-
chosis phenomenology (see132 and2 for discussion), it does have 
limitations. First, it does not address the early development of 
negative symptoms, of which affective symptoms are an integral 
component. Second, it does not address the cause of the valenced 
nature of delusions and hallucinations. To address these gaps, we 
add an affective component to the model below. This extension is
summarized in
Figure 1. 
Extension to Cortical Noise and N egative 
Symptoms 
First, we link the early increase in cortical noise to the develop-
ment of negative symptoms, which have recently been shown 
to correlate with computational measures of low-level noise.
78 
Cortical noise and the degeneration of grey matter 133 and white 
matter tracts 134,135 would lead to degradation in communica-
tion between cortical regions, in addition to bottom-up signal

Figure 1. Negative belief–emotion spiral: Within our Bayesian conceptualization of the prodrome, expectations (priors) form the lens by which 
incoming evidence (observations) is interpreted. Negative affect may , via negatively valencing expectations, increase the precision on negative 
observations and limit sampling of corrective, positive observations (via aberrant, negatively biased exploration; middle of figure). In addition, 
increased cortical noise is expected to flatten overall likelihood precision, limiting the corrective influence of the environment, driving negative affect, 
and leading to increased strength of (negatively valenced) priors. Negative interpretations may subsequently reinforce negative beliefs, further biasing 
future expectations and interpretations. Over time, beliefs crystallize, shaping negatively valenced delusions and hallucinations. Negative 
affect–isolation spiral: Negative affect may also inhibit social engagement and underlie negative conceptualizations of one’s sociability . This would 
result in outward symptoms of loneliness, difficulty feeling one can relate to or be understood by others, social defeat, and even limited social 
expression. Biopsychosocial underpinnings of negative affect: Negative affect likely stems from biological (degradation o f cortical signals, 
disconnection of emotion areas), information processing (eg, perceived environmental instability , greater expected noise , deficits in interoception) and 
social (eg, isolation) factors.
degradation that we have already tied to aberrant prediction error 
signaling. This can account for the distributed changes in mul-
tiple brain networks seen in negative symptoms.
136 This neural 
dysfunction has been shown to affect areas relev ant to reward 
processing,
137 consistent with an RL approach to understanding 
negative symptoms in terms of reduced rew ard sensitivity and 
reward-driven learning.34,35 As such, anhedonia and avolition in 
negative symptoms can be conceptualized as a reduction in the 
integrity of reward processing. We discuss reduced expression 
of emotions in the section on social withdrawal. The proposed 
d ysfunction in communication between brain regions also has 
important implications for affect dysregulation, a s we argue in
the following section.
Noise and Negativ e Affect 
We propose that neural signal degradation, which initially results 
in the formation of negative symptoms, also plays a role in 
the development of a negatively valenced state during the 
prodrome. This likely underlies the development of negatively
10 | International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8
valenced hallucinations and delusions and would be consistent 
with the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia, 138 which 
posits large scale dysconnectivity between frontal and temporal 
regions underlying the illness. We argue that this dysconnectivity 
could lead to negative affect via dysfunction of emotion-
related regions,
139 such as the insula and amygdala, which 
also underlie key psychosis symptoms , such as paranoia and
hallucinations.
72,140,141 In addition, increased perception of 
environmental instability (parametrized as volatility) during 
delusion formation can be pointed to as a potential source 
of negative (eg, fearful, uneasy) affect,
142 which could then be 
incorporated into the delusional belief.
Negative Belief-Emotion Spir al 
Consistent with the computational models described above, this 
negative affective state may cause the observed increase in sen-
sitivity to stresses experienced in daily life seen in the high
risk state
143 by continually biasing future expectations. Increased 
stress sensitivity creates a negative filter on information pro-
cessing that may further reinforce negative beliefs and privilege 
negative observations. In an active inference framework, we might 
model this stress sensitivity as an increased precision (or learning 
rate) on negatively valenced observ ations. This would be present 
especially in the context of overall reduced sensory pr ecision (ie,
greater expected noise in environmental signals)
73 or increases 
in expected environmental instability (volatility) early in the pro-
drome. This would then lead to an uncertain, fearful, and uneasy 
affective state that is potentially discordant with actual signals 
from the environment–in o ther words, delusional mood.
This interplay between affect and unusual beliefs is bi-
directional, and it will extend through time. Negative beliefs 
will reinforce the negative affective state, and negative affect 
will reinforce negative beliefs. The observations present in the 
environment that might normally rescue this negative belief-
emotion spiral (such as positive events or pleasant interactions 
with friends and family) are then limited in their ability to do 
so, as they are experienced with reduced precision, and may 
be sampled less extensively due to potentially reduced levels of 
dir ected exploration (ie, selecting more uncertain options) caused 
by negative symptoms. This is in keeping with greater confidence 
in (likely negatively valenced) prior beliefs and consequent 
discounting of mood-incongruent sensory information. In fact,
it has been observed empirically that individuals with psychosis
show reduced levels of directed exploration,
37 but increased levels 
of random exploration. 38 This is consistent with some other 
studies (but not all) suggesting greater negative affect is linked 
to lower directed exploration (reviewed in
144). It is also notable 
that the active inference framework discussed above specifically 
predicts both lower directed exploration (ie, less dependence 
on expected free energy) and greater random exploration (more 
noisy , value-independent choice) in those with greater negative
affect.
The Development of Valenced Positive Symptoms 
and Social Withdraw al
Psychotic beliefs formed in the context of negative affect, and the 
privileging of negatively valenced information and internal states, 
can jointly account for the specifically negative valence of hallu-
cinations and delusions in clinical populations. This belief forma-
tion occurs in the context of cortical signal degeneration (see
2) 
and with a reduction in cognitive flexibility .145,146 The longer this 
process persists, the stronger these priors become, and the less 
viable the alternative models of the w orld—resulting in the devel-
opment of (negatively valenced) crystallized false beliefs.
119,147 
This would explain why longer durations of untreated psychosis 
and more insidious symptom onset is associated with worsened 
outcome in schizophrenia.
121,148,149 
Interestingly , reduced neural pathology in healthy voice 
hearers compared to patients with schizophrenia has been
observed.
150 Under our model, this should result in less of the sig-
nal degradation and uncertainty that drives negative affect. This 
would then r esult in less negatively valenced hallucinations—a 
finding consistently observed in this population.
151 
One additional symptom that may be better explained by 
this updated model is social withdrawal. An initial sense of 
fearfulness or uncertainty might increase aversion to wards
social engagement.152-154 This would be consistent with the RL 
findings discussed above, which showed aberr ant exploration 
under uncertainty in negative symptoms, 36 and with other 
work linking alterations in exploration with negative affect 
and psychopathology more broadly . 42,47,144,155,156 In addition, 
consistent with RL modelling of negative symptoms, social 
anhedonia may cause increased social isolation,
154 potentially 
as a result of reductions in reward sensitivity .35,157 In line with the 
active inference frameworks described above, the person experi-
encing these symptoms would additionally observe themselves 
being less social, and enter self-states of loneliness, depression, 
social defeat, or social exclusion, further disincentivizing social 
interaction. In addition, from our clinical experience discussing 
with patients, the strange nature of their experiences of the 
world- such as subthreshold positive symptoms- may lead them 
to infer that other people will not understand them, reducing the 
perceived value—or increasing the perceived risk—of attempting 
to communicate these experiences. While speculative, this 
negatively biased conceptualisation of their social situation could 
underlie reduced emotional expression in negative symptoms, 
a phenomenon previously observed in schizophrenia, wher e
individuals show reduced expression despite similar felt emotions
(ie, reduced amplification of felt emotions)
158; for example, if 
I believe that I am isolated from others, or that they may be 
a r i s k t o m e , a n d I h a v e a r e d u c e d p e r c e p t i o n o f t h e v a l u e o f 
social interaction, I may be more likely not to place effort into 
making my emotions explicit (given that the goal of this is to 
facilitate interpersonal interaction). Recent work has begun to 
link altered learning under uncertainty in social contexts to 
negative symptoms, reinforcing the idea that negative symptoms
result at least in part from an impaired understanding of social
situations.
75 
The self-reinforcing cycle of isolation would likely further 
degrade the amount and quality of contradictory information in 
the environment, reducing the stim uli which could counteract the 
growing prior hyper-precision.147 Indeed, this reduction in directed 
exploratory behavior with negative affect is precisely what is 
suggested by the activ e inference approaches discussed abo ve
(eg,53). These continuously increasing maladaptive prior beliefs 
would likely incorporate these observations as they are formed. 
This would explain the themes of self-deprecation, isolation fr om, 
and potentially of persecution by , others that are common in
delusions and hallucinations.
It should be noted, however, that positive and negative symp-
toms do not necessarily co-occur, with positive symptoms tend-
ing to fluctuate more than negative symptoms, and that dif-
ferent computational correlates of negative vs. positive symp-
toms have been observed,78 which may call into question a role 
for negative symptoms and their associated low-level noise in
International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8| 11
the generation of positive symptoms. While this requires further 
longitudinal study , we suggest that this may be related to a 
separation in time. The low-level noise that generates negative 
symptoms is likely present prior to and regardless of whether 
positive symptoms are generated, but this noise provides the 
conditions in which negatively valenced priors can form, with 
these priors then driving hallucinations and delusional convic-
tion independently of negative symptoms and low-level noise. 
Vice versa, negatively valenced priors may well form in other 
ways which are not associated with the presence of negative 
symptoms; longitudinal studies of symptom de velopment with
computational phenotyping would be required in order to identify
these groups.
Formalizing the Addition of Affect 
Affect would be added to this model formally in two components: 
a trait-like component, which would be roughly equivalent to the 
clinical definition of mood, and a state-like component, represent-
ing sensitivity to environmental cues and momentary affect (as 
discussed in the sections above). Each component could be fur-
ther resolved into emotion networks composed of different posi-
tive and negative emotions, which would likely hav e differential 
activations dependent on factors such as premorbid personality 
and traumatic experiences. This would help account for the fact 
that delusions and hallucinations often contain content that is
emotionally relevant to the individual’s premorbid context, such
as trauma.
159,160 In addition, it would be expected that the precise 
content of the eventual psychotic phenomena would depend on 
the precise affective context present during development. For 
example, sad and self-critical states during the prodrome would 
be expected to give rise to critical and self-de precating halluci-
nations; and more fearful or anxious affect might be expected to 
give rise to more par anoid beliefs and hallucinations. In addition,
previous work
161 has suggested that finding meaning through 
the construction of delusional narrati ves (“apophany” in classic 
phenomenology ,
125 and coincident with prior hyper-precision in 
our model), in the context of preceding states of uncertainty and 
lack of trust in the world, can be associated with more positive
emotions.
We would expect that parameters representing these compo-
nents would change in value over time, with negative affective 
states strengthening across the prodromal period. Additionally , 
we would expect reciprocal reinforcement between the trait- and 
state-like components, due to the negative belief-emotion spiral, 
making both relevant from a treatment planning perspective. 
In addition, we might expect to be able to d ecompose the 
state-like component to include an interoceptive dimension, 
consistent with both the active inference literature described 
above connecting interoceptive deficits with psychopathology
and previous demonstration of somatic sensation alterations
in schizophrenia.
162,163 Consistent with the Smith et al mod-
els described above, deficits in interoceptive inference may 
reduce the ability of patients developing psychosis to interpret, 
understand, and regulate their own emotions- making it both 
more difficult to regulate dysregulated affect, and increasing 
the uncertainty about the source of negative affect, which may 
further increase the need for highly precise, negatively v alenced
priors to “explain” the presence of the negative affect.
Modelling these affective components separately may be 
relevant for treatment planning, as temporary alleviation 
of affective state may not be effective as a treatment if a 
“reservoir” of negative affectivity in the trait-like c omponent 
(perhaps driven by maladaptively highly-precise priors which 
are difficult to update with low-precision observations
73) 
will simply re-establish the negative state-like component in 
short ord er.
While this model would explain several phenomenological 
observations, in order to establish its validity it would be helpful 
to have specific predictions. Several of these are included 
below. Crucially , if validated through longitudinal computational 
phenotyping studies which can assess the temporal order 
of events with respect to changes in information process-
ing, this model would provide a staging framework for the 
psychosis prodrome. Stages and parameter estimates at each 
stage (eg, the strength of a n individual’s current prior beliefs) 
could be correlated with neurobiological signatures, and these 
neurobiologically-validated computational measures could then 
help identify novel treatment avenues and serve as biomarkers
of illness progression and eventually as predictors of treatment
effectiveness.
One area where this computationally-informed model of affect 
could have immediate and practical utility would be in better 
differentiating patients truly at risk for psychosis from those with 
attenuated psychotic symptoms in the context of trauma who 
will likely not develop a primary psychotic illness, given the high 
rate of trauma-related disorders in clinical high-risk samples.
164 
Another area where this model may prove useful is in understand-
ing sex differences in psychosis development. Women tend to 
experience more severe affective symptoms in psychosis as well 
as during psychosis risk.
165,166 In addition, men experience more 
negative symptoms, including increased asociality ,123 and there is 
some evidence of differential performance in social a ppraisal in 
males versus females.
166,167 Computationally phenotyping men 
and women using tasks or approaches consistent with our pro-
posed model may help clarify the causes of these sex differences. 
One area for further expansion of this model, while out of scope of 
the current work, is language, which is affected in psychosis and is 
core to both positive and negative symptoms.
168 Another key area 
will be to examine the influence of inter-individual variation in 
the development of psychotic themes. For example, many patients 
have grandiose delusions, rather than persecutory and negative 
delusions, and this model would need to be expanded in order to 
fully chara cterize how these more “positive” positive symptoms 
could be explained. One possibility is that gr andiose ideation is a
resultof negative affect the “manic defense”
169; another possibility 
is that those with grandiosity or mania have a mor e greater sensi-
tivity to reward
170 (see 171 for discussion). Indeed both may be true 
in different people- highlighting that learning about subgroups 
of patients who deviate from the model we propose based on 
their premorbid cognitive or affective makeup will be key . One 
final area for further research is relationship of each element 
of this model with neurotransmitter signalling changes across 
the prodrome- for example, considering the finding that there is
dopamine dysregulation prior to the onset of psychosis (see
172). 
Model Predictions 
Model predictions discussed here ar e also summarized in
Figure 2. 
1) If priors driving hallucinations/delusions are affectively 
laden, we would expect that tasks that tap into affective 
domains would produce stronger experiences when there is 
an affective compared to a neutrall y valenced condition. We 
are currently investigating this with an affecti ve version 
of the conditioned hallucinations task. 72 In this task, 
participants are presented with a valenced prior (a valenced
12 | International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8
Figure 2. Overview of eight model-derived predictions. (A) Prediction #1: Tasks engaging affective processes should elicit stronger responses (eg, conditioned 
hallucinations, prior weighting, and activity in affect-related brain regions) than neutral tasks. (B) Prediction 7: After controlling for prodrome 
duration, stress sensitivity during the prodrome should positively correlate with the severity of symptoms after psychosis onset. (C) Predictions 2–6 & 
8: Affective changes are hypothesized to precede the onset of frank psychosis, and trauma is expected to potentiate this process (Prediction 2). 
Expected outcome noise is expected to rise early in the prodrome (Prediction 4) as a direct consequence of neurobiological alterations such as NMDAR 
dysfunction (contributing to a lower-precision likelihood distribution, entailing relatively greater reliance on priors). We expect the importance 
afforded to negative information in the environment to increase, and for negative beliefs formed during the prodrome to influence the priors 
underlying negatively valenced hallucinations and delusions after psychosis onset (Predictions 3, 5). Perceived environmental volatility and/or reliance 
on priors over sensory evidence should rise in the leadup to psychosis onset (Prediction 4). Given the central role of affect in our model, early 
intervention targeting negativ e affective states and depressive symptoms during the prodrome is predicted to reduce the intensity and modulate the 
content of positive symptoms (Pr edictions 6, 8 ). 
word as the conditioned hallucination) as well as a valenced 
experimental manipulation aimed at inducing an affective 
state. If affective states are relevant to the development and 
maintenance of hallucinations, we would expect stronger 
prior weightings and more frequent conditioned halluci-
nations when the word and manipulation are congruent 
(eg, a negative word and negative affective manipulation). 
In addition, if negative affect in particular is facilitated 
in psychosis and related to the development of psychotic 
symptoms, as we suggest above, we would expect that 
negative, as opposed to positive or neutral affective stimuli, 
should produce the highest prior weightings. In addition, 
we expect that increased affective prior weightings should 
correlate with activity in affectively relevant regions during 
fMRI, such as the insula,
173 anterior cingulate cortex, 174 
or amygdala 141 (among others). A finding that affective 
manipulations have no effect on either priors or conditioned 
hallucination rates would speak against a role for a ffect
International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2025, Vol. 28, No. 8| 13
in symptom development, at least in a subset of patients; 
however, it is possible that some patients with high affective 
sensitivity may be distracted by strong emotional stimuli 
and therefore experience lower conditioned hallucination 
rates in negative conditions, potentially related to being 
distracted by their own usual psyc hotic symptoms .
2) We should expect affective changes to precede the devel-
opment of hallucinations and delusions in the psychosis 
prodrome if they are part of the causal chain that leads to 
the priors that drive them, and we should expect trauma 
to potentiate this process. As discussed, significant evidence 
exists for this prediction (eg,
14,122). The absence of affective 
changes prior to psychosis development (as examined in 
prospective studies of prodromal symptoms, such as , 175 or 
the absence of these symptoms in a subset of patients, 
would suggest the existence of non-affective pathways to 
psychotic symptom development. Further research would be 
needed to determine ho w patients who progress along these 
trajectories differ fr om those with affective changes. 
3) We would expect that the precision afforded to negatively 
valenced information would begin to increase early in 
the prodrome and would correlate with the strengthening 
of maladaptive priors (ie, while the precision afforded to 
other information is also gradually decreasing). However, 
as noted, there may be inter-individual differences such 
that, for example, some prodromal individuals would 
potentially experience a bias towards positive valence, 
potentially leading to grandiosity . This could be tested using 
tasks designed to reveal perceptual biases in the presence 
of emotionally valenced cues.
9,97,176 Specifically , biased 
performance on these tasks should correlate, over time, 
with increased prior weightings. Should this relationship not 
be found, it would argue against the aberrant exploration 
portion of our model, though not necessarily against the 
strengthening of negative prior beliefs as a response to 
noise or as a meta-response to high volatility . This would 
be relevant to assess, as changing true environmental 
information may be more feasible than c hanging internal 
representations when designing nov el treatments .
4) We should expect there to be a temporal correlation between 
worsening affect and the onset of either increases in 
expected environmental instability (volatility) or increases 
in expected noise in sensory input (ie, lower sensory 
precision-weighting, increased weighting of prior beliefs), 
as these are thought to potentially underlie negative affect. 
This could be tested in a longitudinal cohort of patients 
at risk for psychosis or in the earliest phases of psychosis 
b y applying tests such as the conditioned hallucinations 
or social appraisal tasks
72,76 in a longitudinal fashion, and 
examining changes in performance of these tasks i n relation 
to the timing of symptom changes . 
5) We would expect that affective themes experienced ear-
lier in prodrome (and influenced by premorbid experiences, 
trauma and cognitive and affective makeup) should be repli-
cated in the priors driving hallucinations and delusions later 
on, and therefore in the themes of these symptoms. Here, 
we would expect to be able to examine and parse inter-
individual differences and define potential subgroups within 
our proposed model. This should be relatively straightfor-
ward to assess through prospective studies of patients at 
risk for psychosis, by collecting detailed data on trauma, 
standardized questionnaires about delusional themes, and 
in-depth psychiatric interviews, and comparing these to the 
themes present in delusions and hallucinations after psy-
chosis onset. Careful attention will need to be paid, in such 
studies, to major events that could intervene in a patient’s 
life between the initial assessment and onset of psychotic 
symptoms, as these may figure into psychotic themes. We 
would expect associated neurobiological correlates to be 
found in the function or structure of regions related to 
affect (eg, amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex) as 
well as regi ons related to episodic and semantic memory (eg,
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus).
177 
6) Treatment of depressive symptoms earlier in the prodrome 
should reduce the intensity of negative affect present in pos-
itive symptoms, especially for self-critical psychotic symp-
toms; this would be due to a modulation of the intensity of 
the affect during generation of maladaptive priors. However, 
as affect shapes but does not cause prior hyper-precision, 
this would not necessarily prevent psychosis onset. Improve-
ment in the negative or self-critical nature of psychotic 
symptoms in patients successfully treated for depressive 
symptoms during the prodromal phase, compared to those 
who are not, would serve as evidence in favor of this predic-
tion (given that it would not be ethical to run a randomized 
control trial in which some patients w ould not be treated 
for depression, this observational design focusing on the 
success of depression treatment w ould be necessary).
7) After controlling for prodrome length, we would expect mea-
sures of sensitivity to stress during the prodrome (such as 
performance on stressful tasks
178 as well as physiological 
and neurobiological measures of stress response to affective 
stimuli) to correlate with increased symptom severity after 
illness onset. This could be assessed in prospective studies 
of patients at risk for psychosis. 
8) Treating affective states early in the prodrome should 
change the intensity and content of symptoms. However, 
since affective change provides context to developing 
symptoms, but is not the primary process, treatment would 
not necessarily prevent the development of psychosis. 
Similar to point 6 above, this could be assessed by examining 
the intensity and themes of symptoms in patients who 
conv ert to psychosis that were effectively treated for 
negative affective states earlier in the prodrome, compared 
to those for whom treatment was not effective or who had 
affective symptoms that were not tr eated.
CONCLUSION 
In this review, we have discussed how computational approaches 
have enabled us to better understand the role of affect in informa-
tion processing within psychiatric illness. Using these principles, 
we have extended a recent model of psychotic symptom develop-
ment to include affect as an important source of context during 
symptom development. Given the fact that affective states can 
be modified, they may serve as an important focus of treatment 
during the prodrome. Likewise, considering and parsing differ-
ent affective states during illness and illness development using 
computational tasks may help improve dia gnosis, prognosis, and
treatment planning in a range of psychiatric conditions.
