This paper presents an interpretation of stuttering behavior, based on the principles 
of the active inference framework. Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by speech disfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. 
The principles of active inference, a theory of predictive processing and sentient 
behavior, can be used to conceptualize stuttering as a disruption in perception-
action cycling underlying speech production. The theory proposed here posits that 
stuttering arises from aberrant sensory precision and prediction error dynamics, 
inhibiting syllable initiation. Relevant to this theory, two hypothesized mechanisms 
are proposed: (1) a mistiming in precision dynamics, and (2) excessive attentional 
focus. Both highlight the role of neural oscillations, prediction error, and hierarchical 
integration in speech production. This framework also explains the contextual 
variability of stuttering behaviors, including adaptation effects and fluency-inducing 
conditions. Reframing stuttering as a synaptopathy integrates neurobiological, 
psychological, and behavioral dimensions, suggesting disruptions in precision-
weighting mediated by neuromodulatory systems. This active inference perspective 
provides a unified account of stuttering and sets the stage for innovative research 
and therapeutic approaches.

1 Reframing stuttering: a predictive perspective
Stuttering is a complex fluency disorder that is often neurodevelopmental (i.e., childhood-
onset fluency disorder) and sometimes acquired due to illness or injury. For most individuals, 
intricate coordination of the speech subsystems involved in respiration, articulation, and 
phonation results in a smooth and efficient flow of speech. For people who stutter (PWS), 
agentic control over speech is frequently compromised by stuttering behavior or ‘disfluency, ’ 
traditionally classified as blocks, prolongations, or repetitions (Bloodstein et al., 2021). Beyond 
this core stuttering behavior, more peripheral behavior includes overt signs of tension and 
struggle in communication, circumlocution, and avoidance of feared words and social 
situations. Many PWS experience covert feelings such as self-consciousness, shame, and 
apprehension. These emotions often contribute to a perceived loss of control over their 
communication ( Bloodstein et  al., 2021 ; Perkins, 1990 ). This multifaceted experience 
highlights the need for comprehensive models to explain the variability of stuttering behavior.
Recent accounts of stuttering behavior highlight neurodevelopmental (Smith and Weber, 
2017), genetic (Kraft and Y airi, 2012), biological (Neef and Chang, 2024), and computational 
(Chang and Guenther, 2019) factors, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of stuttering. 
However, some aspects of stuttering behavior appear to be functional or psychogenic (Utianski 
and Duffy, 2022; Bloodstein, 1949). In a Presidential town hall in February 2020, President Joe 
Biden openly pondered the cause of stuttering and how he could overcome its debilitating 
effects (CNN, 2020). He explained, “I think part of it is confidence and how you were [sic] what 
circumstance you face…” This folk psychological view of stuttering, which assumes an internal

locus of control and role of self-confidence in stuttering behavior, 
remains dominant in everyday life. The current zeitgeist around 
stuttering includes conflicting narratives regarding the contextual 
nature and (in)tractability of stuttering behavior. Despite over a 
century of empirical research, it remains unclear why stuttering occurs 
during some communicative situations and not in others, and what 
role confidence is likely to play in this variability. However, in the past 
two decades, the application of Bayesian mechanics to the 
cognitive-and neuro-sciences has advanced probabilistic frameworks 
for a greater understanding of the brain and behavior in contexts of 
varying confidence and uncertainty (Doya et al., 2011; Clark, 2015).
An increasingly influential theory of sentient behavior known as 
active inference provides a novel explanation of stuttering as a 
pathology of aberrant predictive processing (Pezzulo et al., 2024). This 
framework describes how biological agents predict and adapt to their 
environment (Pezzulo et al., 2024; Parr and Pezzulo, 2022), including 
both maintenance of optimal internal states (i.e., homeostasis) and 
adaptability during times of stress (i.e., allostasis) (Seth and Friston, 
1708; Barrett et  al., 2016 ; Schulkin and Sterling, 2019 ). Active 
inference provides an explanation of stuttering behavior as an 
involuntary, transient, and chronic failure by the speaker to self-
attenuate from the act of speaking. More specifically, atypical precision 
(i.e., confidence) afforded to perception-action cycling may abruptly 
inhibit syllable initiation, resulting in stuttering behavior. This theory 
links neurobiological and psychological views of stuttering by framing 
stuttering as a synaptopathy – a disorder in the precision afforded to 
parameters of predictive processing mediated by various 
neuromodulatory systems.
2 Core concepts of active inference
According to this framework, based on the free energy principle, 
biological agents have an existential imperative to minimize 
uncertainty (or, more technically, variational free energy) by 
generating internal probabilistic representations of their environment 
(Friston et al., 2022). The brain operates as a Bayesian inference organ 
that infers the probable causes of sensory input from the environment 
via predictive coding (Rao and Ballard, 1999). A technical account of 
active inference and the free energy principle is beyond the scope of 
this article but is available elsewhere (Pezzulo et al., 2024; Friston et al., 
2022). The brain operates as a hierarchical generative model 
comprising of prior expectations [P(x)], representing the brain’s 
existing beliefs or predictions about certain states or events. 
Additionally, it includes likelihood functions [P(y|x)], which quantify 
the probability of receiving specific sensory inputs (y) given a 
particular state of the world (x). To clarify, the likelihood function 
plays a crucial role in how the brain interprets incoming sensory 
information by assessing how probable these sensations are if a certain 
hypothesis about the environment is true. For instance, when 
you expect to hear and feel your speech (i.e., prior expectation) and 
then actually receive the feedback (i.e., sensory input), the likelihood 
function evaluates how well the sensory input aligns with your 
expectation. This process is closely tied to sensorimotor integration, 
where sensory input and motor actions are seamlessly combined to 
form coherent perceptions and drive behavior. Sensorimotor 
integration ensures that the brain’s predictions are continuously 
updated based on real-time sensory feedback. When there’s a 
mismatch between expectations and sensory input, the likelihood 
function helps adjust the posterior expectations based on the precision 
of prediction errors, refining the brain’s model of the environment for 
more accurate future predictions. By integrating prior expectations 
with likelihood functions through sensorimotor interactions, the 
brain maintains a dynamic and adaptive understanding of the world, 
enabling efficient processing in response to changing conditions.
The interplay between Bayesian priors, likelihoods, and posteriors 
ensures that speech-language production is a context-sensitive and 
dynamic process in which agents continuously generate syllables, 
words, and phrases while adjusting to situation-specific prior 
knowledge and sensory feedback. Bayesian inference provides a useful 
framework for understanding how this process balances accuracy in 
model predictions and flexibility in model updating. For example, 
prior expectations include the words likely to be used in the current 
situation. The likelihood reflects how well each potential word fits the 
specific context. Prior expectations are integrated with the likelihood 
of arriving at the most probable and relevant word (i.e., posterior). 
However, sensory feedback from oneself or perhaps a communicative 
partner, can refine this likelihood. This fosters speech-language 
production that is both efficient and adaptive.
Simply put, perception is conceptualized as a form of predictive 
processing in which prediction error is minimized by Bayesian model 
updating. Descending predictions minimize ascending prediction 
errors and thus update the model. The higher up the model hierarchy, 
the slower and more generalized predictions and prediction errors 
become. Over time, prior expectations become increasingly veridical 
to the environment while still being open to new sensory input from 
a dynamic world. While prediction error minimization during 
predictive processing depends on past experiences and current 
sensory input, complex agents also minimize expected prediction error 
by planning sequences of action into the future (Friston, 2010). An 
agent selects an optimal sequence of action or policy that is predicted 
to result in the proprioceptive, exteroceptive, and interoceptive 
endpoints of a future desired state.
Highly precise prior expectations reflect high confidence or 
certainty. On the contrary, uncertainty and anxiety are similarly 
conceptualized as the inability to reliably minimize prediction error 
through perception and action ( Peters et  al., 2017 ; Pezzulo and 
Friston, 2019). Prediction errors that are frequent, large, or unresolved 
signal to higher levels of the generative model that it is inadequate in 
predicting the environment. In active inference, (un)certainty refers 
to a quantitative measure of precision (or inverse variance) of a 
probability distribution representing a Bayesian parameter, such as 
prior expectations and sensory input (Y on and Frith, 2021). Precision 
is a second-order prediction of ‘context’ (e.g., how well you hear an 
utterance) associated with a prediction of ‘content’ (e.g., what 
utterance you expect to hear). Precision determines how much weight 
the agent gives to sensory data versus prior expectations when 
updating its generative model. ‘Prior precision’ is the confidence of our 
prior expectations from previous knowledge and experience. ‘Sensory 
precision’ is the confidence in the fidelity (i.e., likelihood) of the 
sensory input. Higher sensory precision implies greater confidence in 
the sensory input and, as a result, the agent relies more on sensory 
input for updating expectations. Conversely, low sensory precision 
results in a greater reliance on prior expectations. Thus, when prior 
precision is strong, sensory precision is relatively weak, and vice versa. 
Precision weighting can be viewed as a form of gain control to the

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org
influence of sensory input on updating the generative model. In other 
words, prediction error is minimized by perception (i.e., changing our 
model) when sensory precision is relatively strong, or by action (i.e., 
changing our environment) when sensory precision is relatively weak. 
Framing the brain and behavior as existentially minimizing prediction 
error via precision dynamics and the integration of perception and 
action can provide a new and nuanced view of speech fluency and 
stuttering behaviors.
3 The predictive path to speech 
fluency
The nature and clinical importance of ‘fluency’ has sparked 
enduring debate within the communication sciences (Tichenor et al., 
2022). Traditionally, speech fluency has been conceptualized as the 
transitional smoothness or efficiency of perceptual features (e.g., 
acoustics, kinematics), and the absence of discrete interruption (e.g., 
disfluency). However, recent attempts to broaden the concept of 
speech fluency have emphasized the efficiency of achieving 
communicative goals and values ( Usler, 2022a). In the context of 
active inference, fluency can be defined as the subjective experience 
of efficiency in cognitive, linguistic, and motor processes—a 
metacognitive signal indicating prediction error is reliably minimized 
via the successful integration of prior expectations and sensory input 
(Brouillet and Friston, 2023).
Speech production is driven by perception-action cycles, 
influenced by the balance of prior and sensory precisions (See 
Figure 1) (Anil Meera et al., 2022). Sensory precision increases relative 
to prior precision with the prioritization of salient observations, 
commonly known as attention (Feldman and Friston, 2010). During 
speech, the speaker receives different sources of simultaneous sensory 
input: exteroceptive (e.g., auditory), proprioceptive (e.g., 
somatosensory), and interoceptive (e.g., autonomic). These sensory 
inputs inform the speaker of progress in communicating and, 
relatedly, how precision should be  balanced between prior 
expectations and sensory input. This minimization process is 
analogous to the scientific method of prediction-making and 
observation collection (Anil Meera et al., 2022). Sequential perception-
action cycles underlying behavior, such as saccades (Parr et al., 2019; 
Hoffman et  al., 2013 ) and syllables ( Poeppel and Assaneo, 2020 ; 
Pellegrino et  al., 2011), are largely produced in a theta frequency 
(3–8 Hz) (Fiebelkorn and Kastner, 2019; Benedetto et al., 2020). The 
syllable is the likely unit of information processing for speech 
perception and production (e.g., ‘theta-syllable’) (Ghitza, 2013; Strauß 
and Schwartz, 2017). For our purposes, the syllable is viewed as a 
computationally-and biomechanically constrained temporal 
scheduling of perception-action cycles that underlie fluency in speech-
language production.
Understanding the mechanisms behind speech fluency requires 
examining the interaction between sensory input and motor output 
in a dynamic context. Active inference is a revised ideomotor theory 
in which action is not driven by descending motor commands but by 
ascending prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Mohan et al., 2019). 
An action is performed to minimize prediction error between a 
precise prior expectation of the sensory input (associated with a future 
goal state) and current sensory input (evidencing the goal state has not 
yet been attained). To do so, one must reduce sensory precision 
relative to prior precision (i.e., sensory attenuation) by disattending to 
current sensory input (Brown et al., 2013). Sensory attenuation is a 
reduction of sensation intensity (Blakemore et al., 2000 ), which is 
required for action initiation according to the ideomotor principles of 
active inference. Put simply, the brain ‘fools itself ’ into movement by 
not considering the current sensory evidence that movement has yet 
to occur. Instead, strong prior expectations of sensory endpoints (that 
have yet to be reached) result in prediction error that is only resolved 
by the movement. This notion of movement as a self-fulfilling 
prophecy requires sensory attenuation and action initiation to occur 
in synchrony for optimal perception-action cycling. A speaker must 
effortlessly modulate their prior and sensory precisions with just the 
right timing and rhythm to produce the syllable sequencing that 
we  perceive as fluent speech. It follows that a failure to attenuate 
sensory precision at syllable onset disrupts forward action, as there is 
no prediction error to minimize.
Although recent accounts of motor control based on active 
inference principles have focused on proprioceptive prediction error 
(Parr et al., 2021), speech production is also refined by simultaneous 
exteroceptive (i.e., auditory) feedback. As stated by Najnin and 
Banerjee, “instead of directly mapping from auditory sensory to 
action, auditory and proprioceptive sensory can be fused and action 
can be inferred from proprioceptive sensory prediction error” (Najnin 
and Banerjee, 2017 ). A detailed active inference model of speech 
perception and production is beyond the scope of this article, but 
recent conceptualizations are available elsewhere ( Najnin and 
Banerjee, 2017; Friston et al., 2021; Bradshaw et al., 2024). Instead of 
viewing stuttering as being caused by a disorder of speech motor 
planning, execution, or coordination, stuttering may be viewed as a 
disorder of inference. Stuttering behavior may dynamically emerge 
when sequential perception-action cycles fail to transition accordingly, 
leading to transient moments of stuckness and a loss of control over 
speech-language production.
This ideomotor approach contrasts with contemporary speech 
production models that emphasize articulatory kinematics and inverse 
modeling ( Parrell et  al., 2019 ), including two models that have 
influenced current perspectives on stuttering: the Directions Into

Velocities of Articulators (DIV A) (Tourville and Guenther, 2011) and 
the Hierarchical State Feedback Control (HSFC) models ( Hickok 
et al., 2011 ). According to the DIV A model, speech production is 
driven by stored feedforward motor commands refined by errors with 
predictive somatosensory and auditory targets. From this perspective, 
unstable internal models (Max et al., 2004), atypical dopaminergic 
signaling (Civier et al., 2013), and aberrantly high reliance on sensory 
feedback (Civier et  al., 2010) associated within the basal ganglia-
thalamo-cortical loop result in stutter-like disruptions in simulated 
speech. In the HSFC model, speech production is driven by an internal 
model of the vocal tract that supports internal monitoring to 
determine the accuracy of current motor commands relative to 
intended sensory targets. Stuttering behaviors are thus triggered by 
error correction of inaccurate motor predictions due to ‘noisy’ 
sensorimotor integration (Hickok et al., 2011). Contemporary models 
of speech-language production, such as the DIV A and HSFC models, 
emphasize specific neural mappings to specific linguistic and motoric 
processes, and are heavily influenced by control theory that posits that 
movement is driven by the optimization of a value function towards a 
desired endpoint.
On the contrary, in the active inference framework, motor control 
is a form of Bayesian inference to minimize prediction error (Friston, 
2011). All neural processes are Bayesian with predictions and 
prediction errors framed as probability distribution with an associated 
precision (i.e., inverse variance). All environmental input is simply 
sensory prediction error and the precision of that input (whether or 
not it is likely to influence higher-levels of the generative model) is 
mediated by attentional mechanisms. In active inference, an inverse 
model for the formulation of learned motor representations that are 
then executed via a feedforward mechanism is not required. 
Consistent with the equilibrium-point hypothesis (Feldman, 2023; 
Perrier et  al., 1996 ), movements are not centrally planned and 
executed but arise when prior expectations about sensations differ 
from current sensory input (Adams et al., 2013). This view of motor 
control closely aligns with the activation of mirror neurons during 
movement perception and performance (Rizzolatti et al., 1996). Thus, 
movement likely occurs through the sequencing of perception-action 
cycles, modulated by fluctuations in sensory precision, and without 
the need for distinct forward and inverse modeling (See Figure 2). 
Prediction errors are minimized at the lowest level of the hierarchical 
model by closed-loop motor reflex arcs in the brainstem and spinal 
cord that bring the position of relevant effectors into line with 
predicted proprioceptive endpoints.
Models of speech production that rely on control theory versus 
active inference principles offer complementary perspectives on why 
stuttering behaviors occur. From a control theory perspective, speech 
production relies on a balance between feedforward and feedback 
control—fluent speech relies on strong feedforward processes and 
minimal reliance on feedback, particularly in highly automatized 
speech. This is analogous to active inference, in which strong prior 
precision and weak sensory precision drive well-learned (i.e., 
automatic) or highly predictable speech. However, active inference 
conceptualizes speech-language production as a hierarchical Bayesian 
process, explicitly incorporating uncertainty via precision-weighting. 
This is critical for understanding the dynamic and contextual nature 
of stuttering behavior.
4 The role of uncertainty in stuttering 
behavior
To investigate the proximate cause(s) of stuttering behavior, it is 
first reasonable to look at the communicative contexts in which 
stuttering occurs. Developmental stuttering often begins when 
children start producing multisyllabic utterances, highlighting the 
importance of syllable sequencing (Bloodstein et al., 2021). Stuttering 
behavior typically occurs when utterances, such as words and 
sentences, are initiated (Brown, 1945; Buhr and Zebrowski, 2009) and 
FIGURE 2
Rhythmic fluctuations of sensory and prior precisions (blue), associated with attention, during sequential syllable production (red arrows).

follow a “declining gradient of incidence” ( Quarrington, 1965 ). 
Stuttering also tends to be elicited by increased word unpredictability 
or information content (Quarrington, 1965; Schlesinger et al., 1965), 
utterance length (Lanyon and Duprez, 1970; Soderberg, 1971), and 
contextual relevance (Kaasin and Bjerkan, 1982; Byrd et al., 2011). 
Notably, words deemed ‘critical’ to the overall message are often 
stuttered (Kaasin and Bjerkan, 1982; Byrd et al., 2011; Eisenson and 
Horowitz, 1945; Eisenson and Wells, 1942). These different variables, 
which similarly elicit stuttering in both developmental and acquired 
forms of the disorder (Max et al., 2019), appear to be additive in their 
tendency to elicit stuttering ( Schlesinger et  al., 1965 ) while also 
eliciting stuttering independently ( Quarrington, 1965). As Taylor 
(1966) argued, the influence of all these different variables on the 
variability of stuttering can be  explained by the metavariable of 
uncertainty. By framing the various situational factors that elicit 
stuttering—such as word unpredictability, utterance length, and 
contextual relevance—under the broader metavariable of uncertainty, 
we can better understand how these elements collectively influence 
speech production and its disruption, as well as the potential role of 
confidence in modulating these effects.
In active inference, a failure to accurately and reliably predict 
sensory input from an ever-changing environment has been associated 
with the psychological states of anxiety, uncertainty, and 
hypervigilance (Peters et al., 2017). Epistemic uncertainty is a lack of 
information about how to act in a communicative situation. This 
uncertainty is resolved by the information gain from sensory input, 
which ‘self-evidences’ the speaker as an effective communicator 
(Hohwy, 2022). In other words, a speaker’s own speech reduces 
uncertainty regarding what, when, and how particular syllable 
sequences could be produced next. Another form of uncertainty is 
‘volatility’—the intrinsic unpredictability of the communicative 
landscape that the environment affords (Dayan and Yu, 2002; Vincent 
et al., 2019). For instance, reciting a remembered poem to a favorite 
pet entails little volatility. Conversely, spontaneously answering 
questions at a job interview presents high volatility. Policies, or 
sequences of action, require transitions from one state (e.g., syllable) 
to the next, and this ‘transition precision’ is the inverse of volatility 
(Parr and Friston, 2017). Furthermore, policies also have a ‘policy 
precision’ relative to competing policies for initiation. To best 
minimize expected prediction error, highly precise policies are chosen 
because they are optimally accurate yet as simple as possible (Friston 
et  al., 2022 ). Syllable sequences with high policy and transition 
precisions, such as commonly used phrases or sentences, allow the 
speaker to ‘know exactly what to say and how to say it’ and thus foster 
a sense of agentic control over communication.
The notion that uncertainty plays a role of cause (Taylor, 1966) 
and effect (Boyle and Chagachbanian, 2022) on stuttering has been 
long supposed. However, the mechanism that mediates the 
relationship between uncertainty and stuttering has remained elusive. 
Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence support the claim that 
PWS exhibit imprecise prior expectations, compared to non-stuttering 
peers, regarding the sensory endpoints of their motor output. For 
example, adults who stutter (AWS) are relatively less accurate in 
predicting the consequences of upper limb movement (Daliri et al., 
2014). Greater variability in articulatory coordination has been 
repeatedly associated with stuttering in children and adults ( Usler 
et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2010). PWS also exhibit relative limitations in 
speech motor skills ( Namasivayam and van Lieshout, 2011 ; Van 
Lieshout et al., 2004) and the speech of PWS is less rhythmic than that 
of non-stuttering peers (Boecher et al., 2025). Children who stutter 
(CWS), on average, exhibit maturational lags in their speech-language 
development (Smith and Weber, 2017), and numerous studies have 
associated stuttering with atypical event-related potential (ERP) 
amplitudes to auditory and linguistic prediction errors (Gastaldon 
et al., 2023; Maxfield et al., 2010; Weber-Fox, 2001). From an active 
inference perspective, ERP amplitudes index the precision-weighting 
of prediction errors ascending the model hierarchy ( Smith et  al., 
2022). Although ERP findings have varied [for a review, see Bloodstein 
et al. (2021)], PWS often exhibit generally reduced ERP amplitudes 
compared to non-stuttering peers, suggesting less precise prior 
expectations facilitating their speech-language predictions. 
Recognizing how uncertainty shapes stuttering behavior provides a 
pathway to more profound insights into the role of precision dynamics 
underlying Bayesian inference.
5 Precision dynamics and stuttering 
behavior
How does uncertainty elicit stuttering behavior? Weak prior 
expectations regarding the likely causes of incoming sensations 
increase the relative precision afforded to the sensory input via 
selective attention. For example, if you hike a well-trodden path, high 
confidence in the appropriate sequence of actions allows you  to 
disattend from the sensory environment. However, if your prior 
expectations result in prediction error and uncertainty (e.g., 
you realize you are suddenly lost), attention boosts precision to the 
most informative sensory stimuli within the environment. As long as 
volatility is low (e.g., it is a clear and sunny day), epistemic uncertainty 
is likely to be reduced by adaptive actions that boost information gain 
(e.g., looking for the helpful trail sign). Thus, boosting sensory 
precision during times of stress is an adaptive way to increase the rate 
of model updating (e.g., realizing where you had gone off trail) and 
adapting behavior accordingly. Speech-language production can 
be  similarly viewed as sequential perception-action cycles for the 
resolution of prediction error. Analogous to our hypothetical hiking 
example is the experience of a child with maturing linguistic, 
cognitive, and speech-motor abilities now traversing the increasingly 
complex linguistic landscape during the early preschool years—a 
critical period in which stuttering is likely to emerge, as well as 
disappear (Smith and Weber, 2017). Unlike language and articulation 
disorders, stuttering typically emerges after an initial period of speech-
language development (Bloodstein et al., 2021). Stuttering behaviors 
may suddenly occur when children are beginning to sequence 
syllables and words according to syntactic rules. Although stuttering 
in adults largely occurs on highly informative content words, early 
stuttering often occurs on function words. The immature syntactic 
abilities of children reduce the predictability of function words, thus 
boosting sensory precision. One can speculate that a minority of 
children, during a rapid period of language development, may fail to 
develop a tendency to disattend to their own speech, particularly at 
the location of challenging language formulation, such as function 
words and the beginning of syntactic structures. After years of 
linguistic practice, the predictable nature of function words, facilitated 
by their high rate of occurrence and lack of information content, likely 
reduces sensory precision afforded to their onset. On the contrary, 
Usler 10.3389/fnhum.2025.1498423
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.org
stuttering is likely to continue on those content words that are less 
frequently spoken and hold high information content.
Environmental conditions that increase uncertainty in task 
performance also increase sensory precision via selective attention for 
the minimization of that uncertainty. It follows that during periods of 
uncertainty in the sensory consequences of one’s speech production, 
perhaps due to weak prior expectations or volatility in the 
communicative environment, stuttering behaviors could be elicited by 
a lack of sensory attenuation that suddenly inhibits syllable initiation. 
From an ideomotor perspective, there is simply no prediction error 
for action to resolve because current sensory input (that speech had 
yet to occur) is more precise than that of the expected sensory 
consequences of movement. This increased sensory precision thus 
prevents the sensory attenuation required for the initiation of action. 
Such phenomena would explain why stuttering predominantly occurs 
at the beginning of words and phrases (Quarrington, 1965). Sensory 
attenuation is evidenced by a decrease in ERP amplitude to self-
generated versus external stimuli (Mifsud and Whitford, 2017; Timm 
et al., 2016 ; Saupe et al., 2013 ; Horváth, 2015; Kaiser and Schütz-
Bosbach, 2018). In a series of studies, Daliri and Max observed a 
failure of AWS to attenuate auditory input (i.e., auditory suppression) 
before speech or listening to a sound, as indexed by N1 amplitude 
(Max and Daliri, 2019; Daliri and Max, 2016; Daliri and Max, 2015). 
A similar lack of sensory attenuation in AWS was also previously 
observed in the somatosensory domain (McClean, 1996).
Previous studies have similarly suggested a link between stuttering 
and a global inhibition of action ( Neef et al., 2018 ; Arenas, 2017). 
However, unlike the view that inhibition is a learned response to 
stuttering (Orpella et al., 2024), the ideomotor perspective proposed 
here assumes inhibition to be the necessary and sufficient condition 
of stuttering. Although stuttering largely affects the domain of speech, 
the inhibitory phenomena underlying stuttering may hinder any form 
of communication facilitated by sequential perception-action cycles, 
including sign language (Cosyns et al., 2009; Whitebread, 2014) and 
handwriting ( Fagan, 1932 ; Prasad and Pal, 2018 ). Performance 
pressure has been long known to disrupt the initiation of movement, 
with aberrant attentional mechanisms usually implicated as the culprit 
(Beilock and Gray, 2007 ; Abernethy et  al., 2007 ). This form of 
‘paralysis by analysis’ may occur when the efficient initiation of 
perception-action cycling underlying movement is inhibited, likely by 
excessive sensory precision ( Harris et  al., 2023; Cappuccio et  al., 
2020). Given communication often occurs under considerable social 
pressure, the development of communicative ‘paralysis by analysis’ is 
not surprising in at least a small proportion of speakers. This view of 
stuttering as inhibition has been long proposed (Bluemel, 1935) and 
is consistent with previous ideas of stuttering behavior stemming from 
the gradient activation of a behavioral inhibition system relative to the 
defensive distance and intensity of a perceived threat (Usler, 2022b).
The inhibitory mechanisms underlying stuttering may 
be alleviated or exacerbated depending on the precision dynamics 
between prior expectations and sensory input. Reducing sensory 
precision through the direct manipulation of sensory feedback should 
have an immediate and profound effect in reducing stuttering behavior 
(Saltuklaroglu et al., 2002). For example, auditory masking may also 
reduce sensory precision simply by the removal of the auditory input 
(Maraist and Hutton, 1957 ). A more amelioratory approach than 
reducing sensory input could be  to make it one’s speech more 
predictable, such as through choral or shadowed speech ( Charles 
Healey and Howe, 1987 ; Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu, 2003 ). 
Similarly, delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency-altered 
feedback (FAF) provide a simulated ‘second speech signal’ once the 
speaker self-initiates the initial syllable (Saltuklaroglu et al., 2004). 
Interestingly, these fluency-inducing effects are not limited to the 
auditory domain but can be solely visual ( Kalinowski et al., 2000). 
Exogenous sensory stimuli, such as a ‘second speech signal, ’ provide 
interpersonal entrainment to a speaker’s production, including timing 
cues for rhythmic synchrony, resulting in a highly predictable sensory 
environment. Beyond aiding exteroceptive predictions, this second 
signal may help stabilize interoceptive predictions (e.g., heart rate, 
respiration). Furthermore, ‘keeping together in time’ with others may 
affirm higher-level predictions regarding one’s social status within a 
larger group, resulting in positive affect ( McNeill, 2009). Through 
these manipulations, increasing the predictability of one’s own sensory 
input may heighten prior precision while reducing attention (i.e., 
sensory precision) to one’s speech.
It has previously been proposed that the stuttering-reducing 
effects of choral speech, shadowed speech, DAF , and FAF may be due 
to the engagement of mirror neurons facilitating fluent imitation 
(Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu, 2003; Saltuklaroglu et al., 2004). In 
support of this view, active inference provides a compelling framework 
for explaining the function of mirror neurons (Kilner et al., 2007a; 
Kilner et al., 2007b). Mirror neurons activate both when observing 
and performing the same action. It has been proposed that mirror 
neurons function within the generative model hierarchy, connecting 
higher-level predictions (e.g., goals) to lower-level sensorimotor 
predictions (Kilner et al., 2007a ). Observing someone else’s action 
makes the sensory consequences of that action more predictable. 
When the environment is highly predictable, the generative model 
increases prior precision, and thus reduces precision afforded to the 
sensory input. This reduced prediction error leads to a decrease in the 
salience of environmental stimuli, resulting in less attention directed 
toward those stimuli. The more external stimuli reflect the expected 
sensory input, the greater the ameliorating effects on stuttering are 
likely to be (Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu, 2003). As Kalinowski and 
Saltuklaroglu state: “the closer the external gestural representation is to 
the intended utterance, the more likely it will be to enhance fluency” 
(Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu, 2003). How FAF , DAF , and masking 
directly manipulate sensory precision remains empirical questions for 
future investigation.
The interplay between active inference and the predictive 
capabilities of mirror neurons offers a valuable perspective on 
stuttering behavior and its modulation through external feedback. 
However, a deeper understanding of how these processes are 
underpinned by neural dynamics requires exploring the mechanisms 
of neural oscillations within the active inference framework. These 
oscillations facilitate the hierarchical integration of prior expectations 
and sensory input, offering insight into the precision-weighting 
mechanisms that influence stuttering behavior. Neural process 
theories of active inference involve neural message passing that 
correspond to the layers of the cortex and associated sub-cortical 
regions. Low-frequency neural oscillations, spanning delta to gamma 
bands, represent the summation of synchronous post-synaptic 
potentials and are thought to transmit prior expectations downward 
and prediction errors upward across the model hierarchy ( van 
Kerkoerle et al., 2014; Bastos et al., 2012; Engel et al., 2001). These 
oscillations may represent distinct processes for predicting the timing 
Usler 10.3389/fnhum.2025.1498423
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org
of upcoming sensory events (Arnal et al., 2014), such as syllables and 
phonemes (Morillon et al., 2012; Giraud and Arnal, 2018; Arnal et al., 
2011; Arnal and Giraud, 2012 ). Neural oscillations may provide a 
temporal scaffold for the integration of top-down prior expectations 
and ascending prediction error, with different oscillatory bands 
mediating predictive processing at different levels of the model 
hierarchy (Bastos et al., 2012; Friston et al., 2015; Adams et al., 2015). 
Top-down and bottom-up neural message passing map to slower (e.g., 
alpha or beta) and faster (e.g., gamma) brain rhythms, respectively 
(Arnal et al., 2014; Bastos et al., 2020; Alamia and Van Rullen, 2019).
Neural oscillations in the alpha (~8–12 Hz) and beta (~13–30 Hz) 
frequencies may play functionally distinct roles in prediction and 
regulating the precision of prediction errors ( Bastos et  al., 2012 ; 
Galeano-Otálvaro et al., 2024; Palmer et al., 2019). Alpha oscillations 
are thought to regulate precision weighting of prediction errors, 
mediating sensory precision by optimizing attention toward salient 
sensory stimuli (Bastos et al., 2012; Arnal and Giraud, 2012). Beta 
oscillations, on the other hand, may be associated with top-down 
motor predictions ( Galeano-Otálvaro et  al., 2024 ), movement 
initiation (Alegre et  al., 2004 ), sensory gating ( Arnal, 2012), and 
internal timing (Cirelli et al., 2014). Typically, beta power decreases 
(i.e., beta suppression) before movement and rebounds after 
movement cessation (Kilavik et al., 2013; Neuper et al., 2006). Stronger 
beta suppression is linked to faster, well-learned, automatic 
movements (Tzagarakis et al., 2019), whereas reduced suppression 
may indicate imprecise sensory predictions (Kilavik et al., 2013). Beta 
power may index motor prediction uncertainty (Neuper et al., 2006), 
with suppression decreasing under uncertain conditions (Tzagarakis 
et al., 2010; van Helvert et al., 2021). Additionally, beta suppression at 
movement initiation has been associated with sensory attenuation 
(Engel and Fries, 2010) and post-movement beta rebound may reflect 
prediction error (Tan et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2016; Torrecillos et al., 
2015; Torrecillos et al., 2018) and their associated uncertainty (Tan 
et al., 2016). Similarly, Palmer et al. demonstrated that pre-movement 
beta suppression is influenced by precision-weighting of prediction 
errors (Palmer et al., 2019), further supporting the link between beta 
suppression and uncertainty in movement preparation (van Helvert 
et  al., 2021 ; Tzagarakis et  al., 2021 ). From an active inference 
perspective, beta suppression may occur when the brain updates prior 
expectations in response to prediction error. Thus, a reduction in beta 
power at the initiation of action may index an increase of prior 
precision and decrease in sensory precision.
Fluent speech relies on timely beta suppression for smooth 
syllabic transitions. However, studies on neural oscillations in people 
who stutter (PWS) indicate atypical alpha (~8–12 Hz) and beta power 
during speech preparation and execution (Orpella et al., 2024; Jenson 
et al., 2019; Korzeczek et al., 2022; Mersov et al., 2016; Mock et al., 
2016; Mollaei et  al., 2021 ). Korzecek et  al. found that stuttering 
severity correlated with increased alpha power in frontal regions and 
beta power in central areas during speech intention (Korzeczek et al., 
2022). Similarly, Orpella et al. observed elevated beta power in the 
right pre-supplementary motor area before stuttered utterances, with 
severity-dependent variations ( Orpella et  al., 2024 ). Jenson et  al. 
reported weaker alpha and beta suppression in the left premotor 
cortex during single word production (Jenson et al., 2018). Mersov 
and colleagues, however, found stronger beta suppression in the 
bilateral mouth motor cortex during both speech planning and 
execution of phrases (Mersov et al., 2016). According to Brown and 
colleagues, this discrepancy may be task-dependent ( Brown et al., 
2025): compared to non-stuttering peers, PWS may exhibit less beta 
suppression during simpler or more automatic speech (which relies 
less on feedback) but more alpha and beta suppression in more 
complex speech tasks that induce greater uncertainty (Jenson et al., 
2018; Brown et al., 2025; Caruso et al., 2023). The proposed roles of 
alpha and beta oscillations in active inference, and the fact that their 
oscillatory dynamics approximate to speech initiation appear to 
be atypical in PWS and allow one to speculate about their role of 
precision dynamics in stuttering behavior.
6 Two hypotheses for a proximate 
cause of stuttering behavior
Linking precision dynamics, sensory attenuation, and neural 
oscillations present a complicated and unfinished explanation of 
stuttering behavior, but circumstantial evidence supports two 
potential mechanisms for a failure of sensory attenuation at the onset 
of speech: (1) a phase shift in the precision dynamics relative to the 
timing of speech initiation (‘mistiming hypothesis’); or (2) excessive 
inward attentional focus at speech initiation (‘attention hypothesis’). 
The mistiming hypothesis implicates aberrant temporal scheduling of 
the modulation of sensory and prior precision, resulting in a lack of 
sensory attenuation at syllable initiation (See Figure 3). When syllable 
initiation is attempted, sensory precision has yet to decrease past a 
threshold for action. This scenario could be  caused by a specific 
difficulty in predicting the timing of sensory inputs, which is similar 
to previous accounts of stuttering as a deficit in temporal processing 
(Sares et al., 2019; Falk et al., 2015). Stuttering has been associated 
with disruptions in sensorimotor integration, speech timing, and 
speech motor performance (Smith, 1999; Alm, 2004; Etchell et al., 
2014). The speech of PWS is also more fragmented and less rhythmic 
than that of their non-stuttering peers (Y awatkar et al., 2023; Boecher 
et al., 2025). Decreased functional activity and structural connectivity 
in neural networks that support the timing of self-paced movement, 
such as between the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus, and the 
middle temporal gyrus, have been associated with stuttering (Chang 
and Zhu, 2013 ). In an investigation of neural activity in the left  
precentral gyrus, Mersov and colleagues observed non-stuttered 
utterances to be  facilitated by an earlier (~200 ms) onset of beta 
suppression compared to stuttered utterances (Mersov et al., 2018). In 
a study by Etchell and colleagues, aberrant entrainment of beta power 
was observed in CWS during passive listening to tones (Etchell et al., 
2016). Typically developing children exhibited peaks in beta power 
approximate to the sound onset. However, beta peaked ~200 ms after 
sound onset for CWS. Etchell et al. (2016) concluded that, unlike their 
typically developing peers, beta modulation of CWS appeared 
“reactive rather than predictive” . Although greater empirical research 
is needed, the findings of Mersov et al. (2018) and Etchell et al. (2016) 
implicate a potential mistiming in precision dynamics associated with 
stuttering behavior.
If this mistiming hypothesis is true, any circumstance that fosters 
synchrony between sensory attenuation and syllable initiation would 
reduce stuttering behavior. Speaking to the beat of an external rhythm 
(e.g., metronome or choral speech) tends to reduce the likelihood of 
stuttering [For review, see Bloodstein et  al. (2021) ]. Providing 
rhythmic cues for the speaker to initiate speech may aid temporal

prediction of sensory input, resulting in sensory attenuation 
coordinated with syllable initiation. Relatedly, rhythmically moving 
parts of the body during speech may serve as a self-generated cue 
(Barber, 1940). Imposing a slight delay (i.e., pause) to syllable initiation 
may also afford time for sensory attenuation to cross the threshold for 
action and allow for fluent production. Inserting short pauses before 
speech initiation has been considered a helpful therapeutic technique 
for many PWS ( Reitzes, 2006). Alternatively, imposing a delay to 
incoming sensory input within the perception-action cycle (i.e., 
~50–200 milliseconds) may minimize the aberrant phase shift in 
precision dynamics, and could facilitate sensory attenuation under the 
threshold necessary for syllable initiation. This phenomenon has been 
long observed with the use of DAF in the amelioration of stuttering 
[For review, see Bloodstein et  al. (2021) ]. Interestingly, a lack of 
auditory suppression previously observed in AWS was normalized by 
a 100 ms delay in auditory feedback (Max and Daliri, 2019). On the 
contrary, delay in auditory feedback may prevent timely sensory 
attenuation in those who typically do not stutter, resulting in ‘stutter-
like’ behavior (Corey and Cuddapah, 2008).
The attention hypothesis implicates a lack of sensory attenuation 
immediately prior to syllable initiation without atypical timing (See 
Figure 4). In this case, the magnitude of sensory precision is simply 
not attenuated past a threshold necessary to initiate action. This lack 
of sensory attenuation may be due to excessive selective attention to 
the act of speaking or inability to disattend to current sensory input 
during speech (Brown et al., 2013; Limanowski, 2017). Functional 
motor disorders have been associated with strong sensory precision 
due to excessive inward attention to the self (Pareés et al., 2014). Not 
surprisingly, stuttering behavior is a common sign of functional 
speech disorders ( Utianski and Duffy, 2022 ; Baker et  al., 2021 ). 
Increased attention is deployed to resolve uncertainty by affording 
greater salience to observations as a function of their information 
content. The types of utterances that are usually stuttered, described 
in Section 4, are those that resolve uncertainty (i.e., high information 
content) and thus made more salient by the speaker’s attention. 
Beyond the language spoken, circumstances that induce increased 
attention to the self as speaker increase the likelihood of stuttering 
(Maddox, 1938; Kamhi and McOsker, 1982).
If the attention hypothesis is true, disattending to current sensory 
input during speech should reduce stuttering, without any alteration 
in speech timing. Stuttering does not typically occur when 
communicative environments reduce sensory precision, as observed 
in the effects of distraction, altered auditory feedback, and contingent 
stimuli [For review, see Bloodstein et al. (2021)]. Many PWS rely on 
forms of self-distraction to prevent or alleviate stuttering behavior. In 
the case of FAF and auditory masking (e.g., white noise), sensory 
precision afforded to speech may be directed elsewhere or reduced 
altogether. Given the ideomotor nature of active inference, the 
effectiveness of suggestion on reducing stuttering behavior should not 
be surprising (Bloodstein et al., 2021; Bloodstein, 1949). Suggestion 
may reduce sensory precision to the act of speaking by altering 
attentional processes whether the suggestion is hypnotic or 
non-hypnotic, imposed or self-induced (Raz and Campbell, 2011). 
Similarly, any sense of novelty or deviation from how one traditionally 
speaks, such as performing a role or changing vocal characteristics, 
may be viewed as a form of disattending from the self as speaker 
(Bloodstein et al., 2021; Bloodstein, 1949). Dual-task paradigms have 
also revealed that stuttering may reduce if attention is orientated 
FIGURE 3

(PWS; red) and typical syllable initiation by people who do not stutter (PWNS; blue).

towards other sensory stimuli (Vasic and Wijnen, 2005; Arends et al., 
1988), and this effect may be particularly strong if attention is oriented 
towards sensory input from rhythmic limb movement synchronized 
to speech (Barber, 1940).
Although these two hypotheses suppose different causal 
mechanisms, they are likely not mutually exclusive and may even 
reinforce each other. For example, PWS exhibit considerable 
individual differences in responding to altered auditory feedback 
(e.g., DAF/FAF) and, on average, these interventions all appear to 
be effective at ameliorating stuttering behavior (Lincoln et al., 2006). 
The novelty of any alteration of natural speech as a potential form of 
self-distraction supports the attention hypothesis. Y et the attention 
hypothesis does not explain how DAF elicits stutter-like behavior in 
people who typically do not stutter ( Corey and Cuddapah, 2008 ). 
Further evidence for either hypothesis includes previous associations 
between stuttering and deficits in the processing of temporal 
information, including errors in time estimation (Bastos et al., 2012). 
PWS may overestimate in their perception of time and stuttering 
behavior has been positively correlated with time estimation 
difficulty (Ezrati-Vinacour and Levin, 2001 ; Barasch et al., 2000 ). 
Previous research supports the notion of increased attention as 
prolonging the perception of time, which would support the 
attention hypothesis  [For review, see Tse (2010) ]. However, this 
subjective time dilation has also been found to increase with 
temporal uncertainty (Zhang et al., 2023). This finding and observed 
deficits in rhythm discrimination ( Chang et  al., 2016 ) and 
production ( Boecher et  al., 2025 ) in PWS gives credence to the 
mistiming hypothesis.
In sum, both hypotheses help to explain how the precision of 
current sensory input may fail to attenuate relative to that of prior 
expectation, resulting in the inhibition of syllable initiation. It is 
possible the stuttering behavior of some PWS, such as those who 
respond most favorably to DAF , are driven by mistiming of perception-
action cycles. The stuttering behavior of other PWS, such as those who 
respond more favorably to FAF or masking, may be driven by excessive 
attention to their speech. Given precision dynamics are likely 
influenced by the degree of uncertainty associated with personal 
history, sense of self-efficacy, temperamental differences, and daily 
stresses, it is to be expected that the appearance of stuttering vary 
naturally between and within individuals who stutter, while also being 
somewhat ecologically predictable (Sheehan, 1969).
7 Loss of agentic control over speech
Overt stuttering spans a wide range of aberrant and involuntary 
behaviors. Most prominent are speech disruptions in the form of 
blocks (e.g., involuntary halts or fixed articulatory postures), 
prolongations (e.g., lengthening sounds), and repetitions (e.g., 
repeating sounds, syllables, or words) that develop in early childhood 
(Bloodstein et  al., 2021). Stuttering has also been associated with 
increased tension and struggle during speech production, resulting in 
a felt experience of effortfulness and a ‘loss of control’ in speech 
(Perkins, 1990; Tichenor and Y aruss, 2019). During moments of 
stuttering, many PWS also exhibit aberrant low-frequency tremor in 
speech articulators and dystonic movements, such as facial grimaces, 
FIGURE 4
Attention hypothesis purports increased attention (or lack of disattending) sustains relatively high sensory precision, resulting in a failure of sensory 
attenuation by people who stutter (PWS; red) relative to people who do not stutter (PWNS; blue).

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 10 frontiersin.org
eye blinks, and head jerks ( Kelly et al., 1995 ; Kiziltan and Akalin, 
1996). As described above, precision estimation reflects the weight 
given to prior expectations or sensory stimuli. Precision also operates 
across multiple hierarchical levels for the initiation of action—shaping 
goal setting and policy selection at higher levels and movement 
segmentation and kinematics at lower levels (Limanowski et al., 2024; 
Proietti et  al., 2023 ). Experimental manipulation of precision 
dynamics at different levels of this hierarchy is currently lacking, but 
computational simulations by Parr and colleagues are suggestive that 
a failure to attenuate sensory precision at the level of policies induces 
akinesia or freezing of motor initiation, akin to Parkinson’s disease 
(Parr et al., 2021). This study also distinguishes spatial and temporal 
precisions—spatial precision refers to the confidence in estimating the 
position of effectors in space. In contrast, temporal precision is the 
confidence afforded to the timing of sensory input. In simulating limb 
movement, Parr et al. found that not attenuating spatial precision 
disrupted motor reflexes akin to motor neuron pathologies, while 
imprecise temporal precision led to disrupted movement coordination. 
Future work is necessary to determine if these computational findings 
are relevant in explaining disordered speech motor control. One may 
speculate that specific disruptions in neuromuscular activation for 
speech may be associated with aberrant spatial precision (e.g., spastic 
dysarthria) and temporal precision (e.g., ataxic dysarthria). Aberrant 
precision dynamics in the continuous inference underlying movement 
trajectories may explain many speech-motor pathologies; however, 
this low-level neuromuscular function is largely unimpaired in those 
who stutter, particularly children soon after onset (Walsh and Smith, 
2013; Smith and Luschei, 1983 ). Instead, the relatively late 
development, situational variability, and linguistic loci of stuttering 
behavior implicate stuttering as a disorder of aberrant policy 
precision—a difficulty in planning syllable sequences to optimally 
minimize expected precision error across longer movement sequences. 
Such a disorder would implicate inefficiencies in the basal ganglia and 
associated cortical areas in estimating and selecting optimal policies 
through dopaminergically-modulated policy precision (Friston et al., 
2012). Over time, chronic disruption to the discrete inferential 
processes of the basal ganglia may impair neural message passing to 
lower-level inferential processes driving continuous muscular 
activation and kinematics (Parr et al., 2021). For example, a subset of 
young CWS develop aberrant neuromuscular pathologies, such as 
tremor of the lips and jaw, in later childhood and adolescence (Kelly 
et  al., 1995 ). The disruptions in policy selection and syllable 
sequencing that underlie stuttering behavior often give rise to broader 
behavioral adaptations aimed at mitigating or avoiding stuttering over 
longer timescales.
Stuttering behavior over longer timescales may be  viewed as 
cognitive and behavioral reactions to an attempt to prevent or avoid 
the more transient behaviors mentioned above, such as 
circumlocution, word substitution, and avoidance [For review, see 
Bloodstein et al. (2021)]. For instance, consider a speaker entering a 
communicative situation and knowing they will have to say a word 
that they often stutter on. They are likely to be uncertain in their ability 
to fluently traverse the linguistic landscape (i.e., Will I stutter or not? 
What course of action should I take to make stuttering less likely? ). 
These cognitions and behaviors that extend beyond the perception-
action cycle may be  the product of, and contribute to, atypical 
precision dynamics afforded to syllable transitions and policies that 
unfold over longer timescales, from phrases to entire conversations. 
Current active inference models (e.g., Markov decision process) 
include precisions associated with policies (i.e., policy precision) that 
transition an agent from one state to the next (i.e., transition precision) 
(Fradkin et al., 2020). This lack of confidence in transitioning from 
one syllable to the next is felt as a series of momentary uncertainties 
analogous to walking a tightrope. In other words, greater uncertainty 
when transitioning from one syllable to the next or when choosing the 
appropriate syllable sequence is likely to increase attention to the 
current sensory input. This dynamic has been previously described as 
anticipatory struggle (Bloodstein, 1972). On the contrary, the less 
sensory precision interferes with syllable initiation, the greater 
transition precision will be afforded when moving from one syllable 
to the next. Stuttering behavior largely occurs on the initial syllable of 
an utterance because higher uncertainty fosters deployment of 
selective attention towards high information content, thus boosting 
sensory precision ( Taylor, 1966; Goldman-Eisler, 1958). As the 
speaker traverses the linguistic landscape, particularly during open 
discourse, speech exhibits a decreasing information rate (Giulianelli 
and Fernández, 2021), resulting in less likelihood of stuttering across 
an utterance (Quarrington, 1965). This is consistent with Sheehan’s 
fear reduction hypothesis (Sheehan, 1953), may be due to the previous 
stuttering behavior removing the speaker’s attention away from the 
next syllable.
If stuttering becomes chronic, communicative apprehension may 
grow such that a speaker learns to mistrust their overall ability to 
minimize expected prediction errors into the future. For instance, the 
speaker becomes uncertain about how to transmit the larger message, 
resulting in word substitutions and circumlocutions, that indicate a 
loss of agentic control over the communicative environment (Perkins, 
1990). This uncertainty in selecting the best policy, or sequence of 
actions, is reflected by low policy precision ( Sandved-Smith et al., 
2021). Chronic disruption to perception-action cycling may induce a 
vicious cycle of attentional capture to specific sounds, words, and 
situations that further increases sensory precision that is causal to 
stuttering behavior ( Kessler, 2016). When stuttering occurs on a 
particular word, greater attention to that word will increase sensory 
precision in future scenarios and this may be felt as premonition of 
future stuttering ( Jackson et  al., 2019 ; Cholin et  al., 2016 ). This 
phenomena fuels the long-known ‘consistency’ and ‘adjacency’ effects 
in which stuttering predictably occurs across repeated utterances (Tate 
and Cullinan, 1962; Avari and Bloodstein, 1974). This chronic and 
transient increase in sensory precision via attention is analogous to 
previous theories linking stuttering to excessive self-monitoring 
during speech production (Bernstein Ratner and Wijnen, 2007). The 
environmental unpredictability that comes with the variability of 
stuttering may lead to persistent uncertainty and prediction errors. If 
the agent cannot act to reliably reduce prediction error, either because 
of weak prior expectations or because the environment is too volatile, 
a lack of control or agency may emerge. If the model consistently 
assigns excessive precision to incoming sensory signals, a state of 
heightened arousal or vigilance may become habitual. Agentic loss of 
control over communicative ability can be viewed in active inference 
as reduced transition and policy precision to such a degree that acting 
for information gain (i.e., exploration) is deemed too risky. Instead, 
expected prediction error is minimized by limiting goal-directed 
action. For PWS, the perceived perils of stuttering can lead one to 
avoid speaking and/or choose a lifestyle centered on avoiding potential 
stuttering (i.e., covert stuttering). This strategy is effective at 
Usler 10.3389/fnhum.2025.1498423
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 11 frontiersin.org
minimizing uncertainty in the short-term, but at the expense of long-
term wellbeing because information gain is necessary for model 
updating in a dynamically changing world. This paradox of choosing 
between approach and avoidance is analogous to the ‘dark room 
problem’ (Van de Cruys et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2012). Inversely, 
uncertainty reduction during speech is likely to be fostered through 
active exploration of the world.
One can speculate that this shift in relative precision from sensory 
input to prior expectation facilitates the ‘adaptation effect’ in which 
PWS exhibit a gradual reduction in disfluencies when repeatedly 
reading or speaking the same passage within a short timeframe 
(Harris, 1942 ; Wingate, 1986 ). With repeated speech, prior 
expectations are strengthened, and uncertainty is reduced. This may 
lower attention-moderated sensory precision and increase policy 
precision as speech production becomes more automatic. Thus, the 
adaptation effect emerges as speech transitions from a high-
uncertainty, effortful process to a predictable, automatic one. More 
generally speaking, this increased confidence (in prior expectation) 
has been expressed by PWS who actively communicate regardless of 
occasional stuttering behavior (Finn and Felsenfeld, 2004). This idea 
of openly stuttering and ‘saying what one wants to say’ has been 
clinically operationalized by therapeutic programs for stuttering (Byrd 
et al., 2021; Sisskin, 2018). Conversely, feelings of stress or anxiety may 
increase the likelihood of stuttering by increasing an inward and 
negatively-valanced self-consciousness during speech production, 
which is likely to boost sensory precision precisely on those words that 
are most feared or anticipated for stuttering to occur. Stress increases 
epistemic uncertainty during speech planning, making speech less 
automatic and more effortful, reinforcing the cycle of self-monitoring 
and increased disfluency.
Chronic stuttering behavior also negatively impacts well-being 
beyond speech and language (Jacobs et al., 2021; Pruett et al., 2021). 
Metabolic processes regulate energy production and expenditure to 
keep the brain functioning within an optimal range, particularly 
during periods of stress ( Peters et  al., 2017 ). By minimizing 
uncertainty, active inference optimizes energy utilization and reduces 
metabolic costs (Barrett et al., 2016). The brain is largely efficient in its 
energy expenditure during periods of low uncertainty via optimal 
precision weighting facilitated by synaptic transmission (Harris et al., 
2012). Conversely, the processing demands that come with selective 
attention and boosting sensory precision during uncertainty are 
metabolically expensive (Peters et al., 2017). This energy expenditure 
is felt as cognitive effort—the cost of frequently updating prior 
expectations in response to frequent prediction error (Parr et al., 2023; 
Zénon et  al., 2019). For many people, speaking involves minimal 
cognitive effort because they rely on precise policies (i.e., you know 
what you want to say) based on precise transitions (i.e., you easily 
move from one syllable to the next) and precise prior expectations 
(i.e., you hear what you expected). For PWS, speech is computationally 
and metabolically expensive. It was recently found that CWS exhibit 
greater gray matter volume, compared to non-stuttering children, in 
brain areas correlated with gene expression involved with metabolic 
function. This suggests a relationship between energy metabolism and 
stuttering in children ( Boley et  al., 2021 ; Chow et  al., 2020 ). 
Furthermore, many PWS exhibit gene mutations associated with 
lysosomal enzyme trafficking (Han et al., 2019). Although it remains 
unknown how these mutations and lysosomal storage abnormalities 
relate to stuttering, it has been proposed that a deficiency in lysosomal 
function may result in reduced brain metabolism or neural energy 
supply (Alm, 2021a; Sheikh Bahaei et al., 2023). Chronic interoceptive 
experience of disfluency is felt as fatigue, anxiety, and perhaps even 
depression (Stephan et al., 2016). For many PWS, quality of life is 
reduced by diminished vitality, increased fatigue, and other depressive 
symptoms (Bills, 1934 ; Craig et  al., 2009 ). This cost is likely to 
be particularly acute for PWS who rely on continual covert actions 
and avoidance behavior to ‘pass as fluent’ (Constantino et al., 2017). 
Speech production can be both cognitively and metabolically taxing 
for PWS, with inefficiencies in prediction error minimization leading 
to effortful speech and decreased overall quality of life. This 
underscores the importance of fluency in everyday functioning, 
particularly speech production.
Fluency can be  understood as the process in which model 
accuracy and complexity are balanced to achieve optimal prediction 
error minimization via perception-action cycling. As a result, fluent 
movements are perceived as smooth, graceful, and effortless, at the 
price of minimal computational and metabolic cost. This concept 
aligns with theories in cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology, 
where fluency reflects mastery and efficiency of cognition and 
action. The framework of active inference, a corollary of the free 
energy principle, is conceptually similar to the minimization of the 
Lagrangian (i.e., difference between kinetic and potential energies) 
over time in classical mechanics. This fundamental aspect of nature, 
the principle of least action , ensures that the dynamics of physical 
systems are such that the ‘action’ is minimized or stationary [for a 
review of this principle, see Gray (2018)]. For our purposes, fluency 
can be conceptualized as the enactment of the principle of least 
action for communicative behavior, akin to Zipf ’s principle of least 
effort (Zipf, 2016). Stuttering, as a disorder of fluency, may reflect a 
chronic inability to minimize prediction error, resulting in 
disrupted transitional flow in perception-action cycling. As a result, 
stuttering manifests as the involuntary, transient, and habitual 
inhibition of syllable initiation that makes speech effortful, 
fragmented, often accompanied by physical tension or 
compensatory behaviors, which may paradoxically exacerbate the 
symptomology akin to Huxley’s law of reversed effort ( Huxley, 
2021). These issues may stem from deeper neural mechanisms, 
implicating neuromodulatory systems.
8 Stuttering as synaptopathy
As stated above, the active inference account of stuttering 
proposed above maps onto hierarchical and temporally deep message-
passing models of the brain (Parr et al., 2021; Parr and Friston, 2018). 
Sensory prediction errors ascend hierarchical subcortical pathways 
from the inferior colliculus to the thalamic nuclei (e.g., ventral 
posterior nucleus for proprioceptive prediction error and medial 
geniculate nucleus for auditory prediction error) ( Carbajal and 
Malmierca, 2018). Upon reaching layer IV of the cortex, prediction 
errors are resolved by prior expectations at higher cortical levels 
(I-III), with this inferential processing becoming more categorical and 
abstract as residual prediction errors move anteriorly to the prefrontal 
cortex (Carbajal and Malmierca, 2018; Escera, 2023). Neural circuits 
at higher (i.e., more anterior) levels of the model encode sequences of 
Usler 10.3389/fnhum.2025.1498423
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org
information from lower levels, such as syllables, words, and phrases 
(See Figure 5). Predictions are sent via upper motor neurons from 
cortical layer V to the brainstem and spinal cord. Within closed-loop 
motor reflex arcs, this prediction is subtracted from the incoming 
proprioceptive input, resulting in prediction error that is minimized 
by movement.
This neural network is supplemented by connections between 
the cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia that assist with the 
computation of precision-weighting, expected prediction error, and 
the selection of optimal policies. A connection between the cortex 
and the thalamic nuclei (i.e., pulvinar) mediates the precision-
weighting of ascending prediction errors ( Kanai et  al., 1668 ). 
Predictions are also sent from layer V to the basal ganglia, which is 
divided into two pathways: the direct pathway, which activates (i.e., 
disinhibits) thalamic signaling to the motor cortices, and the indirect 
pathway, which inhibits activation. The direct pathway, which 
includes the striatum and internal globus pallidus, may compute 
expected prediction error of a particular policy. The direct pathway 
promotes goal-directed action by selecting policies with relatively 
low expected prediction error. The indirect pathway counters this 
motivation by suppressing implausible policies and promoting more 
conservative policies (i.e., habits) based on previous experience. 
These two pathways combine at the internal globus pallidus and 
send select optimal policies to the thalamus ( Parr, 2020).
Current theories of predictive processing have implicated 
neuromodulation as the key mechanism underlying precision 
dynamics ( Parr et  al., 2021 ). Acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and 
dopamine have all been associated with precision parameters and have 
all been associated with stuttering behavior ( Ekhart et  al., 2021 ). 
Norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that modulates transition 
precision during unexpected uncertainty ( Parr and Friston, 2018 ; 
Zhao et al., 2018), has been shown to increase significantly in PWS 
during speech, perhaps due to increased sympathetic activation 
(Edgren et al., 1969). Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that encodes 
reward prediction error (Schultz et al., 1997). From an active inference 
perspective, dopamine modulates policy precision and sets the 
balance between the direct and indirect pathways in inferring which 
policies should and should not be selected, respectively (Parr, 2020). 
Stuttering has been primarily associated with excessive dopaminergic 
signaling in the basal ganglia ( Maguire et al., 2002; Maguire et al., 
2020; Wu et al., 1997). However, stuttering may more generally occur 
if dopamine deviates from an optimal range ( Sheikh Bahaei et al., 
2023; Ekhart et al., 2021; Alm, 2021b). Overly precise policies due to 
a hyperdopaminergic state can result in overly fixed movement 
patterns, including cognitive inflexibility and perseverative behavior 
(Berridge et al., 2005). Excessive dopamine may reflect high precision 
in a chosen policy, which reduces prediction error in subcortical 
auditory pathways, including the inferior colliculus (Valdés-Baizabal 
FIGURE 5
Simple hierarchical model with lower levels including subcortical areas processing ascending sensory prediction error (red) which are resolved by 
multiple levels of descending predictions (i.e., prior expectations).

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 13 frontiersin.org
et al., 2020). Conversely, a hypodopaminergic state and under-precise 
policies can lead to effortful and slowed movement ( Bologna 
et al., 2020).
Acetylcholine has been implicated as a neuromodulator of sensory 
precision (Pérez-González et al., 2024). The prefrontal cortex connects 
to the basal forebrain, which releases acetylcholine to modulate 
sensory gain in response to prediction error (Yu and Dayan, 2002). A 
reciprocal interaction between dopamine and acetylcholine within the 
basal ganglia for the control of movement has been long known, with 
dopamine regulating the release of acetylcholine in the striatum 
(Surmeier and Graybiel, 2012 ). Activation of striatal cholinergic 
interneurons can also elicit dopamine release ( Shin et  al., 2015 ). 
Although their dual influence is complex and likely context-specific, 
an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine may underlie at 
least some aspects of stuttering behavior (Ekhart et al., 2021). It is clear 
that much needs to be done to understand how neuromodulatory 
systems and their interactions may influence stuttering behavior. 
Although neural process theories based on active inference principles 
are currently in infant stages and highly speculative, stuttering may 
be  viewed as a synaptopathy resulting from atypical precision 
dynamics (Friston, 2023).
9 Current limitations, future 
directions, and clinical implications
Applying principles of active inference to stuttering does reveal 
several limitations. One major issue is the complexity of stuttering 
etiology. Recent work on the etiology of stuttering has identified 
potential neurobiological abnormalities across numerous levels of 
analysis [For review, see Sheikh Bahaei et al. (2023) ]. Stuttering is 
highly influenced by genetic, biological, and even social factors, which 
are not fully addressed, or have yet to be addressed, by active inference 
models. Additionally, the neural mechanisms underlying stuttering, 
such as those in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, remain unclear in 
this framework. Little is understood about the effects of the corpus 
callosum and hemispheric lateralization, as well as the role of 
numerous subcortical areas, such as the amygdala and cerebellum. 
These brain regions are central to speech motor control and stuttering 
(Guenther, 2016), but have yet to be widely incorporated into active 
inference models. Other models, such as the DIV A model, have a 
more comprehensive set of neurophysiological correlates. Unlike the 
DIV A and HSFC models, a well-developed model of speech 
production that explains articulatory kinematics based on the 
principles of active inference has yet to be  fully developed. This 
proposed account of stuttering behavior is limited by the nascent state 
of the concept of active inference and related neural process theories.
The functional role of neural oscillations within the active 
inference framework is also currently unclear, with evidence 
suggesting these low-level oscillations may play a role in transmitting 
prediction and prediction error across the generative model. Although 
there is considerable circumstantial evidence that atypical 
low-frequency oscillations associated with speech preparation and 
production are associated with stuttering behavior, more research is 
necessary to better understand this relationship. Determining the 
neural correlates of precision dynamics is difficult because it likely 
involves the integration of different modalities (e.g., exteroception, 
interoception, proprioception), as well as combining the precisions of 
prior expectations and sensory input. It is important that the 
theoretical assumptions of active inference are not contingent on any 
particular theory of neural mechanisms.
Active inference provides future opportunities for empirical 
validation through discrete and continuous computational 
modeling, largely using partially observable Markov decision process 
(POMDP) models ( Smith et al., 2022 ). POMDPs evaluate action 
sequences based on their likelihood of achieving desired outcomes. 
At the same time, continuous models translate these plans into 
action, bridging higher-level discrete cognitive and linguistic 
processes with lower-level motor processes that drive the movements 
of muscle and bone. Recent computational work, largely in the 
domains of active vision ( Parr et  al., 2019 ) and active listening 
(Friston et al., 2021) may be translated into computational modeling 
of (disordered) speech production. These models, using discrete 
time steps and variables, provide a formal framework for testing 
active inference assumptions.
Future modeling of speech perception and production based on 
active inference will likely increase our understanding of the 
relationship between precision dynamics and stuttering behavior in 
ways that inform the clinical interventions of stuttering that alter 
precision dynamics across various levels of the hierarchical model. 
Any protocol that enhances the predictability of the environment, 
thereby reducing uncertainty and sensory precision, via cognitive 
behavioral training or feedback modulation, could recalibrate 
aberrant precision dynamics to reduce the elicitation of stuttering 
behaviors. Behavioral approaches that aim to re-structure speech, 
such as ‘fluency shaping’ or ‘stuttering modification’ ( Guitar and 
McCauley, 2009), and more recent approaches that focus on effective 
communication, such as Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering 
(Sisskin, 2018) and CARE Model of Treatment for Stuttering (Byrd 
et al., 2024), could be reframed as strategies that foster precise prior 
expectations of communicative competence up the model hierarchy. 
More immediate techniques that directly alter current sensory 
feedback (e.g., masking, DAF/FAF , etc.) can also be  effective at 
manipulating sensory precision at syllable initiation, that often 
dramatically alleviates stuttering behavior. However, these 
immediate positive effects are likely to dissipate without a concordant 
effort to increase prior precision of sensory consequences of speech. 
Alternately, the use of psychedelics may alleviate stuttering behavior 
in some individuals ( Jackson et al., 2024 ) by decreasing high-level 
prior precisions regarding one’s communicative abilities in 
accordance with the Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics (REBUS) 
model (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019 ). Simply put, stuttering 
may only be ameliorated in the long term by developing high-level 
prior expectations that stuttering is not likely to occur ( Finn and 
Felsenfeld, 2004).
10 Conclusion
Despite extensive scientific investigation over the past century, 
the complex and functional nature of stuttering has thwarted 
attempts at a parsimonious explanation. Active inference is a 
predictive processing account of sentient behavior that may help to 
explain the etiology and phenomenology of stuttering behavior. 
Stuttering may arise from atypical sensory precision and prediction 
error dynamics, inhibiting syllable initiation. High sensory precision,

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 14 frontiersin.org
resulting from mistimed precision dynamics or excessive attentional 
focus can impede the sensory attenuation required for fluent speech 
initiation. Reframing stuttering as a synaptopathy integrates 
neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions, 
suggesting disruptions in precision-weighting mediated by 
neuromodulatory systems like dopamine and acetylcholine. As a 
result, the development of aberrant perception-action cycling leads 
to a vicious cycle that disrupts speech fluency.

Glossary
Acetylcholine - A neurotransmitter involved in modulating sensory 
precision and attentional focus.

cognitive science describing agents minimize the difference (or free 
energy) between their generative modal and the environment by 
perception and action.
Adjacency Effect - The tendency for stuttering to occur near 
previously stuttered words in repeated speech trials.
Adaptation Effect - The phenomenon where repeated readings or 
speaking of the same text lead to a reduction in stuttering.
Allostasis - The process by which the brain and body maintain 
stability by predicting and adapting to environmental demands.
Attention - The cognitive process of selectively focusing on certain 
stimuli while ignoring others, which influences sensory precision and 
prediction error minimization.
Basal Ganglia - A group of subcortical brain structures involved in 
motor control, speech production, and decision-making, often linked 
to stuttering.
Bayesian Inference - A statistical method where prior knowledge 
(beliefs) is updated with new evidence to generate a posterior belief.
Bayesian Priors - Pre-existing beliefs or expectations that influence 
how new sensory information is interpreted.
Cholinergic System - The neural system associated with acetylcholine, 
which plays a role in attention and sensory precision.
Choral Speech - A fluency-enhancing condition in which a person 
who stutters speaks in unison with another speaker.
Confidence - A measure of precision in probabilistic inference, 
reflecting the certainty of predictions about sensory input or motor 
actions. Higher confidence corresponds to greater precision in prior 
expectations or policies.
Cortico-Basal Ganglia-Thalamo-Cortical Loop - A neural circuit that 
regulates motor control and speech, implicated in stuttering.
Covert Stuttering - Avoidance behaviors, word substitutions, or 
circumlocutions used to conceal stuttering.
Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) - A technique where a speaker 
hears their own voice with a slight delay, which can either alleviate or 
induce stuttering depending on timing.
Distraction Effect - The reduction of stuttering when attention is 
directed away from speech, often through external stimuli or dual-
task conditions.
Dopamine - A neurotransmitter involved in reward processing, 
motor control, and policy precision, often linked to stuttering due to 
its role in speech initiation and movement regulation.
Dystonia - A movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle 
contractions, sometimes associated with stuttering-related tremors.
Epistemic Uncertainty - A lack of knowledge about a situation, 
leading to increased attention to incoming sensory information to 
resolve uncertainty.
Exteroception - The perception of external stimuli, such as auditory 
feedback during speech production.
Fluency Shaping - A speech therapy approach focused on modifying 
speech patterns to promote fluent speech.

Friston, stating that self-organizing biological systems minimize 
surprise (or free energy) by predicting and adapting to 
their environment.
Frequency-Altered Feedback (FAF) - A method that changes the pitch 
of a speaker’s voice in real time, often used to modify 
stuttering behaviors.
Generative Model - A hierarchical neural model that predicts sensory 
input by integrating prior expectations with real-time 
sensory feedback.
Hierarchical Predictive Processing - A concept in active inference 
where higher-level brain areas generate predictions that are compared 
with lower-level sensory inputs to minimize prediction errors.
Homeostasis - The process of maintaining stable internal conditions 
in the body, contrasted with allostasis, which involves 
predictive regulation.
Law of Reversed Effort - A principle, proposed by Aldous Huxley, 
suggesting that the harder one tries to control a process (such as 
speech fluency), the more likely they are to experience failure due to 
excessive self-monitoring.
Interoception - The perception of internal bodily sensations, such as 
heartbeat, respiration, and muscle tension, which can influence speech 
production and stuttering.
Likelihood Function - In Bayesian inference, the probability of 
observing a particular sensory input given a specific state of the world.
Markov Decision Process (MDP) - A mathematical framework for 
modeling decision-making where an agent transitions between states 
based on probabilistic policies.
