Abstract 
Anxious emotional states are known to disrupt both decision-making processes and the 
control of dextrous motor actions. Theoretical accounts such as the Entropy Model of 
Uncertainty and Active Inference have characterised anxiety as closely related to situational 
estimates of uncertainty and a (perceived) inability to reliably predict future states (e.g., 
sensory outcomes) based on the current state. Computational work has shown that anxiety-
induced uncertainty alters the rate at which we learn about the environment, but the 
subsequent impact on predictive sensorimotor control remains to be understood. In the 
present work we tested whether anxiety alters predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms, 
as suggested by uncertainty-based accounts. Thirty participants completed an experimental 
task that consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality. 
Participants were subjected to conditions designed to induce states of high or low anxiety 
using performance incentives and social-evaluative pressure. We measured subsequent 
effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, task performance, and eye 
movements. Under high pressure conditions we observed visual sampling of the task 
environment characterised by higher variability and entropy of position prior to release of the 
projectile, consistent with an active attempt to reduce uncertainty. Computational modelling 
of predictive beliefs, using gaze data as inputs to a partially observable Markov decision 
process model, indicated that trial-to-trial updating of predictive beliefs was reduced during 
anxiety, suggesting that updates to priors were constrained. These results support the idea that 
organisms may attempt to counter anxiety-related uncertainty by moving towards more 
familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.

This research uncovers how anxiety disrupts sensorimotor control through alterations to 
predictive mechanisms. We observed increased visual sampling under high-pressure 
conditions during a manual interception task, consistent with theoretical models of anxiety as 
a state of predictive uncertainty. Our findings, based on advanced modelling techniques 
revealed constrained trial-to-trial updating of eye movements during anxiety, shedding new 
light on how organisms cope with uncertainty by gravitating towards familiar sensorimotor 
patterns.

Counteracting Uncertainty: Exploring the Impact of 
Anxiety on Predictive Sensorimotor Control 
Mechanisms in a Manual Interception Task 
 
Introduction 
Both dextrous motor actions and control of our visual system are thought to depend on 1 
predictions about future states of the world and our own body (1–3). Skilled movement also 2 
depends on the ability to flexibly adapt and update those predictions according to new 3 
contexts or new sensory evidence. As anxious emotional states can bias the way in which we 4 
make and update predictions (4–6), they can disrupt motor actions with potentially damaging 5 
consequences (7). It is well known that during highly pressurised situations, such as a job 6 
interview or the final of a sporting event, people can experience drastic breakdowns in task 7 
performance (8–10). In the present work we sought to understand the impact of anxiety on 8 
predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms. We first outline theoretical approaches that 9 
have described anxiety in terms of uncertainty or entropy and how sensorimotor control 10 
might reflect an active attempt to resolve that uncertainty.  11 
Anxiety is a negative emotional response to a perceived threat (11, 12). It is often 12 
characterised along cognitive (worry) and somatic (physiological arousal) dimensions. 13 
Anxiety can lead to distinct difficulties learning about the world and making decisions (13, 14 
14), and can particularly disrupt the ability to adapt to changing task conditions (5, 15, 16). 15 
One potential explanation for these effects is that anxiety may alter the way in which we 16 
make predictions about the world around us. For instance, several theoretical accounts have 17 
characterised anxiety as closely related to situational estimates of uncertainty and a 18 
(perceived) inability to reliably predict the absence of threats (4, 12, 17–19). For instance, 19 
Hirsh, Mar, and Peterson’s (20) Entropy Model of Uncertainty (EMU) describes 20 
uncontrollable or unpredictable situations as creating an aversive high-entropy state, in which 21 
an organism experiences a reduced ability to predict successive states (e.g., sensory 22 
outcomes) based on the current state. According to the EMU, organisms find such uncertainty 23 
aversive and experience it subjectively as anxiety.  24

 4 
The EMU characterisation of anxiety aligns closely with other dynamical systems 25 
approaches like the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference, which similarly 26 
conceptualise the goal of a cognitive-behavioural system as the minimization of internal 27 
entropy (or ‘free energy’) and an increase in prediction success (21–23). From this 28 
perspective, to cope with instability (e.g., during anxiety) organisms should seek to return to 29 
familiar low-entropy states. Under the FEP (24), this tendency to return to low entropy states 30 
is, by definition, true of a self-organising system as they must resist dissipative forces (i.e., 31 
states of high entropy) to maintain their own integrity and existence. One way to achieve this 32 
goal in the face of anxiety-induced uncertainty, is to adopt behaviours like withdrawal or 33 
avoidance to evade the aversive stimulus. Alternatively, the organism may seek out new 34 
perceptual information that will disambiguate any uncertainty (e.g., looking under the bed to 35 
check for monsters). These uncertainty-reducing behaviours may in some circumstances be 36 
detrimental, such as the sportsperson who’s movements become rigid and constrained (7), but 37 
in others may be beneficial (e.g., (25)) or just neutral.  38 
It has previously been suggested that an adaptive response in times of uncertainty is to 39 
modify the rate with which you update your beliefs about the world; learning faster allows 40 
one’s model of the world to better reflect the current ‘reality’ of an environment (25). 41 
Neurocomputational work has illustrated that this is indeed the case for perceptual learning 42 
(18) where learning rates (i.e., the speed at which we revise prior expectations) appear to be 43 
increased by noradrenergic up-regulation of prediction error signal strength. What remains to 44 
be determined, is whether anxiety-related uncertainty similarly induces faster updating of 45 
predictive aspects of sensorimotor control1, or if these might instead be impaired. While 46 
quickly revising predictions may be beneficial in some instances (e.g., when conditions are 47 
changing or inherently unstable), a constantly high learning rate would generally disrupt the 48 
formation of appropriate action beliefs or models (i.e., by limiting a person’s ability to 49 
disregard atypical or uncharacteristic task outcomes). As a result, participants may display 50 
highly variable and reflexive sensorimotor responses, which correspond less accurately to the 51 
surrounding performance context. Moreover, it has previously been reported that participants 52 
will constrain movement degrees of freedom when placed in more unpredictable task 53 
 
1 Here we refer to aspects of movement that are driven by expectations, like anticipatory saccades that jump 
ahead of a moving target or looking towards the most likely ball release location, rather than predictive 
mechanisms like efference copy.

environments as an active attempt to reduce uncertainty (26, 27). These findings align with 54 
theoretical models of impedance control in the motor system where co-activation of 55 
antagonistic muscle pairs is a natural response to unpredictable perturbations (28). There is 56 
initial evidence that updating of predictions that guide sensorimotor control may indeed be 57 
slowed. Using a combination of EEG and computational modelling, Sporn et al. (29) 58 
demonstrated that rates of motor learning were reduced under anxiety, and that anxious states 59 
impaired reward processing and the updating of predictions about rewards associated with 60 
motor sequences. Similarly, Ellmers et al. (30) found that participants’ approach velocity in 61 
the moving escalator paradigm (31) was updated more slowly under state anxiety. In essence, 62 
constraining updates to sensorimotor predictions could help the organism stay in familiar 63 
states when uncertainty is already high. Consequently, there may be important differences in 64 
how perceived uncertainty influences prediction updating in overt motor and oculomotor 65 
actions compared to simpler (perceptual) associative learning tasks.  66 
The present study 67 
Previous studies have shown that visual attention can be disrupted during anxious 68 
states, leading to subsequent breakdowns in task performance (32–34). An open question is 69 
what effect anxious states have specifically on the predictive mechanisms that underpin gaze 70 
control (35, 36). In the present study, participants performed an interceptive task in a virtual 71 
reality environment (see Fig 1) while we manipulated performance incentives to induce 72 
situational pressure (as in (32, 37)). We measured subsequent effects on physiological 73 
arousal, self-reported state anxiety, task performance, and eye movements. To examine 74 
changes to predictive beliefs underpinning gaze control, we adopted computational modelling 75 
approaches that are increasingly being employed in psychiatry and clinical neuropsychology 76 
(38–40).  77 
Our hypotheses were based on EMU and FEP characterisations of anxiety as a state of 78 
entropy which organisms will seek to resolve (20, 41). Our primary hypothesis was that 79 
updates to predictive eye movements (relating to the release location of a projectile) over 80 
trials would be impaired during state anxiety, as previous findings have indicated that 81 
participants may constrain both their movements and their rate of prediction updating under 82 
uncertainty (26, 29). We also examined some secondary eye movement metrics to understand 83 
how anxiety influenced oculomotor control. If participants are indeed uncertain about their 84 
ability to predict future states during anxiety, we would also expect impaired anticipatory 85 
tracking of predictable moving targets during the interceptive task. Given the importance of 86

 6 
prior expectations in interceptive motor tasks (e.g., see (42)), such uncertainty would likely 87 
be reflected in more variable, stimulus-driven (as opposed to prediction-driven) scan patterns 88 
under anxiety. We therefore hypothesised that high pressure conditions would also lead to 89 
greater variance and higher entropy of eye movements prior to the release of the interception 90 
target, as well as performance decrements.  91 
Methods 92 
Design  93 
We used a repeated measures design in which all participants took part in both high 94 
and low pressure conditions, the order of which was counterbalanced across participants.   95 
Transparency and openness 96 
We report sample size determination, data exclusions, and all manipulations in the 97 
study. All data and analysis code are available at: https://osf.io/2amdv/. The hypotheses were 98 
not preregistered. Data were analysed using RStudio v1.4.1106 (43).  99 
Participants 100 
Thirty participants (12 female; Mage = 20.8; SDage = 1.2; range = 18-23 years) took 101 
part in the study. Participants were recruited from the undergraduate student population at the 102 
host University. Eye tracking data was lost for one participant in one condition due to a 103 
recording error. In a previous study, we observed effects in the range of R2 = .03-.06 for 104 
changes in predictive gaze position in this task (44). Power curves using the simr package for 105 
R (45) showed that for linear mixed effects models (with participant as a random factor), 36 106 
trials for 30 participants was sufficient to detect effects at the lower end of this range with 107 
more than 85% power (see power curves in the supplementary files: https://osf.io/2amdv/). 108 
Written informed consent from all participants was obtained in accordance with British 109 
Psychological Society guidelines, and the study received approval from the Departmental 110 
Ethics Committee (University of Exeter, UK; REF: 520338). The study methods closely 111 
adhered to the approved procedures and the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection was 112 
completed between December 2022 and May 2023.  113 
Task and Materials 114

The experimental task consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in 115 
virtual reality (VR). The task was a simplified racquetball game in which participants were 116 
instructed to intercept a ball projected from one of two possible locations at the front of the 117 
court using a virtual racquet operated by a tracked hand controller. Participants were given no 118 
prior cues as to which of the two locations the ball would appear from on each trial, but there 119 
was an auditory tone signalling the start of each trial. Overall, there was a 50/50 split of left 120 
and right sided trials which were presented to the participants in one of four pseudo-121 
randomised orders (counterbalanced across participants). However, the trial orders were 122 
designed to be volatile, with periods where the projection location was clearly biased to one 123 
side or the other to induce probabilistic learning. Illustrations of these orders are available in 124 
the online supplementary files (https://osf.io/pwmhy). Participants were given no information 125 
about the statistical structure of the task or the optimal strategy, so that any emerging eye 126 
movement patterns reflected a spontaneous response to the task structure. Balls were 5.7 cm 127 
in diameter and resembled the visual appearance of a real-world tennis ball. These balls 128 
remained visible from the moment of their release, through to the end of each trial, meaning 129 
that participants could observe the true projected location regardless of whether they 130 
intercepted or missed the target stimulus. The visible racquet in VR was 0.6 × 0.3 × 0.01 m, 131 
although its physical thickness was exaggerated by 20 cm to facilitate the detection of ball-to-132 
racquet collisions.  133 
The virtual environment, which had the visual appearance of an indoor racquetball 134 
court, was developed using the gaming engine Unity (v2019.3.1f; Unity Technologies, San 135 
Francisco, CA) (see Fig 1). The same task has been used to study predictive eye movements 136 
in previous papers (44, 46). The task was displayed using an HTC Vive head-mounted 137 
display (HTC Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan). The HTC-Vive is a high-precision, consumer-138 
grade VR system which has proven valid for small-area movement research tasks (field of 139 
view: 110°, accuracy: 1.5 cm, jitter: 0.5 mm, latency: 22ms; (47, 48)). Two ‘lighthouse’ base 140 
stations projecting infra-red light act as a reference point to record movements of the headset 141 
and hand controller at 90 Hz. The headset features inbuilt eye-tracking, which uses binocular 142 
dark pupil tracking to monitor gaze at 120 Hz (spatial accuracy: 0.5–1.1°; latency: 10 ms, 143 
headset display resolution: 1440 × 1600 pixels per eye). Gaze was calibrated over five virtual 144 
locations prior to each condition, and upon any obvious displacement of the headset during 145 
trials.  146

Note: The ball was projected from one of the two locations on the front wall. The ball passed 150 
the player without bouncing and they were instructed to intercept it with the racquet (videos 151 
of hit and miss trials of the task are available online: https://osf.io/2amdv/). The score counter 152 
was displayed right at the top of the participant’s field of view and increased with every 153 
successful interception during the high pressure condition. In the low pressure condition 154 
(right) the score was not counted, and the red ‘recording’ text was replaced with ‘not 155 
recording’.  156 
 157 
Measures 158 
Anxiety 159 
State anxiety. State anxiety (S-ANX) during each experimental condition was 160 
assessed using The Anxiety Thermometer (49), which requires participants to report their 161 
anxiety at the current moment on a simple scale ranging from 0-10 (0 = not at all anxious; 10 162 
= extremely anxious). This is a time-efficient measurement tool that has been used in related 163 
studies that presented low- and high-threat conditions (37).  164 
Heart rate. Heart rate was used to index sympathetic nervous system activation 165 
changes related to anxious states. Participants wore a Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor (Polar 166 
Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) around the chest, with data recorded via a Polar 2 Heart Rate 167 
Monitor Transmitter Watch (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). The Polar H10 has a 168 

Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 9 
100Hz sample rate and values were recorded from the watch at 1 minute intervals and 169 
averaged across each block of trials. Reported values were baselined to participants’ resting 170 
HR, which was taken over a 2 minute period while they were seated.  171 
Eye tracking 172 
Gaze-in-world coordinates (i.e., the intersection point of the gaze vector with the task 173 
environment) were recorded from the VR eye tracking system and then denoised with a three 174 
frame moving median filter and a second-order 15 Hz lowpass Butterworth filter (50). We 175 
subsequently calculated the following metrics:  176 
Predictive eye movements.  177 
The primary variable of interest, was the predictive eye movement that took place 178 
immediately before ball release. Predictive gaze location, was defined as the horizontal (x-179 
coordinate) gaze position (i.e., gaze vector intersection point with the world) at the 180 
termination of the auditory tones, averaged over a 50ms window. Following Harris et al. (44) 181 
this was taken as the most critical moment for anticipating the projection location and 182 
therefore the critical eye movement feature that would reveal participants’ prediction about 183 
the upcoming trial. The predictive gaze location variable was then used as an input to model 184 
the updating of sensorimotor predictions over trials (described in the Active Inference 185 
Modelling section below). Our previous work using this task has shown that participants 186 
either make an overt prediction with their eyes (directing gaze to one of the two projection 187 
locations) or make no prediction and ‘hedge their bets’ by looking directly between the two 188 
locations (51). The fact that participants do not have to look at either location means that 189 
trials in which they choose to direct gaze towards one of the two locations is a strong 190 
indication of their expectation about the most likely upcoming release location. We therefore 191 
treated predictive gaze location as a discrete variable (left/right/centre); the central half of the 192 
space between the two locations (10.9o of visual angle) was treated as non-predictive and 193 
those outside as left or right predictions (as in (51)). This approach allowed us to adopt the 194 
widely used discrete state space approach to modelling active inference (40, 52) to infer the 195 
underlying belief (most likely location) from the eye position (anticipating left/right/neither). 196 
Pre-release variability and complexity 197 
To address our secondary hypotheses, we examined patterns of eye movement shifts 198 
prior to release relating to (i) variability of position and (ii) complexity (entropy) of the signal 199 
(see example plots in Fig 2). Variability of eye position has been used in previous studies 200 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 10 
(e.g., in driving tasks; (53)) to indicate anxiety-induced disruptions to gaze. Gaze variability 201 
was defined as the 2-dimensional standard deviation of the gaze intersection position for the 202 
period from the trial start until the ball release cue. Here, we were interested in the eye 203 
movements that occurred just before the ball was projected from one of the two wall 204 
locations, as they would indicate participant’s state predictions (e.g., about where the ball 205 
would emerge from) and expected uncertainty (i.e., relating to the environment and its 206 
‘hidden’ task probabilities). Gaze entropy was calculated to index signal complexity, for 207 
which we adopted a sample entropy measure calculated from the natural logarithm of the 208 
conditional probability that a series similar for n points remains similar at the next point (see 209 
(54)). Entropy was calculated separately for horizontal and vertical planes. Entropy can be 210 
used to index the level of randomness or complexity in biological time series data, including 211 
eye tracking, and has previously been used to detect changes in visual scanning during 212 
anxious states (32, 55). Sample entropy is generally robust to variations in sample size so 213 
recording durations do not need to be exactly matched. Higher entropy values (in bits) would 214 
suggest a more complex signal, indicative of more random and reflexive (i.e., less 215 
predictable) movements over time. 216 
In-flight tracking (pursuit gain) 217 
For high speed targets (such as the ball in this task) close tracking of the target’s in-218 
flight trajectory may only be achieved through anticipation of its future location (56). Here, 219 
anticipatory head and eye movements can facilitate continuous smooth pursuit dynamics, 220 
while preventing a person’s point of gaze from significantly ‘lagging behind’ the target. To 221 
index whether eye position was keeping up with the target in this way, we calculated a 222 
measure of pursuit gain. Following Palidis et al. (57), this was computed as the saccade-free 223 
eye velocity divided by target velocity (i.e., values of 1 indicate that the eye perfectly kept 224 
pace with the ball). To do this, periods during which a saccade were made (identified as 225 
portions of data where gaze acceleration exceeded five times its median absolute 226 
acceleration; (58, 59)) were firstly removed from the data. Following Fooken and Spering 227 
(60), gain values were then calculated for the closed-loop portion of tracking (i.e., based on 228 
observed motion feedback (57)) which was defined as 140ms after ball release.  229

and there were fewer changes of location. The lower plots show the corresponding gaze 239 
traces and entropy values. 240 
 241 
Active Inference Modelling 242 
To probe the mechanisms behind the trial-to-trial updating of predictions we fit a 243 
computational model to the predictive gaze location variable. The purpose of this model was 244 
to use the observed behaviour (eye position) to infer an unobserved variable (belief about the 245 
next release location). We therefore chose a gaze variable (position before release) that had a 246 
clear mapping to a task-relevant belief (release location) (as in (44)). A Bayesian generative 247 

Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 12 
model of perception derived from the Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of active 248 
inference (61) was chosen to align with the theoretical approach of the paper. This approach 249 
has previously been used to model individual characteristics of active inference in clinical 250 
states of depression and anxiety (40, 52, 62). It has also been used for predictive eye 251 
movements in a task similar to the one reported here (26). Such computational modelling of 252 
behavioural data allows us to estimate the mechanisms that generated that data and therefore 253 
move towards a better understanding of underpinning mechanisms. This modelling approach 254 
requires specifying a generative structure for the inference process of interest (see Figure 3), 255 
inputting observed values for known parameters, and optimising other, unobserved, model 256 
parameters to best explain the data. In the current case, the predictive eye movements that 257 
participants made (left/right/centre), and their subsequent observations (left or right outcome) 258 
are known. Given these known values, a gradient descent optimisation routine can be used to 259 
estimate participants’ ongoing beliefs about the most likely release location, the best courses 260 
of action available to them, and the rate at which these beliefs were updated over time.  261 
In the model (see Figure 3) beliefs about states of the world (s) are estimated over 262 
timepoints within a trial (𝜏) and across trials (t). The schematic in Figure 3 represents a single 263 
trial, in which prior expectations about the release locations(p(S1); D) are encoded as a 264 
categorical distribution over possible states of the world (i.e., release location). Transitions 265 
between states (p(sτ+1| sτ,π); B) are updated over trials based on the likelihood matrix 266 
((p(oτ|sτ)); A), which maps the probability of hidden states given observed instances. The 267 
partially-observable MDP model takes a set of initial parameters specified by the 268 
experimenter – e.g., prior expectations about release location (see online supplementary files 269 
for starting priors: https://osf.io/2amdv/) – then iteratively updates beliefs (according to 270 
Bayes rule) following the known actions and outcomes.  271 
Each trial was modelled as consisting of three timesteps: τ = 1 was the start state 272 
before any observations had been made; τ = 2 was the cue timepoint when participants hear 273 
the onset cue and where the eye position is taken to be a prediction about release location; 274 
and τ = 3 is the ball appearance timestep when participants observe which release location 275 
was correct. Models did not extend past the observation of the ball appearance (i.e., into the 276 
swing of the racquet) because task related uncertainty effectively ended with the ball 277 
observation. At τ = 3, the participant observed the true release location and inferred whether 278 
the true state was left or right. That is, they inferred a posterior distribution over P(sτ = 3) that 279 
assigned a probability to the left versus right state, based on a Bayesian integration of prior 280 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 13 
beliefs about transitioning to the respective states P(sτ = 2|sτ = 1) and P(oτ|sτ) (i.e., the likelihood 281 
mapping). The inferred posterior formed the prior for the next trial. Bayesian belief updating 282 
in the model was based on the following equations for the timepoints (τ = 1 and τ = 2-3, 283 
respectively): 284 
𝒔̅𝜏=𝟏 = 𝝈 (
 
1
2 (ln 𝐷 + ln 𝐵 ∙ 𝑠𝜏+1) + ln 𝐴 ∙ 𝑜𝜏
 
 
 
 
 
) 285 
𝒔̅𝜏=𝟐−𝟑 = 𝝈(ln 𝐵 𝑠𝜏−1 + ln 𝐴 ∙ 𝑜𝜏) 286 
Here, 𝝈 indicates a SoftMax function which converts the belief to a proper probability 287 
distribution and ln refers to the natural logarithm. Posteriors over states were estimated using 288 
an optimization routine (gradient descent) that minimises free energy in the model. 289 
Additional technical details are described in figure 3. By fitting the generative model to real 290 
participant data, we were able to identify a set of parameters that enabled model predictions 291 
to best match observed behaviour (i.e., maximising p(𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑏𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟|𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙)). For 292 
further details on the mathematical formalism of these models, see Friston et al.(63), Smith et 293 
al. (40), or an introductory review by Smith and colleagues (64).   294

Notes: The model outlines inferences about projection locations based on active inference 299 
behaviours (eye position). Arrows connecting nodes indicate dependencies between 300 
variables. Following the notation of Smith et al. (2021), circles (‘nodes’) correspond to the 301 
following variables: s = state; o = observations; 𝜋 = action policies. Squares indicates factors 302 
mediating conditional relationships and take the form of matrices in the model: A = 303 
likelihood mapping between states and outcomes (i.e., (𝑜𝜏|𝑠𝜏)); D = initial state priors (i.e., 304 
(𝑠1)); B = state transition matrices encoding beliefs about how hidden states evolve over time 305 
(i.e., (𝑠𝜏+1|𝑠𝜏,)). Observation and state subscripts correspond to time points in a trial (𝜏). When 306 
𝜏>1, the B matrix from 𝜏−1 acts as an empirical prior, playing the same role as the D vector 307 
at 𝜏 = 1. Action policy selection (π) depends on the expected free energy associated with each 308 
policy (G), which in turn depends on prior preferences for outcomes (C), as well as expected 309 
precision of action policies (E). Policies expected to i) minimize uncertainty over states and 310 
ii) maximize the probability of preferred observations will have the highest probability of 311

After identifying the model structure, we compared different combinations of free 315 
parameters to determine the best approach for fitting to participant data. We examined five 316 
possible free parameters and compared model fits with different combinations of these 317 
values. Full details of the competing models and the comparisons are available in the 318 
supplementary files (https://osf.io/2amdv/ – supplementary 5). Successive models were 319 
compared using a Bayesian random effects model (spm_BMS.m function: Statistical 320 
Parametric Mapping 12 toolbox; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, 321 
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/), which assesses the variational free energy of each model fit 322 
and returns the relative probabilities (e.g., [0.9, 0.1]) of the better fit (the protected 323 
exceedance probability; (66). The winning model had three free parameters: η (learning rate), 324 
α (action precision), and loss aversion. The parameter η describes the magnitude of belief 325 
updating at each timestep of the model and therefore indicates how fast prior expectations 326 
(e.g., about likely ball location) are being adjusted in response to sensory observations (e.g., 327 
about the ball’s actual observed location). It is worth noting that, in this context, learning rate 328 
does not refer to improving at the experimental task; indeed, a high learning rate could be 329 
detrimental to task performance as it equates to disregarding potentially valuable prior 330 
observations (e.g., beliefs which have been formed through previous sensorimotor 331 
experiences and longer-term exposure to interception cue-outcome contingencies). Action 332 
precision refers to the mapping between beliefs and actions, it encodes the degree to which 333 
action choices are deterministic or random. Loss aversion describes the strength of the prior 334 
preference against observing a particular outcome.  335 
Next we fit the models to observed data and extracted participant-wise estimated 336 
parameters for learning rate, action precision, and loss aversion. Average action probabilities 337 
(i.e., the probability of a participant’s actions under the model) were 73% suggesting high 338 
explanatory power of the model. Next, we checked parameter recoverability and 339 
independence (https://osf.io/2amdv/ – supplementary 4). Finally, the estimated model 340 
parameters were subject to between-condition comparisons (see Results). 341

Procedure 347 
Participants attended the lab for a single visit lasting ~60 minutes. They first 348 
completed an informed consent form and were fitted with the heart rate chest strap. While 349 
they were seated, their baseline heart rate was recorded over a period of 2 minutes. All 350 
participants then watched a short video explaining the broad aims of the study and what 351 
would be required during the experiment, to standardise the instructions. Next, participants 352 
were fitted with the VR headset and performed a familiarisation block of the interception 353 
task, consisting of four trials (two left and two right-sided trials). They then completed the 354 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 17 
high and low threat conditions in their preassigned (counterbalanced) order. Before each 355 
condition, participants watched a pre-recorded video (available from: https://osf.io/2amdv/) 356 
which explained the task to them and then completed the S-ANX measure (anxiety 357 
thermometer). The in-built eye trackers were calibrated at the start of the first block and on 358 
any obvious displacement of the headset. Participants then completed 36 interception trials in 359 
each of the high and low threat conditions. On each trial, participants began in the centre of 360 
the court, just behind the ‘short line’. The appearance of each ball was cued by three auditory 361 
tones which were followed by a variable onset delay. Based on previous pilot testing, the 362 
onset delay was randomly selected from a uniform distribution over a 0-5 second window. 363 
This variable onset window was required to create sufficient levels of challenge and 364 
uncertainty in the task. Participants then had to intercept the oncoming ball by reaching their 365 
racquet out to the left or right. When participants successfully intercepted the ball it ‘popped’, 366 
and a rewarding ‘ding’ sound was played, alongside a haptic vibration from the handheld 367 
controller. If the ball was missed, a ‘buzz’ sound was played. 368 
Anxiety induction 369 
The anxiety induction consisted of a threat manipulation similar to that used in 370 
previous studies (32, 37). This was based on the provision of evaluative and ego-threatening 371 
instructions, monetary incentives, and immediate consequences for performance failure. Two 372 
pre-recorded videos presented by the head of department were used to deliver these 373 
instructions to give them added legitimacy. During the low-threat block of trials, participants 374 
were advised that their score was not important and that they should just do their best. On the 375 
game screen, the score was replaced with ‘N/A’, and the text ‘not recording’ was shown in 376 
the bottom left (see Figure 1). By contrast, in the high-threat block of trials, participants were 377 
told that they if they performed well enough they would receive a monetary prize, whereas if 378 
they scored in the bottom three, they would be consented into a follow-up study which 379 
examines people who choke under pressure. They were also told that at the end of testing a 380 
league table of participants' scores would be made public to all those who participated. On 381 
their head-set display, their score was displayed in front of them along with a sign saying 382 
‘Recording’, to reinforce these elements of evaluative pressure.  383 
Data analysis 384 
Processing of the raw eye movement data was performed in MATLAB 2022b 385 
(Mathworks, US) using bespoke analysis scripts which are available from the Open Science 386

 18 
Framework project page (https://osf.io/2amdv/). Computational modelling was also 387 
performed using MATLAB, using scripts adapted from the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 388 
toolbox. Statistical analysis was performed in RStudio v1.4.1106 (43). A series of linear 389 
mixed effects models (LMMs; fitted using restricted maximum likelihood in the lme4 390 
package (67)) were used to examine the hypotheses. Model fit checks were performed using 391 
the ‘performance’ package (68). For each model we report R2conditional (overall) and R2marginal 392 
(all fixed effects) effect sizes, as well as standardised beta effect sizes for each independent 393 
variable. Interpretations follow Acock's (2014) rule of thumb for std. beta values that < .2 is 394 
weak, .2–.5 is moderate, and > .5 is strong. 395 
Results 396 
Manipulation checks 397 
First we examined whether the pressure manipulation successfully increased state 398 
anxiety. A linear mixed model on S-ANX, with participant as a random effect [R2conditional = 399 
.42; R2marginal = .14] indicated that the effect of Condition [High] was statistically significant 400 
and large in magnitude [β = 1.50, 95%CI [0.69, 2.31], p < .001; std. beta = 0.73] indicating 401 
increased self-reported anxiety during the high pressure condition (see Figure 4 top). The 402 
linear mixed model for HR [conditional R2 = .88; marginal R2 = .09] similarly indicated a 403 
statistically significant increase in the high pressure condition [β = 10.06, 95%CI [6.99, 404 
13.12], p < .001; std. beta = 0.60] (see Figure 4 bottom).  405

Performance 415 
To examine the effect of the pressure condition on task performance, we ran a logistic 416 
mixed model predicting successful interception [R2conditional = .27; R2marginal = .01]. The model 417 
indicated a statistically significant effect of Condition [High] [β = 0.36, 95% CI [0.14, 0.58], 418 
p < .001; std. beta = 0.36] corresponding to better interception performance in the high 419

pressure condition. Both S-ANX [β = 0.11, 95% CI [0.03, 0.19], p = .01; std. beta = 0.22] and 420 
deviations from baseline HR [β = 0.04, 95% CI [0.02, 0.06], p < .001; std. beta = 0.69] were 421 
found to be significant predictors of better interceptive outcomes.  422

 21 
Predictive eye movements 431 
Before examining the model-derived variables, we first checked that there was no 432 
general difference in predictive gaze behaviours between high and low pressure conditions. 433 
We did not anticipate changes in these variables; however, we assessed them to determine 434 
whether any changes in model variables were simply a result of broad changes in the ability 435 
to make anticipatory eye movements. A linear mixed model on predictive gaze position (i.e., 436 
raw horizontal position) indicated that the effect of Condition [High] was statistically non-437 
significant [β = 1.79e-03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.05], p = .94; std. beta = 3.02e-03, R2conditional = .14, 438 
R2marginal < .01]. Similarly, a logistic model indicated that there was no change in the accuracy 439 
of pre-onset gaze predictions between conditions [β = -0.04, 95% CI [-0.21, 0.13], p = .68; 440 
std. beta = -0.04, R2conditional < .01], i.e., participants did not attend to the correct side 441 
more/less frequently. We further examined whether there was any difference in variance of 442 
predictive gaze location, by computing the standard deviation in predictive gaze position for 443 
each participant. A linear model indicated that there was no effect of condition on the 444 
standard deviation of predictive gaze position [β = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.03], p = .51; std. 445 
beta = -0.08, R2conditional = .83, R2marginal < .01]. These results indicate that there was no 446 
systematic difference in predictive gaze position, variance of that position, or the correctness 447 
of that position between high and low pressure conditions.  448 
Active inference model variables 449 
Next, we examined whether there were differences in active inference during anxiety, 450 
based on the model-estimated parameters. A linear mixed effects model indicated that there 451 
was no statistically significant effect of pressure condition on α (action precision) [β = 0.97, 452 
95% CI [-0.23, 2.17], p = .11; std. beta = 0.33, R2conditional = .40, R2marginal = .03], showing no 453 
change in the randomness of action selection. Similarly, there was no effect of condition on 454 
the loss aversion parameter [β = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.85, 0.42], p = .51; std. beta = -0.08, 455 
R2conditional = .80, R2marginal = .002]. We did, however, observe a significant reduction in 456 
learning rate (η) in the high pressure condition [β = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.16, -0.02], p = .009; 457 
std. beta = -0.62, R2conditional = .26, R2marginal = .10], with a large effect indicating slower 458 
updating of gaze predictions under state anxiety.  459 
We also examined whether there were relationships between the model-derived 460 
parameters and self-reported or physiological measures of anxiety. For change in self-461 
reported anxiety (i.e., high pressure minus low pressure), the correlation with learning rate 462 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 22 
was weak and non-significant [r = -0.24, p = .21]. There were, however, significant 463 
relationships with α [r = -0.44, p = .02] and loss aversion [r = -0.51, p = .005] indicating that 464 
greater increases in felt anxiety were associated with more random and less deterministic 465 
action choices, as well as a reduced aversion for unpreferred outcomes. There were no 466 
correlations between change in HR and α [r = -0.12, p = .54], η [r = 0.04, p = .85], or loss 467 
aversion [r = -0.11, p = .57].  468

 474 
Pursuit gain 475 
To examine whether pressure condition also affected in-flight tracking, we ran a 476 
linear mixed model on log-transformed pursuit gain values. The model (with participant as 477 

Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 23 
random effect) had a conditional R2 of .40 and marginal R2 of .01. The effect of Condition 478 
[High] was statistically significant but small [β = 0.33, 95% CI [0.21, 0.45], p < .001; std. 479 
beta = 0.10] indicating higher gain values (closer to 1) under high pressure conditions (see 480 
Figure 5 – top].  481 
SD of pre-release position 482 
To examine whether pressure condition affected gaze sampling prior to ball release, 483 
we ran a linear mixed model on the two dimensional standard deviation of eye position for 484 
the period preceding the auditory cue. The model (with participant as random effect) had a 485 
conditional R2 of .41 and marginal R2 of .01. The effect of Condition [High] was statistically 486 
significant but relatively small [β = 0.04, 95% CI [0.02, 0.05], p < .001; std. beta = 0.15] 487 
indicating an increase in the variance of eye position before ball release under high pressure.  488 
Entropy 489 
Finally, we tested whether the complexity of pre-release sampling was different 490 
between conditions. A linear mixed model on sample entropy of eye position indicated a 491 
small but statistically significant difference between the low and high pressure conditions for 492 
both the horizontal [β = 0.01, 95% CI [3.38e-03, 0.01], p = .002; std. beta = 0.12] and vertical 493 
[β = 0.01, 95% CI [3.38e-03, 0.01], p = .036; std. beta = 0.09] planes. This indicates a higher 494 
degree of randomness or complexity in eye movements in the high pressure condition. 495 
 496 
Discussion 497 
In the present work, we examined how eye movements, and their underpinning predictive 498 
mechanisms (e.g., uncertainty-related learning and belief updating) were affected by 499 
temporary states of anxiety. Based on EMU and FEP accounts of anxiety (20, 41), we 500 
hypothesised that performance pressure would increase internal entropy and reduce 501 
participants’ ability to predict future states (impaired ball tracking), which they would seek to 502 
resolve by: i) more reflexive sampling of the task environment; and ii) constraining updates 503 
to predictive eye movements. Our hypotheses about resolving internal entropy through 504 
reduced learning rates and increased visual sampling were supported by the data. However, 505 
we found no disruption to performance or in-flight tracking during the high-pressure 506 
condition; instead, there were small improvements in these variables. Overall, these findings, 507 
based on advanced modelling techniques, provide a critical new understanding of the 508 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 24 
interaction between active inference behaviours and pressurised performance scenarios. 509 
These findings have clear relevance for neurocomputational theories of anxiety and 510 
contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of how motor skills may be affected 511 
(positively or negatively) by situational pressure.  512 
Firstly, the manipulation checks indicated that we successfully increased participants’ 513 
state anxiety, as shown by clear increases in S-ANX and HR in the high (compared to the 514 
low) pressure conditions. Our primary hypothesis was that updating of predictive eye 515 
movements (i.e., not actual pre-release position but trial-to-trial changes) would be impaired 516 
under state anxiety. Model-based estimates of trial-to-trial updating indeed indicated a lower 517 
learning rate in the high pressure (anxiety) condition. This finding accords with previous 518 
work reporting disrupted reward processing and updating of motor predictions under anxiety 519 
(29). Adding to this picture, Lang et al. (70) found more rigid, repetitive, and redundant hand 520 
movement patterns during state anxiety, which they characterised as an attempt to return to 521 
familiar low-entropy states. Taken together, these results suggest a growing picture that 522 
people attempt to counter uncertainty (either in the form of internal entropy or shifting 523 
environmental probabilities) by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor 524 
patterns.  525 
The slowed updating of sensorimotor predictions observed here contrasts with the 526 
relationship between anxiety and increased rates of learning (belief updating) reported by 527 
Lawson et al. (18). However, this apparent discrepancy is easily resolved by appealing to 528 
active inference models of perception and action (23, 71). Within active inference theory, a 529 
distinction is made between minimising two types of ‘prediction error’ known as variational 530 
free energy (VFE) and expected free energy (EFE). VFE is effectively momentary prediction 531 
error arising from inferences about the likely causes of sensations (e.g., during simple 532 
perceptual or associative learning tasks). By contrast, EFE refers to minimisation of future 533 
prediction errors through action. The ability to infer future states (of the body or world) with 534 
confidence is critical in computing EFE, as action policies are most likely to be selected when 535 
they (i) minimize uncertainty over states and (ii) maximize the probability of preferred 536 
observations. Uncertainty about future states (i.e., expected precision) is explicitly 537 
represented by the E term in our active inference model in Figure 3. Consequently, if the 538 
organism is generally less confident predicting its own future states, it is unlikely to switch to 539 
new actions where the outcomes may be more uncertain. In this way, perceptual beliefs about 540 
the world (e.g., during associative learning tasks; (18)) may be updated more quickly during 541 
Preprint v 3 – 15/04/2024. This manuscript has not been peer reviewed 
 25 
states of uncertainty (25), while actions (e.g., predictive eye movements in our interceptive 542 
task) may not. A question for future work is, therefore, whether learning rates for beliefs 543 
about environmental states can diverge from those relating to sensorimotor predictions during 544 
the same task.  545 
There are additional variables to consider that may influence this relationship between 546 
uncertainty and belief updating. For instance, ‘degrees of uncertainty’ are hard to compare 547 
between studies/tasks, therefore results from associative learning and motor learning studies 548 
may not be directly comparable. Prediction updating is also dependent on higher-level beliefs 549 
about uncertainty (72, 73). Indeed, probabilistic relationships in the world can themselves be 550 
more or less changeable (74), and this additional ‘volatility’ can, itself, have varying levels of 551 
stability. When uncertainty is short-lived, faster prediction updating will be adaptive, but if it 552 
is persistent, updating your predictions is ineffective and wasteful. Here, the source of 553 
uncertainty is also relevant. For instance, if uncertainty is purely a function of probabilistic 554 
relationships in the environment and the outcome of one’s actions can be estimated with 555 
certainty, predictive movements should be adapted more quickly. If, on the other hand, the 556 
organism has high internal entropy (e.g., anxiety) and cannot predict their own future states 557 
with assurance, prediction updating may be slower. Given the widespread impact that these 558 
variables can have on performance and learning, future investigations may wish to explore 559 
the (inter-)relationships between uncertainty, volatility, and anxiety beliefs during naturalistic 560 
sensorimotor tasks.   561 
We also observed relationships between S-ANX and both loss aversion and action 562 
precision parameters from the active inference model. As these were exploratory analyses, 563 
they should, however, be interpreted with caution. The relationship between S-ANX and 564 
reduced action precision (i.e., less deterministic mapping from beliefs to choices) makes 565 
intuitive sense and aligns with the theoretical models we have discussed above. Indeed, states 566 
of high entropy can mean that an organism is less able to predict its current or future states 567 
with confidence, so there may be an increase in the apparent randomness of their 568 
sensorimotor actions. Reduced loss aversion, however, seems in the opposite direction to 569 
what we would generally expect for anxious emotional states. Generally, research has 570 
suggested a positive association between these constructs, particularly in perceptual decision-571 
making tasks (75). Sporn et al. (29) have previously reported that anxiety disrupts reward 572 
processing in a motor learning task, so this unexpected result could be related to a reduced 573 
ability to predict the rewards associated their own actions (eye movements). 574

 26 
Turning to our secondary hypotheses, we found that in-flight gaze tracking was not 575 
disrupted under anxiety. In fact, participants in the high-pressure condition actually had 576 
higher pursuit-gain values, indicating that they were following the path of the ball more 577 
closely and continuously than in the low-pressure conditions. This effect was unexpected but 578 
might be an artefact of an increased motivation to succeed in the high pressure conditions, 579 
given the performance incentives. This would be consistent with the observed increase in 580 
performance success. Indeed, while anxiety is typically associated with performance 581 
decrements (9), it can also lead to performance improvements through greater effort and 582 
motivation (76, 77) that mitigate against any disruptive effects. Such increases in task 583 
engagement might have led participants to track the ball more closely and perform more 584 
successful interceptive motor actions, despite the observed changes in learning rate. This 585 
divergence illustrates that attempts to reduce uncertainty through sensorimotor behaviours 586 
may have beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on other features of the task. For 587 
instance, here, participants may have been able to maintain (or even improve) their 588 
performance through additional effort despite a constrained learning rate (in line with (77)).   589 
Our hypotheses related to increased sampling of the environment prior to release 590 
were, however, supported. We observed small but statistically significant increases in both 591 
the variability and the complexity of gaze position before target release. These findings align 592 
with previous studies that have reported similar anxiety-induced disruptions to gaze control 593 
(32, 34, 55, 78). Many of these studies have proposed attentional mechanisms (10) – such as 594 
an altered balance between top-down and bottom-up systems (79) – as responsible for these 595 
effects. We have instead suggested that they could be conceptualised as an active attempt to 596 
reduce uncertainty in the environment through increased sampling of visual information (e.g., 597 
as in (80)). While attentional mechanisms could equally explain the changes to gaze 598 
variability and entropy, the alterations to learning rate that we observed are more consistent 599 
with an entropy reduction explanation.  600 
The present work has both theoretical and practical implications. Our results 601 
contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of the interactions between motor and 602 
affective states, illustrating that the feedforward and predictive mechanisms which are 603 
fundamental to sensorimotor control may be impaired during high pressure (or high anxiety) 604 
conditions. Our findings align with EMU and FEP accounts of anxiety (20, 41). The results 605 
also have implications for our understanding of motor skill breakdowns under pressure, such 606 
as during sports. While previous explanations have focused on attentional explanations (10), 607

our findings suggest that disruptions to predictive mechanisms could also contribute to 608 
episodes of ‘choking’ (see (7) for a review). Even though we did not observe performance 609 
deficits in this task, expert-like motor control depends on ‘statistically optimal’ prediction-610 
making (in many ways), hence, altered predictive models during anxious states may provide 611 
an explanation for episodes of performance failures. Finally, our results have implications for 612 
designing motor skill training programmes. It has previously been suggested that training in 613 
the presence of anxiety may ‘inoculate’ sports performers to the subsequent effects of 614 
performance pressure (81). Our results, however, suggest that the presence of anxiety during 615 
training could alter the learning of critical predictive sensorimotor control mechanisms. As 616 
such, it is crucial to understand these effects more deeply in order to determine the likely 617 
value of such ‘stress inoculation training’.  618 
Limitations 619 
A limitation of the current work is that we most probably did not achieve genuinely 620 
high states of anxiety, such as would occur during public speaking, job interviews, or high-621 
pressure sporting events. Scores on the anxiety thermometer unmistakably increased in the 622 
high pressure condition (with a large effect size) yet were still in the mid-to-low range of the 623 
self-report scale. For instance, no participants reported scores of eight or nine out of ten. 624 
Hence, the conditions in the experiment cannot be said to replicate some of these real-world 625 
experiences of anxiety. We did, however, observe large increases in HR suggesting a notable 626 
activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These lower states of anxiety may well account 627 
for why participants did not ‘choke’ and actually performed better under the high-pressure 628 
conditions. Notably, the fact that performance improved while prediction updating was 629 
slowed appears to suggest that predictions did not particularly matter for performance. 630 
However, as the trial order was highly uncertain and shifted between periods that favoured 631 
left and right release locations, faster updating of predictions was not necessarily beneficial 632 
nor disadvantageous here (i.e., conditions were genuinely unstable and trial n-1 was not 633 
always strongly predictive of trial n). We would expect such disruptions to be detrimental to 634 
sensorimotor skills in cases where there was a greater statistical regularity (7).  635 
Conclusion 636 
They key finding from this work was that high pressure conditions can disrupt the 637 
updating of beliefs that underpin predictive sensorimotor control. These findings have 638 
relevance for a better understanding of how finely tuned motor skills can break down in the 639

presence of heightened emotional states, as well as providing an empirical test of theories like 640 
the EMU and free energy principle (20, 41). By conceptualising anxiety as a state of 641 
uncertainty, and anxious behaviours as uncertainty reduction attempts, it will be possible to 642 
situate our understanding within a wider computational framework (4, 20, 41) and potentially 643 
explain wide-ranging anxiety-related behaviours. This may contribute to the growing 644 
appreciation of uncertainty computations in both diagnosis (82) and treatment (83) of clinical 645 
anxiety, as well as situation-specific patterns of sensory processing and/or motor 646 
performance.  647
