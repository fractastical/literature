SUBJECTIVELY EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY AND
SUBJECTS' PROBABILITY ESTIMATES:
USE OF MEASUREMENT-FREE TECHNIQUES1!
THOMAS S. WALLSTEN2
University of North Carolina
The dual purpose of the experiment was to provide measurement-free tests of
subjectively expected utility (SEU) theory based on the principle of additivity,
and of the common assumption that 5s1 probability estimates differ from their
subjective probabilities inferred from SEU theory by no more than a scale
factor. Four 5s estimated probabilities of random events used in gambles of
the form apQ and chose from 31 pairs of such gambles. SEU theory accounted
for the empirically established indifferences of each 5 within error limits.
Each S's estimates were close to his inferred subjective probabilities; one
analysis supported the assumption that they differed by no more than a scale
factor, while another rejected it.
Research on decision making under risk
has generally proceeded on the assumption
that there exist psychological variables of
subjective uncertainty, called subjective
probability, and of subjective value, called
utility. This paper is concerned with two
related issues. One is a theory associating
subjective probability and utility with
preferences among alternatives. The other
issue is the adequacy of a common method
of measuring subjective probability, that
of having 5s provide numerical estimates

of the probability. These problems are
related because subjective probability is
a hypothetical construct and any measure
of it can be evaluated only within the
framework of a theory connecting it to
observable behavior.
The theory which has been most rigor-
ously developed is subjectively expected
utility (SEU) theory (Edwards, 1962;
Luce & Suppes, 1965; Tversky, 1967).
This involves the expression
SEU= ZS(ey)i7(oy), [1]y-i
in which 5 and U are real valued functions
relating subjective probability to events ey
and utility to the outcomes Oy contingent
on the events, respectively. The sum is
taken over the n events which could follow
a given action. The theory states that
Alternative A is preferred to Alternative B
if and only if the SEU of A is not less than
the SEU of B.
Although the model has generated a good
deal of work (Wallsten, 1970), only a few
studies have tested it and derived subjec-
tive probability and utility scales without
a priori assumptions about at least one
of those scales (Anderson & Shanteau,
1970; Davidson, Suppes, & Siegel, 1957;
Tversky, 1967). The present paper also
uses measurement-free techniques, but
differs from Anderson & Shanteau and

Tversky (1967) in the use of choice data
rather than bids. It differs from Davidson
et al. in the establishment of indifferences
rather than preferences and in the employ-
ment of a considerably wider range of
probabilities and outcomes.
Wallsten (1970) has pointed out that it
is very commonly assumed that 5s' nu-
merical estimates of probabilities differ
from their subjective probabilities by only
a scale factor and has critically discussed
the relevant literature. Besides testing
SEU theory, the present study investigated
the relation between estimates and sub-
jective probability denned by SEU theory
without assumptions about the utility
functions.
1. Method for testing SEU theory. If
an 5 is indifferent between two gambles,
apQ and bqQ, in which apQ means "win the
amount a with probability p or the amount
0 with probability 1 — p," then SEU
theory leads to
S(p)U(a) - p)U(0)
. [2]
Events are identified by their probabilities
and outcomes by their values, since those
are their sole distinguishing characteristics
here.
Tversky (1967) has shown that in such
a situation, SEU theory holds if and only
if probability and value contribute inde-
pendently and additively (multiplicatively)
to the preference value of an alternative,
i.e., if and only if additivity holds. With-
out additional restrictions, this is the sole
empirical statement of the theory. One
way to evaluate this is to look for simul-
taneous solutions to the set of interrelated
equations (or inequalities) which embodies
additivity and reflects the indifference (or
preference) structure. To the extent that
solutions exist, the additivity principle is
sustained and the theory cannot be re-
jected. This analysis was done as follows.
The experiment involved determining in-
differences between pairs of gambles. Al-
though, of course, a ?*• b and p ^ q in any
one pair, there was a good deal of overlap
across pairs. Returning to Equation 2,
letting U(0) = 0 since U is an interval
scale and two values can be arbitrarily
fixed, taking logs, rearranging, and letting
i index a particular pair of gambles for
which indifference has been established
gives
logZ7(o,)
- logU(bt) - = 0. [3]
Squaring Equation 3 and summing over
the m indifferences for a given 5 yields
-log £/(&,)- logS (<z<)]2 = 0. [4]
A computer was programmed to search
for that set of solutions to the m equations
of the form of Equation 3 which minimizes
the left side of Equation 4, separately for
each S, subject to the following constraints :
(a) monotonicity, i.e., if pi > pj, then
S(pi) > S(pj), and if a,- > ay, then C7(a,-)
> U(a,j) ; (b) U(a) = a', for one value of
a in the system. This used up the last
degree of freedom in an interval scale and
allowed unique solutions to be specified.
These constraints are innocuous, although
it may be pointed out that the use of logs
disallowed negative solutions for U and S.
Note that nothing is said about SPs of
complementary events or about the shape
of either function.
The criterion is critical. If solutions can
be found such that the sum of squares in
Equation 4 does equal zero, the m separate
equations whose squares are being summed
are consistent and the theory cannot be
rejected. If a set of values cannot be
found such that the sum of squares equals
zero, the equations are not consistent.
However, the computer will arrive at solu-
tions which bring the sum as close to zero
as possible. It is then a statistical question
whether additivity, and therefore SEU
theory, should be rejected.
2. Method for assessing whether prob-
ability estimates differ from subjective
probabilities by only a scale factor. Return
again to Equation 2 and again let 17(0) = 0
and U(a) = a'. Now assuming that esti-
mates differ from subjective probabilities

RELATIONS BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY AND SEU 33
by only a scale factor, substituting the
estimates, E(p), in place of S(p), and re-
arranging terms results in
a' = [5]
It follows that the values obtained for
U'(b) should be independent of the par-
ticular values of p and q. If indifference is
established between various pairs of gam-
bles with different values of p and q, but
all involving the same values of a and b, the
values of U'(b) should be the same in all
cases within limits of error. If they are
not, then either SEU theory is wrong or
the assumption that£(£) = cS(p) is wrong
(c > 0). This prediction was tested at
various levels of b.
METHOD
Apparatus.-—A pair of identical spinners provided
the chance events for a pair of gambles. The
spinner bases, which were 20 cm. in diameter and
mounted in black Plexiglas frames, were each di-
vided into a green and a silver radial sector. The
relative areas of the sectors could be adjusted from
0% to 99% green. The bases were calibrated on the
back for E, but no markings were visible to 5.
Transparent Plexiglas discs, 20 cm. in diameter and
2 mm. thick, with a black radial line, could be
freely spun on the bases by S, stopping by chance
with the black line above either green or silver.
During much of the experiment, when comparison
of the relative areas of the sectors was important,
the discs were removed from the bases and the
frames were stood upright so that the bases were
vertical and could be easily viewed.
One outcome of each gamble was always zero and
was not displayed to S. The other outcome of
each gamble, a positive number of points, was indi-
cated on a card mounted on top of each upright
frame.
Probability estimates were collected on individual
slips of paper. Mimeographed on each was "The
probability of the spinner landing on green (or
silver, depending on S) is." Below this was a 20-cm.
horizontal line with 101 upright ticks spaced 2 mm.
apart. The first tick and every tenth thereafter was
higher than the others and labeled .00, .10, . . . ,
1.00. In addition, the fifth tick after each labeled
one was higher than the remaining ones.
Procedure.—The 5s were run individually for 30
sessions, 1 per day, S days per week. The first part
of each session, approximately 10 min., consisted of
estimating probabilities. The 5s were instructed to
estimate the probability that the black line on the
disc would stop on green (silver) when started at a
randomly chosen position, spun, and allowed to stop
of its own accord. The 5s gave estimates by mark-
ing the calibrated line on a slip of paper and handing
it to E.
Each of the 19 settings from .14 to .86 that were
employed in the gambles was presented twice in
each session, for a total of 60 estimates at each
setting. They were presented in one random order
and then again in a second, except that the first
setting of the second order was different from the
last setting of the first.
The second part of each session, approximately
SO min., consisted of choosing gambles. The 5s were
instructed that one spinner generally would give
them a greater chance to win a smaller amount
than would the other. They were to choose the one
with which they would prefer to play on each trial.
Thirty-one pairs of gambles were presented in a
different random order each session. After a choice
was made and recorded, E changed the point values
and reset the spinner bases for the next trial, etc.
At the end of a session, 5 randomly selected 6 of
31 numbered cards to determine which choices would
actually be played at the conclusion of the experi-
ment. A special session was held for this purpose.
The 5s were paid at the rate of 1)4 per 20 points,
with a guarantee of averaging no less than $1.75
per session.
Subjects.—Four 5s were recruited from among
students enrolled in the summer session at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. One male (5i) and one
female (52) estimated probabilities of the disc
landing on green and won the positive outcomes
when it landed on green. One male (5S) and one
female (5J estimated probabilities and won positive
outcomes for silver.
Construction of the pairs of gambles.—The purpose
of the choice procedure was to establish indifferences
between members of 31 different pairs of gambles.
One member of each pair, the standard gamble, was
held constant, while the other, the comparison
gamble, was systematically varied from session to
session.
The construction of the 31 pairs of gambles and
their manipulations across sessions can be under-
stood with the aid of Table 1. For purposes of
analysis, the pairs were divided into two sets, with 4
standard gambles in Set 1, and S in Set 2. The sets
were mixed in presentation.
The notation in Table 1 is analogous to that used
above, except that zero is not included since it was
always one of the outcomes. Thus, 1,100 (.30)
means "win 1,100 points if the disc lands on the
sector whose area is 30% of the total; otherwise
win 0 points."
In Set 1, each standard gamble was paired with
each of the comparison gambles whose positive out-
come is entered in the column below it. For example,
the standard 1,100 (.30) was paired with five com-
parisons, and so forth. Similarly, in Set 2, each
standard was paired with each of the comparisons
whose probability of winning is entered below it.
For example, the standard 1,600 (.26) was paired

with two comparisons, and so forth. It can be seen
that there were a total of 31 comparison gambles,
for 31 pairs of gambles.
In the first session, all choices were between
gambles of almost equal expected value (EV).
(EV is defined by Equation 1 when S(p) = p and
U(v) = v.) Thus, the probabilities in the Set 1
comparison gambles and the positive outcomes in
the Set 2 comparison gambles were fixed so that the
EVs of a given comparison and standard were as
close as possible. On subsequent sessions, the
probabilities of the Set 1 comparison gambles and
the outcomes of the Set 2 comparison gambles were
governed by 5's choices in the previous session in
accordance with the staircase method; i.e., they
were decreased following a comparison choice and
increased following a standard choice.
The initial Set 1 probabilities were equal to
.14 + .04w, where n is the integer which brings the
EV of the comparison closest to that of the standard.
For example, the EV of the standard 1,100 (.30) is
330. The comparison 700 (p) would be equal in EV
when p = .47, but p was set instead to .46 = .14
+ (.04)8. Subsequent probabilities were manipu-
lated in units of .04. All the positive outcomes were
in multiples of 50, and the Set 2 comparison out-
comes changed by ± 50 points from session to
session.
RESULTS
Determining the indifference points.—Each
of the 15 pairs of gambles in Set 1 system-
atically differed from day to day in terms
of the comparison probabilities. Each of
the 16 pairs of Set 2 gambles systematically
differed from day to day in terms of the
comparison positive outcomes. Dixon and
Massey (1957) provide maximum likeli-
hood approximations for use with data
collected in the present fashion to deter-
mine probabilities in Set 1 and outcomes
in Set 2 such that S can be considered
indifferent between the particular com-
parison and standard gambles, and for
calculating standard errors (SE) about the
indifference points. The requirements are
that the number of observations is large,
that the choices at the different levels are
independent of each other, that they are
approximately normally distributed, and
that the different levels are separated by
equal steps which are less than twice the
standard deviation. Preliminary analyses
(Wallsten, 1970) showed only few viola-
tions of these conditions. The approxima-
tions were abandoned in those cases in
favor of the maximum likelihood procedures
detailed in Dixon and Mood (1948). Biases
and limitations of the Dixon and Massey
method have been extensively investigated
by Kappauf (1969).
The indifferences for each S are shown
in Fig. 1. Each point on the log—log graphs

represents a gamble. Open points are
standard, and solid points are comparison
gambles such that S can be said to be in-
different between the particular comparison
and standard. The straight lines represent
gambles with EVs equal to those of the
standard gambles they contain. The Set 1
indifference probabilities, p~, are plotted as
a function of the outcome values, v. The
Set 2 indifference outcome values, v, are
plotted as a function of the probabilities, p.
Data are missing for five comparison
gambles for Ss and for one for S^. In each
of these cases, the gamble with the greater
probability was consistently chosen for
approximately half of the experiment,
despite the daily changes in outcome value.
At some point, when the potential winnings
from the other gamble had become con-
siderably greater, that gamble was chosen
for the remainder of the experiment, re-
gardless of the fact that the comparison
outcome was converging to that of the
standard. Consequently, it was impossible
to determine those indifference points.
With the exceptions just noted, variance
about the indifference points was quite
small. For Set 1, the range of SEs was
from .017 to .002 for Si, from .015 to .003
for Si, from .048 to .003 for 53, and from
.012 to .000 for S4. For Set 2, the range
was from 31 to 3 for Si, from 17 to 4 for £2
(not including one SE of 85), from 92 to 18
for Sg, and from 23 to 4 for S4.
It can be seen that all the indifference
points are quite close to the EV lines. The
deviations appear to be systematic only in
the case of Si. Tests were not run to
determine whether the deviations were
significant, or whether the EV lines were
least-squares best-fit lines, since no pre-
dictions were made relative to EV.
Determining whether SEU theory is vio-
lated.—This analysis involved both Set 1
and Set 2. The indifference points were
used to join each standard to each of its
comparison gambles in an equation of the
form of Equation 3. One parameter could
be fixed, and it was a' = [7(1,300) = 1,300.
The system of equations for each S was
solved with respect to the criterion and sub-
ject to the constraint previously described.

RELATIONS BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY AND SEU 39
The solutions were exponentiated and are
displayed in Fig, 2 and 3 as a function of
the objective values. The circled points
in Fig. 2 represent the fixed [7(1,300)
= 1,300, and the lines in both figures are
diagonals. With the exception of the U
curve for Si, all the relationships are small
deviations from the identity. For S2, 53,
and £4, the slopes of the least-squares best-
fit lines in Fig. 2 are 1.09, 1.02, and 1.02,
respectively. In Fig. 3, they are 1.11, .94,
.99, and 1.02, for Si, S^, Ss, and £4, re-
spectively. Variability about these lines
is quite small, and the product-moment
correlation is above .99 in all cases.
The question whether the sets of equa-
tions are consistent, and therefore, whether
the SEU model is satisfied, is answered by
inspecting Fig. 4. This figure is analogous
to Fig. 1, except that the calculated sub-
jective values are plotted instead of the
objective ones and the lines through the
standard gambles are equal SEU lines in-
stead of equal EV lines.
A set of equations is consistent if the
sum in Equation 4 equals zero. This will
be the case if values are found such that
each comparison gamble equals its standard
gamble; that is to say, such that each solid
point in Fig. 4 falls on the appropriate
equal SEU line. The question whether an
SEU model is sufficient to account for the
data, then, is one of whether the points
have been moved sufficiently close to the
lines.
For Si, S2, and S4, all the comparison
gambles are as close to their respective
equal SEU lines as can be expected; in most
cases, they are on the lines. Although the
fit is not as good for S3, 95% confidence
intervals about the points include the
equal SEU lines in all but four instances.
Determining whether estimates differ from
subjective probabilities by only a scale factor,
—Mean probability estimates, E(p), were
obtained for each S at each spinner setting.
Variability around the means was so small
that measures of it were not calculated;
after the initial session or two, estimates
for a particular setting did not vary over
a range of more than .04 or .05. The plot
of E(p) against the objective probability,
p, is linear for each S (Wallsten, 1970).
The least-squares best-fit line is E(p)
= l.OSp — .016 for Si, E(p) = p for S2,
E(p) = p - .010 for S8) and E(p) = p
for S4.
The relation between the calculated S(p)
and p is also linear for each S (see Fig. 3).
On this basis, the hypothesis that E (p) and
S(p) are linearly related to each other,
differing at most by a scale factor, can not
be rejected.
An alternative approach, involving only
the Set 1 pairs of gambles, makes use of
the actual values of E(p) rather than a
best-fitting function. The empirically de-
termined indifference points and the appro-
propriate values of E(p) _ relate each
standard to each of its comparison gambles
in an equation like Equation 5. There were
four systems of equations for each S, corre-
sponding to the four standard gambles (see
Table 1). Again, one parameter could be
fixed, and it was a' = £7(1,300) = 1,300.
Each system was solved independently of
the others for the U'(b) corresponding to
the remaining positive outcomes. All the
U'(b) for a particular outcome should be
the same within the limits of error.
There were 17 pairs of U'(b) values to be
compared with each other. For example,
the outcome 700 appeared in two systems,
allowing one comparison. The outcome
1,700 appeared in all four systems, allowing
six comparisons, and so forth. Critical
ratio 2 scores calculated on the differences
between the members of each pair showed
them to be significantly different from zero
in 7 pairs for Si, 9 pairs for £2, 5 pairs for
Ss, and 15 pairs for S4 (p < .05). On this
basis, then, it is apparent that the E(p)
differ from the S(p) by something more
than just a scale factor.
DISCUSSION
Each of the systems of equations reflecting
S's indifferences in terms of the additive struc-
ture of SEU theory was found to be consistent.
Thus, additivity, and therefore SEU theory,
were sustained. These results are in accord
with those of Anderson and Shanteau (1970),
Davidson et al. (1957), and Tversky (1967).

40 THOMAS S. WALLSTEN
Since none of the four studies make any a
priori assumptions about the nature of the
scale values, this represents considerable sup-
port for the theory. However, there are also
a variety of studies which indicate that SEU
theory is not a general model of risky decision
making. For example, probability and value
interact in some situations (e.g., Irwin &
Metzger, 1967; Irwin & Snodgrass, 1966). In
addition, although Tversky's (1967) data
reflect additivity, they are incompatible with
the conjunction of the two reasonable con-
straints that utility be risk invariant and that
subjective probabilities of complementary
events sum to one.
Many of these experiments are compared
and evaluated in Wallsten (1970) in an at-
tempt to work toward a more complete theory
of risky decision making by considering the
relation between task variables and 5s' strate-
gies. For example, it is quite possible that a
factor predisposing 5s to combine dimensions
additively within an alternative is the spe-
cificity of the objective scales and that less
well defined measures will lead to other
strategies, such as an additive difference
strategy (Tversky, 1969). An indication of
the degree to which 5s' behavior reflected the
objective scales in the present study is the
close correspondence between the objective
and subjective values.
The two analyses concerning the relation
between probability estimates and subjective
probability appear to lead to opposite con-
clusions. The analysis based on best-fitting
lines indicated that at least to a first approxi-
mation, the estimates and the subjective proba-
bilities were identical up to a positive multi-
plicative transformation, while the analysis
using specific values of E(p) indicated that the
two measures differed by more than just a
scale factor. The conclusion to be accepted
depends on the question whether the measure-
ment of a set of elements is better represented
by a best-fitting function or by point values.
It may be mentioned that neither specific
values of E(p) (Wallsten, 1970), nor of S(p),
(Fig. 3) differed greatly from p, and therefore
from each other; so that if the differences are
considered significant, they still may be con-
sidered unimportant.
A final point needs to be made. If it were
found that 5's preferences were not handled
by SEU theory, it would be vacuous to ask
whether his probability estimates were mea-
sures of his subjective probabilities inferred
from the theory. It cannot be stressed too
strongly that subjective probability is defined
only within the framework of a theory, al-
though not necessarily SEU. Without a
theory, the construct is without operational
meaning and measures of it can not be inter-
preted. It is precisely this which is at issue
when some theorists question how to attach
meaning to 5s' magnitude estimates in
standard psychophysical experiments (Luce
and Galanter, 1963, p. 278).
