Abstract
The aim of this study is to investigate whether expectancy, induced through a placebo procedure, favors the activation of the cor-
ticospinal tract before movement initiation. By adopting the premovement facilitation paradigm, we applied transcranial magnetic 
stimulation over the left or right primary motor cortex at rest and 100 ms or 50 ms before movement onset while healthy volunteers 
performed a reaction time (RT) motor task consisting of abductions of the right or left thumb after a go signal. Participants in the 
placebo group received an inert electrical device applied on the right forearm along with information on its speed-enhancing proper-
ties. A control group received the same device with overt information about its inert nature, while another control group underwent no 
intervention. Along with RT, we measured the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) before and after the procedure. Compared 
to the control groups, the placebo group had faster RT and greater MEP amplitude before movement initiation. This study demonstrates 
that the placebo effect can boost the activity of the corticospinal tract before movement onset, and this modulation positively impacts 
motor performance. These results give experimental support to the active inference account.

Introduction
Mounting evidence indicates that expectancy per se influences 
motor performance (Hurst and Beedie 2023). In fact, individuals 
who expect to perform well following an intervention or a treat-
ment show objective improvement in a variety of motor functions, 
including force exertion, speed, balance control, and resistance 
to fatigue, even if the treatment itself is actually inert (Beedie 
and Foad 2009, Villa-Sánchez et al. 2019, 2021, 2023, Fiorio et al. 
2022). This psychobiological phenomenon, known as the “placebo 
effect,” is tangible proof of the power of the mind over the body.
Predictive coding theories, and in particular the active infer-
ence account, provide a good theoretical framework for explain-
ing the placebo effect and, therefore, the influence of expectancy 
on motor performance (Büchel et al. 2014, Ongaro and Kaptchuk 
2019
). According to this framework, the brain uses priors, which 
can be defined as beliefs about future outcomes, to predict the 
consequence of an action, combining expectations with sensory 
input (Friston et al. 2010, Smith et al. 2022). The model assumes 
that priors and actions interact with each other so that, on the 
one hand, top-down processes provide predictions to lower-level 
layers, preparing perceptual and motor processes in advance, and, 
on the other hand, lower-level layers provide details of the move-
ment to be performed, allowing predictions to be updated during 
the execution of a motor act ( Adams et al. 2013). Thus, accord-
ing to the model, action preparation and execution continuously 
interact to create a reliable prediction of future outcomes, as the 
brain attempts to minimize prediction error, i.e. the discrepancy 
between priors and sensory information (Adams et al. 2013).
This framework not only explains well the impact of 
expectancy on motor performance but also lends support to the 
use of placebo procedures as appropriate strategies to experimen-
tally manipulate the induction of priors in a controlled manner 
(Büchel et al. 2014, Ongaro and Kaptchuk 2019). Interestingly, pre-
vious neurophysiological evidence in the motor domain showed 
that the induction of expectancy through a placebo procedure 
changes the activity of motor-related brain regions (Fiorio 2018 ). 
Specifically, by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
over the primary motor cortex (M1), it was demonstrated that 
healthy individuals who were induced to believe in the force-
enhancing properties of a placebo device showed an increase in 
force production associated with increased excitability of the cor-
ticospinal tract from M1 (Fiorio et al. 2014). In the current study,

we aim at investigating whether expectancy favors the activation 
of the corticospinal tract even before movement initiation.
We exploited the premovement facilitation paradigm as a suit-
able way to study the neurophysiological correlates of expectancy. 
Premovement facilitation is represented by an increase in 
excitability of the corticospinal tract from M1 that typically begins 
80–100 ms before movement onset (Rossini et al. 1988 , Hiraoka 
et al. 2010, Cirillo et al. 2021). It can be evoked by asking indi-
viduals to perform rapid movements after a go signal and by 
delivering a TMS pulse to the contralateral M1 in a time window 
between the go and the movement onset. As such, premovement 
facilitation can give information on the preparatory mechanisms 
that combine higher-level layers, like M1, and lower-level layers, 
like the spinal cord. To induce positive expectations, we adopted 
an ergogenic placebo procedure in which a group of participants 
received the application of an electrical stimulation device on the 
right forearm passed off as having speed-enhancing properties. 
A control group underwent the application of the same electrical 
device as the placebo group but with explicit verbal information 
on its inert nature, while another control group received neither 
the device nor any information about it. According to the active 
inference account, priors should activate motor and premotor cor-
tices in the preparatory phase of a movement (Bestmann et  al. 
2008
, Brown et al. 2011, Pezzulo and Ognibene 2012), and there-
fore we hypothesized that the induction of expectancy in the 
placebo group should result in faster movements and in higher 
MEP amplitude before movement onset compared to the control 
groups. Furthermore, since the model assumes that attention is 
involved in processing relevant information to prepare and exe-
cute an action (Fagioli et al. 2007, Brown et al. 2011), we tested the 
behavioral and neurophysiological effects of our procedure both 
on the body side on which the placebo device was applied (i.e. the 
right forearm) and on the contralateral side, with the hypothesis 
that a greater modulation of performance and brain activation 
should be present in the treated side as a result of the interplay 
between expectancy and attention.
Methods
Participants
Sample size computation was performed with G-Power 3.1 (Faul 
et al. 2007), considering F tests for a within-between interac-
tion with three groups and two sessions. Assuming an antici-
pated effect size f  of 0.25 (considered medium by Cohen 1988), 
α error probability of 0.05, power (1 − β error probability) of 0.80, 
correlation among repeated measures of 0.5 and nonsphericity 
correction ε of 1, the resulting sample size is 42. To prevent a 
reduction of power due to potential dropouts, we recruited a total 
of 48 healthy subjects. Participants were recruited from the stu-
dent population of the University of Verona (Italy) and randomly 
assigned to 3 groups of 16 subjects each: placebo group (mean age: 
21.8 ± 2.2; 7 women; 14 right-handed), control transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) group (mean age: 21.8 ± 2.4; 
7 women; 13 right-handed), control NoTENS group (mean age: 
22.6 ± 4.0; 6 women; 15 right-handed).
Prior to the experiment, participants were screened for any 
contraindications to TMS and for neurological or psychiatric dis-
orders (Rossi et al. 2009). Participants were not taking any medica-
tions at the time of the experiment and had normal or corrected 
to normal vision. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants prior to study participation. The study was approved 
by the Human Research Approval Committee (CARP 17.R1/2022) 
of the University of Verona and conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki.
Simple reaction time motor task
Participants sat on a comfortable chair in front of a PC moni-
tor (ASUS Full HD; screen size: 29 × 38.6 cm; screen resolution: 
1280 × 1024 pixels) with the forearms relaxed on a table. They 
were asked to perform a simple reaction time (RT) motor task by 
abducting the thumb as quickly as possible after the appearance 
of a visual cue (i.e. a black circle, 2.5 cm diameter) presented in 
the center of the PC monitor on a gray background (Chen et  al. 
1998, Morgante et al. 2011 , Cirillo et al. 2021 ). RT was defined 
as the latency between the presentation of the visual cue and 
the electromyographic (EMG) onset of movement recorded with 
surface electrodes from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), the 
muscle directly involved in the task. The EMG onset was defined 
as the time point at which the EMG signal amplitude exceeded 
a predetermined threshold, indicating the beginning of muscle 
activation. In our study, the threshold was set at 2 SD above the 
baseline EMG amplitude, defined as the EMG recorded during the 
50 ms preceding the onset of the visual cue.
At the beginning of each experimental phase, participants 
were asked to perform 10 trials of the motor task (i.e. 10 thumb 
abduction movements). An interval of 8 s (± 1) was inserted 
between two consecutive trials (Cirillo et al. 2021). We called this 
condition “Task-only.” By averaging the RT of the 10 trials, we 
obtained the mean RT for each participant which was used not 
only to have a measure of performance but also to calculate the 
time window in which to apply the TMS pulse necessary to eval-
uate the premovement facilitation (details are reported in the 
procedure) ( Fig. 1a). The motor task was performed separately 
with the right and the left hands in a counterbalanced order 
across participants.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Single-pulse TMS was applied over the M1 contralateral to the 
hand performing the task (either the right or the left) with a 
blocked design and with a counterbalanced order across par-
ticipants. The TMS pulses were delivered through a standard 
figure-of-eight coil with mean loop diameter of 90 mm, connected 
to a STM 9000 stimulator (EB Neuro). The coil was positioned 
tangentially to the skull at an angle of 45∘ to the sagittal plane.
Surface EMG was recorded from the APB and the abductor 
digiti minimi (ADM) muscles by means of unipolar self-adhesive 
Ag/AgCl electrodes (1.5 × 2.5 cm) in a belly-tendon montage. The 
APB was considered the muscle of interest, being directly involved 
in the task, while the ADM served as the control muscle (Duqué 
et al. 2010, Cirillo et al. 2021). The ground electrode was placed on 
the palm. EMG signals were amplified (×1000), filtered by band-
pass from 10 to 500 Hz plus a notch filter set at 50 Hz (LabChart 
8 pro, ADInstruments Co.), sampled at the frequency of 2 kHz, 
and digitized by PowerLab 16/35 (ADInstruments Co.). EMG sig-
nals were analyzed in real-time and offline with MATLAB 2014a 
(MathWorks Inc.).
The APB optimal scalp position was identified by moving the 
coil in small steps around the vertex and by delivering TMS pulses 
at 50% of the maximum stimulator power until stable and maxi-
mal MEP could be evoked in the APB muscle. The resting motor 
threshold (RMT) was defined for each subject and each hemi-
sphere as the lowest stimulus intensity able to evoke an MEP 
with an amplitude of at least 50 μV in 5 out of 10 trials in the 
contralateral APB muscle (Temesi et al. 2014).
Placebo effect on premovement activity  3
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the motor task and the procedure. (a) The simple RT motor task consisted of 10 rapid thumb abduction 
movements after the presentation of a visual go signal (a white dot appearing on the screen). In the Task-only condition, participants performed the 
motor task alone with the right or left hand with a blocked design and a counterbalanced order across participants. In the TMSRest condition, the TMS 
pulse was applied over the left or right M1 (depending on the hand performing the task) while the subjects were at rest. In the TMSTask condition, the 
TMS pulse was delivered over the left or right M1 (depending on the hand performing the task) while the subjects performed the motor task. In this 
condition, the TMS pulse could be randomly delivered at 100 ms or 50 ms before the onset of the EMG. MEPs were recorded from the APB and ADM 
muscles of the right or the left hand. The APB was the muscle of interest, being involved in the task, while the ADM was a control muscle. (b) The three 
conditions (Task-only, TMSRest, TMSTask) were performed before (Baseline) and after (Test) the placebo manipulation or the control procedures.
During the experiment, single-pulse TMS was delivered at 
120% of the RMT in two conditions: at rest (TMS Rest) and dur-
ing the motor task (TMS Task). In the TMS Rest condition, 10 TMS 
pulses were applied over the right and left M1 while participants 
were at rest. This allowed us to measure the baseline corticospinal 
excitability of each participant. In the TMS Task condition, TMS 
pulses were delivered during the motor task. This condition con-
sisted of a total of 20 randomly presented trials: in 10 trials 
the TMS pulse was delivered 100 ms before the movement onset 
(TMSTask100) and in 10 trials the TMS pulse was delivered 50 ms 
before the movement onset (TMS Task50) (Fig. 1a). Since our pro-
tocol comprised several conditions (i.e. rest and active, right and 
left hand, baseline and test sessions), 10 TMS pulses per condition 
appear to provide an optimal balance between feasibility and reli-
able measurements (Cavaleri et al. 2017, Biabani et al. 2018, Cirillo 
et al. 2021).
TMS pulses were automatically triggered with MATLAB 
through a USB-6009 (National Instruments Corporation). As antic-
ipated above, the time to apply the TMS pulse was derived from 
the mean RT obtained from the 10 trials of the simple RT motor 
task (Task-only) for each participant at the beginning of each 
session. Like in the Task-only condition, we considered an inter-
val of 8 s (± 1) between two consecutive trials (Cirillo et al.
2021).

The neurophysiological parameter considered in this study 
was the peak-to-peak MEP amplitude (mV) recorded from the APB 
and ADM muscles. To rule out any effect of prestimulus EMG 
activity on MEP amplitude, prestimulation EMG activity was cal-
culated on both muscles as the root mean square of the EMG over 
50 ms prior to the TMS pulse.
Procedure
After a short familiarization with the motor task (three trials), 
participants underwent the three conditions described above, pre-
sented always with the same blocked order: Task-only, TMS Rest, 
and TMSTask (Fig. 1b). The blocked order was chosen based on 
previous studies on premovement facilitation ( Chen et al. 1998, 
Morgante et al. 2011, Cirillo et al. 2021), in which the “Task-only” 
condition must inevitably always be performed at the beginning 
of the procedure to determine the individual’s mean RT used to 
apply the subsequent TMS pulse (at 100 ms or 50 ms before move-
ment onset). For the two TMS conditions (i.e. TMSRest and TMSTask), 
we again used a blocked design because the TMS Rest condition 
was conceived of as a “baseline” assessment of corticospinal 
excitability and counterbalancing the order of the TMS condi-
tions would have carried out the potential risk of having varying 
levels of “baseline” corticospinal excitability across participants, 
as demonstrated by previous evidence where the application of 
consecutive TMS pulses over M1 induced cumulative changes in 
neural activity, resulting in increased corticospinal excitability 
(Pellicciari et al. 2016).
The conditions were separated by a time window of about 
2 min and were performed in two sessions: baseline and test 
(Fig. 1b). The baseline session served to evaluate performance 
and premovement facilitation before any manipulation. Between 
the baseline and test session, the placebo group underwent a 
placebo manipulation, consisting of the application of 10 Hz tran-
scutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with two surface 
electrodes (1.5 cm diameter) over the volar surface of the right 
forearm. This stimulation per se does not produce any enhanc-
ing effects on motor performance (Fiorio et al. 2014). Nonetheless, 
the placebo group received positive verbal information about the 
effect of TENS on speeding-up thumb movements at the motor 
task. TENS intensity was adjusted so that participants felt a 
slight tingling sensation on the skin, though without any mus-
cle contraction. The slight sensation served to convince partic-
ipants that the device was active, thus boosting their expecta-
tion of TENS effectiveness. After 4 min, participants performed 
the test session. This time window appears to be adequate to 
let participants believe in the effectiveness of the device in the 
experimental condition (Fiorio et al. 2022 , Emadi Andani et al. 
2024
). For consistency, the same time between sessions was main-
tained also in the control groups. During the test session, the 
TENS electrodes were still attached to the forearm, but with 
the stimulation intensity at zero level. This procedure served to 
maintain subjects’ belief about TENS effectiveness throughout 
the test session, without any confounding factor linked to skin
sensation.
T wo control groups (control TENS and control NoTENS), not 
exposed to any placebo manipulation, differed in terms of ver-
bal information and procedures received. The control TENS group 
received TENS over the right forearm in the same (inert) modality 
of stimulation as the placebo group, though without any positive 
suggestion that TENS would enhance performance. In particular, 
participants of this group were told that they belonged to a con-
trol group, and therefore, the device was set at frequencies that 
have no effect on performance. This group served to control for 
potential effects due to the mere sight of TENS electrodes on task 
performance. Participants of the control NoTENS group received 
neither TENS nor any information about it and served to control 
for the natural course of performance throughout the procedure. 
Participants of this group had a rest of 4 min between the baseline 
and test sessions.
By applying TENS on the right forearm and asking participants 
to perform the task with the right and left hand, we had the 
secondary aim of investigating whether the placebo effect was 
specific for the treated side (i.e. right hand, left M1) or could 
generalize to the contralateral side.
Subjective ratings
As a manipulation check for our placebo procedure, before the 
test session subjects were asked to judge how they expected 
their performance to change compared to baseline, by using a 
numerical rating scale (NRS), ranging from −3 (“much slower than 
before”) to +3 (“much faster than before”), with 0 denoting “like 
before.” Moreover, at the end of the experiment subjects were 
asked to rate the perceived effectiveness of TENS, on a 10 cm 
visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (“not effective at all”) to 
10 (“very much effective”). Finally, after the motor task subjects 
were asked to evaluate their own performance on a VAS ranging 
from 0 (“very slow”) to 10 (“very fast”).
Importantly, the experimenter (M.B.), who was in direct con-
tact with the participants, was responsible for giving them the 
information sheet, collecting signed informed consent, instruct-
ing participants on the RT task and collecting subjective scores. 
This experimenter was completely unaware of the group assign-
ment, which was instead performed by a third researcher (M.E.A), 
who was never present in the laboratory, thus ensuring for the 
double-blind nature of our design. The experimenter who applied 
the TMS pulse (F.D.D.) was not blind, since he also applied the 
placebo or control intervention. For these reasons, we can exclude 
any experimenter bias on variables sensitive to it, such as RTs and 
subjective scores.
Data handling
Trials of the TMSTask conditions were inspected for muscle con-
traction preceding the TMS pulse, defined as EMG activity greater 
than 2 SD of the mean value recorded in the rest condition. Pres-
timulation EMG activity was below this threshold in all TMS Task
trials. Afterwards, MEP amplitude was inspected to exclude out-
liers (i.e. values 2.5 × SD above or below the mean value for each 
subject in each session and condition). Following this procedure, 
for the right hand we removed 0.52% of trials in the placebo group, 
0.73% in the control TENS group, and 0.63% in the control NoTENS 
group; for the left hand we removed 0.63% of trials in the placebo 
group, 0.94% in the control TENS group, and 0.31% in the control 
NoTENS group.
Statistical analysis
The three groups were compared for gender distribution and 
hand-dominance by means of chi-squared test and for age and 
RMT with one-way analysis of variance. Behavioral and neuro-
physiological data were normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test, 
P > .061), with equal variances between groups (Levene’s test, 
P > .085). RTs obtained in the Task-only condition were analyzed 
by means of repeated measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA) 
with Phase (baseline and test) as within-subjects factor and Group 
(placebo, control TENS, and control NoTENS) as between-subjects 
factor. This analysis allowed to determine whether the placebo

session in the placebo group (red bar), while they were longer in the test compared to the baseline in the control TENS (light blue bar) and control 
NoTENS groups (dark blue bar). In the test session, the RTs of the placebo group were shorter compared to the two control groups (black lines). (b) RTs

procedure was effective in modifying participants’ performance 
without any interference induced by the TMS pulse.
MEP amplitude and prestimulation EMG activity were ana-
lyzed, separately for the APB and ADM muscles, by means of 
rmANOVAs, with Phase (baseline and test) and Time (TMS Rest, 
TMSTask100, TMS Task50) as within-subjects factors and group as 
between-subjects factor.
Subjective variables were analyzed with nonparametric tests 
due to the ordinal nature of the data. In particular, the Wilcoxon 
signed rank test was used to compare the sessions within each 
group separately, and the Kruskal–Wallis test to compare the 
groups within each session separately.
All analyses were conducted for the right and left hand, sep-
arately. Post-hoc comparisons were performed with paired- and 
independent-samples t-tests for parametric analyses and Mann–
Whitney test for nonparametric analyses. The effect size of all 
significant results was reported with partial eta-square ( ηp
2) and 
Cohen’s d for rmANOVA and parametric post-hoc tests, respec-
tively (Fritz et al. 2012) and with Kendall’s W , and r for Kruskal–
Wallis, and nonparametric post-hoc tests, respectively (Tomczak 
and Tomczak 2014).
Bayes factors quantifying the evidence in favor of the alterna-
tive hypothesis (BF 10) were computed (van Doorn et  al. 2020). A 
Bayes factor BF10 > 3 was interpreted as substantial, and a BF10 > 10 
as strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
Spearman’s coefficient of correlation was used to correlate the 
subjective data with the change ( Δ) in neurophysiological and 
behavioral data from the baseline to the test sessions computed 
for each participant as follows: 
ΔRT = RTBaseline−RTTest
ΔMEP = MEPBaseline−MEPTest
where ΔRT or ΔMEP is the difference between the baseline and 
test phase in RTs (obtained in the Task-only condition) or MEPs 
(measured at 100 ms and 50 ms before EMG onset). The delta is 
informative of the amount of change in performance and corti-
cospinal excitability before and after the procedure and can be 
considered as a proxy of the placebo effect. Additionally, we plot-
ted ΔRT and ΔMEP together and analyzed their relationship with 
a quadrant analysis described in the Supplementary material. The 
ΔMEP was also submitted to a further analysis by including Mus-
cle and Hand as factors (see Supplementary material for details 
and results).
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied 
where necessary and the significance level was set at P< .050.
Results
The three groups did not statistically differ for gender, hand-
dominance (P > .669, for both), age, and RMT (right hemi-
sphere, placebo: 55.37 ± 7.89, control TENS: 61.09 ± 10.54, control 
NoTENS: 59.74 ± 6.32; left hemisphere, placebo: 56.98± 9.32, con-
trol TENS: 58.8 ± 8.62, control NoTENS: 58.33 ± 10.75; P > .163, for 
both hemispheres).
Reaction times
On the right hand, the significant interaction Phase × Group 
(F(2,45) = 13.935, P < .001, ηP
2 = 0.382) revealed that RTs were shorter 
in the placebo group compared to the two control groups, specif-
ically in the test session (t (30) > 2.56, P < .029, Cohen’s d > 0.45, 
BF10 > 3.40). Furthermore, in the placebo group RTs were shorter 
at test than at baseline (t (15) = 3.31, P < .001, d= 0.59, BF10 = 9.52), 
while in the two control groups RTs were longer at test compared 
to baseline (t(15) > 2.86, P < .036, d > 0.51, BF10 > 4.31) (Fig. 2a). These 
findings suggest that the procedure was effective in speeding up 
RTs in the placebo group. The effect of Phase or Group was not 
statistically significant (P > .279). No statistically significant result 
was found on the left hand ( P > .925, BF10 < 0.26), indicating that 
the improvement of RTs in the placebo group was specifically 
localized on the hand on which the placebo device was applied 
(Fig. 2b). Additional analyses are reported in the Supplementary 
material and Supplementary Fig. 1.
Neurophysiological data
On the right hand, APB MEP amplitude was greater in the 
TMSTask100 than in the TMS Rest condition, and it was also greater 
in the TMS Task50 compared to the other two conditions (main 
effect of Time: F(2,90) = 67.481, P < .001, ηP
2 = 0.600; post-hoc com-
parisons: for all, P < .001). This finding certifies the presence 
of premovement facilitation at 100 ms and 50 ms before EMG 
onset and is in line with previous studies (Cirillo et al. 2021 ). 
More interestingly, the interactions Phase × Group (F(2,45) = 11.936, 
P < .001, ηP
2 = 0.347) and Phase × Time × group were significant 
(F(4,90) = 2.668, P = .037, ηP
2 = 0.106). Since the latter interaction 
encompassed the former, it was further analyzed. Consistent 
with our hypotheses, post-hoc comparisons revealed that APB 
MEP amplitude was greater in the placebo group compared to

session compared to the baseline in the placebo group (solid red lines) both at 100 ms and 50 ms before EMG onset. In the test session, the MEP

amplitude was higher 50 ms and 100 ms before EMG onset, indicative of premovement facilitation. In the test session, the subject of the placebo group

dition (t (30) > 2.70, P < .033, d > 0.95, BF10 > 4.46). Furthermore, in 
the placebo group a greater APB MEP amplitude was found at 
test compared to baseline at TMSTask50 and TMSTask100 (t(15) > 3.13, 
P < .021, d > 1.11, BF10 > 6.90) (Fig. 3a). On the left hand, MEP ampli-
tude increased across times (main effect of Time: F (2,90) = 74.25, 
P < .001, ηP
2 = 0.623), certifying the presence of the premovement 
facilitation (Cirillo et al. 2021), but no significant effect was found 
for Phase, Group, or their interactions (P > .062, BF10 < 0.84), indi-
cating that the placebo effect did not affect the left hand (Fig. 3b). 
No significant effect was found on the ADM (for all factors, 
P > .298, BF10 < 0.43) (Fig. 3c and d). Representative MEPs from the 
APB are shown in Fig. 4. 
Analysis of the prestimulation EMG activity disclosed no signif-
icant effect (for all factors, P > .282), indicating that MEP amplitude 
was not influenced by differences in preceding EMG activity.
Subjective data and correlation
On the right hand, the placebo group reported higher expectation 
ratings compared to the control TENS group (Z = −2.26, P = .029, 
r = 0.40, BF 10 = 6.67), while no difference was found on the left 
hand (P = .616, BF10 = 0.32) (Fig. 5a and b). Similarly, on the right

hand, the placebo group reported higher ratings of TENS effec-
tiveness compared to the control TENS group (Z = −2.43, P = .015, 
r = 0.43, BF10 = 3.29), with no difference on the left hand (P = .341, 
BF10 = 0.36) (Fig. 5c and d). These findings indicate that the placebo 
procedure was effective in inducing positive expectations and 
belief in TENS effectiveness in the placebo group.
Participants of the placebo group reported higher performance 
scores in the test than in the baseline session, only on the left 
hand (Z = −2.84, P = .004, r= 0.50, BF10 = 27.78).
A positive correlation was found in the placebo group between 
expectation scores and ΔRT on the right hand (rho = 0.542, 
P = .030, Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This correlation indicates that 
the higher the expectation of improvement, the greater the 
improvement at the motor task. Further analyses on the rela-
tion between ΔRT and ΔMEP are reported in the Supplementary 
materials and in Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4.
Discussion
Taking advantage of the premovement facilitation paradigm, we 
demonstrate for the first time that the placebo effect can boost 
the excitability of the corticospinal tract before movement onset. 
Our results help refine the knowledge of the neurophysiologi-
cal basis of the placebo effect in the motor domain and can be 
interpreted in the light of the active inference account.
Premovement facilitation reveals a highly specific 
placebo effect before movement initiation
First of all, our results provide evidence that the paradigm was 
suitable for obtaining a reliable and clear premovement facilita-
tion in all groups, as revealed by the increase in MEP amplitude in 
the muscle directly involved in the task (i.e. right and left APB) 
before movement initiation (i.e. 100 ms and 50 ms before EMG 
onset). The novel finding of the present study is that premovement 
facilitation turned out to be amplified in a very specific way after 
the placebo manipulation, thus suggesting a role of the placebo 
effect on the activation of the corticospinal tract from M1 prior to 
movement onset.
Previous studies using central (TMS and electroencephalog-
raphy) or peripheral (EMG) techniques converged to indicate 
the existence of a top-down mechanism through which posi-
tive expectancy induced by placebo procedures could enhance 
the activity of the corticospinal system (Fiorio et  al. 2014, Emadi 
Andani et al. 2015, Piedimonte et al. 2015, Fiorio 2018, Rossettini 
et al. 2018, Corsi et al. 2019). Taking advantage of the good spa-
tial and temporal resolution of TMS (Garcia-Sanz et al. 2022), we 
were able to demonstrate that the placebo effect induced a pre-
cise amplification of premovement facilitation that was specific 
to the muscle involved in the task (i.e. APB) and localized on the 
treated side of the body (i.e. on the right). Indeed, the homologous 
muscle on the untreated side of the body (i.e. left APB) or adjacent 
muscles not involved in the task (i.e. right and left ADM) did not 
show any change in MEP amplitude.
This neurophysiological finding is consistent with the behav-
ioral data, as the performance improvement was found specifi-
cally on the side of the body on which the placebo treatment was 
applied. The subjective data confirmed that our manipulation was 
effective in inducing positive expectations and beliefs about the 
effectiveness of TENS, particularly on the right hand, giving fur-
ther support to the specificity of the placebo effect on the treated 
body part. The spatial localization of the placebo effect has also 
been observed in other domains, such as pain. For instance,
8  Andani et al.
a placebo analgesic effect was observed only on the participant’s 
arm treated with a placebo cream when expectancy was directed 
toward the same body part (Benedetti et al. 1999). Similarly, Col-
loca et al. (2008) confirmed a placebo analgesic effect localized to 
the treated hand that was associated with a specific neurophysi-
ological reduction of the N2-P2 component, a brain wave evoked 
by laser stimulation and representing the emotional component 
of pain (Colloca et al. 2008). Altogether, this evidence suggests that 
when the placebo intervention is spatially localized, the resulting 
sensory, motor, or neurophysiological effects are specific to the 
body part or muscle treated.
It should be noted that in our study the placebo treatment had 
some characteristics that could have favored a “spatially localized 
effect.” First, the placebo consisted of a tangible device (i.e. TENS) 
that was clearly applied over a specific body part (i.e. the fore-
arm). Second, the placebo device was expected to affect a task 
involving a restricted body district (i.e. the right thumb). Conse-
quently, given these characteristics, it was reasonable to expect 
that the placebo effect could be explicitly localized to the right 
hand. Although predictable, this result represents the first exper-
imental behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for a spatial 
localization effect of a placebo device in the motor domain. There-
fore, our study could provide a benchmark for comparing the 
effects of less tangible types of placebos (e.g. oral pills, oxygen 
inhalation, etc.) on movements performed with one or multi-
ple body districts. To date, only one study on pain ( Kong et al. 
2013
) has tried to compare different types of placebos, demon-
strating that verbally suggested placebo pills or sham needles 
can induce different responses and supporting the idea that the 
type of intervention could likely play a role in shaping the placebo 
effect.
A dissociation between behavioral and subjective 
variables
While the placebo group showed a shortening of RTs on the right 
hand, the two control groups showed an increase in RTs from the 
baseline to the test session. A possible explanation for this result 
could be related to the mindset instilled in all participants from 
the beginning of the procedure. In fact, before signing the con-
sent form, all participants read an information sheet in which 
the general objective of the project was passed off as research on a 
new TENS intervention to improve motor performance. This could 
have fueled certain expectations about the nature of the study. 
Therefore, while participants assigned to the placebo group found 
these expectations met, those assigned to the control groups may 
have had the feeling that the intervention had been denied (either 
because it had been applied at inert frequencies, as the control 
TENS group was told, or because they had not received TENS at 
all, as was the case with the control NoTENS group). We could 
reason that a sort of “negative mindset” was induced in the con-
trol groups, thus consequently worsening motor performance on 
the right hand in test session. This hypothesis should be tested 
in future studies in which a nocebo group will be included (i.e. 
a group that receives the same TENS device with negative verbal 
information). The lack of modulation on the left hand could be 
interpreted in the light of previous evidence showing that motor 
performance of the nondominant hand is typically slower than 
the dominant hand (Todor and Kyprie 1980, Todor et al. 1982, 
Heuer 2007 ). Since our participants were mostly right-handed 
(87.5% in the placebo group, 81.3% in the control TENS group, and 
93.8% in the control NoTENS group), we can speculate that the 
left hand performance was overall slow, and this might have lim-
ited further worsening of RTs in the test phase, as a sort of “floor” 
effect. Future research with longer task durations may allow us to 
investigate whether performance impairment would occur in the 
control groups on the left hand.
Although they were objectively faster with their right hand, 
participants of the placebo group perceived themselves as faster 
with their left hand after the placebo procedure, hinting at a 
dissociation between the behavioral and subjective levels. Again, 
given that most participants were right-handed, we could hypoth-
esize that they may have been imprecise in judging the perfor-
mance of the left, nondominant hand, thus subjectively reporting 
an improvement that, however, was not objectively detected. A 
similar dissociation was described in a previous study in which 
participants reported perceiving the positive effects of a placebo 
treatment on performance despite the lack of effect detected by 
the objective measure of actual performance (Schwarz et al. 2015).
The placebo effect through the lens of active 
inference
Our findings can be interpreted according to the active inference 
account (Adams et al. 2013). If we consider verbal suggestion as 
a contextual psychosocial factor that can shape internal predic-
tions (Kaptchuk et al. 2020, Pagnini et al. 2023), we can hypoth-
esize that the information provided to participants assigned to 
the placebo group could have acted as a reliable contextual cue 
regarding the achievable speed, thus modeling precise internal 
predictions about the consequence of the motor act (i.e. faster 
performance at the thumb abduction task). Therefore, individu-
als in the placebo group likely updated their internal predictions 
on the upcoming action based on the verbal suggestion received. 
In other words, the expectancy of being faster at the motor task 
could have induced a peculiar mindset characterized by positive 
and precise internal predictions about motor performance. The 
subjective data support this hypothesis, as the placebo group had 
a strong expectancy about the effects of TENS in speeding up RTs 
and a strong belief that TENS was an effective intervention.
This mindset could have impacted both the behavioral level, 
with faster movements in the placebo group, and the neurophys-
iological, with an amplified premovement facilitation. The latter 
could be interpreted as a sign of precise internal predictions about 
the upcoming movement outcome (i.e. faster RTs). In keeping 
with this interpretation, a previous TMS study showed that the 
presence of reliable prior information about an upcoming motor 
response (like, for instance, a visual cue indicative of the effector 
to be moved) induced an increase in MEP amplitude, specific for 
the muscle involved in the task (Mars et  al. 2007). Consistently, 
another TMS study showed that MEP amplitude increased in the 
preparatory phase in trials characterized by valid cues compared 
to trials characterized by invalid cues (Bestmann et al. 2008).
Limitations and concluding remarks
It should be acknowledged that our study presents some lim-
itations. First, our sample was predominantly represented by 
right-handers and therefore we cannot clarify whether the side of 
the body on which the placebo device was applied interacted with 
handedness in determining the placebo effects observed here.
Second, we did not directly measure fatigue and fatigability in 
our study and therefore we cannot completely exclude the pres-
ence of fatigue in our participants, especially in the two control 
groups (Langner et al. 2010, Jaydari Fard et al. 2019). Nonetheless, 
we consider a potential effect of fatigue on our data very unlikely, 
because (i) the conditions in which participants were required to 
perform the RT task (i.e. the Task-only and the TMSTask) were inter-
leaved by a rest period (i.e. TMSRest condition); (ii) the baseline and 
Placebo effect on premovement activity  9
test sessions were interleaved by 4 min rest, thus further allowing 
for recovery; (iii) the abduction movements of the RT task were 
very brief and separated by an intertrial interval of about 8 s; (iv) 
the task did not require exerting maximum voluntary muscle con-
traction or certain levels of force, as typically required in fatigue 
inducing tasks (Enoka and Duchateau 2007). Considering all these 
aspects, we would exclude the effect of fatigue on our results.
Third, we focused on the corticospinal tract, leaving open 
the question on the role of other brain regions in modulating 
these effects. Namely, a reasonable hypothesis is that the neural 
bases of our findings may be related to a complex brain network 
involved in motor control. As anticipated above, motor-related 
brain areas have been already shown to play a role in the placebo 
effect (Fiorio 2018). In this regard, we hypothesize that the dor-
solateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may play a fundamental role, 
being a brain region involved in processing expectation and often 
being active in neuroimaging studies on the placebo effect (Wager 
et al. 2004, Kong et al. 2006, Watson et al. 2009, Krummenacher 
et al. 2010, 2010, Lui et al. 2010, Geuter et al. 2013, Jubb and Bens-
ing 2013, Peciña et al. 2013, Egorova et al. 2015, Villa-Sánchez 
et al. 2018). Interestingly, the DLPFC has functional connections 
with M1 and is involved, together with other frontal regions, in 
the cognitive control of motor behavior ( Miller and Cohen 2001, 
Hasan et al. 2013). Therefore, our hypothesis is that the positive 
expectations induced by the placebo procedure might recruit the 
DLPFC and strengthen its projections to M1, thus enhancing cor-
ticospinal excitability before movement onset and consequently 
speeding up movement execution.
These limitations notwithstanding, our study represents the 
first demonstration that the corticospinal tract from M1 can 
be boosted by the placebo effect before movement onset, thus, 
in turn, facilitating movement preparation and execution. This 
study contributes to broadening our understanding of how 
expectancy influences motor behavior and the complex neural 
circuits underlying motor control and provides experimental sup-
port for the active inference account. Albeit cautiously, this inves-
tigation encourages future advances in the clinical field, where 
tailored placebo procedures could be used to address individuals’ 
spared motor resources, potentially supporting motor recovery.
