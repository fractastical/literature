ABSTRACT: Understanding competitive inhibition at the molecular level is
essential for unraveling the dynamics of enzyme−inhibitor interactions and
predicting the evolutionary outcomes of resistance mutations. In this study, we
present a framework linking competitive inhibition to alchemical free energy
perturbation (FEP) calculations, focusing on Escherichia coli dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) and its inhibition by trimethoprim (TMP). Using
thermodynamic cycles, we relate experimentally measured binding constants
(K
i
and K
m
) to free energy differences associated with wild-type and mutant
forms of DHFR with a mean error of 0.9 kcal/mol, providing insight into the
molecular underpinnings of TMP resistance. Our findings highlight the
importance of local conformational dynamics in competitive inhibition.
Mutations in DHFR affect substrate and inhibitor binding affinities differently,
influencing the fitness landscape under selective pressure from TMP. Our FEP
simulations reveal that resistance mutations stabilize inhibitor-bound or substrate-bound states through specific structural and/or
dynamical effects. The interplay of these effects showcases significant molecular-level epistasis in certain cases. The ability to
separately assess substrate and inhibitor binding provides valuable insights, allowing for a more precise interpretation of mutation
effects and epistatic interactions. Furthermore, we identify key challenges in FEP simulations, including convergence issues arising
from charge-changing mutations and long-range allosteric effects. By integrating computational and experimental data, we provide an
effective approach for predicting the functional impact of resistance mutations and their contributions to evolutionary fitness
landscapes. These insights pave the way for constructing robust mutational scanning protocols and designing more effective
therapeutic strategies against resistant bacterial strains.

INTRODUCTION
Predicting competitive inhibition fates in point mutants of
proteins is critical for the process of drug discovery, whereby
one strives for inhibitors that are effective on a wide range of
variants.
1
This strategy would be critical for developing drugs
which have efficacy within the time frames when resistance
mutations arise and get permanently fixed.
2
While accurate
prediction of binding affinities helps prioritize compounds with
the highest likelihood of success, reducing trial and error in
drug discovery, experimental determination of binding
affinities and development of suitable biochemical assays are
expensive and time-intensive.
3
Paradoxically, high failure rates
in clinical trials often stem from poor understanding of binding
affinities or off-target effects. One route to optimize these
efforts is to develop computational approaches that allow
virtual screening of compounds, identifying promising
candidates early and reducing the costs of wet-lab experiments.
The level of accuracy and precision required for such
predictions is currently provided by free energy perturbation
(FEP) calculations.
4
While accuracies below 0.5 kcal/mol are
desired for reliable predictions, the current level of confidence
provided by FEP calculations is around 1 kcal/mol.
5
Improved
accuracy over traditional methods such as docking or
molecular mechanics force fields, which makes FEP more
reliable in early stage drug design, stems from its full atomistic
resolution, which enables modeling complex thermodynamic
contributions like solvation and entropic effects.
6
Conversely,
simpler models often take such critical factors into
consideration only as mean field effects, sacrificing accuracy
and precision. FEP-based approaches are also adept at
capturing small changes in molecular structure, such as
substituent modifications and their impact on binding affinity.
This feature is critical in lead optimization, where small
structural modifications to drug candidates influence the
activity.
While FEP calculations are costly compared to lower-
resolution approaches, advancements in molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and GPU computing as well as fine-tuning

of existing methods have made them ever more scalable and
accessible.
7,8
The ongoing development of FEP-based methods
further ensures that these techniques keep pace with the
increasing complexity of drug targets, allowing integration of
large-scale FEP applications into pharmaceutical pipelines
addressing real-life problems.
9
Despite the many advances, constructing thermodynamic
cycles that are suitable to make decisions on drug efficacy
facing various mutations on the target is far from
straightforward. Nevertheless, recent advances in alchemical
free energy calculations have markedly improved our ability to
predict how mutations affect inhibitor binding. For instance, by
employing nonphysical transformation pathways within a
thermodynamic cycle, it was possible to estimate changes in
ligand binding affinities upon mutation with root-mean-
squared errors (RMSEs) as low as 1.2 kcal/mol, providing a
robust quantitative framework for protein design and drug
resistance studies.
10
This approach was extended to the
challenging problem of kinase inhibitor resistance, comparing
physics-based and data-driven approaches on Abl kinase
mutations and showing that such techniques can accurately
predict the impact of single-point mutations on drug binding.
11
In the context of HIV-1 protease, alchemical free energy
simulations were applied to a series of resistance-associated
mutations, revealing that careful treatment of factors such as
active site protonation is essential for consistent prediction of
mutation-induced binding free energy changes.
12
Furthermore,
state-of-the-art protocols were shown to forecast resistance
phenotypes in clinical Abl kinase mutants, achieving impressive
classification accuracy and low RMSE values, underscoring the
potential of these methods in precision medicine.
13
Compared with transport or structural proteins, enzymes
pose additional challenges due to the kinetic effects that need
to be accounted for during lead optimization. In fact, the
studies mentioned above do not explicitly incorporate the
effect of the catalytic efficiency of the enzymes involved. Their
primary focus is on quantifying changes in ligand binding free
energies (ΔΔG) upon mutation, which directly relate to
inhibitor affinity rather than catalytic turnover. Integrating an
explicit treatment of enzyme catalytic efficiency through the
incorporation of K
m
into a Bayesian framework was proposed
to overcome this hurdle.
14
This framework combines the
computed free energy changes in the presence of the drugs
with the experimental resistance factor data, which depend on
both these free energy differences and K
m
, to more accurately
predict how mutations alter resistance. The correction factor
accounts for changes in catalytic activity that may accompany
mutations, thereby linking the computed inhibitor binding
energetics to the observed inhibition constants and ultimately
resistance factor values. This enhancement, while probabilistic,
provides a more robust thermodynamic framework that
combines the dual effects of mutations on both ligand binding
and enzyme kinetics, which is essential when mutations have a
compensatory or antagonistic effect on catalytic turnover.
In the current work, we propose an alternative framework
that directly relates binding free energy differences to
experimentally determined biochemical constants K
m
and K
i
measured under the evolutionary pressure of competitive
inhibitors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on the
mutants of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
(Figure 1a), which catalyzes dihydrofolate (DHF) to
tetrahydrofolate (THF) (Figure 1b). We have chosen E. coli
DHFR due to the extent of the evolutionary trajectories
accumulated on this model system under the pressure from the
competitor inhibitor trimethoprim (TMP) and the accom-
panying biochemical data for the emerging mutants.
15,16
Moreover, the analyses of precatalytic conformers of DHFR
mutants have enabled us and others to develop leads that steer
the evolutionary trajectories away from the mutational
pathways with extreme resistance to the drug,
17−19
making it
a testbed for developing drug optimization methodologies. We
show that the thermodynamical cycle we propose is a good
predictor of mutant fates in competitive inhibition and opens
the way forward for high-throughput applications
20
in
predicting mutants arising under various evolutionary pressure
scenarios.
Beyond single-site changes, we also examine double mutants
in this system to illustrate how molecular-level epistasis can
emerge from direct or indirect residue−residue interactions.
Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which the effect of one

mutation depends on the presence of others and plays a pivotal
role in shaping the ruggedness of adaptive fitness landscapes.
While epistasis is often framed at the organismal level, focusing
on overall fitness,
21,22
our analysis targets the molecular
dimension of epistasis,
23,24
manifested as nonadditive changes
in binding free energy, stability, or enzymatic activity. In this
study, we specifically focus on whether combining two
mutations produces binding energetics that deviate from the
sum of their individual effects. We find that certain double
mutants indeed exhibit substantial epistatic “rescue” or
aggravation, highlighting how conformational rearrangements
and altered residue contacts can drive nonadditivity. By
elucidating these mechanistic underpinnings of epistasis, our
framework broadens the understanding of how multiple
mutations can impact enzyme−inhibitor interactions and
guides the design of robust inhibitors resilient to complex
evolutionary pathways.

METHODS
System Preparation. All simulations for the systems are
conducted with the NAMD program.
25
The initial systems are
based on the 1RX2 PDB-coded crystal structure
26
where the
cofactors NADPH and folate are bound to the enzyme. The
TMP-bound systems are obtained by removing folate and
docking TMP at the binding site. For both the DHF-bound
and TMP-bound systems, each mutation is introduced with the
VMD Mutator Plugin.
27
Both Charmm22 with CMAP
corrections and Charmm36 parameter sets for proteins are
utilized.
28
We report full results from the former in this article,
but we verified that we have the same energy differences for
the TMP-bound M20I, A26T, D27E, and I94L systems within
error bars. DHF is simulated in a protonated form that models
the precatalytic state; thus, the 5-protonated 7,8-dihydrofolate
force-field parameters were used as reported in the literature.
29
TMP is modeled in the protonated state as established in our
previous work, where its force-field parameters are also listed.
30
The water box is set to the dimensions of 65 × 87 × 65 Å with
a padding of at least 10 Å TIP3P water layer in each direction
of the protein. The salt concentration is set to isotonic
conditions, 0.15 M, with K
+
and Cl
+
ions. Particle mesh Ewald
summation is utilized to calculate long-range electrostatics with
a cutoff distance of 12 Å and a switching distance of 10 Å. The
RATTLE algorithm is applied to constrain bonds, and the
Verlet algorithm is used with a time step of 2 fs. The
temperature is controlled at 310 K by Langevin dynamics with
a dampening coefficient of 5 ps
−1
. The pressure is set to 1 atm
and regulated by the Langevin piston.
To obtain initial coordinates for FEP simulations, we
conduct classical MD simulations on DHF-bound and TMP-
bound WT systems. Due to convergence issues (see Results),
equilibration simulations for the W30R and F153S mutants are
also carried out. These systems are minimized for 10,000 steps.
The resulting structures are subjected to 200 ns long
production runs in the NPT ensemble, which we have shown
in our previous work to be ample to equilibrate the
mutants.
30,31
In another study on DHFR, the last 2 ns of 10
ns long MD runs have been extracted to compute properties of
the system.
19
We therefore utilize various structures at the 10
ns time point and beyond, extracted from our 200 ns
trajectories, as initial structures for the FEP simulations.
Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation Calculations.
The alchemical free energy perturbation method with
Zwanzig’s formulation is followed for all the systems listed in
Table 1.
32
The implementation in the NAMD suite of
programs is used.
33
The best practices outlined by Mey et
al.
5
are applied. Force-field parameters and simulation
conditions are the same as those in the previous subsection.
Systems selected from various equilibration MD simulation
time points, which are at least 10 ns apart, are minimized,
followed by 0.5 ns equilibration. We have tried λ = 16, 32, 64,
and 128 for the TMP-bound L28R system and found the free
energy differences to converge at λ = 32 windows, which we
use for all systems presented in this work. Each window size is
set to 200 ps, with the initial 50 ps being discarded for
equilibration; repeating the calculations with 100 ps of
equilibration and 100 ps of production yields similar results
but with larger error bars. Hence, the production in each
window is 150 ps long. The systems are run in both forward
and backward directions.
To reduce singularities occurring during Leonard-Jones
potential calculations, a soft-core potential is introduced at the
middle λ. The charge-changing mutations are problematic
because the results depend on the box size due to the long-
range effects of electrostatic interactions. The protocol
proposed by Morgan and Massi
34
is used for charge correction,
whereby one set of charge creation and another set of charge
annihilation FEP runs are carried out. Since the two charge-
changing mutations in this work are from a neutral side chain
to a positively charged one (L28R and W30R), the created/
annihilated charge is a chloride ion. The arithmetic average of
the values obtained from these simulations provides the
expected free energy difference for the mutation, free from box
size effects, while the difference provides the free energy cost of
charge creation in the water environment, Cl
−
in this case. The
convergence of the latter value across FEP runs provides an
additional check for convergence of the free energy cost of the
mutation.
Different initial structures are used in sampling to enhance
the coverage of the potentially available conformational states.
At least four different poses are chosen from the classical MD

and 200 ns time points obtained from the trajectories
described in the previous subsection and whose forward and
backward simulations are completed in a stable manner. Our
criterion for convergence is to have overlapping samples in all
32 windows for the forward and backward simulations when at
least four FEP sets were merged in the Bennett-acceptance
ratio (BAR) analyses. If additional sampling is necessary due to
insufficient convergence of the free energy window overlaps,
then more simulations selected from these time points are
added to the pool. In two cases (L28R and F153S) where
window overlaps and error bars did not yield consistent results,
additional FEP simulations started from time points selected
from the MD simulations of the mutated versions are
conducted (see Results for details). Acquired data are merged
and analyzed by the Bennett-acceptance ratio (BAR) method
35
as implemented in the alchemlyb library.

RESULTS
Relating Competitive Inhibition to Alchemical Free
Energy Calculations. The shifts in the conformational
dynamics due to changes in substrate−enzyme interactions
have recently been scrutinized for β-lactamase and underscore
the effect of local dynamics on epistatic outcomes.
37
It is
therefore crucial to construct thermodynamic cycles suitable
for the problem at hand whereby the reaction step(s) effective
on local conformational dynamics are included in the
calculations, while those that are independent of mutation
types are assumed constant over the systems.
We will focus on the competitive inhibition of E. coli DHFR
(Figure 1) by the inhibitor TMP. Ample biochemical
experimental data have been published for this enzyme.
15
DHFR converts dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate
(THF) by the transfer of one proton from the cofactor
NADPH (Figure 1b) and another from the solvent environ-
ment. The catalytic cycle of E. coli DHFR consists of five steps
(Figure 1c): Starting with the initial binding of the cofactor
NADPH, the binding of DHF to the NADPH−enzyme
complex to form a ternary complex follows. A hydride ion is
then transferred from NADPH to DHF, reducing it to
tetrahydrofolate (THF) and oxidizing NADPH to NADP
+
.
Once the product THF is released from the enzyme, NADP
+
dissociates, allowing it to bind new substrates. The hydride
transfer step is rapid and not rate-limiting. Instead, the release
of NADP
+
is slower and often determines the overall rate of
the catalytic cycle.
38
The Met20 loop undergoes significant
conformational shifts during the catalytic cycle.
26
After hydride
transfer, the loop must reopen to allow NADP
+
to exit the
active site. This conformational change is energetically
demanding and slows the release of NADP
+
. In the precatalytic
step, alignment for hydride transfer occurs. Precise positioning
of NADPH and DHF allows for optimal orbital overlap
necessary for the hydride transfer from NADPH to DHF. The
enzyme’s conformational adjustments lower the activation
energy by stabilizing the transition state, making the hydride
transfer more efficient.
39−41
Competitive inhibitors such as TMP (Figure 1d) target
DHFR by mimicking the interactions of DHF at the active site
with much higher affinity (nM vs. μM). Mutations affecting the
precatalytic steps can alter binding affinities and conforma-
tional dynamics, leading to decreased inhibitor efficacy and
drug resistance.
15,30
The importance of the precatalytic step in
DHFR underscores the intricate interplay among enzyme
structure, dynamics, and function. By studying these early
events in the catalytic cycle, we can better comprehend how
enzymes achieve specificity and efficiency and how these
processes can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes.
The reaction scheme for competitive inhibition is given in
Figure 1e, with K
m
being the Michaelis constant and K
i
the
inhibitor’s dissociation constant. Note that the latter is a purely
thermodynamic quantity, whereas the former is kinetic since
the product rate constant, k

inhibition. The ratio K

i
reflects how much more likely an
enzyme is to bind to the substrate than the inhibitor, aiding in
understanding the potency of the inhibitor in biochemical
contexts. Similarly, the ratio
K m /
K i displays the binding
propensity of a mutated enzyme toward the substrate relative
to the inhibitor. The difference between these ratios quantifies
the energetic advantage conferred by the mutation compared
to that of the WT enzyme. In Table 2, we present the K
m
and
K
i
data for E. coli DHFR for the WT enzyme and for those
mutants that emerge when the bacteria are under evolutionary
pressure from TMP. The nine single mutants that appear most
frequently in morbidostat experiments are studied in this
work;
15
only P21L and R98P are left out since they involve
changes from/to a proline residue for which FEP simulations
are currently not feasible due to the ring structure fused with
the protein backbone. We also include four of their double
mutant combinations for which biochemical data are
available,
15
leading to a test set of 13 mutants.

drug and substrate affinities caused by mutations, experimental
measurements suggest the presence of additional resistance
mechanisms. Moreover, K
i
values alone are insufficient to fully
explain the TMP resistance. Within the bacterial cell, various
other factors including DHFR abundance, catalytic efficiency,
thermal stability, nutrient and metabolite availability, excess
DHF accumulation, and the demand for THF play significant
roles in determining bacterial fitness in the presence of TMP.
Of the mutants listed in Table 2, those involving L28R and
W30R are the most frequently observed in the morbidostat as
the first replacement in the coding region,

Moreover, multiple mutants containing the L28R mutation are
among the toughest to eradicate by drugs,

confirming the
further lowered values as listed in Table 2.
We next seek a thermodynamic cycle that will be useful for
the prediction of the quantity in eq 1. Under the steady-state
assumption, which is valid when product formation is linear in
time, we arrive at the relation for the concentration of

Our aim is to use classical force fields for an enzyme to
predict the relative effect of point mutations on the
evolutionary outcomes of its overall function. We therefore
focus on the equilibrium between the inhibitor-bound enzyme
(EI) and the substrate-bound enzyme (ES). Writing this
equilibrium situation twice, once for the WT enzyme (E) and
once for the mutant (E′), we arrive at the thermodynamic
cycle depicted in Figure 2; the detailed derivation of this cycle
relies on rapid equilibrium and initial rate conditions; the full
derivation and the assumptions involved are included in the
Supporting Information. The horizontal equilibria are for the
competition of the substrate and the inhibitor for the same

Equation 4 is our final expression linking the FEP
simulations to biochemical experimental results, which we
defined in eq 1. We use FEP simulations to introduce a point
mutation to the WT enzyme. We carry out FEP simulations on
both the substrate-bound (ES) and the inhibitor-bound (EI)
forms of the enzyme. The difference in the free energies is
expected to provide the right-hand side, which is obtained
from experimentally measured quantities. Our main assump-
tion is that the mutations make a difference predominantly at
the precatalytic step when the enzyme samples conformations
that are best suited for the catalysis to take place,
42−44
while
the product release is not dependent on the mutations on the
enzyme but enters the final observed reaction rates as a
common multiple in all mutants, bridging the time scale
difference.
45
Thus, our assumption is that the mutations do not
affect the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and so K
m
and K
i
are considered to reflect the binding of the substrate and
inhibitor, respectively. Therefore, their ratio can be used to
estimate the difference in binding. This reduces the problem to
that of two alternative ligands binding to a given protein,
similar to other standard applications of FEP approaches. We
will show that this assumption holds for the system we study in
this work and might hold for other cases, although its
effectiveness should be assessed for the enzyme at hand in
future applications.
DHFR Mutation Fates Predicted by FEP Simulations.
The calculated values for our case study of competitive
inhibition of E. coli DHFR by TMP are listed in Table 3. We
note that the experimental data of Table 2 were collected
under the conditions required for the application of eq 4. The
calculated data are visualized against the experimental
counterpart values in Figure 3. The performance of the
predicted values is quantified using three metrics: To evaluate
the overall agreement between predicted and experimental
ΔΔG values, we calculated the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of the differences between the experimental and
predicted values. To assess the linear correlation between the
predicted and experimental ΔΔG values, we computed the
Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, to assess the discrim-
inative ability of the model, we computed the area under the
Figure 2. Thermodynamic scheme depicting a cycle for which the
alchemical FEP simulations are feasible for the vertical (green)
reactions, while the substrate−inhibitor exchange reactions occurring
in physical reality are shown in the horizontal (blue) reactions. Note
that the top horizontal reaction is the 1st and 3rd steps of the
competitive inhibition scheme in Figure 1e. The last equalities in the
blue equations follow from eq 2.

receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by thresholding
experimental ΔΔG values at 0 kcal/mol to define binary labels.
Predicted ΔΔG values were used as continuous scores, and the
AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Our findings
point to the applicability of our approach with high accuracy
and further disclose the mechanisms that lead to these fates.
Inspection of the experimental data in Table 2 shows that,
according to eq 1, there is only one mutation that displays
significant stabilization of the mutant while in competition
with TMP. This is L28R, which has a ΔΔG
competition
of −2.28
kcal/mol. The double mutants L28R-A26T and L28R-W30G
are further stabilized, along with W30G-A26T and I94L-A26T,
which are slightly stabilized by ca. 1 kcal/mol. We find that the
mutants destabilize the inhibitor in all but one case (M20I), as
one would expect in a resistance mutation, i.e., they display
larger K
i
than the WT. However, in all single mutants except
L28R, the substrate-bound complex ES is also destabilized with
respect to the WT. The latter is an expected outcome since the
competitive inhibitor targets the same modified binding site.
The net effect is a ΔΔG
competition
value within 1 kcal/mol of the
WT, and this may be the main reason why these usually appear
as second or later mutations in morbidostat trajectories. The
surviving mutants are then those losing less binding affinity for
the substrate than to the inhibitor.
One may follow this outcome from the FEP results with a
protein-centric perspective rather than the binder-centric
perspective of the experiments. The cost of a mutation may
be positive or negative in the presence of the substrate or the
inhibitor, as shown by the range of values taken on by ΔG
S
and
ΔG
I
(Table 3). The charge-introducing mutations are
stabilizing for the protein in the presence of both DHF and
TMP (e.g., L28R and W30R), while charge-maintaining ones
may be positive or negative, depending on the local
environment and how the dynamics are altered. Nevertheless,
the effect of the mutation is always in the same direction for
the DHF- and TMP-bound forms, and the final stabilization is
decided upon by the relative effect of these two values.
Interpreting Epistasis for Individual Binders and the
Overall Outcomes from a Molecular Perspective. There
is ongoing discussion in the literature regarding the extent to
which protein sequence−function relationships are governed
by pairwise interactions and higher-order effects.

The
answer to this question is important because it determines the
ease with which evolutionary landscapes may be constructed,
both experimentally and computationally. Interpreting fitness
landscapes requires integrating molecular-level interactions,
mutation effects, and broader evolutionary dynamics. While
free energy differences due to changes in atomic-level
interactions are far from being the only contributors to the
fitness values, they are certainly among the most important.
48
In our study, the double mutants under investigation occur
in residues that are in close proximity to each other or interact
directly with the substrate or inhibitor. Consequently,
nonadditivity in the measured free energy changes is expected.
Our analysis quantifies the degree of nonadditivity by
comparing the observed free energy differences of double
mutants with the sum of the effects of the corresponding single
mutants (Table 4). It is important to emphasize that our focus
is on understanding how direct or indirect interactions
between these residues contribute to deviations from simple
additivity. While our discussion is framed at the molecular
level, such insights are essential for elucidating one of the
important components underlying the evolutionary drivers of
epistasis. We do not claim that our molecular analysis alone
explains epistasis; rather, it provides a detailed view of how
local interactions shape the free energy landscape, which, in
turn, can contribute to the evolutionary dynamics observed at
the organismal level.
We compare the calculated versus the expected ΔG
S
and
ΔG
I
values, where the expected values are obtained by the
simple summation of the individual free energy differences of
the single mutants (Table 3). For example, in the case of the
W30G-A26T double mutant, the W30G mutation contributes
a positive free energy difference of 4.96 kcal/mol for DHF
binding (and 4.79 kcal/mol for TMP binding), while A26T

contributes a negative difference of −1.90 kcal/mol for DHF
(and −1.26 kcal/mol for TMP). In the absence of nonadditive
effects, one would expect the double mutant to have a ΔΔG of
approximately 3.06 kcal/mol (i.e., 4.96 + (−1.90)) for DHF
binding. However, our simulations yield an actual value of only
0.15 kcal/mol for DHF binding and −0.28 kcal/mol for TMP
binding, indicating a significant nonadditivity. We interpret this
“epistatic rescue” (calculated as the difference between the
expected and observed ΔΔG values, amounting to approx-
imately −2.91 kcal/mol for DHF and −3.79 kcal/mol for
TMP) as arising primarily from conformational adjustments in
the protein, rather than from direct interactions with the
binder. This interpretation is illustrated in Figure 4a, showing
how the spatial arrangement of the A26 and W30 side chains
may compensate for each other’s destabilizing effects.
Importantly, while our discussion quantifies these nonadditive
effects at the molecular level, we do not imply that free energy
can be rigorously decomposed into isolated contributions;
rather, we use these trends to provide qualitative insights into
how specific local interactions deviate from additivity. In
contrast, the double mutants involving I94L and A26T, which
lack direct or indirect cross-interactions, show negligible
epistasis (Tables 4 and 5).
Different outcomes are observed for the double mutants
involving L28R. For the DHF-bound forms, these mutants
exhibit an epistasis on the order of −1 kcal/mol, whereas for
the TMP-bound forms, the epistasis is positive. In the case of
DHF-bound L28R-A26T (Figure 4b), the A26T mutation
appears to modify the direct interaction of the R28 side chain
with the ligand. Although the individual contributions to ΔΔG
are small, the opposing effects for DHF and TMP binding lead
to a notable net nonadditivity. As the inhibitor is smaller than
the substrate (molar mass 290 and 441 g/mol, respectively;
also see Figure 1a,d), thereby establishing fewer contacts with
the enzyme, we might in general expect such differentiated
epistatic effects for mutations that directly affect the binding
site. Here, as in the previous example, our analysis is intended
to highlight qualitative deviations from additivity that reflect
local structural rearrangements, rather than to claim a rigorous
partitioning of the free energy into independent components.
Some Comments on Achieving Convergence. Accu-
rately exploring the necessary conformational space for each
alchemical state is vital to the success of these results.
49
However, this becomes problematic when a significant
conformational rearrangement is required to transition from
the reference to the target binder−receptor complex. While
extending simulation times and employing enhanced sampling
strategies can help, their impact is varied and especially difficult
when the free energy barriers between conformational states
are high or when adopting and maintaining the desired target
conformation proves challenging. In Table 1, we have listed the
number of simulations required to get converged free energy
values for either the DHF-bound or TMP-bound forms. Our
criterion for convergence was to have overlapping samples in
all 32 windows for the forward and backward simulations when
at least four FEP sets were merged in the BAR analyses. For

mutation at positions 26/30, and (c) double mutations at positions 26/28. Direct or indirect interactions of the side chains with each other and/or
the substrate may be responsible for epistasis. The protein structure (PDB code 1rx2) for residues 20−50 is shown in cartoon, the substrate DHF is

Fitness assessment where larger values correspond to lower free energy difference; capital letters imply point mutations. Combining mutations can
result in additivity (i.e., no epistasis), as exemplified by the I94L-A26T double mutation. An increase over the expected fitness, e.g., for the DHF-
bound L28R-A26T system, leads to positive epistasis, and negative epistasis is exemplified by TMP binding to the same system. (a)−(c) were

some of these cases, we have achieved such convergence in
four sets, but we have had to increase the simulation sets up to
7 in many cases. Overlaps in windows are exemplified in Figure
S1. The full set of outputs is also provided (please see the Data
Availability statement for details).
Two of the mutations we have handled are charge-changing:
L28R and W30R. A recent systematic study has shown that
charge-changing mutations are particularly prone to con-
vergence issues, while usual FEP protocols are adept at
predicting consistent free energy costs of neutral side chain
replacements.
20
The significance of charge corrections due to
electrostatic contributions to binding emerged due to Ewald
summation requirements in periodic boundaries. We have used
the protocol from the literature
34
as described under the
Methods section, which greatly alleviated charge correction
errors. This approach also provides an additional check on the
convergence of the free energy differences if the cost of the Cl
−
creation in water is converged to a value of 83.0 ± 0.5 kcal/
mol in this case. On the other hand, the calculated BAR errors
are larger due to merging two simulations to predict the free
energy change.
We had additional challenges in simulating the W30R
mutation. We have shown in our previous work that the effect
of the W30R change is due to the salt bridge established
between the newly created R30 side chain and E139 on the β-
sheet residing on the opposite side, further away from the
binding region (compare Figure 5a,b).
15
The separation
between the two residues is thus greatly reduced with a salt
bridge distance at a baseline value of 2 Å, which samples values
up to 7 Å during a 200 ns trajectory. It also leads to an overall
shrinkage in the distance between the α-helix accommodating
R30 and the β-sheet where E139 resides (Figure 5c). This
situation is hardly reproducible during a FEP simulation due to
the gradual onset of the interactions and the relatively short
simulation times that may not allow for sampling all of the
possible interaction scenarios. We have therefore included a
second set of simulations where we carried out FEP
simulations for the R30W mutations, starting from the salt-
bridged orientations and using the negative value of the final
free energy differences. Only when we have combined the two
sets of simulations have we been able to converge the overlaps
in the λ windows along with the converged ion creation value
as described for L28R.
Finally, the F153S mutation has proven to be another hard
case. This residue is located near the C-terminus and is distal
from the binding site. In fact, there is no apparent effect of the
mutation that may be captured by comparing 200 ns long
classical MD simulations for WT and F153S mutants via visual
inspection of the trajectories. However, our previous work,
which followed large shifts in hydrogen bond occupancies, has
shown that this mutation has an allosteric effect on DHFR,
interfering with the motions of the CD loop (Figure 1a) and
revealing a cryptic site that is more than 30 Å away.
31
As in the
previous case of W30R, such long-range effects may not be
captured by the gradual changes introduced into the side
chains during the relatively short FEP simulations. Moreover,
the overlaps in the first window of the reverse runs were very
poor (Figure S1a) in the F153S simulations of the DHF-bound
systems. Conversely, the S153F systems had well-behaved
overlaps (Figure S1b), and we have reported the negative of
the value predicted for these systems in Table 3. We did not
have this problem for the TMP-bound system, hinting that
allosteric communication requires DHF.
For the double mutants, we have used the systems we have
studied extensively in our earlier work as the base:
15,30
L28R
for the L28R-A26T/W30G mutations, W30G for the W30G-
A26T change, and I94L for the I94L-A26T change. We used
the time points selected from the 200 ns MD simulations of
the system with the single mutation to add the second
mutation. We report the values in Table 3 as the sum of the
costs of the two FEP simulations. However, we have also tried
introducing both mutations at the same time for the I94L-
A26T change. We find that it is not straightforward to
converge simultaneous mutations even for this case, where
both single mutants gave converged results in just four FEP
simulations.
We acknowledge that while our enhanced convergence
criteria for specific mutations were necessary to overcome
known sampling challenges, they may introduce systematic
differences compared to cases in which less sampling was
required. We further note that the possibility that convergence
in some systems might be partly fortuitous cannot be entirely
excluded and warrants additional validation in future studies.
Some strategies that might be employed in future work to
systematically refine and further validate our methodology
include increasing the number of replicates under carefully
selected conditions to further reduce stochastic error and
evaluate the reproducibility. In addition, one can test
alternative sampling strategies, such as parallel tempering or
replica exchange, to more thoroughly explore conformational
space to select initial structures for FEP simulations,
particularly for challenging mutations and in analyzing the
effects of introducing double mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
The development of FEP-based methods addresses critical
challenges in drug design including accuracy, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. By refining these methods, faster and more

precise drug discovery processes may be achieved, ultimately
improving patient outcomes and reducing development costs.
FEP can model the interactions of drugs with mutated or
polymorphic targets, aiding in the development of personalized
therapeutics. For diseases with genetic variations, such as
cancer or antibiotic resistance, FEP holds immense potential in
the design of tailored drugs. For high-throughput predictions,
well-established computation protocols will prove essential.
20
In this article, we utilize a thermodynamic cycle that informs
on the relative efficiency of an enzyme in the presence of a
competitive inhibitor and relate it to the biochemical constants
K
m
and K
i
. Our framework is built upon the key assumption
that under steady-state conditions, the Michaelis constant
(K
m
) largely reflects substrate binding affinity (approximating
K
d
) because in E. coli DHFR, the rate-determining step is the
product release, which remains largely unaltered by mutations
affecting the binding site. Second, we assume that kinetic
contributions beyond binding (e.g., those from k
cat
) can be
decoupled from the binding process such that differences in
observed inhibition concentrations predominantly stem from
alterations in binding free energy. We note that if mutations
were to affect catalytic turnover or product release significantly,
these assumptions might break down. However, for the DHFR
system under competitive inhibition by trimethoprim (TMP),
experimental evidence indicates that changes in binding affinity
dominate the resistance phenotype. This assumption thereby
reduces our problem to that of comparing binding free
energies of two competitive ligands (substrate and inhibitor), a
standard scenario in alchemical free energy calculations.
We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on 13
variants of E. coli DHFR that arise in bacterial colonies under
the intense evolutionary pressure of TMP. Our thermody-
namical cycle is based on FEP simulations carried out on
substrate-bound protein in the precatalytic conformation,
which has been argued to be the step most significantly
affected by the mutations in enzymes. This is because, while
mutations often shift population states of the enzyme, favoring
catalytically competent conformations, these shifts do not
necessarily extend to altering the pathways for product release,
especially when product egress mechanisms rely on conserved
structural features.
50
This assumption holds well for our
predictions, with 11 out of the 13 systems studied falling
within the ±1 kcal/mol range (Figure 3), barring F153S and
L28R-A26T, which are in the ±2 kcal/mol range. The
measures of the overall deviations from experimental values,
in terms of RMSD of the data (0.89), Pearson correlation
coefficient (0.83), and AUC (0.82), are all favorable,
considering the complexities of the subtle conformational
changes and gradual ligand rearrangements. The largest
discrepancy is for the F153S mutant, whereby our simulations
predict a negative ΔΔG
competition
value in favor of the substrate,
while experimental data finds the difference negligible. We
note that F153S is an allosteric resistance-conferring mutation
for which other mechanisms that come into play may not have
been captured within the time frame of our simulations. Thus,
the nuanced effects of mutations on protein behavior pose
difficulties in predicting free energy changes; e.g., challenges
emerge when compensating for charge changes, necessitating
usage of additional runs or simulation of the reverse mutation
to cover the possible conformational range.
Our approach introduces a protein-centric view of the
competitive inhibition mechanisms and allows us to interpret
the effect of the mutations on the substrate-bound and the
inhibitor-bound forms of the enzyme separately. Thus,
substrate binding and inhibitor binding may be assessed
individually, which is a big advantage for rational drug design
purposes. In particular, displaying similar free energy differ-
ences for both binders implies that the effect of the mutation
does not directly involve the binding site. Moreover, epistasis
may also be interpreted in a novel way, and background
mutation selection for high-throughput mutational scanning
experiments may be suggested based on this additional
structural information. With the currently available computa-
tional resources, carrying out a total mutational scan on the
WT, followed by mutational scans in the background of
mutations selected based on this detailed knowledge, has
become possible.
20
This capability opens the way forward for
interpreting epistatic effects on fitness landscapes.
