Recent studies have revealed that liquid- liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays crucial roles in various cellular 
functions. Droplets formed via LLPS within cells, often referred to as membraneless organelles, serve to 
concentrate specific molecules, thus enhancing biochemical reactions. Artificial LLPS systems have been utilized 
to construct synthetic cell models, employing a range of synthetic molecules. LLPS systems based on DNA 
nanotechnology are particularly notable for their designable characteristics i n droplet formation, dynamics, 
properties, and functionalities. This review surveys recent advancements in DNA -based LLPS systems, 
underscoring the programmability afforded by DNA’s base-pair specific interactions. We discuss the fundamentals 
of DNA droplet formation, including temperature -dependence and physical properties, along with the precise 
control achievable through sequence design. Attention is given to the phase separation of DNA nanostructures on 
two-dimensional closed interfaces, which results in spatial pattern formation at the interface. Furthermore, we 
spotlight the potential of DNA droplet computing for cancer diagnostics through specific microRNA pattern 
recognition. We envision that DNA -based LLPS presents a versatile platform for the explo ration of cellular 
mimicry and opens innovative ways for the development of functional synthetic cells.

Introduction 
 
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) phenomenon generates droplets of water-soluble molecules in aqueous solution. 
The LLPS are  classified into two types: segregative- or associative [1]. The segregative LLPS is mainly driven by the 
immiscibility of the different components under given conditions. The aqueous two- phase system of polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) and Dextran mixtures is a typical example of the  segregative LLPS.  In associative LLPS (coacervation), the 
interaction between components induce s the formation of condensates, leading to the formation of  a molecular dense 
phase and a diluted phase.  
A cell is a complex and sophisticated molecular system in which a wide variety of components are enclosed within a 
single microscopic space. Within the cell,  biopolymer molecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, can form droplet -
like condensates via the associative LLPS. These droplets are called membraneless organelle and have roles to concentrate 
specific molecules to increase the efficiency of biochemical reactions  [2]. The LLPS also contribute to gene expression 
in the cell nucleus , where heterochromatin and euchromatin form spatial structural patterns near  the nuclear membrane 
[3]. The functions, physical properties, and principles of formation of the structures formed by LLPS have been the subject 
of numerous biophysical studies. 
The LLPS exhibited by natural biopolymer molecules, especially proteins, is an essential research target to elucidate the 
basis of cellular functions and mechanisms . On the other hand, the phase separation exhibited by synthetic molecules is 
also an important research target from the viewpoint of artificially creating and understanding cells in a bottom-up manner. 
Although the LLPS of PEG/Dextran is often adopted in artificial cell studies, it is necessary  to establish LLPS systems 
with more designable molecules to create artificial cells whose behavior can be programmed.  In these viewpoints, DNA 
nanotechnology provides a promising approach for the bottom-up construction of artificial cell-like structures [4]. Due to 
the Watson-Crick base pairing, artificially synthesized sequence-designed DNAs hybridize with specific strand pairs. This 
feature is best used to construct designed- shaped nanostructures and molecular computing system s. In recent years, the 
programmability of DNA has been extended to the LLPS  [5,6], attracting worldwide attention  in artificial cell studies . 
The LLPS of DNA nanostructures was observed when branched DNA nanostructures, such as “Y-shape” and “X-shape,” 
were mixed in a solution. The self-assembly of the branched-DNA nanostructures into macroscale hydrogels was reported 
by Um et al. in 2006  [7]. Then, the phase separation of the DNA nanostructures into DNA -rich and DNA -poor phases 
was first reported by Biffi et al. in 2017 [8], and the formation of liquid-like droplets via the LLPS was reported by Nguyen 
et al. in 2017 [ 9]. Then, our research group demonstrated the programmability of the DNA -based LLPS system in 2020 
[10]. In this review , we overview the LLPS of DNA  nanostructures and examples of research contributing to the 
construction of artificial cells based on the DNA -based LLPS system.  This review article is an extended version of the 
Japanese article [11]. 
 
Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation of DNA Nanostructures and Formation of DNA Droplets  
 
LLPS of DNA nanostructures can be observed by changing the temperature of solutions containing DNA nanostructures 
with multiple interaction sites (sticky ends) [10]. Y-shaped DNA nanostructures (Y-motifs) in a buffer solution containing 
salt self-assembled into droplet-like condensates (DNA droplets) via the LLPS  by decreasing the solution temperature  
(Fig. 1a). The DNA droplet exhibit coalescence when two of them collide with each other. The droplet formation process 
occurs during the transition from the "dispersed state" to the "droplet state" of the Y -motif. Further temperature decrease 
lead to the transition from droplets to hydrogels (Fig. 1b). It should be noted that the transition from the dispersed state to 
the droplet state occurs rapidly below the transition temperature, while the transition from the droplet state to the gel state 
is a gradual process  with temperature changes.  The DNA droplets are composed of only DNA nanostructures , but they 
can uptake DNA-tagged proteins. When streptavidin tagged with DNA whose sequence is complementary to the sticky 
end was mixed with the DNA droplets, the streptavidin accumulated in the DNA droplets. This accumulation depends on 
the DNA sequence; streptavidin tagged with non- complementary sequences is not accumulated. It shows the applicable 
potential of DNA droplets as artificial organelles that accumulate target molecules for efficient chemical reactions.  
The advantage of the DNA-based LLPS system is its tunability, which was demonstrated by the changes in the droplet 
formation temperature [10] and the physical properties of the DNA droplets [12]. As for the droplet formation temperature, 
a shorter sticky end sequence, i.e., a less stable sequence, resulted in a lower droplet formation temperature (Fig. 1c). This 
result showed that the molecular design approach can offer the means for tuning the droplet formation temperature.  The 
physical properties of the droplet, including viscosity and surface tension, were also varied with the sticky end sequence. 
In comparing the fusion dynamics of the droplets at the droplet formation temperature (Fig. 1d). it was suggested that the 
sticky end stability affected the viscosity but ha d more impact on the  surface tension. It is proposed that the surface 
tension of the DNA droplets is dominated by the unbound sticky end at the droplet’s surface, which will generate a surface 
excess free energy. Indeed, the experiment performed at 22°C suggested the relationship between the expected free 
energy of the sticky ends and the amount of unbound sticky ends [ 13]. On the other hand, the experiment performed at

the droplet formation temperature, much higher than the melting temperature ( T
m) of sticky end hybridization, did not 
show the correlation between the free energy and the surface tension. A deepening understanding of the hybridization 
dynamics under such unstable conditions, i.e., much higher than T
m, would explain how the sticky end interaction alters 
the physical properties. 
Rational design of the sticky end sequences can achieve the selective fusion and fission  of DNA droplets  [10]. When 
two types of DNA nanostructures  (Y-motif and orthogonal Y-motif: orthY-motif), whose sequences are orthogonal (no n-
complementary), each nanostructure form DNA droplets that show selective and exclusive fusion (Fig. 2a). Namely, Y-
motif forms the DNA droplets composed of only Y -motifs (Y-motif droplets), and orthY-motif forms the DNA droplets 
composed of only orthY-motif (orthY-motif droplets). The Y- and orthY-motif droplets can fuse only with the same types of 
droplets but never show the fusion between Y- and orthY-motif droplets. This immiscibility between the two different DNA 
droplets can be eliminated by adding cross-linker DNA nanostructures that can bind to both types of the motifs (Fig. 2b). 
The mixed DNA droplets can exhibit fission when the cross -linker DNA nanostructures are cleaved into two portions so 
that their cross -linking ability is  lost (Fig. 2c). Thus, the LLPS of DNA nanostructures can control various dynamic 
behaviors, such as the immiscibility  between the DNA droplets and the droplet fission, based on the base sequences and 
the nanostructure design.  
The advantage of the DNA -based LLPS system is not limited to the sequence -dependent interaction. A nanostructure 
size, structural flexibility, and the number of interaction sites impact the DNA -based LLPS system. Growth rate of DNA 
droplets was found to be  slower for smaller motifs and faster for larger motifs [1 4] (Fig. 3a). When single-stranded and 
double-stranded DNA were combined to create motifs to prepare different flexibility of interaction sites, the more flexible 
motifs were less likely to form the droplets by LLPS and vice versa [15]. In addition, by varying the number of interaction 
sites, a larger number of the interaction sites led to a higher droplet formation temperature [10] (Fig. 3b). These findings 
provide various design parameters of the DNA-based LLPS system in addition to the sequence design of DNA.

Sato and Takinoue: DNA-based liquid-liquid phase separation 
 
Phase Separation of DNA Nanostructures on a Two-dimensional Closed Interface 
 
The phase separation of DNA nanostructures described above was observed in bulk solution. As we described in the 
Introduction, chromatin in the cell nucleus exhibits a spatial phase -separation pattern in the vicinity of the nuclear 
membrane. Several studies revealed that the LLPS of the DNA nanostructures also shows pattern formation on a two-
dimensional closed interface. 
Because DNA is a negatively charged polymer molecule, when cell -sized water-in-oil (W/O) droplets were prepared 
with positively charged amphiphilic molecules, DNA nanostructures were adsorbed on the water/oil interface. When the 
W/O droplet solution, whose  aqueous phase contains the Y -motif, was heated and cooled gradually, the porous pattern 
was formed [1 6] (Fig. 4a). When the temperature change was faster, the porous pattern was not formed. The research 
revealed that there are two routes for the pattern formation: (1) simple viscoelastic phase separation (VPS) and (2) cluster-
cluster aggregation after the VPS (interaction of coacervate particles). This phenomenon was explained by three factors: 
accumulation of the motifs at the interface, (2) concentration  of the accumulated motifs, and (3) diffusion of the motifs. 
The detailed mechanism of the phenomena is described in the reference paper [16].  
Although the porous pattern was observed in only the Y -motif solution in the cell- sized W/O droplets, more various 
patterns can be formed in the Y- and 
orthY-motif combined system [17] (Fig. 4b). In the bulk solution, Y- and orthY-motif 
individually form two types of DNA droplets. On the other hand, when the motifs are accumulated at the interface by 
electrostatic interaction, the two types of droplets did not form, but patterns of Y- and 
orthY-motif-rich regions were formed 
(DNA phase-separated capsule). The pattern formation is thought to be due to that the immiscible behavior between the 
two types of DNA droplets was defined by the boundary of the oil-water interface. In bulk solution, the Y- and the orthY-
motif are not spatially defined and form droplets independently. However, by restricting the position of the motifs to the 
interface through electrostatic interaction, the phase separation changes to a lateral phase separation , as seen in lipid 
bilayer membranes, leading to the formation of patterns. Detailed investigation of the relationship between the space size 
and the pattern formed, as well as the pattern formation process, may lead to the construction and control of artificial cell 
nuclei.

e210010_5
An i mportant achievement in the above  works is that the formed structures on the W/O droplet interfaces can be 
extracted to aqueous solution [16,17] (Fig. 4c and 4d). Because the Y-motifs formed hydrogels at room temperature, the 
formed structures on the interface is not fluid but stable. Both works successfully demonstrated the extraction of the 
"capsule-like" DNA hydrogels with patterns formed by the VPS or immiscibility of two different Y-motifs. On the other 
hand, the extracted structures were not compl etely spherical shape. The mechanism is discussed to be that the hydrogel 
is distorted due to its softness and excess surface area when it is released from adsorption on the interface [ 18]. Since 
various functional DNA nanostructures for sensing or actuation were developed, the cell-sized DNA microcapsules would 
possibly be adopted as a compartment for artificial cells functionalized with the DNA devices.  
 
"Intelligent" Droplets: microRNA Pattern Detection by DNA Droplets 
 
One of the major differences  between the DNA droplets and other polymer droplets  is the ability to use  the 
"information" encoded in the DNA base sequences , just as genetic information is encoded in the base sequence. In the 
field of DNA computing [18,19], the base-specific interaction is used to construct logic gates and information processing 
devices. Because the DNA droplets were assembled from the sequence- designed DNAs, DNA droplets could have the 
capability of information processing. The potential was demonstrated as a microRNA (miRNA) detection function [20]. 
Cancer cells show a particular miRNA expression pattern. By using the  miRNA pattern as an input for computing, the 
detection of a specific combination of the four miRNAs, which are known as a set of cancer markers (Fig. 5). As an output 
of the detection, fission of the DNA droplets was used. In the reported DNA droplet computing system, three types of Y-
motifs, each sequence is orthogonal, are connected by the two types of cross -linker DNA nanostructures. The cross -
linkers can accept miRNAs and can split  into two portions depending on the miRNA sequences, resulting in the fission 
of DNA droplets. As the demonstration, the expression patterns of four types of miRNAs (miRNA-1, miRNA-2, miRNA-
3, miRNA-4) = (yes, yes, yes, no), specific to breast cancer and determines the possibility of breast cancer, was used as 
the input and the DNA droplets successfully exhibited the fission only when the specific patterns were given as the input 
signals. For details of the principle and achievements, please refer to Reference [20]. Although there are many points that  
need to be improved in this system, such as sensitivity to input, the successful demonstration would lead to constructing 
a molecular system that shows practical functions by the combination of DNA computing and the DNA -based LLPS 
indicates the possibility of constructing intelligent artificial cells and their applications.

Sato and Takinoue: DNA-based liquid-liquid phase separation 
 
Conclusion 
 
As overviewed in this review , phase separation of DNA nanostructures can be designed based on molecular design. 
Fusion and fission of the DNA droplets can be well controlled by the base sequence designs. Patterns derived from phase 
separation are formed by regulating the spatial area of the phase separation to a two- dimensional closed space.  By 
combining DNA computing techniques and the phase separation, the DNA droplets can have i nformation processing 
function. These achievements are expected to contribute significantly to the technology for constructing artificial cells.  
On the other hand, the design technology of amino acid sequences has been rapidly growing in recent years  [21] . 
Additionally, de novo protein design can be assisted with a neural network [ 22]. In the near future, the combination of 
the phase separation of designed proteins and DNA nanostructures would possibly emerge as a novel artificial LLPS 
system. Such a hybrid LLPS system will emerge as the new technique for the construction of functional artificial cells, 
such as programmable gene expression regulation based on phase separation.
