Abstract: The magnetic shielding device is used to provide an extreme weak magnetic ﬁeld, which
plays a key role in variety of ﬁelds. Since the high-permeability material constituting the magnetic
shielding device determines the magnetic shielding performance, it is important to evaluate the
property of the high-permeability material. In this paper, the relationship between the microstructure
and the magnetic properties of the high-permeability material is analyzed using minimum free energy
principle based on magnetic domain theory, and the test method of the material’s microstructure
including the material composition, the texture and the grain structure to reﬂect the magnetic
properties is put forward. The test result shows that the grain structure is closely related to the initial
permeability and the coercivity, which is highly consistent with the theory. As a result, it provides
a more efﬁcient way to evaluate the property of the high-permeability material. The test method
proposed in the paper has important signiﬁcance in the high efﬁciency sampling inspection of the
high-permeability material.

1. Introduction
The magnetic shielding device is used to reduce the ambient magnetic interfering
signals (including the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the ambient magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations)
signiﬁcantly, by which, an extreme weak, high uniform, small time drifts, and low noisy
magnetic ﬁeld could be obtained [ 1–3]. The demands for the magnetic shielding device
come from a variety of ﬁelds such as fundamental physics [4,5], biomedical science [6,7],
underground survey [8], space research [9], and industrial applications [10]. One typical
application of a magnetic shielding device in industry is the high sensitivity magnetic
detection based on the effect of spin change relaxation free (SERF). With the advantages of
non-radiation, non-contact, high sensitivity, small volume, and low cost [11,12], the high
sensitivity magnetic detection brings broad application prospect and high commercial
value, especially in the areas of magnetocardiogram (MCG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) [13]. The magnetic shielding device plays a key role to ensure the accuracy and
sensitivity of the magnetic detection.
Magnetic shielding device is usually constructed by the high-permeability materials
based on the effect of ﬂux shunting [ 14], and high-conductivity materials based on the
effect of eddy current [15]. Among them, the property of the high-permeability materials
(a kind of soft magnetic material) always determines the performance of the magnetic
shielding device in most applications [16,17]. In order to achieve a better magnetic shielding

performance, it is important to obtain the complete property of the high-permeability
material before the construction of the magnetic shielding device.
The most concerned magnetic properties of the high-permeability material related to
magnetic shielding performance are the initial permeability, the coercivity, the maximal
permeability, the saturation magnetic induction, and the remanence [18], which could be ob-
tained by a standard soft magnetic testing instrument such as MATS-3000S. The measuring
principle by a standard soft magnetic testing instrument is based on the electromagnetic in-
duction, and the magnetic properties could be obtained by the hysteresis loop [19]. The test
ring needs to be wound evenly by coils to generate the excitation magnetic ﬁeld and obtain
induced voltage for the calculation of magnetic induction intensity [20], which brings the
testing process inconvenience and low efﬁciency. In some recent studies, the probe and
H-coil without winding were used to obtain the magnetic induction intensity and magnetic
ﬁeld intensity, respectively [17,21]. However, the structure used to form the closed magnetic
loop is still complex and the accuracy in low magnetic ﬁeld intensity is hard to maintain.
According to the research on the soft magnetic materials, the magnetic properties could
be explained by the magnetic domain theory [22–25]. The minimum free energy principle
(MFE) [26] based on magnetic domain theory is usually used to calculate the magnetic
properties of soft magnetic materials, such as the initial permeability and the coercivity.
The initial permeability and the coercivity could be reﬂected by the anisotropy and the
magnetostriction (related to the material composition and texture), the grain structure,
the defect, the stress, etc. [18,27]. The MFE method is already used to calculate the inﬂuence
of stress and defects, but rarely used to analyze the pinning effect of the grain boundary.
Since the measurement of the microstructure is more direct and efﬁcient, we are motivated
to explain the mechanism of microstructure in theory and explore a new test method for
the high-permeability material focusing on the microstructure.
In this paper, a test method of high-permeability material’s microstructure including
the material composition, the texture, and the grain structure is proposed, and the rela-
tionship between the microstructure and the magnetic properties of the high-permeability
material is analyzed and calculated through the magnetic domain theory, which is veriﬁed
by the experiment. The main contributions are listed as follows: (1) a novel test method of
the high-permeability material’s microstructure to reﬂect the high-permeability material’s
magnetic properties is proposed for the ﬁrst time. (2) MFE based on magnetic domain
theory to explain the pinning effect of the grain boundary is ﬁrstly introduced to analyze
the relationship between the microstructure and the magnetic properties. (3) An effective
formulation of etchant for permalloy corrosion is obtained. (4) Compared with typical
magnetic testing methods, the proposed method of microstructure to obtain the magnetic
properties will promote the detection efﬁciency and reduce the detection complexity.
This paper is organized as follows. The theory reﬂecting the relationship between the
microstructure and the magnetic properties of the high-permeability material is described
in Section 2. The test of magnetic properties and microstructure of the high-permeability
material is recorded in Section 3. The discussion of the test results when compared with the
theory is arranged in Section 4. Through the experiment results, the relationship between
the microstructure and the magnetic properties is proved to be clear and credible, which
provides a new approach to evaluate the property of the high permeability material.
2. Theory of Microstructure’s Magnetic Properties
The magnetic domain theory is widely applied to explain the magnetic properties’
mechanism of the high-permeability material [24,28,29], which follows the minimum free
energy principle. For a ferromagnet with unit volume, the total free energy FT could be
described as follows:
FT = FH + Fσ + Fw (1)
where FH is the external magnetic ﬁeld energy, Fσ is the magnetoelastic energy and Fw
is the domain wall energy. The most commonly used high-permeability material in the
magnetic shielding device is the large-grained material such as permalloy, and the grain
Materials 2023, 16, 3956 3 of 14
size D follows the relation D ≫Lex , where Lex = √A/K1 is the ferromagnetic exchange
length, A is the exchange energy constant and K1 is the anisotropy constant. The magnetic
properties of large-grained material could be explained by the domain wall extension
theory. During the process of domain wall expansion, the change of domain distribution
follows the minimum free energy principle:
δFT = δFH + δFσ + δFw = 0 (2)
Ignoring the change of magnetoelastic energy near the domain wall, the magnetization
equation could be written as:
−δFH = δFw (3)
For the typical 180° domain wall, the variation of the external magnetic ﬁeld driving
energy δFH and the domain wall energy δFw could be expressed as:
δFH = −µ0 Ms Hcos0◦−(−µ0 Ms Hcos180◦) = −2µ0 Ms H (4)
δFw = ∂rw
∂x (5)
where µ0 represents the permeability of vacuum, MS is the saturated magnetization and H
is the external magnetic ﬁeld intensity, rw is the domain wall energy and x is the displace-
ment of domain wall expansion in one dimension. Then, the displacement equilibrium
equation for the 180° domain wall could be obtained from Equation (2) as follows:
2µ0 Ms H = ∂rw
∂x (6)
The differential of the 180° domain wall energy ∂rw
∂x could be expressed as [29]:
∂rw
∂x = A( dφ
dx )2 + K1sin2φ, x ∈(−∞, +∞) (7)
where φ is the rotation angle of the domain and
φ = 2arctan (e
x
Lex ) (8)
The typical parameters to evaluate the magnetic properties of the magnetic shielding
device include the coercivity and the initial permeability. The coercivity is produced
when the variation of the domain wall energy exceeds the peak value, which makes the
magnetization process irreversible. The coercivity in the domain wall extension model Hc0
from Equation (6) could be expressed as follows:
Hc0 = 1
2µ0 Ms
( ∂rw
∂x )max = K1
µ0 Ms
(9)
For material with large grains, the magnetization process is determined by domain wall
pinning at the grain boundaries, so the coercivity for material with large grains Hc is
obtained as follows:
Hc = PH
Lex
D Hc0 = PH
√AK1
µ0 MsD (10)
where D is the grain size and PH is the correction factor for the domain size and the rotation
angle of the adjacent magnetic domains.
The initial permeability is related to the magnetic susceptibility of the material. When
the external magnetic ﬁeld intensity varies δH, domain wall moves a distance of δx. Ac-
cording to Equation (6), the relationship of ∆H and ∆x in the 180° domain wall could be
written as:
2µ0 Ms∆H = ∂2rw
∂x2 |x=x0 ∆x (11)
Materials 2023, 16, 3956 4 of 14
where x0 is the initial position of the domain wall, and the magnetization varies along with
the domain wall displacement as:
∆M = 2MsS∆x (12)
where ∆H represents the variation of the magnetization and S is the area of the domain
wall. Then, the initial susceptibility χi0 could be obtained as:
χi0 = ∆M
∆H = 4µ0 M2
s S/( ∂2rw
∂x2 |x=x0 ) (13)
It is not easy to determine the initial position in a domain, so the average variation rate is
used as the approximate substitution as follows:
∂2rw
∂x2 |x=x0 ≈(( ∂rw
∂x )max −0)/(ld/2) = 4K1
ld
(14)
where ld is the width of the domain. In the unit volume, the area of domain wall could be
expressed as S = 1/ld. According to Equation (13), the initial permeability of the domain
µi0 could be written as:
µi0 ≈χi0 ≈µ0 M2
s /K1 (15)
Considering the material with large grains pinning at the grain boundaries, the initial
permeability µi could be obtained as follows:
µi = Pµ
D
Lex
µi0 = Pµ
µ0 M2
s D√AK1
(16)
where Pµ is the correction factor for the domain size and the rotation angle of the adjacent
magnetic domains.
The relationship between the magnetic properties and the microstructure is established
according to Equations (10) and (16), where the parameters A, K1, and Ms are related to the
material composition and the texture, and D is related to the grain structure.
3. Test and Results
There is a clear correlation between the magnetic properties and the microstructure of
large grains’ material in theory. This section introduces the testing method of the microstruc-
ture and explores the relation between the magnetic properties and the microstructure
by experiments. The permalloy used in the magnetic shielding device is chosen as the
material of the test samples with different annealing processes by different manufacturers.

3.1. Magnetic Properties Test
In order to obtain the magnetic properties, the test samples are processed into a circular
shape to match the standard soft magnetic testing device (MATS-3000S). The measuring
principle by the standard soft magnetic testing instrument is based on the electromagnetic
induction, and the magnetic properties could be obtained by the hysteresis loop from
Materials 2023, 16, 3956 5 of 14
the device. The test samples were wound evenly by the excitation coil to generate the
excitation magnetic ﬁeld and the induction coil to obtain induced voltage for the calculation
of magnetic induction intensity, which is shown in Figure 1. The test sample, the excitation
coil, and the induction coil are separated by the insulation ﬁlm to avoid short circuiting.
During the test, laminations are used to increase the signal strength of the induction coil.
The test parameters for each sample is arranged in Table 2.

3.2. Microstructure Test
To verify the relation between the magnetic properties and the microstructure, the
measurement of the material composition, the texture, and the grain structure is described in
this section. The material compositions of samples were analyzed using a scanning electron
microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (NOVA NANO SEM 200). The textures
of samples were measured by an X-ray diffractomer (XRD-7000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
using CuKα radiation with a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The step size is 0.02°,
the scanning speed is 2 °/min, and the scanning range is 20 ∼90°. The grain structure is
observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope(LEXT OLS5100, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
3.2.1. Material Composition Test
The compositions of the test samples in Table 1 were tested using the scanning electron
microscope (SEM). The testing procedures of material composition are listed as follows:
• Cut the test samples into appropriately sized pieces, then wash and dry the pieces for
later use;
• Polish the surface of the sample pieces until they are smooth as a mirror;
• Place the test pieces in the SEM and observe them at magniﬁcation of 200 and 1600,
respectively;
• Take photos in back scattered electron (BSE) mode and secondary electron detect (SED)
mode in the typical area;
• Obtain the main constituent elements and their proportion using energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) at the detection location.
In the measurement of SEM, the BSE mode was used to obtain the phase distribution
and the SED mode was used to observe the surface topography. Through the comparison of
the pictures taken in BSE mode and in SED mode, the phase composition of the test sample
could be obtained. Figure 3 shows the pictures in BSE mode and SED mode of Sample 1 in
the same detection scope with magniﬁcation of 1600.
From Figure 3a, it could be seen that there are three types of contrast in Sample 1,
including light gray, dark gray (red circles), and black (blue circles). From Figure 3b, it
could be seen that the black contrast represents the surface pits of the sample. So there are
two phases in Sample 1, which are matrix phase and impurity phase. Then EDS is used to
analyze the phases by scanning the chosen points, which is shown in Figure 4.

mode. (b) SED mode.
Figure 4. Phase distribution in Sample 1: ( a) Pictures taken in BSE mode and the scanning points’
position. (b) Elemental spectrum.
The element contents of the matrix phase and the impurity phase in Sample 1 are
arranged in Table 4. It could be seen the main elements of the matrix phase in Sample 1
include Ni, Fe, and Mo, with the proportion of 80wt%, 15wt%, and 5wt%, respectively.
Compared with the matrix phase, the impurity phase is clearly mixed with elements
including C, O, and Si. It is inferred that the impurity phase should be a mixture of Ni/Fe
carbide and SiO2, and SiO2 may originate from the abrasive in the polishing process. Since
the relative content of impurity phase is quite low, the inﬂuence of the impurity phase
could be ignored.

Impurity phase 53.56 10.43 3.54 0.50 0.19 1.16 26.81 3.81
The BSE pictures of all test samples are shown in Figure 5, and the analyzed com-
positions for the matrix phase of the samples are arranged in Table 5. It could be seen
that the element type and content of each sample is essentially same except Sample 2,
which contains a lot of Nb. Since Sample 2 and Sample 1 were provided by the same
manufacturer, among which Sample 1 contains little Nb, the element of Nb may come from
the annealing process. Despite this, the compositions of all samples are still similar, so the
material composition is not the main reason on the difference in magnetic properties of the
test samples.

3.2.2. Texture Test
The testing procedure of the texture by the X-ray diffractomer (XRD) is listedas follows:
• Cut the test samples into appropriately sized pieces;
Materials 2023, 16, 3956 9 of 14
• Remove surface impurities of the sample pieces through polishing until the surface
appears to be metallic luster;
• Fix the sample pieces using rubber putty as the sample holder and place the samples
in XRD for detection;
• Analyze the XRD data and obtain the textures of the samples.
The normalized test results of all samples are arranged in Figure 6.
Figure 6. The test results of XRD.
It could be seen that all samples show high-intensity peaks in texture orientation (111),
(200), and (220), which are consistent with the standard powder diffraction ﬁle (PDF) card of
permalloy (No. 65-3244). Therefore, the samples by different manufacturers show similarity
in texture. However, from Figure 6, it could be seen that there are some intensity peaks not
containing in PDF card No. 65-3244 which are marked with diamond symbol. Comparing
with the related PDF card, the intensity peaks marked with white diamond symbol came
from the sample holder (calcium carbonate, PDF card No. 88-1807). The intensity peaks
marked with black diamond symbol came from the impurities unable to ﬁnd corresponding
PDF card, which might be the sosoloid of Fe and Mo or Ni and Mo. Considering that the
textures of all samples are similar, the texture contributes little on the difference in magnetic
properties of the test samples.
3.2.3. Grain Structure Test
The testing procedures of the grain structure by the confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM) are listed as follows:
• Cut the test samples into appropriately sized pieces;
• Polish the surface of the sample pieces;
• Make chemical corrosion on samples’ surface to present grain morphology;
• Observe the grain morphology of each sample and calculate the size of grain.
Based on corrosion experience of steel materials and high-temperature alloy materials[30,31],
three kinds of etchant were prepared for corrosion testing including 4% nitric acid alco-
hol solution, 4:10:20 copper sulfate/hydrochloric acid/water solution, and 1.8:10:20 iron
chloride/hydrochloric acid/water solution.
A 4% nitric acid alcohol solution is usually used in the metallographic corrosion of
steel materials. During the test, the permalloy was soaked in the 4% nitric acid alcohol
solution for 5 min; there were no obvious signs of corrosion on the permalloy’s surface,
which shows that the corrosion solution could not corrode the permalloy.
Materials 2023, 16, 3956 10 of 14
A 4:10:20 copper sulfate/hydrochloric acid/water solution is usually used in Ni-base
superalloy. During the test, it was found that the 4:10:20 copper sulfate/hydrochloric
acid/water solution was easy to form an oxide ﬁlm on the surface of permalloy, which
made it hard to distinguishing the grain structure, as shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7. The SEM picture of permalloy surface corroded by 4:10:20 copper sulfate/hydrochloric
acid/water solution: (a) magniﬁcation of 200. ( b) magniﬁcation of 1600.
A 1.8:10:20 iron chloride/hydrochloric acid/water solution is another etchant for
Ni-base alloy. During the test, the grain structure of permalloy was clearly presented after
corrosion for about 1.5 min. So the 1.8:10:20 iron chloride/hydrochloric acid/water solution
was chosen as the etchant for the test samples. The grain structure of the test samples after
corrosion are observed by CLSM, which are shown in Figure 8.
It could be seen that the grain size of the test samples varies greatly, for the samples
came from different manufacturers with different annealing processes. The grain size of
each sample was measured by the intersection point method according to the measurement
standard GB/T 6394-2017 [32].
The procedures are listed as follows:
• Prepare the representative picture taken by CLSM for grain size calculation;
• Draw three circles with Radius R1, R2, and R3 on the picture (the biggest circle should
be as large as possible within the scope of the picture);
• Calculate the intersection points’ number of the grains and the circles Ni;
• Obtain the average grain size L according to the equation below:
L = L
M ·Ni
(17)
where L is the sum of circumference of the three circles and M is the magniﬁcation.
The grain size of each sample is arranged in Table 6 and the relation between the grain
size and the magnetic properties from the test results is shown in Figure 9. The test result
shows that the grain size is closely related to the initial permeability and the coercivity,
which is consistent with the theory.

4. Discussion
The test method of permalloy including the material composition, the texture, and the
grain structure is proposed are described in the previous section of this paper. According to
the test result of different samples, the grain structures are closely related to the magnetic
properties. The theory shows that the initial permeability is proportional to the grain size
(µi∼D) and the coercivity is inversely proportional to the grain size (Hc∼1/D) according to
Equations (10) and (16). To explore the relation between the theory and the experiments,
the D ﬁtting curve and 1/D ﬁtting curve are introduced for comparison, which are shown
in Figure 10. Considering the saturation magnetic induction for each sample is different,
which is proportional to the saturated magnetization (Bs∼Ms), the saturated magnetization
correction for the ﬁtting curve is also drawn in Figure 10.
Figure 10. The comparison the test results, the ﬁtting curve and the saturated magnetization correction
for the ﬁtting curve: ( a) Grain size and initial permeability. (b) Grain size and coercivity.
It could be seen that the ﬁtting curve could clearly describe the variation trend of the
grain size with the initial permeability and the coercivity from test results, which proves
the consistency between theory and experiment. Meanwhile, after saturated magnetization
correction, the ﬁtting points are closer to the test data, which veriﬁes the correctness of
Equations (10) and (16). Other magnetic properties such as the saturation magnetic induc-
tion, the maximum permeability and the remanence are related to the inherent attributes of
the material, which are comprehensive and hard to observe. So the change patterns of the
other magnetic properties are difﬁcult to obtain, which are not discussed in the manuscript.
Since the initial permeability and the coercivity could directly reﬂect the performance
of the permalloy, which could be observed directly from the grain size, the method of
evaluating the property of the high-permeability material has been broadened. Meanwhile,
the procedure of polishing and chemical corrosion could be easily completed by automated
devices, which brings the promotion of the efﬁciency comparing with the soft magnetic
testing instruments.

the high-permeability material’s magnetic properties. The relationship between the mi-
crostructure and the magnetic properties of the high-permeability material is derived and
calculated through the magnetic domain theory using MFE to explain the pinning effect for
the ﬁrst time. Through the experiment, the relationship between the microstructure and the
magnetic properties is proved to be clear and credible, which provides a new approach of
evaluating the property of the high-permeability material. Compared with typical magnetic
testing methods, the proposed method of microstructure to obtain the magnetic proper-
ties will promote the detection efﬁciency and reduce the detection complexity in some
detection cases. It has important signiﬁcance in the high efﬁciency sampling inspection for
industrial applications.
