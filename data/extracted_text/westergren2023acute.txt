ABSTRACT
Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a highly 
prevalent, complex and distressing condition that 
may negatively affect all domains of life. In view of an 
active inference framework, and resting on the concept 
of allostasis, human movement per se becomes a 
prerequisite for health and well- being while chronic 
pain becomes a sign of a system unable to attenuate an 
allostatic load. Previous studies on different subgroups 
of chronic pain conditions have demonstrated alterations 
in gait kinematics and muscle activity, indicating shared 
disturbances in the motor system from long- term allostatic 
load. We hypothesise that such alterations exist in 
heterogenous populations with chronic musculoskeletal 
pain, and that exposure to acute and controlled exercise 
may attenuate these alterations. Therefore, the main aim 
of this study is to investigate the acute effects of exercise 
on gait kinematics and activity of the back and neck 
muscles during diverse walking conditions in patients with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain compared with a reference 
sample consisting of healthy participants.
Methods and analysis This two- sample two- armed 
parallel randomised controlled laboratory trial will include 
40 participants with chronic musculoskeletal pain (>3 
months) and 40 healthy participants. Participants will be 
randomly allocated to either 30 min of aerobic exercise 
or rest. Primary outcomes are gait kinematics (walking 
speed, step frequency, stride length, lumbar rotation, gait 
stability) and muscular activity (spatial and temporal) of 
the back and neck during diverse walking conditions. 
Secondary outcomes are variability of gait kinematics 
and muscle activity and subjective pain ratings assessed 
regularly during the trial.
Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved 
by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden 
(#2018/307). Findings will be disseminated via conference 
presentations, publications in peer- reviewed journals and 
engagement with patient support groups and clinicians.
Trial registration number NCT03882333.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a highly prev-
alent and complex condition that continues 
to challenge clinicians and academics and 
as such constitutes a major health and well- 
being burden. 1 2  The International Associ-
ation for the Study of Pain defines chronic 
pain as ‘pain which has persisted beyond 
normal tissue healing time’, which, in the 
absence of other factors, is a pain condition 
lasting for more than 3 months.3 A condi-
tion with chronic musculoskeletal pain may 
be referred to as chronic primary pain 4 and 
should be seen as a disease in its own right. 5 
Chronic musculoskeletal pain can negatively 
affect physical movement and functioning, 
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ To our knowledge, this will be the first randomised 
controlled laboratory trial investigating the acute ef-
fects of aerobic exercise, as active inference, on gait 
kinematics and muscular activity in a heterogenous 
group of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
 ⇒ As long- term aerobic exercise is ultimately the result 
of regular sessions of aerobic exercise, studying ef-
fects induced by a single session of aerobic exercise 
will provide important insights into exercise and its 
role in the rehabilitation of chronic pain conditions.
 ⇒ The study will incorporate objective measures of 
gait kinematics and muscle activity from continu-
ous overground walking by using modern wireless 
sensors, thus replicating real- world conditions of 
functional movement.
 ⇒ While complete blinding is not possible post inter -
vention, due to the nature of exercise, care will be 
taken to minimise investigator bias by using auto-
mated recording protocols.

sleep, social interaction, quality of life and work ability, 6 
in essence all domains of life.
In the light of an active inference framework, 7–9 based 
on the free energy principle proposed by Friston10 11 and 
resting on the concept of allostasis, 12 any living system 
becomes a model of the world it inhabits. Then, through 
the process of active inference, it attempts to maximise 
the proof of its own existence (chances of survival) by 
minimising prediction errors (variational free energy) 
through perception and action. The physiological 
concept of allostasis can be described as achieving stability 
through change,12 in which the rate of change influences 
the process of adaption. In addition, living things may 
be defined by their ability to move autonomously, be it 
of bodies, limbs or cells, making movement a key driver 
of allostasis through sensory palpation of the world. In 
view of this, human movement, from cell respiration to 
locomotion, may constitute the major source of active 
inference on which the organism builds and maintains 
its model, making human movement of all sorts pertinent 
to long- term health and prosperity by facilitating the 
changes that are needed for stability.
Building on this notion, in a healthy context acute 
pain can be viewed as a precision signal for learning and 
control, with the main function being motivational to 
direct both short- term and long- term motor behaviour 
away from harm.13 Chronic musculoskeletal pain, on the 
other hand, is suggestive of a living system in distress and 
may be explained by the creation and maintenance of 
abnormal priors that are afforded abnormal attention in 
a self- evidencing system.7 14
This reasoning is—we believe—in line with earlier theo-
ries such as the body- self neuromatrix model,15 the theory 
of moving differently in pain 16 and effectively aligning 
with concepts such as sensitisation, 17 18  and ultimately 
depression19 within chronic pain populations, as well as 
recent theory on active interoceptive inference. 20 Then 
chronic pain can also be viewed as the consequence of 
an allostatic overload from unresolved prediction errors 
of the system’s lower level predictions about its internal 
and external milieu. 17 19 21–24  These prediction errors in 
lower level predictions may manifest themselves at higher 
levels as fear avoidance behaviour of movement 25 and 
intolerance of uncertainty, 26 which lead to the further 
reduction of physical activity. 27–29 This relative sensory 
deprivation30 31  that is induced by sedentary behaviour 
may disable self- organisation normally driven through 
allostasis, leading to aberrant neurosignatures (models) 
of painful states. In essence, chronic musculoskeletal pain 
becomes a pathophysiology with a self- fulfilling hypothesis 
of pain as the systems only solution to minimise prediction 
errors. Building on this notion, physical activity and exer-
cise, or simply human movement, can be viewed as active 
inference and as such may facilitate a return to allostasis 
and less painful future states by promoting the flexible 
reassignment of precision weighting that alters the indi-
vidual’s prediction about their body and their world. 32 
This implies that adding physical activity or exercise to a 
rehabilitation programme may simply be reintroducing 
something essential that was engineered away genera-
tions ago.
From this active inference view of chronic pain, it is 
understandable that a biopsychosocial approach has 
gained traction in the treatment of chronic pain condi-
tions,6 33–35  since such interdisciplinary treatment deliv-
ered by a team of allied health professionals involves a 
combination of physical activity and exercise, psycho-
logical interventions, pharmaceutical treatments and 
patient education all acting as active inference33 enabling 
a return to less painful states.
Given the fact that the musculoskeletal system is crucial 
to human locomotion or functional movement, a large 
body of research has focused on the effects of chronic 
pain on functional movement. There is now moderate-  
to- strong evidence that individuals with persistent low 
back pain demonstrate differences in gait kinematics, 34 
that individuals with non- specific low back pain demon-
strate impaired postural control when standing35 and that 
individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia demonstrate an 
altered gait compared with healthy individuals. 36 Neuro-
imaging studies have reported functional brain changes 
related to sensorimotor impairment in individuals with 
low back pain, 37 irritable bowel syndrome, 14 fibromy-
algia38 and migraine,39 suggestive of shared disturbances 
of the motor system across different diagnoses. The 
overall finding is that persons with chronic pain condi-
tions walk slower, with a lower step frequency, shorter 
step length and with a greater amplitude of back muscle 
activity.34–36
However, based on the notion of a shared distur -
bance, it is currently not known if the altered gait 
patterns identified in specific subgroups of chronic 
pain patients may generalise to wider populations of 
chronic musculoskeletal pain patients and if they could 
be used as markers of functional movement impairment 
in these populations. There is a paucity in how exercise, 
viewed as active inference, can have an acute effect on 
the motor control of walking in humans, especially in 
adaptions to perturbations such as faster walking speeds 
or dual tasks and if this is related to long- term sedentary 
behaviour.
Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate 
the acute effects of exercise as active inference on gait 
kinematics and activity of the back and neck muscles 
during diverse walking conditions in patients with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain compared with a reference sample 
consisting of participants without chronic musculoskel-
etal pain.
Our hypothesis is that a wide sample with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain will walk at lower speeds with lower 
step frequency and stride lengths but with increased 
muscle activity in the back and neck and that these differ-
ences will increase with task difficulty and begin to atten-
uate acutely by exercise.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial design
The study consists of a two- sample two- armed parallel 
randomised controlled laboratory trial (RCT) that will 
be conducted at Dalarna University, Sweden (figure 1). 
The main sample consists of patients with chronic pain 
who will be randomised into one of two arms: an interven-
tion group performing a single session of acute aerobic 
exercise (30 min stationary cycling) or a resting control 
group. The reference sample consists of participants 
without chronic musculoskeletal pain who will follow a 
similar RCT procedure, with the purpose being to investi-
gate whether the acute response to exercise is unique for 
patients with chronic pain as our hypothesis proposes, or 
if it is just a general effect that would be seen in any popu-
lation. The trial will comply with Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials and Standard Protocol Items: Recom-
mendations for Interventional Trials guidelines with 
Patient Reported Outcomes (SPIRIT). 40–42 A completed 
SPIRIT checklist for the trial can be found in online 
supplemental appendix 1. Data will be collected between 
January 2019 and May 2021.
For our primary outcome, a total estimated sample size 
of n=80 (n=20 in each of the four randomised groups) 
was determined based on previous studies using similar 
design and wearable technology. 43 44  A supplementary 
power calculation was conducted using normalised right- 
side erector spinae longissimus back muscle activity 
collected from the initial 20 participants to confirm the 
adequacy of the sample size. The analysis confirmed that 
a total sample size of n=80 is required to achieve a statis-
tical power of 80% at a significance level of α=0.05 (two 
tailed) to detect a 25% difference between patients and 
participants without musculoskeletal pain.
Participants and setting
This trial includes 80 participants. Patients (n=40) that 
visit primary and specialist pain clinics in Region Dalarna 
for evaluation or treatment of chronic musculoskel-
etal pain (> 3 months), as well as an age- matched and 
gender- matched convenience sample of participants 
without musculoskeletal pain (n=40), will be simultane-
ously recruited. The physiotherapists treating or evalu-
ating potential participants at the cooperating clinics will 
act as liaisons to inform patients of the study and those 
interested in participation will be asked to provide their 
contact information. Researchers will then contact all 
potential participants by telephone and email prior to 
the laboratory visit, to perform a preliminary screening 
of eligibility criteria before scheduling a laboratory visit.
Eligibility criteria
Participants aged 18–67 years will be included. Patients 
will be in assessment and/or treatment of chronic (>3 
months) musculoskeletal (neck and/or low back) pain 
or widespread pain in primary or specialist pain care in 
Region Dalarna. Exclusion criteria: (1) any coexisting 
medical condition that would restrict safely participating 
in the exercise intervention, (2) previous spinal surgery, 
(3) inability to perform unsupported indoor walking, 
(4) inadequate Swedish or cognitive ability to provide 
consent and understand information and instructions, 
(5) pregnant in second or third trimester or childbirth 
in the last 3 months, (6) allergies to adhesive tape used 
for sensor application, (7) major hearing impairment 
effecting performance of auditory 1- back test, (7) pain 
caused by malignancies or systemic diseases, or localised 
pain in lower extremities only.
Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding
Participants will be randomly assigned to either the inter-
vention or control group at a 1:1 allocation ratio, using 
stratified block randomisation with a fixed block size of six 
within the chronic musculoskeletal pain and no chronic 
pain strata. Allocation information is kept in opaque 
sealed envelopes and will not be disclosed to participants 
or researchers until all baseline walk trials are completed. 
All data collection will be automated in preprogrammed 
sequences and participant instructions read verbatim 
to minimise any investigator bias influencing partici-
pants’ behaviour. Participants will not be informed of the 
hypotheses of the study, and the researcher performing 
the data analyses will be blinded to group allocation.
Interventions
The acute aerobic exercise intervention will consist of one 
20 min cycling interval preceded by a 5 min warm- up and 
followed by a 5 min cool- down (total duration of 30 min) 
and will be performed on a stationary electromagnetically 
braked cycle ergometer (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik, 
Jülich, Germany). Self- selected exercise intensity will 
be guided to moderate intensity by using Borg Ratings 
of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale with a target RPE of 
13–15 (somewhat hard/hard).45 Borg RPE and self- rated 
pain on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0–100 mm) will be 
recorded every 5 min during the exercise session. Power 
output, cadence and heart rate will be recorded at 2 Hz. 
Participants will be able to freely regulate cadence and 
resistance to maintain the target RPE of 13–15, by means 
of a 14- increment mechanical gear shifter located on the 
handlebars. The ergometer is equipped with an upright 
handlebar, flat pedals and a wide- padded saddle with an 
extra gel cover to minimise sitting discomfort.
Participants allocated to the control groups will rest for 
the equivalent period of 30 min in a self- selected comfort-
able resting position accompanied by staff.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes (detailed in table 1) are kinematic 
measures of human movement and muscle activity that 
will be measured while participants are walking using 
the following three gait conditions: (1) self- selected 
habitual gait speed, (2) brisk gait speed and (3) self- 
selected habitual gait speed with a concurrent cognitive 
task. Our primary kinematic outcomes are gait speed, 
step frequency, stride length, lumbar rotation and gait

domain will be mean normalised electromyography 
(EMG) amplitude averaged over aggregated gait cycles.
Our secondary outcome measures are variability of 
gait kinematics and muscle activity and self- rated current

the statement ‘no pain at all’ at the extreme left and ‘the 
worst possible pain’ at the extreme right (chronic pain 
sample only).46 47
Trial procedure, instruments and data collection
The entire trial procedure at the laboratory is expected 
to take approximately 3 hours and will be supervised by 
two researchers. On arrival at the laboratory, eligibility

screening, presentation of the study procedures and collec-
tion of informed consent (online supplemental appendix 
2) will be performed. Participants will complete the 
following questionnaires before commencing any testing: 
(1) participant characteristics (age, sex, educational 
level, occupational status, pain locations, pain duration) 
including two validated items with questions about phys-
ical activity.48 Participants with chronic musculoskeletal 
pain will also complete the following two questionnaires 
relating to pain experiences: (2) the Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale,49 which contains 13 items regarding participants’ 
thoughts and feelings associated with pain, with a total 
score ranging from 0 to 52, with higher scores repre-
senting higher pain catastrophising and (3) the West 
Haven- Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory, which is a 
questionnaire that measures the psychosocial, cognitive 
and behavioural effects of chronic pain.50–53
A researcher will then record participant body height 
using a stadiometer (Harpenden Stadiometer, Holtain 
Limited, Crosswell, UK) and body weight using a weighing 
scale (Midrics, Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). 
Participants will be introduced to the 1- back test 54 and 
listen to a 30 s practice sequence, then two 30 s 1- back 
baseline tests will be recorded with participants in a seated 
position. The 1- back test will be performed with a pair of 
minimally intrusive wireless handsfree on- ear headphones 
connected via Bluetooth to a PC using Audacity Software 
V.2.3.0. Participants will listen to an audio file consisting 
of a randomised number sequence and will be instructed 
to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to audio 
prompts, repeating the digit before the last one in the 
consecutive sequence during the entire 1- back walking 
trial. All responses will be recorded.
After this, seven wireless inertial monitoring unit 
sensors (OPAL, APDM, Oregon, USA) incorporating a 
three- axis gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer 
will be applied on participants’ limbs using elastic straps 
as specified in figure 2. Gait kinematics will be streamed 
and logged wirelessly from each sensor at 128 Hz during 
all trials and will be automatically processed via Moveo 
Explorer software to extract gait variables specified as 
primary or secondary outcomes according to table 1. 55 
Participants will be given standardised instructions prior 
to starting each gait trial in order to comply with the initial 
calibration procedure described by the manufacturer.
Wireless EMG sensors (Delsys Trigno, Delsys, Boston, 
Massachusetts, USA) will be positioned according to 
anatomical landmarks detailed in figure 3, as per surface 
EMG for the non- invasive assessment of muscles guide-
lines56 57 and data will be recorded at 1111 Hz. Skin will 
be shaved and cleansed with a chlorhexidine digluco-
nate ethanol cutaneous solution (Klorhexidinsprit 5 mg/
mL, Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To obtain 
normalised (reference) muscle activity, each participant 
will perform four standardised submaximal standing trunk 
flexion (hip flexion to 45° from neutral standing position) 
muscle contraction tests, interspersed by a 60 s rest. EMG 
sensors will be removed after baseline measurements and 
reapplied prior to the follow- up walking trials. Before 
removal, sensor positions will be marked with a marker 
pen to facilitate accurate reapplication.
All gait trials will be performed indoors in a continuous 
fashion on a 15 m standardised walkway with tape mark-
ings on the floor indicating starting and 180° turning 
points. Trials will have a minimum duration of 2 min and 
finish when participants cross the start line with a time 
exceeding 2 min. Participants will initially perform a famil-
iarisation trial at a self- selected habitual speed followed by 
a short rest if needed, to avoid any accumulated pain or 
fatigue. After this, participants will proceed to walk the 15 
m walkway under the three different conditions described 
above: (1) an initial self- selected habitual gait speed, (2) a 
brisk gait speed and (3) a self- selected habitual gait speed 
with a concurrent cognitive task (1- back test). The order 
of performance of the brisk and 1- back walking condi-
tions (2 or 3) will be randomised and the allocation will 
be kept concealed from the participants until the initial 
condition with self- selected habitual gait speed has been 
performed. For the brisk walking condition, participants 
will be instructed to walk faster than they habitually do, 
as they imagine themselves doing when slightly late for a 
bus they want to catch. The self- rated pain intensity (VAS) 
of participants with chronic musculoskeletal pain will be 
recorded after each walk trial. The risk of complications 
due to measurements or interventions is considered to 
be low, but any adverse or serious adverse events will be 
logged and reported as well as covered by laboratory 
insurance.

Data management
Participant questionnaires will be checked for complete-
ness and congruity before data is entered into the data-
base. Data will be stored on secure university servers and 
in locked cabinets only available to the research team. 
Gait kinematics will be aggregated for all valid gait cycles 
of each gait condition. For each individual, a minimum 
of 50 gait cycles will be used and aggregated prior to anal-
ysis.58 Back and neck muscle activity (root mean square 
(RMS)) synchronised to gait cycles and aggregated from 
each gait condition will be normalised as percentage RMS 
against reference contractions.
Statistical analysis
Participant characteristics will be reported using descrip-
tive statistics. The statistical analyses will be performed 
on an intention- to- treat basis and potential differences 
between the intervention groups and the control groups 
will be analysed. Analysis will primarily be conducted with 
variance analysis with respect to both data quality and 
distribution (data assumptions) and with the addition 
of repeated measurements where applicable. Log trans-
formations of data will be made as appropriate. Data will 
be presented with means and variances. To explore the 
magnitude of the effect of interventions, effect sizes will 
be calculated.59 Lastly, non- linear analysis using Gait Eval-
uation Differential Entropy Method60 will be used to assess 
variability of gait kinematic and muscular activity.60–62
Ethics and dissemination
The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics 
Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden (#2018/307). Findings 
will be disseminated via conference presentations, publi-
cations in peer- reviewed journals and engagement with 
patient support groups and clinicians.
Patient and public involvement
The burden of the study procedures has been assessed by 
patients during preliminary pilot work, primarily to assess 
the following areas: the feasibility of the cycling exercise 
intervention, the baseline questionnaires and the instru-
mentation to capture gait kinematics and EMG data. Study 
participants will be invited to a briefing where the results 
of the study will be presented. In addition, study partic-
ipants will be given a summary of the results written in 
Swedish. Results will be presented at the annual meeting 
of the Swedish National Registry for Chronic Pain Reha-
bilitation where patient groups are represented.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first RCT 
to investigate the acute effect of aerobic exercise on 
gait kinematics and muscle activity in participants with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain compared with reference 
participants from a perspective of exercise as active infer-
ence. Our two- sample two- armed parallel design allows

for a cross comparison of effects in patients with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain and healthy participants that will 
follow the same study protocol and will contribute to 
our understanding of how chronic musculoskeletal pain 
manifests on measures of human motor behaviour and 
how exercise can influence this in a rehabilitation setting. 
Knowledge of how gait kinematics and back and neck 
muscular activity may change during different gait condi-
tions and from aerobic exercise may contribute to the 
understanding of how exercise therapy influences our 
generative models in the process attenuates allostatic load 
through active inference. The use of modern, miniatur -
ised and completely wireless sensors during overground 
walking replicates real- world conditions, hence strength-
ening the ecological validity of our results. Objective 
measurements of movement and muscular activity during 
diverse walking conditions have been chosen as primary 
outcomes since such a methodology can both uniquely 
and sensitively show and quantify deviating activation 
patterns as validly reflected in everyday functional move-
ments and commonly performed physical activities.
Selection bias is difficult to completely overcome in 
exercise intervention studies as volunteering participants 
will likely be positively biased towards exercise in general 
and motivation to participate in an exercise intervention 
is also likely influenced by the severity of symptoms expe-
rienced when asked to volunteer for the study. We will 
compare and validate our sample baseline characteristics 
with a new nationwide large database including 60 000 
patients with chronic pain.63
Concerning our reference participants without chronic 
musculoskeletal pain, we aim to create a sample that is 
sex and age matched with our chronic musculoskeletal 
pain sample and will serve as a reference sample for all 
our outcomes.
Viewing this exercise intervention as active inference 
will hopefully add knowledge on how acute movement 
through exercise may promote an individual’s predictions 
about their body and their world by creating a platform 
for belief updating. Our use of a cycling modality with 
a rather different muscle recruitment and joint loading 
pattern compared with walking may be beneficial, espe-
cially since stationary cycling may be more palatable to 
participants than running at the same intensity as it may 
lead to an undesired level of fatigue, fear or increased 
pain.
In addition, the aerobic exercise intervention in the 
current study reflects recommendations in exercise guide-
lines and allows an easy progression of rehabilitation in 
terms of both intensity and duration.64 Since a bicycle can 
be used for therapy, recreation and transportation, there 
are opportunities for healthcare professionals to facilitate 
changes in lifestyle that have the potential to mitigate 
morbidity and function in patients with chronic pain, 65 
simultaneously reducing the risks and impact of common 
comorbidities.
With the foundation of this project being objective 
measures of overground walking, it adheres well to the 
Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment 
in Clinical Trials, which recommends that all chronic pain 
trials should include measures of physical functioning. 47 
This project is expected to result in increased knowledge 
of how acute exercise affects subsequent functional tasks, 
here measured during different walking conditions.
Our proposed project will deepen our understanding 
on the topic of alterations in functional movement in 
chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. Results from 
the current study may help us reach a better under -
standing of how acute aerobic exercise acts as active infer-
ence to attenuate chronic pain by facilitating allostasis. 
This knowledge will help us formulate better questions as 
to how generative models in chronic pain conditions are 
formed, maintained and updated through movement, or 
lack thereof.
