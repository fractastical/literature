1 Introduction
Human culture manifests itself in two intertwined forms: societal structures shaped by 
traditions, norms, laws, and customs, and the creative expressions in arts and media that are 
products of our individual and collective imagination (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015; Shao et al., 
2019; Brown, 2021). Scholars have long contemplated the intricate relationship between these 
two cultural spheres and their respective functions. In this paper, we examine such relationship 
through the lens of the predictive coding framework in cognitive science (Huang and Rao, 
2011). Predictive coding suggests that our brains are essentially prediction machines, 
continuously creating and updating internal models of the world to anticipate future states and 
minimize surprise (Shipp, 2016; Pezzulo et al., 2022). We propose that both dimensions of 
culture can be viewed as adaptations designed to enhance and train the brain’s predictive 
abilities in the social domain. The former disseminates models tested by groups to facilitate 
social coordination ( Fallucchi and Nosenzo, 2022 ), while the latter offers simulated 
environments to challenge assumptions and broaden conceptual possibilities (Pezzulo et al., 
2021). Traditions, norms, laws, and customs, and their ideological encapsulations (Wheeler 
et al., 2020), foster shared predictions and expectations among individuals, thereby reducing

uncertainty in social environments. Compliance with these elements 
signals a commitment to the community and facilitates mutual 
inference of others’ probable behaviors and reactions irrespectively of 
their unobservable mental states ( Uttich and Lombrozo, 2010 ). 
Conformity to conventions also aids in coordinating collective goals 
(Centola and Baronchelli, 2015). Research in social learning illustrates 
how the cultural transmission of norms leverages wisdom accumulated 
over generations to equip members with useful predictive frameworks 
(Bisin and Verdier, 2023).
In contrast, the arts and media expose us to simulated experiences 
that explore alternate social realities, venturing far beyond familiar life 
circumstances (Boyd, 2009). Fiction, music, visual arts, among others, 
provide spaces for cognitive play to rehearse counterfactual 
simulations, test possibilities from different perspectives, and open 
new trajectories for thought (Dancygier, 2011, p. 35). This allows the 
predictive machinery of the brain to refine its capacities through 
exposure to a wider array of social situations and scenarios (Oatley, 
2016). While traditions conserve successful patterns, the arts disrupt 
familiar conventions to actively push conceptual boundaries 
(Galenson, 2008). Despite their remarkable differences, we argue that 
both cultural forms serve complementary functions in honing the 
brain’s ability to predict and adaptively navigate the social world. By 
integrating predictive coding theory with existing interdisciplinary 
research on culture, arts, and media, we put forth a new perspective 
on culture as an adaptive system shaped by the imperative of the 
predictive social brain.
The paper is structured as follows. We first overview key principles 
of predictive coding and active inference that provide a framework for 
addressing prediction-driven learning and behavior. We then explore 
the respective functions of cultural traditions and artistic culture in 
reducing uncertainty through the propagation of useful social 
predictive models versus expansive exploration of alternatives. Core 
hypotheses are that traditions minimize collective surprise by 
stabilizing and transmitting community-tested models, whereas the 
arts facilitate the development of flexible generative capacities and 
social cognition.
By tracing parallels between institutionalized normative habits 
that stabilize social worlds and creative and imaginative acts that 
temporarily subvert conventions to inject variability, we  point at 
culture as an essential resource for human survival and effective 
navigation of physical and social environments (Dissanayake, 2015). 
Evidence from history and social science reveals how the interplay 
between conservative and disruptive cultural forces drives artistic 
innovation, technological creativity, and paradigm shifts (Sassoon, 
2006). We conclude by proposing adaptive roles for the dual cultural 
heritage of compressed traditions and imaginative simulated worlds 
in training the predictive capacities that make humans such a 
cognitively unique species.
2 The predictive coding framework
Over the past two decades, predictive coding has emerged as a 
powerful model for understanding perception, cognition, and brain 
function (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Clark, 2013). At its core, this model 
posits that the brain is in a constant state of generating top-down 
perceptual hypotheses or predictions based on prior experience. These 
predictions are then matched against actual sensory data. Perception, 
therefore, is not a passive process but an active one. It involves 
confirming or revising internal predictive models to best explain the 
external causes of sensory inputs (Friston et al., 2016). This perspective 
suggests that our brains are essentially prediction machines, 
continuously creating and updating internal models of the world to 
anticipate future states and minimize surprise. This framework has 
been exceptionally successful at explaining low-level perceptual 
abilities and the neural processes that underlie them. It has also been 
claimed that predictive coding can account for higher-level cognitive 
processes like theory of mind, mirror neurons, emotions, aesthetics, 
self-awareness, consciousness, and disorders of cognitive function 
such as schizophrenia and autism ( Kilner et  al., 2007 ; Spratling, 
2008a,b, 2016a; Koster-Hale and Saxe, 2013; Van de Cruys et al., 2022). 
In essence, predictive coding provides a unified theory of brain 
function that spans from perception to cognition. In particular, it 
offers a comprehensive framework for explaining perception, 
cognition, and action in terms of fundamental theoretical principles 
and neurocognitive architectures (Hohwy, 2020; Parr et al., 2022).
In its classical formulation, predictive coding provides a specific 
Bayesian framework for understanding the perpetual interactions 
between top-down predictions and bottom-up sensations in shaping 
perception and guiding learning (Friston, 2005).
Prediction errors, which denote the disparities between 
anticipated outcomes and actual observations, play a pivotal role in 
propelling the refinement and adaptation of internal models, 
ultimately enhancing the accuracy of future predictions. This iterative 
process of aligning predictive models with real-world data to minimize 
discrepancies closely parallels the principles of Bayesian inference. 
This adaptive mechanism empowers the brain to fine-tune its 
probabilistic representations of the underlying causal framework 
within the environment (Friston and Kiebel, 2009a,b). This process is 
a fundamental aspect of learning and cognition, allowing us to 
continuously update our understanding of the world based on new 
information. In essence, our brains are constantly learning from 
prediction errors, adjusting our mental models and expectations to 
better match the reality we  experience. This ongoing process of 
learning and adaptation is what allows us to navigate our complex and 
ever-changing environment with remarkable efficiency and accuracy.
The foundational tenets of predictive coding align harmoniously 
with Friston’s free energy principle, which posits that biological 
systems are driven to diminish surprise by minimizing discrepancies 
between their predictions regarding sensory inputs and their internal 
states (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). Rather than functioning as 
a passive recorder of sensory information, the brain serves as an active 
inferential engine, continually striving to anticipate the sensory 
outcomes arising from the external factors influencing its inputs. In 
this light, perception is more akin to scientific hypothesis testing than 
to a mere collection of sensory experiences (Gregory, 1980), with all 
its related, peculiar cognitive attitudes such as, for instance, the 
stubbornness in sticking to certain hypotheses even in the face of 
contradictory evidence (Y on et al., 2019).
Support for the predictive coding framework has grown 
exponentially across neuroscience domains in the last decades. 
Predictive signals have been identified across cortical hierarchies and 
sensory modalities, from early visual pathways to higher-order 
multimodal association areas (Mumford, 1992; Summerfield et  al., 
2006; Bastos et al., 2012). For instance, predictive response suppression 
occurs when expected stimuli evoke a muted response relative to 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org
unexpected inputs (Summerfield and de Lange, 2014). This is consistent 
with the model where top-down predictions are subtracted from or 
compared against bottom-up signals, minimizing prediction errors for 
anticipated inputs (Friston, 2005). The functional organization of 
sensory pathways also aligns with the hierarchical message-passing 
structure proposed by predictive coding, where backward connections 
convey predictions and forward connections transmit prediction errors 
up the cortical hierarchy (Friston, 2008; Shipp, 2016). Dynamic causal 
modeling of brain imaging data provides further evidence that 
bottom-up and top-down connections interact asymmetrically in a 
manner fitting predictive coding principles (Friston, 2016). Moving 
from such early foundational results, the recent literature has confirmed 
the robustness and broad applicability of the predictive coding 
framework in a variety of domains (Nave et al., 2020).
Computational models suggest that predictive coding mechanisms 
perform well on perceptual tasks like visual object recognition and 
language processing ( Uran et  al., 2022 ; Caucheteux et  al., 2023 ). 
Machine learning algorithms based on predictive coding architectures 
can perform robust pattern recognition, particularly in noisy 
environments or with incomplete inputs (Salvatori et al., 2022; Straka 
et al., 2023). This demonstrates the potential of leveraging generative 
models of probable causes rather than just sensory data.
Beyond perception, predictive coding theory has expanded to 
address how the brain predicts complex dynamics across multiple 
timescales, including not just sensory signals but also external events, 
internal states, and abstract rules or relationships (Kiebel et al., 2009; 
Bubic et al., 2010). Humans deploy an integrated system of multilevel 
predictive models spanning motor control, interoception, motivation, 
memory, theory of mind, value learning, and conceptual knowledge 
(Clark, 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2015).
Active inference extends predictive coding from passive model 
updating into how organisms take actions to seek out experiences 
expected to reduce overall uncertainty in their predictive models, not 
just immediately but over the future (Friston et al., 2009, 2017a). This 
provides a foundation for addressing prediction in decision-making 
in ecological settings.
Predictive coding has thus emerged as a reference model for 
rethinking cognitive function through a unifying Bayesian lens. It 
provides a framework for explaining numerous perceptual, behavioral, 
and neural response patterns as reflecting the imperative of a 
prediction-driven learning system. Its unique strength lies in capturing 
the tight coupling between top-down and bottom-up processes which 
leverage prior knowledge to parse the onslaught of sensory data. By 
postulating concrete mechanisms for learning as model optimization 
through prediction error correction, predictive coding moves from 
abstract metaphors of the mind as an inference machine toward 
formalizable computational models with increasing explanatory and 
integrative power. Grounded in Bayesian probability and information 
theory, predictive coding aligns with the increasingly influential view 
of the brain as a near-optimal probability estimation machine. In other 
words, predictive coding serves as a bridge connecting abstract 
theoretical concepts to empirical observations, offering a versatile 
framework that enhances our understanding of cognitive processes 
across various subfields of neuroscience. The integration of Bayesian 
principles into the predictive coding model ( Spratling, 2016b ) 
emphasizes the brain’s inherent ability to engage in near-optimal 
probabilistic estimations, further cementing its position as a valuable 
cornerstone in the study of human cognition and perception.
In the sections that follow, we apply active inference and predictive 
coding to provide a novel perspective on the complementary 
evolutionary functions of the two major forms of human culture.
3 The complementary functions of 
culture: play, practice, and cultural 
evolution
Culture in its dual instantiations fulfills complementary learning 
needs of the predictive brain. Norms and traditions conserve 
successful predictive patterns and transmit wisdom that has proven 
adaptive to the local niche over time while reducing uncertainty in 
social environments through shared conventions. Artistic culture 
provides more flexible simulation spaces to actively push beyond 
existing patterns and entrenched ideas to explore new perspectives 
and models.
The interplay of conserving social practices and imaginative 
exploration parallels the rhythms of weekly routine and festive time 
observed in many societies across history. Durkheim (1915) noted 
that festivals mark a break from mundane workday life focused on 
instrumental activities. Artistic events open up spaces devoted to the 
exploration of imaginative worlds, where social norms relax, and role 
play expands beyond habitual identities in a way not sanctioned 
during routine weekly time. Likewise, in the thinking of William 
James one finds a contraposition between the ‘epiphanic’ sphere of 
creative imagination and the ‘average’ sphere of mundanity (Pawelski, 
2007). Again, Bakhtin’s (1984) notion of carnival as a temporary 
suspension of the ordinary rules and hierarchies of socioeconomic 
and political organization and as attainment of a new communitarian 
awareness through sensual and bodily engagement is another 
important perspective into the institutionalized structuring of festive 
time as a sociobiological necessity.
But the suspension of the rules of weekly time need not happen in 
circumscribed, festive time slots only. In this regard, it is important to 
consider Shklovsky’s (2007) notion of ‘defamiliarization’ , namely the 
artful representation of familiar objects and situations as if seen for the 
first time. Through defamiliarization, even the elements of everyday 
reality can be  turned into doors toward imaginary worlds and 
narrative experimentation. Shklovsky (2007) illustrates at length how 
this technique is widely used in poetry and literature to de-structure 
the mechanisms of perception to pave the way to different, more 
profound forms of experience, suggesting that the arts can carve 
‘epiphanic’ bubbles also within the frame of the most mundane aspects 
of existence. Gamoneda (2020)  builds upon Shklovsky’s (2007) 
approach to analyze how defamiliarization may be intended as a form 
of cognitive estrangement with important neurocognitive implications 
in terms of embodied simulation and reframing of sensory and 
emotional experiences.
Turner (1969) expanded on these ideas with his concept of 
“liminality” – transitory spaces that break social norms and allow free 
experimentation. As for Bakhtin (1984), the carnivalesque atmosphere 
of festivals permits temporary inversion of hierarchies, parody of 
leaders, and exploration of taboo ideas that would normally 
be off-limits. We can interpret this ebb and flow between tradition-
bound routine and creative festive periods as giving predictive brains 
space to cycle between preserving useful patterns and expanding into 
new possibilities.
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.org
Sutton-Smith (2009) proposed that the human appetite for 
generating varied imaginative worlds through games, art, and make-
believe serves an adaptive cognitive function he termed “the ambiguity 
of play. ” The arts and games allow safe spaces to manipulate meanings, 
construct virtual realities, and explore identities in deliberately 
ambiguous ways disassociated from worldly consequences. By 
engaging with hypothetical scenarios on both personal and social 
scales, thinking through liminality facilitates cognitive development 
and mental flexibility and prepares us for unpredictable change 
(Thomassen, 2015, p. 40–1).
Building on these insights, we can understand festive time as a 
crucial opportunity for developing individual skills and social ideas 
that overcome the constraints of tightly regulated weekly time 
(Ehrenreich, 2007). The loosening of social control mechanisms 
during festivity allows not just frivolous escapism but serious collective 
experimentation with alternative models and meanings (Páez et al., 
2015). Artistic culture provides low-cost simulated sandboxes ideal for 
this exploratory predictive work ( Boal, 2005 ). Many historical 
examples illustrate the interplay between conserving traditions and 
visionary imagination stimulating cultural evolution. Classical Greek 
theatre performances explored taboo themes like incest and patricide 
that defied traditional mores but did so in highly ritualized contexts 
that were demarcated from real life. Hybridizing fanciful theatrical 
simulations and reasoned debate in the political sphere catalyzed 
pioneering advances in democracy, rhetoric, law, and philosophy that 
deeply shaped later cultures (Meineck, 2017). Meineck draws upon 
theories of ancient Greek theater and ancient rituals to elaborate on 
the concept of liminal spaces. In this context, liminal spaces represent 
locations where social norms can be  momentarily suspended or 
reversed (McKenzie, 2004). This suspension of social norms allows 
people to experience a sense of liberation and challenge social 
conventions ( Seale-Collazo, 2012 ). Liminal spaces thus provide 
opportunities for individuals to expose themselves to unconventional 
situations, opening the door to new perspectives and knowledge 
(Pielichaty, 2015 ). In this sense, liminal spaces offer learning 
opportunities and contribute to cognitive development through the 
exploration of surprising social dynamics and the acquisition of a 
broader understanding of the world from unexpected angles.
The European Renaissance provides another example where 
tensions between conservative and imaginative cultural elements 
spurred paradigm shifts. As royal patrons began supporting innovative 
secular painting, sculpture, and architecture rather than solely 
religious works, exposure to these novel perspectives expanded 
audiences’ perceptual predictions and worldviews and radically 
transformed the notion of creative agency ( Heller, 1978 ). The 
humanistic emphasis kindled by the arts stimulated scientific creativity 
and likely coevolved with more pluralistic social values 
(Greenblatt, 2019).
Throughout history, the intermingling of traditional habits and 
artistic innovation has catalyzed advances in fields as varied as music, 
visual arts, literature, and even mathematics and science ( Root-
Bernstein, 2003; Charyton, 2015). Playful challenges to orthodoxy 
expand the realm of conceivable models, which can lead to 
revolutionary syntheses and broader paradigm shifts when new 
syntheses are adopted by societies ( Kuhn, 1962). Sperber (1996)  
synthesized these perspectives in his epidemiological theory of how 
representations spread through cultures. He argued that the tensions 
between predictable traditions and unfettered artistic innovations 
produce an endless supply of new mental representations competing 
for adoption. The most cognitively captivating meanings catch on, 
spreading through networks via inherent human drives for social 
learning and memorability. Periodic injections of imaginative 
variation therefore prevent stagnation and spark new cycles of social 
creation of meaning.
Adopting the predictive coding theory as a conceptual backbone 
allows the reframing of this interplay between conservative and 
disruptive cultural forces as serving essential cognitive ecosystem 
functions. This cultural cycle of conservatism and innovation parallels 
the scientific process ( Kuhn, 1962). Existing paradigms conserve 
frameworks honed to explain ordinary cases, while outliers spark 
paradigm shifts (Sterman and Wittenberg, 1999). Predictive coding 
proposes that the brain shares this intrinsic drive for theoretical 
refinement – conserving useful models while continuously probing at 
the edges to uncover anomalies that necessitate expanding the model 
repertoire to reduce surprise.
This evolutionary interplay between traditions and disruptive art 
may have been critical for the cumulative generative capacities that 
make human culture unique. Donald (1991) proposed that the dual 
heritage of ritual imitation and mimetic imagination drove our 
species’ unrivaled cognitive fluidity. The arts may play the essential 
role of introducing variation and challenging assumptions necessary 
for cultural evolution (Gabora, 2017), while social norms conserve 
building blocks between innovations.
Culture therefore appears finely tuned to serve both conservative 
and disruptive/exploratory predictive drives. Ritualized traditions and 
norms preserve compressed generative models specialized for 
coordinating social exchange and minimizing uncertainty. Meanwhile, 
festive periods and the arts facilitate exploratory simulations and 
competition between alternative models and worldviews. This dual 
cultural ecosystem provides a training ground for optimizing the 
predictive capacities of our brains in both routine and novel contexts, 
supporting human adaptability and cumulative knowledge growth.
4 The predictive function of cultural 
norms
Cultural norms – the informal rules guiding behavior in groups 
– provide key social coordinates that structure interactions into 
predictable patterns. Norms provide members with shared 
expectations about how others are likely to act in recurrent situations, 
allowing individuals to anticipate behavior and outcomes (Hawkins 
et al., 2019). The predictive functions of cultural norms can be linked 
to René Girard’s mimetic theory. Cultural norms are considered 
models of acceptable behavior and guide people’s actions through 
mutual imitation. Mimetic theory suggests that imitation can lead to 
rivalry and conflicts, but cultural norms serve as a tool to prevent 
violence, regulating behavior and providing shared rules for resolving 
conflicts nonviolently. In this context, cultural norms play a key role 
in creating predictions of behavior within a society (Girard, 2005).
From a predictive coding perspective, cultural transmission of 
norms trains individuals to develop more accurate generative models 
about social cause-effect patterns. This process minimizes surprise 
and enables coordination within a society ( Leung, 2015 ). The 
transmission of norms involves the selection and socialization of 
cultural ideas from one generation to the next. Parents play a crucial 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.org
role in this process, as they strategically choose which cultural ideas 
to transmit based on their own orientations and perceptions of what 
is normatively important in their culture ( Silverstein and Conroy, 
2008). The perceived norms perspective suggests that parents 
reference these norms to guide their actions and goals (Kastel et al., 
2023). Through cultural transmission, individuals learn and 
internalize these norms, which shape their behavior and decision-
making processes. The cultural transmission of norms contributes to 
the development of accurate generative models that help individuals 
navigate social interactions and coordinate effectively within their 
cultural context.
4.1 Conceptualizing social norms
Philosophers and social scientists have long recognized that 
informal social norms and conventions play a central role in human 
culture, that is distinct from that of formal laws. David Hume 
emphasized how conventions enable complex cooperation between 
individuals with limited altruism (Bruni and Sugden, 2000). Émile 
Durkheim viewed norms as collective representations binding society 
together (Durkheim, 1964; Gilleard, 2018). Max Weber delineated 
legal-rational prescriptiveness from traditional authority embodied in 
customary norms ( Spencer, 1970). Bicchieri (2006) synthesized a 
useful schema for dissecting the components of social norms. She 
distinguishes between empirical expectations – beliefs about what 
others normally do in a situation, and normative expectations – beliefs 
about what others think ought to be done. Shared expectations on 
both dimensions provide social proof enabling inferences about 
appropriate behavior (Cialdini et al., 1990; Friston et al., 2011). The 
violation of norms exposes to social sanctions aimed at stigmatizing 
unjustified deviance.
This dual structure parallels predictive coding notions of 
perceptual hypotheses and prior beliefs. Empirical expectations 
represent compressed accumulated observations about typical 
behaviors, while normative expectations are more abstract schematic 
knowledge about permissible actions – similarly to prototypes and 
causal models. Together, they comprise a social grammar predicting 
likely events and reactions during recurrent situations, of which 
we  start to understand the neurobiological foundations ( Duerler 
et al., 2022).
4.2 Psychological drivers of norm 
compliance
A wealth of research highlights strong psychological drivers 
behind norm compliance and enforcement. Classical conformity 
studies demonstrate that individuals alter opinions and behavior to 
match group majorities, particularly when uncertain or stressed 
(Asch, 1956; Zhang et  al., 2016). Obedience experiments reveal a 
willingness to obey authority figures even when directives violate 
personal morals (Milgram, 1974; Haslam et al., 2014). Enforcement 
studies show a willingness to punish norm violators, even at personal 
cost and even for norms recently introduced in laboratory settings 
(Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004 ). What mechanisms underlie these 
striking conformity patterns? Informational influence suggests 
looking at others for evidence about reality, especially in ambiguous 
situations. Normative influence describes compliance to avoid ridicule 
or gain approval. Both serve uncertainty reduction functions 
complementing predictive coding notions ( Deutsch and Gerard, 
1955). Uncertainty Management Theories argue how group 
identification, conformity, and schema reliance all aid in managing an 
unpredictable social world (Hogg and Adelman, 2013). Shared norms 
provide expectational templates guiding the perception and 
interpretation of ambiguous social stimuli (Chang and Koban, 2013). 
Deviating is at risk of sanctions and unclear reactions, whereas 
adherence demonstrates commitment, reducing uncertainty about 
one’s standing (Mullin and Hogg, 1998).
Computational models demonstrate how norms can arise from 
simple interaction rules. Agent-based models show the emergence of 
stable cooperation in social dilemmas when agents adopt strategies to 
meet group expectations ( Axelrod, 1997; Macy and Flache, 2002 ; 
Hanaki et al., 2007). In Bayesian models, agents infer hidden group 
conventions from sparse observations of others’ behavior ( Shafto 
et al., 2014). These dynamics converge on stable equilibrium normative 
behavior without global knowledge or top-down enforcement. Such 
models provide a framework for understanding the evolution of 
societal norms and their impact on individual and group behavior. 
They offer insights into how norms can change over time and how 
they can be influenced by external factors such as cultural shifts or 
technological advancements.
Together, these psychological and computational mechanisms 
highlight how internalized norms reduce uncertainty by training 
expectations about others’ behaviors and likely consequences of 
potential actions. This enables a fluent navigation of the fast-paced 
social world. These mechanisms underscore the importance of norms 
in shaping our social interactions and our understanding of the world 
around us. They emphasize the role of norms in guiding our actions 
and decisions, ultimately influencing the trajectory of our social lives.
4.3 Predictive functions of cultural learning
Traditions passed across generations embody accumulated 
knowledge about recurrent situations and preparations for likely 
future scenarios ( Boyd and Richerson, 1985 ). Rituals, including 
extreme ones ( Fischer and Xygalatas, 2014 ) provide procedural 
knowledge about coordinated cultural practices that minimize 
uncertainty through collective synchronized actions (Watson-Jones 
and Legare, 2016). Tomasello (2016) proposes that the human capacity 
for complex cumulative culture rests on abilities to understand shared 
goals, make recursive inferences about others’ mental states, and learn 
from pedagogy. This allows comprehension of artifacts and practices 
as solutions to commonly understood problems facing the group, 
facilitating cultural model transfer. Traditions and rituals serve as a 
bridge between the past, present, and future, allowing societies to 
maintain continuity and coherence. They also foster a sense of identity 
and belonging among group members, strengthening social bonds, 
and promoting group cohesion (Jackson et al., 2018). The ability to 
understand shared goals and infer others’ mental states is crucial for 
effective communication and collaboration (Tomasello et al., 2005) 
and has complex neurobiological underpinnings ( Saxe, 2006 ). It 
enables individuals to anticipate others’ actions, coordinate their own 
actions accordingly, and work together toward common objectives. 
This, in turn, enhances the group’s ability to adapt to changing 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.org
circumstances and overcome challenges. Preston and Wegner (2007) 
detail how implicit cultural learning mechanisms including imitation, 
emotional contagion, and norm adoption allow rapid indirect 
acquisition of vast group knowledge. Children discern societal 
expectations and conventions without need for explicit coaching 
(Schmidt and Tomasello, 2012 ; Rakoczy and Schmidt, 2013 ). 
Enactment itself strengthens neural pathways for skills and norms 
through immersive participation in patterned cultural practices, 
enabling thinking through other minds and the alleged process of 
inferring other agents’ behavioral expectations (Veissière et al., 2020).
Repetition further cements predictable routine behaviors, if it is 
supported by specific attentional cues (Musfeld et al., 2023). Ritual 
gatherings provide regular synchronized affirmation of norms and 
values (Rossano, 2012). Cycles of festivals and ceremonies structure 
the cultural calendar into anticipated occasions renewing group 
identity and bonds ( Malinowski, 1922; Whitehouse and Lanman, 
2014). This affirms ingroup predictive models by exploiting their 
causal opaqueness and their impermeability to individual innovation 
and change ( Legare and Wen, 2014 ). In general, repetitive and 
ritualistic behaviors serve to reinforce social norms and expectations, 
thereby promoting stability and order within the group, but they 
cannot be manufactured at will (Hobson et al., 2017). They provide a 
sense of predictability and control, reducing uncertainty and 
enhancing the group’s collective sense of security (Lang et al., 2022). 
Moreover, the cyclical nature of festivals and ceremonies not only 
renews group identity and strengthens social bonds, but also provides 
a temporal framework that guides social interactions and activities, 
functioning as a regulatory mechanism ( Tonna et  al., 2019). This 
structuring of social life across time contributes to the formation and 
maintenance of a shared cultural identity, reinforcing the group’s 
distinctiveness and cohesion.
At the end, the affirmation of ingroup predictive models through 
these practices underscores the importance of shared understanding 
and consensus in maintaining social harmony. It highlights the role of 
collective beliefs and values in guiding individual and group behavior, 
shaping social dynamics, and influencing the group’s overall trajectory.
4.4 Neuroscience of social learning
Neuroimaging studies reveal the possibility of shared neural 
circuits for learning hierarchical sequences across sensorimotor, 
linguistic, and social domains. Meta-analyses show moreover that 
social norms representation and violation are associated with different, 
specialized brain circuits ( Zinchenko and Arsalidou, 2018 ). Value 
learning research finds that social norms rapidly acquire motivating 
valence through dopamine habituation pathways similar to primary 
rewards, providing intrinsic motivation to conform (Klucharev et al., 
2009). fMRI studies show greater striatal responses for choices 
aligning with perceived social norms ( Nook and Zaki, 2015 ), 
consistent with predictive coding notions of expected reward and 
precision (Friston et al., 2014). Together these findings indicate that 
social norms harness general hierarchical sequence learning abilities 
while tapping into neurocognitive systems for rewards, mentalizing, 
and uncertainty-driven learning. This allows an indirect acquisition 
of complex cultural knowledge. All these findings suggest that the 
brain’s ability to learn and adhere to social norms is not only a product 
of social conditioning, but also a fundamental aspect of human 
neurobiology (Cikara and Van Bavel, 2014). The brain’s reward system, 
which is crucial for motivation and learning, appears to be intrinsically 
linked to our ability to understand and follow social norms (Montague 
and Lohrenz, 2007).
In addition, the use of neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI has 
provided valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying 
social norm compliance ( Spitzer et  al., 2007; Bellucci et  al., 2018; 
Toelch et al., 2018). These studies have revealed that abiding by social 
norms is also associated with activation in brain regions involved in 
reward processing and decision-making, suggesting that social norms 
may be  encoded in the brain as rewarding behaviors ( Ruff and 
Fehr, 2014).
Moreover, the role of dopamine in social norm compliance 
suggests a neurochemical basis for our tendency to conform to societal 
expectations. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in reward and 
motivation, may play a key role in reinforcing adherence to social 
norms and promoting social cohesion. These findings highlight the 
complex interplay between social, cognitive, and neural processes in 
shaping our behavior and understanding of social norms. They 
underscore the importance of interdisciplinary research in advancing 
our understanding of the human social mind (Frith and Frith, 2012).
4.5 Predictive coding of social patterns
Predictive coding proposes that the brain’s hierarchical generative 
models leverage accumulated experience to predict unfolding events, 
actions, and internal states (Friston, 2005). This framework extends 
naturally to collective culture. Social norms build upon compressed 
knowledge about stable patterns in group interactions. Rituals, 
customs, and practices represent cultural ‘programs’ solving common 
coordination problems, transmitted across generations. Conformity 
enforces the reliable propagation of predictively useful models. Ritual 
gatherings provide regular opportunities to synchronize and entrench 
model parameters guiding inferences. Predictive coding provides a 
theoretical framework for understanding how individuals learn and 
adapt to social norms. It suggests that our brains are constantly 
updating our beliefs and expectations based on our experiences and 
observations, allowing us to navigate the social world with greater 
efficiency and accuracy (Clark, 2013).
Shared culture thus equips individuals with robust prior models 
for navigating the social world. Compliance demonstrates the 
reliability of these ‘theories’ , minimizing surprise. Violations force an 
error-driven updating of faulty assumptions. Prosocial behavior and 
obedience instantiate inferences about others’ mental models based 
on mature cultural schemas. Furthermore, the concept of shared 
culture emphasizes the role of collective knowledge and experience in 
shaping individual behavior. It suggests that our actions and decisions 
are not solely determined by our personal beliefs and desires but are 
also influenced by the norms and values of the group to which 
we belong (Boyd and Richerson, 2005). The notion of compliance as 
a demonstration of the reliability of cultural ‘theories’ underscores the 
importance of social validation in reinforcing social norms. When 
individuals observe others adhering to a particular norm, they are 
more likely to perceive that norm as valid and beneficial and are thus 
more likely to adopt it themselves (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004). The 
idea of prosocial behavior and obedience as instantiations of 
inferences about others’ mental models highlights the cognitive 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org
processes underlying social interaction. It suggests that our 
understanding of others’ thoughts and intentions is shaped by our 
cultural schemas, which provide a framework for interpreting and 
predicting others’ behaviors (Tomasello, 2014).
In this view, cumulative cultural knowledge acquired through 
norms provides high-fidelity generative models for fluent predictive 
processing during social exchanges and collaborative endeavors. 
While individual learning is slow and costly, leveraging collective 
wisdom enables rapid indirect acquisition of models attuned to 
complex cultural patterns over decades or centuries. Common culture 
therefore functions as a distributed prediction machine minimizing 
collective surprise.
5 Art as playground for the predictive 
brain
If cultural norms can be  seen as encoded predictive patterns, 
finely tuned to facilitate social interactions, then the realm of artistic 
culture offers a more pliable domain for the active exploration of novel 
patterns. Through various mediums such as media, visual arts, 
literature, music, and performance, humans gain the opportunity to 
immerse themselves in imaginative worlds, virtual simulations, and 
playful experiments with identity, having the chance to actively 
contribute to their unfolding. These experiences extend far beyond the 
confines of the physical world.
This leads to a compelling question: What intrinsic motivations 
might drive our brains to invest considerable energy in the generation 
and interaction with these artificial, imaginary realms? Predictive 
coding theories hold the key to some intriguing possibilities, as they 
provide a framework for understanding how the brain predicts, 
compares sensory data, and adapts to new information. Art, with its 
variety, complexity, and countless nuances, is an ideal space to explore 
and apply such theories. It offers a unique opportunity to comprehend 
how the brain anticipates, interprets, and adjusts to the world through 
the lens of artistic experiences.
5.1 Prediction, play, and possibilities
Predictive coding is not just about reducing immediate prediction 
mistakes. It’s also about enhancing the adaptability and flexibility of 
internal models over time, by exploring new ideas and questioning 
existing assumptions ( Schwartenbeck et  al., 2013 ; Friston et  al., 
2017b). This aligns with the play theory notion that play behavior is 
impulse-driven learning that is essential for cognitive development 
(Groos, 1901).
Fictional spaces offer sandboxes where brains can safely toy with 
alternative simulations unconstrained by risks, resources, or actual 
outcomes (Clark, 2016; Oatley, 2016). Games provide structured play 
spaces designed to engage learning drives (Juul, 2011). The arts and 
media enable counterfactual exploration broadening predictive 
capabilities beyond local ecological constraints. As already remarked, 
Sutton-Smith (2009) argued that the human appetite for diverse 
imaginative worlds serves adaptive functions he termed the “ambiguity 
of play. ” Play loosens anchors to reality, allowing flexible recombination 
of meanings and concepts. Make-believe provides a play space to 
manipulate identities and virtual realities while suspending worldly 
consequences. This facilitates cognitive development and mental 
flexibility. In this view, arts and fiction allow indulging intrinsic drives 
to address uncertainty through imaginary exploration, expanding 
concepts and causal models beyond available experience ( Carroll, 
1990; Swirski, 2007). Just as children play games to train skills, creative 
works provide artificial environments to refine and diversify predictive 
models ( Boyd, 2009). Hartung and Willems (2020)  propose that 
fiction and fantasy specifically target gaps in readers’ conceptual 
networks. The navigation of imaginary worlds thus harnesses the 
training of generalizable cognitive skills.
5.2 Mimetic culture as cognitive 
playground
Donald (1991)  argued that complex mimetic skills enabled 
humans to construct imagined realities orders of magnitude beyond 
other species. Ritual and oral myth-telling coevolved with material 
culture to simulate virtual worlds, constituting a playground for 
modeling alternate psychic and social realities.
Donald termed this nexus of mimetic cognitive abilities, ritual 
behavior, oral narrative, and aesthetic culture the “mimetic mind. ” 
He  proposed that the generative capacity at the heart of human 
cognition emerged from the interplay between mimetic imagination 
and cultural innovation. The arts provided spaces to push mimetic 
skills, expanding the horizons of possible realities. Across cultures, 
arts extract deep structural invariances in experience as creative 
templates (Dissanayake, 2015).
In this view, the universal delight humans find in the arts reflects 
impulse-driven play behavior that hones cognitive skills by exposing 
minds to divergent worlds. Aesthetic pleasure may arise from 
satisfying intrinsic drives to seek out tractable challenges and new 
possibilities that expand generative capacities ( Csikszentmihalyi, 
1990). The predictive brain therefore engages with art as a particularly 
adaptive form of cognitive training.
5.3 Cultural learning: the tension between 
uncertainty reduction and creative 
imagination
Tomasello (2016) argues that cumulative human culture relies on 
capacities to discern others’ intentionality and recursively simulate 
how artifacts solve shared problems. This allows indirect acquisition 
of models and practices with opaque purposes. Norms and rituals 
efficiently transfer adaptive cultural knowledge. Boyd and Richerson 
(1985) detail how cultural learning mechanisms promote the 
acquisition of group-tested knowledge and behaviors. Y ounger 
generations readily adopt cultural patterns, leveraging accumulated 
wisdom without needing to reinvent solutions from scratch (Dean 
et  al., 2014 ). Social learning can thus optimize solutions over 
generations in ways individual learning cannot (Ballinger et al., 2003).
Traditions and norms thereby propagate community-refined 
predictive models that reduce uncertainty by providing frameworks 
for addressing many issues that humans recurrently face. Artistic 
culture complements this conservative function with spaces to 
challenge assumptions and exploring ulterior possibilities that are 
instrumental to the evolution of culture (Morriss-Kay, 2010; Kesner, 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org
2014). Tensions between norms and disruptive imaginings stimulate 
revolutions in perspective that can reshape societies ( Poks, 2020). 
Open-ended simulation abilities allow humans to download culture 
on vast scales to efficiently equip predictive brains with tools, practices, 
languages, and bodies of knowledge that are refined and 
institutionalized across generations through a constant dialectical 
tension between conservation and disruption (Wheeler, 2003), and 
that eventually favor the minimization of collective uncertainty 
(Dissanayake, 2006 ). The arts may provide essential cognitive 
sandboxes necessary for evolving culture and discovering new 
predictive models not easily discerned through individual experience 
(Wolf, 2020).
5.4 Exploration of social worlds
Fiction turns out to be a particularly precious resource devised by 
humans for the safe exploration of the realm of complex social 
causality (Fletcher, 2021) that is a characteristic source of uncertainty 
in human and more generally primate societies (Ramos-Fernandez 
et al., 2018). Social cognition researchers argue that navigating the 
tangled dynamics of agency, intention, cooperation, deception, and 
recursive thinking presents perennial adaptive demands that have left 
a clear trace in human biological design (Platt et al., 2016; Dunbar, 
2018). Shared imaginative worlds provide low-stake training grounds 
for social competence (Dodell-Feder and Tamir, 2018). The capacity 
of literary fiction to function as a rich simulation of social worlds has 
been shown to engage theory of mind reasoning more than popular 
fiction (Kidd and Castano, 2013, 2019). Reading fiction moreover 
correlates with performance on social inference tasks (Mar et al., 2006; 
Mumper and Gerrig, 2017 ). Transportation into narrative worlds 
involves inferring characters’ beliefs, motives, and likely behaviors 
(Fletcher, 2023), and qualitative differences in fiction formats and 
thematic genres may affect levels of prosociality (Turner and Felisberti, 
2018). This “pretense of social interaction” exercises social predictive 
models by exposing readers to diverse agents and perspectives 
(Zunshine, 2006), so that fiction provides surrogate experiences and 
social commentary expanding human intuitive psychology (Oatley, 
2016). As the arts simulate alternate social realities as cognitive 
training, music similarly provides an abstracted relational sandbox. 
Levitin (2006)  argues that musical pleasure stems from tracking 
nested patterns across timescales and actively predicting upcoming 
structures. Specific aesthetic manipulations exercise cognitive skills 
for detecting variation, recursion, and resolution in sequenced 
patterns, which transfer to social domains (Cross, 2012; Pearce and 
Rohrmeier, 2012). Generative competition between conventions and 
creative novelty may drive the cultural evolution of such adaptive 
learning environments across art forms (Gabora, 2017). The cultural 
canon can therefore be  regarded as a storage of socially validated 
simulations whose engagement potential relates to their capacity of 
honing valuable social inference skills.
5.5 Neural basis of art and social cognition
Neuroscientific evidence corroborates the existence of links 
between the arts and social cognition. Both fiction reading and social 
working memory tasks activate the default network and executive 
system (Hsu et al., 2015; Tamir et al., 2016). Exposure to predictively 
stimulating musical patterns recruits neural valuation circuits 
(Salimpoor et al., 2015), further supporting the idea that humans are 
intrinsically motivated in seeking novelty in their experiential sphere 
(Baranes et al., 2014). Such evidence suggests that the arts, and more 
generally creative, out-of-the-box thinking, activate executive (Beaty 
et al., 2015) and social inference (van Leeuwen et al., 2022) networks, 
supporting proposals that engagement with narrative or auditory 
worlds, among others, provides valuable opportunities for cognitive 
training. This would also explain why art forms such as music, visual 
arts and fiction appear intrinsically rewarding, as a result of their value 
in promoting successful ecological adaptation and not as a pure 
hedonic stimulus (Lacey et al., 2011; Blain and Sharot, 2021). It also 
accounts for why brains are intrinsically motivated to devote energy 
and attention to artificial experiences serving no apparent survival 
necessity, but superseding attendance of crucial survival functions 
such as eating and sleeping while deeply immersed in engaging 
fictional worlds (Perks, 2014). The arts offer a primary experimental 
space tailored to exercise social cognition capabilities, just as games 
and play train physical and problem-solving skills, and such goals are 
heavily prioritized in our biobehavioral design (Kirsch et al., 2016). 
Culture may then have evolved as a cognitive amplification tool for 
social animals dependent on recursive mindreading but constrained 
by risks and costs of unbounded, unregulated real-life exploration.
This perspective integrates theories of play and culture with 
predictive processing frameworks and research across anthropology, 
psychology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. It generates intriguing 
hypotheses about requisite cultural elements for optimizing the 
adaptive predictive accuracy of human brains across both physical and 
social domains.
5.6 The dynamic toggling between weekly 
and fesive time: culture as situated 
cognition
Once understood how weekly and festive time cultures play 
different but complementary roles, we need to consider what are the 
socio-cognitive mechaisms that egulate the dynamic toggling between 
these two spheres. A useful conceptual framework in this respect is 
culture-as-situated-cognition (CSC) theory (Oyserman, 2016), that 
highlights the malleability of cultural mindsets and their influence on 
cognitive processes, judgments, and behavior. Individuals have access 
to multiple cultural mindsets, such as individualistic, collectivistic, 
and honor mindsets, which can become temporarily accessible 
through situational cues. The cognitive effects of these primed 
mindsets can manifest in various ways, such as influencing attention 
allocation, reasoning styles, and social judgments (Oyserman et al., 
2009; Choi et  al., 2016 ). The interplay between weekly time, 
characterized by routines and traditions, and festive time, marked by 
artistic expression and creative exploration, can be understood as a 
cyclical process that regulates the accessibility of different cultural 
mindsets. The institutionalization of weekly vs. festive time in terms 
of the social calendar of weekdays, weekends, and festivities, therefore, 
acts itself as the social cue that primes the activation of 
different mindsets.
However, the arts can act themselves as a social priming 
mechanism, priming temporary mindset shifts also within the 
Bortolotti et al. 10.3389/fnhum.2024.1357354
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org
fabric of weekly time, as in the already discussed case of Skhlovsky’s 
defamiliarization techniques. Just as priming tasks in experimental 
settings can make individualistic or collectivistic mindsets 
accessible, exposure to artistic experiences can prime cognitive 
processes associated with individualistic or collectivistic 
orientations, with the difference that, unlike social cues designed 
in the laboratory, artistic cues are not only ecological, but also 
suitably evolved for this purpose. This explains why the arts can 
become powerful forms of social priming eliciting attitudinal and 
behavioral change ( Klatt et al., 2013 ; Martin et al., 2018 ), and why 
they represent a potentially more promising foundation for 
behavioral policy interventions than artificial, paternalistic choice 
architecture ones which struggle to fit the contextual complexity of 
ecological human environments ( Meder et al., 2018 ). In particular, 
the priming effects of artistic experiences during festive time are 
sociobiologically designed to counteract the potential risks of 
cultural entrenchment and cognitive rigidity associated with 
prolonged immersion in routine practices. By periodically 
activating alternative cultural mindsets and exposing individuals 
to diverse social simulations, festive time fosters cognitive 
flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to navigate complex 
social environments.
6 The neuroscience of traditions and 
artistic innovation: the shallow brain 
hypothesis
Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience lend further support 
to the conceptual framework proposed here regarding the 
complementary roles of traditions and artistic innovation in training 
the predictive capacities of the social brain. In particular, the “shallow 
brain hypothesis” outlined by Suzuki et  al. (2023)  provides an 
intriguing neurobiological perspective that enriches the functional 
account of culture’s dual nature.
The shallow brain hypothesis questions the dominance of 
hierarchical models like mainstream versions of predictive coding 
that assume higher cortical areas to sequentially build up abstract 
features. However, this line of argument challenges such predicting 
coding approaches in a way that further corroborates the conceptual 
foundation of cultural experiences proposed in this paper rather 
than undermining it. Let us see why. Suzuki et al. (2023)  point to 
extensive evidence that even primary sensory cortices project 
directly to subcortical areas like the thalamus, basal ganglia, and 
brainstem. Furthermore, they highlight how all areas, both higher 
and lower, receive inputs from subcortical structures, constituting a 
massively parallel architecture. From this shallow neuroanatomical 
arrangement, Suzuki et  al. propose several key computational 
benefits that may be relevant to navigating cultural environments. 
First, the direct cortico-subcortical loops allow fast processing and 
learning in local circuits without sluggish propagation up and down 
cortical hierarchies. This may align with the proposal that rituals and 
norms leverage rich sensory-motor links and subcortical habits to 
quickly entrain generative models, while art provides more 
unconstrained exploration.
Additionally, the shallow architecture’s convergence in subcortical 
regions enables flexible selection and combination of diverse cortical 
inputs. This may lend neurological support to the hypothesized role 
of subcortical areas in integrating conventions and innovations, also 
in view of the increasing recognition of the extensive subcortical 
contribution to cognitive networks ( Janacsek et  al., 2022; Pessoa, 
2024). The basal ganglia and thalamus are positioned to gate and blend 
outputs from lower and higher cortical processors. The extraordinary 
computational capacity within local cortical microcircuits also 
emphasized by the shallow brain hypothesis suggests that both 
compression of traditions and expansion of innovations might occur 
within specialized but fully integrated circuits. The generative 
architectures for constraining versus enhancing conceptual networks 
may operate in parallel. The shallow brain thesis further elucidates 
how synaptic plasticity sculpts cortical microcircuits over learning 
experiences, gradually yielding efficient representations tailored to 
recurrent situations. This neural tuning account seems to support the 
idea that norms and rituals cultivate shared generative models 
optimized for stabilizing social worlds. Finally, Suzuki and colleagues 
elaborate predictive coding principles showing how brains minimize 
surprise by matching top-down models against sensory inputs to 
correct errors. The shallow brain perspective demonstrates how 
hierarchical and parallel circuits coordinate to implement prediction-
driven learning. This neuroscience-grounded predictive processing 
aligns with and substantiates the overarching framework proposed for 
cultural forms sculpting social predictive abilities.
The shallow brain hypothesis may be a precious source of research 
hypotheses to further probe into the conceptual duality presented here 
between traditions that transmit compressed models and art that 
expands horizons. Neural evidence confirms cultures harness flexible 
cortical–subcortical circuits ( Nadal, 2013 ) whose role in the 
stabilization and adaptation of predictive models attuned to both 
routine and novel social challenges needs to be further explored. The 
shallow neuroanatomy of the brain might thus provide a fascinating 
basis for an elegant conceptual convergence between our current 
insights about the psychological and biological mechanisms involved 
in both dimensions of our cultural experience.
This interdisciplinary synthesis of cognitive and brain sciences 
provides a richer picture of how human predictive capacities 
intertwine with culture’s dual heritage. Such a conceptual framework 
appears promising for future research leveraging neuroimaging, 
neural network modeling, and clinical studies to further elucidate the 
cognitive and neural processes bridging brains and human cultures. 
Understanding the neurocognitive bases of shared predictions 
promises to illuminate much about the deep roots of human 
psychology and sociality.
7 Conclusion
This paper has explored the dual faces of human culture through 
the unifying lens of predictive coding. Viewing brains as prediction-
optimizing systems provides insight into how both traditions and the 
arts aid cognitive adaptation in the social domain. We  proposed 
complementary roles for cultural norms and creative imagination in 
training the predictive capacities of the social brain. The former 
propagate group-tested schemas, rituals, and practices that minimize 
collective uncertainty by providing efficient predictive frameworks for 
recurrent situations. Shared conventions reduce ambiguity about 
others’ likely behaviors and reactions during high-stake cooperative 
endeavors and routine social living.

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 10 frontiersin.org
Meanwhile, decoupled imaginary worlds of fiction, music, and 
make-believe facilitate the development of flexible social cognitive 
skills. The arts provide simulated play spaces to actively explore 
diverse perspectives, agents, and social dynamics well beyond 
those present in one’s immediate experience, while at the same 
time providing inputs that can be readily processed and exploited 
in specific real-life circumstances, but also turning out useful in 
future planning. For instance, dealing with counterfactual 
scenarios and unconventional narratives encountered in fictional 
worlds exercises the brain’s ability to contend with a wider array of 
mental models and outcomes which are essential for long-range 
executive tasks.
In this paper, we  synthesized a scattered body of 
multidisciplinary evidence regarding the functions of traditions and 
the arts as part of an integrated evolutionary framework grounded 
in emerging predictive processing theories of cognition. This 
perspective reveals deep commonalities between the sciences of 
mind and culture. Both deal fundamentally with developing, 
propagating, and updating generative models of the world. If brains 
are essentially prediction engines, then culture constitutes the 
collective data sets and training environments for optimizing 
models of social worlds. Arts and traditions populate distinct but 
complementary niches in the cultural ecosystem, which play a key 
role in the acceleration of learning. The former specializes in 
imaginative exploration and expanding possibilities, while the latter 
conserves solutions and encodes wisdom into compressible rituals 
and norms. This framework integrates findings across anthropology, 
psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computational modeling 
into a common information-theoretic vocabulary elucidating what 
culture is, why it is so salient, and how it interacts with cognition. 
It provides an integrative foundation for future research examining 
cultural evolution through a predictive coding lens. A deeper 
understanding of our distinctive human cognition may emerge 
from examining its interdependence with the collective cultural-
cognitive networks that shape its growth.
