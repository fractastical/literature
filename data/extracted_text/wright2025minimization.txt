A theory of self-organization in the central nervous system is described,
proposing that additive and dissipative synaptodendritic summation leads to

mechanism of prediction error minimization. As a consequence, synaptic
connections become arranged in mirror-symmetric paired patterns, wherein
exchangesofsynapticﬂuxwithineachpatternformcoupledspatialeigenmodes.
The mirror-reﬂection axis between each pair functions as a Markov blanket that
maintains excitatory–inhibitory equilibrium, while multiway exchanges among

energyprincipleandtheimportanceofpredictionerrorminimizationinbrainfunction.
The free energy principle, with its corollary, prediction error minimization,
has become inﬂuential throughout the brain sciences over the last two decades
as a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of earlier top-down vs. bottom-up concepts of brain
organization. It generalizes formal parallels between laws of nature, including least action,
thermodynamics,andBayesianinference(e.g., Friston,2002,2005,2008,2010a,b;Hohwy,
2016; Ramstead et al., 2022), and depends upon the idea that all systems separated by a
boundary from a wider environment evolve until they have minimized their perturbation
bythatenvironment.Thisimplieserrorminimizationacrosstheboundary,as,inthelimit,
equal and opposite signals are continuously exchanged, resulting in maximum mutual
information. Such a boundary is termed a Markov blanket by Friston (Kirchhoﬀ et al.,
2018; Friston et al., 2017; Tschacher and Haken, 2007; Fields and Levin, 2019; Kiebel and
Friston,2011;Levin,2019;Hohwy,2016).

Applying the principle to the central nervous system (CNS), it
issupposedthataninternalrepresentationoftheself,actingwithin
the world, arises in the higher centers of the brain as a generative
model with the capacity to bring about novel consequences—that
is,withthecapacityforagency.
Due to the principle’s generality and unity, and its implications
for natural general intelligence, its importance for the future
developmentofartiﬁcialgeneralintelligenceisapparent.However,
it also faces strong criticism. An early criticism was that of the
dark room (Friston et al., 2012; Clarke, 2013; Sun and Firestone,
2020)—that escape from stimulus alone would minimize error.
Recent criticisms (Kwisthout and van Rooij, 2020; Mangalam,
2025) assert that the principle is metaphoric and not testable; that
the computation of Bayesian priors and posteriors could not be
achievedwithinhierarchicalarchitectures;thatintermediatevalues
of these measures could not be stored; and that assumptions made
about the statistical properties of pulses and electrocortical waves
areunphysiological.
These criticisms conﬂate high-level cognitive abstractions with
basicphysiologicalmechanisms.Theywouldbealleviatedifitwere
shown that neurons minimize prediction error in interactions at
all scales, so they are not bound solely by hierarchical interactions;
that the mechanisms are robust with respect to the statistical
characteristics of pulse and wave generation; and that such neural
mechanisms tend to evolve toward agency. What follows is a
theoretical account of neuroanatomical order that meets these
requirementsandcouldbefurthertestedinconnectomics.
2 The neural ﬁeld
We begin with deﬁnitions of minimal network characteristics
(Wright and Bourke, 2024a,b) necessary to justify the simulations
upon which our arguments rely. The network properties overlap
with those of classical artiﬁcial networks ( Hopﬁeld, 1982 ;
Rumelhart et al., 1986; Xie and Seung, 2003), but are not identical.
When stochastic approximations are assumed, it does not imply
thatGaussianorlinearpropertiesarenecessary.
2.1 Presynaptic ﬂux and Hebbian plasticity
The n unidirectional ﬂows of presynaptic ﬂux in a neural ﬁeld
can be represented asn elements of a square matrix/Phi1(t), with
elements ϕij, each representing the presynaptic ﬂux received at the
neuronatposition i fromtheneuronatposition j,overallpathways.
/Phi1(t) = GQ (t) (1)
G (t) is a square matrix operator of presynaptic gains and axo-
dendritic conduction times, transformingQ (t), a vector of action

Qj isthepulserateofthe j −th neuron,υ isthespeedofsignal
spread, and |i−j|
ν is the delay from pulse generation to arrival of
peak pulse density at pre-synapses on thei − th neuron, averaged
over all routes. Synaptic gains are on three time-scales,εij,gij,ρij–
thetransientsynapticeﬃcacy,theslowdynamicsynapticgain,and
the structural synapse gains, respectively, with synaptic ﬂux either
excitatoryorinhibitory.
Itisassumedthatgainsarecompetitiveonallthreetime-scales
(Miller, 1996; Okamoto and Ichikawa, 2000) and consistent with
the uniﬁcation of fast and slow synaptic learning rules proposed
by Izhikevich and Desai (2003), combining short-term plasticity
(STP) and short-term depression (STD) with the slower and more
permanent Bienenstock-Cooper-Monro (BCM) rule. Thus, with
ongoingnetworkactivity,therapidandtransientsynapticeﬃcacies
in response to aﬀerent pulses lead to increasing dynamic and
structuralgainsasthetimeaverageofsynapticﬂux.
2.2 Dendritic summation and pulse
generation
Transformations of synaptic ﬂux leading to pulse generation
canberepresentedas
Vi (t) = δ (t −τ)∗ ∑ ϕij (t) (3)
δ (t −τ) is a dendritic delay function convolving the aggregate
presynaptic ﬂux to generate the dendritic potential,Vi (t), and
may describe any form of leaky integration. The large numbers
ofindependentnon-linearsummationsatthedendriticmembrane
are assumed to be stochastically smoothed to an additive
approximation, where Q
i (t) is the eﬀerent pulse rate of thei −
th neuron,
Qi (t) = fθ (Vi (t)) (4)
and fθ is any sigmoid-like function operating as a probabilistic
thresholdforactionpotentialgeneration.
2.3 Anti-Hebbian plasticity and steady state
Anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity, reﬂecting multiple
homeostatic metabolic pathways, acts to normalize excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic gains, leaving the relative strengths of
Hebbian inﬂuences unchanged (Keck et al., 2017). A steady state
is maintained in which excitatory and inhibitory ﬂux remain
balancedsothatwhere ∑ ϕ
e isthetotalexcitatorypresynapticﬂux
and∑ ϕi isthetotalinhibitorypresynapticﬂux,then
∑ /Phi1e →− ∑ ϕi → constancy (5)
This steady-state assumption applies to summed aﬀerent
pulses reaching individual neurons as well as the population
average; however, the constancy may vary with the level of
networkactivation.
2.4 Goals of this model
From these assumptions about network properties, we must
demonstrate how the external environmental ﬁeld,E

Wright and Bourke 10.3389/fnsys.2025.1683448
where x,y,z,t are spatial and temporal coordinates, is mapped
onto the developed form of the synaptic connections. That is,
we must explain how synapses that converge to a static state can
represent sequences of spatiotemporal sensory and motor images.
The electrodynamics of synchronous oscillation provide a starting
pointforunderstanding.
3 Synchrony
3.1 Mechanism of synchrony
Synchronous oscillatory ﬁring ( Singer, 1993) of cortical
neurons is prominent in the 40Hz (gamma) range but is apparent
over all frequencies. Possible mechanisms for its generation
are multiple, as it may arise from identical inputs to separate
neurons or through non-linear phase-locking of neurons at high
or pathological levels of excitation. However, it can be shown
that synchrony emerges in any network with zero-mean summing
junctions interposed between elements, even when the network is
driven by temporally and spatially diﬀuse white noise. Principal
component spatial eigenmode analysis of simulations of the
neural ﬁeld reveals that the ﬁrst principal component of the
ﬁeld exhibits widespread zero-lag synchrony with relatively low
spatial damping and is the response to the even components of
the inputs driving the ﬁeld. The second principal component is
characterized by low-magnitude, asynchronous, highly spatially
damped, and rapidly dissipated activity and is the response to
the odd components of the inputs (Chapman et al., 2002). These
properties can account for the bulk of ﬁndings on synchronous
oscillation in the brain ( Wright et al., 2000). Closely related
simulations that also account for other EEG properties, including
the background spectrum and major cerebral rhythms (Wright
and Liley, 1995, 1996; Robinson et al., 1997, 2001; Rennie et al.,
2000, 2002), incorporate prominent zero-lag synchrony as an
inherentproperty.
These numerical ﬁndings can be simply explained. Oscillation
arises from the to-and-fro exchange of signals between excitatory
neuronsandlocalinhibitoryneurons.Synchronyisthengenerated
by summation of synaptic aﬀerents at dendritic membranes, as
in Equation3, with a set level as inEquation5. Synaptic pulse
trains that arrive in opposite phase with respect to the sustained
mean level cancel in summation, while those in phase summate
positively—thus out-of-phase signals are dissipative, whereas in-
phase pulses, when exchanged through the neural population,
converge to coordinated synchrony at all frequencies. This applies
to the summation of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic ﬂuxes
at the membrane, since the inhibitory ﬂux is eﬀectively of the
oppositephasetotheexcitatoryﬂux.Thisargumentisindependent

interactionsofoddandevensignalcomponentsarerelevant.
Although point, limit cycle, or chaotic attractor dynamics may
appear transiently in single neurons, this model is not restricted
to such dynamics. A stochastic process results in synchrony as a
groundstateofelectrocorticalactivity,consistentwithobservations
thatelectrocorticalwavesexhibitenergyequipartitionandminimal
freeenergy( Wright,1989).
3.2 Synchrony as prototypical predictive
error minimization
Since the exchange of signals between any two neurons tends
to converge toward their synchronous ﬁring, this is a prototypical
example of mutual predictive error minimization leading to the
maximization of mutual information, I. Roughly measured in
linearapproximation,
I =− 1
2 log2
(
1−r2) (6)
where r is the correlation coeﬃcient of their synaptic
ﬂuxexchange.
From this simple form of prediction error minimization
between individual cells, the formation of geometrically ordered
multiway exchanges between cell populations can be inferred,
asfollows.

F = A −C → 0 (7)
where A is the total presynaptic ﬂux autocorrelation, andC is
thetotalpresynapticﬂuxcross-correlation.
A further assumption is made here—that although the
asymptoticlimitcannotbereachedinlife,itwillbesuﬃcientlyand
continuously approached despite perturbation, to such a degree
that connections will emerge observably close to those expected at
thelimit.
At the limit at whichF = 0 (or approximately, if the limit is
suﬃciently closely approached), in the exchange of synaptic ﬂuxes

i and j, and time-lag τ, the sum of their autocorrelation terms
becomesequaltothesumoftheircross-correlations:
ϕij (t)ϕij (t −τ) +ϕji (t) ϕji (t −τ) = ϕij (t) ϕji (t −τ)

According to the free energy principle, the synaptic ﬂuxes now

Equation8 admits manysolutions in which free energy iszero,
but energy is not equipartitioned. These cases represent forces
perturbing the system and external inputs operating upon the
neural network and are analogous topdV forces in equilibrium
thermodynamics, where free energy is equivalent to the Gibbs
freeenergy.
4.2 Prediction error minimization and free
energy gradient
Free energy gradients must vanish as the free energy is
minimized—but since the system is under continuing input
perturbations, then, where /Delta1/Phi1+ is a vector representing ﬂux
induced by the externally imposed signals, there must arise an
oppositely directed vector /Delta1/Phi1−. In eﬀect, the neural network
predictsandneutralizesitsinputswithminimalerror,so
/Delta1/Phi1+ (t) −/Delta1/Phi1− (t) → 0; dF

Since all ﬂuctuations are minimized, synaptic exchanges in
zero-lagsynchronyaremaximizedtotheextentpossibleintheface
ofongoingperturbation.
4.3 The emergence of mirror pair systems
and excitatory/inhibitory balance
Fields of synchrony form the spatial eigenmodes of the
network. Opposite and equal compensating asymmetric exchanges
cannot be within the same eigenmode system, as this would
result in a frozen steady state in which a representation of input
time variations would not be possible (This would be the dark
room outcome.). Therefore, the minimization of prediction errors
requires that spatial eigenmodes develop in paired systems with
mirror reversal, each with time-varying ﬂux exchanges between
eigenmodesoppositelydirectedtothoseinthemirrorpartner.
Paired mirror systems must also be able to maintain overall
excitatory/inhibitory balance, as required byEquation5. This can
be provided by the collision of traveling waves at the line of
interaction of the mirror pair, modulated by the adaptations of
anti-Hebbian plasticity, and mediated by cross-couplings of all
excitatory/inhibitory combinations, as diagrammed inWright and
Bourke (2024a,b). The line of collision is acting as a Markov
blanket, with prediction errors in exchanges over the blanket
minimized until equilibrium is reached. The paired structure
conformstothegoodregulatortheorem( ConantandAshby,1970 ),
which states that every good regulator must be a good model of
the system it is controlling. Thus, each of the paired mirrors is a
good regulator of the other. When the mirror pair arrangement
is generalized to the multiway interactions of many systems, each
approaching approximate mirror symmetry with its neighbors,
complicated patterns of mutual regulation and distributed systems
ofpartialgenerativemodelscanarise,inﬂuencingoneanother.
Figure1 (left) illustrates a system composed of a pair of
mirror-symmetric, coupled spatial eigenmodes, each generating
oppositely directed, colliding, traveling waves. The diagram shows

Within each of a pair of mirror-symmetric systems, spatial

4.4 Signal exchanges across Markov
blankets
It is emphasized that a Markov blanket is a mechanism for
prediction error minimization, but it is not essential that free
energy reach the zero limit. Perturbation of the system short of
the limit will generate exchanges of signals across the blanket,
enabling sequences of activity to be coordinated between mirror
pairs,althoughexchangesacrosstheblanketboundarymaintaining
excitatory/inhibitory balance result always in convergence toward
signal mean and zero-lag synchrony on either side. This requires
exchanges that may be mutually excitatory, mutually inhibitory, or

perturbations of signals across the blankets can be information-
rich, and multiway exchanges between assemblies of mirror pairs
could organize sensorimotor sequences. This can be observed in

4.5A prototypical example: the spinal cord
All neural development depends upon cell diﬀerentiation
in stages, from early precursors into populations of cells with
characteristic diﬀerences in axonal and dendritic trees and paths
of mobilization into anatomical order. Mirror symmetries are

spinal segment can be regarded as forming a system of coupled
spatial eigenmodes. Exchanges across each of the Markov blankets
couldthenmaximizethemutualinformationbetweensensoryand
motor signals in the left and right parts of the body, as well as
between higher and lower spinal levels. Thus, elementary sensory
experiencesfromwithinandwithouttheorganism,aswellasmotor
expression, would be integrated in a generative model of self-
in-the-world, in the simplest sense. Perturbations crossing these
boundaries would enable the organization of activity in temporal
sequences. This provides a principled basis for the well-studied
mechanisms that coordinate locomotion in all creatures with a
segmental nervous system, from worms to humans (Danner et al.,
2016).
This symmetry could not be generated by the above
hypothetical neural mechanisms alone. The structure must be
genetically determined and originally selected in evolution by
mechanical demands for articulation and the development of
segmental reﬂexes, but it oﬀers a starting point for the evolution
of neural mirror symmetries in further development. It is well-
established that the organization of the spinal cord extends into
thebrainstemandsubcortex,preservingbilateralsymmetryandthe
extension of structures related to the dorsal and ventral horns of
the spinal cord. We assume without proof that the later evolved
developments within the subcortical systems could themselves
be decomposed into mirror pairs. Instead, we will show how
the formation of mirror pairs is apparent in the formation of
connectionsthroughouttheneocortex.
5 Embryogenesis
5.1 Selection of neurons and synapses early
in the developing brain
Synchronous ﬁring emerges early in neuronal development,
coinciding with the establishment of small-world connectivity
(Downes et al., 2012; Markov et al., 2011; Vergara et al., 2019;
BassettandBullmore,2006 ).Concurrentapoptosis( Hollvilleetal.,
2019) favors cells that ﬁre with zero-lag synchrony (Heck et al.,
2008; Sang et al., 2021), apparently because synchrony promotes
high metabolic turnover and resistance to cell suicide (Vergara
et al., 2019). Initially, random action potential pulses can generate
polysynaptic ﬂows, within which bidirectional monosynaptic
couplings may form between cells through symmetric exchanges.
Arising ﬁrst as rostral extensions of the early embryonic spinal
cord and brainstem, brain cell precursors that will give rise to the
limbicsystemradiateoutwardtoformtheneocortex,inaccordance
with the Structural Model. As this expansion continues, cortical
layers develop in depth, establishing pathways of signal ﬂow and
increasinglydetailedlocalpatternsofconnectivity.
5.2 The structural model
Thestructuralmodelprovidesanaccountoftheembryogenesis
of the neocortex (Barbas, 1986; Barbas and Rempel-Clower, 1997;
Barbas, 2015; Garcia-Cabezas et al., 2019, 2020; Sancha-Velasco
et al., 2023; Uceda-Heras et al., 2024). Radial lines of cells grow
outwards(Sanides,1962,1964,1970)fromtwoprimarycellgroups
related to the hippocampus and olfactory allocortices, respectively,
expanding in concentric rings. Cellular and molecular features
vary systematically along the radial cortical gradient of laminar
complexity (Sancha-Velasco et al., 2023; Garcia-Cabezas et al.,
2017; Puelles et al., 2019, 2024; Rakic, 2002, 2007; Barbas and
Garcia-Cabezas, 2016; Barbas and Garcia-Carbezas, 2015; Garcia-
Cabezasetal.,2019 ,2020).
As diﬀerentiation proceeds, cell connectivity also undergoes
modiﬁcation under the distance rule (Markov et al., 2011; Vezoli
et al., 2021), favoring cross-connections via the shortest and most
locally dense pathways (Aparicio-Rodriguez and Garcia-Cabezas,
2023), thereby imposing circumferential connections among the
radial lines. The radial lines and circumferential rings become
folded into the neocortex, and at the most peripheral limit of
development, they include the neurons in the primary sensory and
motorcortices.
Along the radial lines of development, centrifugal signals from
the limbic system interact with centripetal signals from the special
sensory and motor cortex, bypassing each other between cortical
layers in a counterﬂow between a hub-like center vs. the primary
cortical areas that establish direct sensory and motor interactions
with the environment (Adams et al., 2013). The counterﬂow is
organized according to layers in the cortical depth, with layer
complexityincreasingfromthelimbictothespecialsensorycortex.
The ﬂow outward from the limbic system passes from layers 5 and
6 centrally to layers 5 and 6 and layers 2 and 3 more peripherally.
Meanwhile, the counterﬂow in layer 4, generated by peripheral
inputs, interacts with neurons in layers 2 and 3 and is then relayed
further via layer 4. Circumferential connections connect layers all-
to-all.
The structural model reiterates ancestral neocortical evolution
(citations above, Steﬀen et al., 2022), and the radial hierarchical
order can be regarded as an ultimate extension of spinal segmental
order. Radial development provides a hierarchical order for
minimizing theoretical prediction error (Shipp, 2007; Shipp and
Friston,2022;Bastosetal.,2012 ,2020).
5.3 Columns and patches at millimetric
scale
Further order develops at the millimetric scale in the upper
layers, where the superﬁcial patch system (Muir et al., 2011; Muir
Frontiersin SystemsNeuroscience 05 frontiersin.org
Wright and Bourke 10.3389/fnsys.2025.1683448
andDouglas,2011 ;Martinetal.,2014 ),madeupofpatchesofcells
that make lateral connections, skipping from patch to neighboring
patches in several steps, forms gridworks believed to distribute
information between all intracortical locales. Some parts of the
cortexareorganizedintozones( Molnar,2020;HortonandAdams,
2005), consisting of short-axon neurons surrounded by groups of
superﬁcial patchcells, whichcreate variablyresolved, oftendiﬀuse,
macrocolumns. Within these macrocolumns, individual cells are
organizedaccordingtotheirstimuluspreferences(e.g., Obermayer
and Blasdel, 1993). Similar neuron response preferences can be
detected whether or not columns are present (Meng et al., 2012),
so the presence or absence of columnar structure appears to reﬂect
thedegreetowhichthepatchsystemandinterveningshorteraxon
cellsformdiscreteormergingsystems.
Organized response columns in animals, which are clearly
deﬁned and have relatively long gestation periods, such as rhesus
monkeys,appearbeforebirth( WieselandHubel,1974 ).Thus,their
formationdoesnotdependuponorganizedvisualinputs.Yet,when
deprived of organized visual inputs during the post-natal period,
the response architecture collapses (Blakemore and Van Sluyters,
1975;SherkandStryker,1976 ).
This embryological order can be interpreted as the formation
of mirror pairs in a number of distinct topologies, initially driven
antenatally by random pulsation and subsequently responding
post-natallytoorderedinputs.
6 All mirrors
6.1 Whole brain and interareal
approximations to mirror symmetries
In gross anatomy, approximate left/right mirror symmetry
extends from the spinal cord to the cerebral hemispheres.
Approximate mirror symmetries are also apparent throughout the
cerebral white matter, since interareal cortico-cortical connections
form U-shaped projections, each area tending to mirror others to
whichitprojectsreciprocally.
6.2 Hierarchical counterﬂows as mirror
symmetry
The lines of counterﬂow in the structural model, whereby
interactions between signal streams in a hierarchical order occur
in cortical layers 3 and 4, can be construed as a mirror reﬂection
of a mirror pair, with the layer 3/4 interaction interpreted as
an extended Markov blanket. This aligns with the inﬂuential
theory of prediction error minimization proposed byBastos et al.
(2012, 2020), in which prediction errors are minimized through
excitatory/inhibitoryinteractionsincounterﬂows.
We suggest that the Bastos et al. models are a special case of a
moregeneralandubiquitousprocessatallscales—andparticularly
at millimetric scales—in which paired, mirror-symmetric cells
and synaptic arrangements develop, thereby greatly increasing the
degrees of freedom for signal interchange and facilitating overall
minimizationofpredictionerror.
6.3 Simulations of the generation of mirror
maps at mesoscale
Detailed accounts of how the selection of developing neurons
for maximum synchrony by apoptosis can shape anatomical
ordering and the tuning of individual cortical neurons are given in
WrightandBourke(2013,2016,2022,2023,2024a,b);Wrightetal.
(2014).
Simulations (Wright and Bourke, 2013, 2016) were devised
to show that continuity between columnar and non-columnar
cortex could be explained when total synchrony was maximized
and axonal lengths were minimized according to the rules of
ultra-small world connectivity. We employed a simple force
equilibrium algorithm that leveraged the unit-dimension analogy
between mechanical force and synaptic ﬂow, considering
the axonal lengths of two populations—speciﬁcally, those
with long vs. short axons. With an emphasis on small-world
cell organization alone, the pattern of cell connections was
diﬀuse. With emphasis on synchrony maximization alone, short
axon cells formed clusters surrounded by pools of the long
axon cells, the latter in systems with hexagonal, square, or
irregulartiling.
With both optimization criteria considered concurrently,
simulation outcomes varied depending on the absolute and
relative lengths of the short vs. the long axons. Where all
axonal lengths were shorter, and when the long axon lengths
were closer to those of the short axons, then a more diﬀuse
small-world order predominated. With increasing diﬀerence of
relativeaxonallengths,amoreclearlycolumnarstructureemerged.
This accounted for the variation in columnar and non-columnar
appearances, as well as the ordering of patch cells, with the
implication that a single modular system is common throughout,
and modular interpenetration in apparently non-columnar areas
is made possible by the sparsity of connectivity throughout
thecortex.
Using the patterns of cell body positions generated in the
simulations, we next reconstructed the patterns of symmetric
bidirectional monosynaptic connections that should emerge as
synchrony is maximized in the growing network. These matched
the distribution of synapses formed by superﬁcial patch cells,
with a neighborhood arrangement of cortical columns in mirror
symmetry to each neighbor. The closest approximation to mirror
symmetrybetweencolumnsrequiredpatchcellsinsquarepatterns,
with broken symmetry where patch connections were in a
hexagonalarray.
The requirement to maximize synchrony with bidirectionally
symmetric connections in all cases implied a rather strange but
necessary arrangement in the connection between patch cells and
the cells within each column. The interpenetration of the sparse
networks implied that maximization of synchrony among the
short axon cells required their linkage in closed loops, while the
connections made to the short axon cells by the patch cells would
be constrained within arcs radiating from columnar centers. The
upshot was that projection from the larger patch cell scale to the
shorter axon cell scale would be similar to the projection of a
Euclidean plane to a Möbius strip in a Riemann projection. We

where P is a position at the global scale of the patch system
expressed as a complex number, andp is a corresponding position
within one of the local maps. Curly brackets indicate that there is
a set of such maps tiling the cortical surface.(P−p0)2
|P−p0| describes the

rotation by 90 degrees, and the scale of the projection from global

a short-axon cellcluster. This impliesthat a mirroringrelationship

6.4 Explanatory power of the mesoscale
mirror pair model
The above model oﬀers a unitary explanation of the following
experimentalobservations:
• Columnar vs. non-columnar variation (Wright and Bourke,
2016).
• The antenatal development of retinotopic maps and their
post-natal loss with deprivation of visual experience (Wright
andBourke,2013 ).
• Retinotopic response maps in cortical area V1—Orientation
Preference (OP) singularities, linear zones, and saddle points.
A Möbius-like internal conﬁguration within a column
accountsfortheorganizationofOPfrom0to180degreesover
the 360 degrees around an OP singularity. Linear zones and
saddle points of OP are accounted for by mirror-symmetric
reversalswithsomebrokensymmetryatcolumnarboundaries
(WrightandBourke,2013 ,2016).
• Ocular dominance (OD) columns in a square array (Wright
andBourke,2024a ).
• “Like to like” patch cell connections—i.e., the preferential
connections of patch cells to columnar cells with a common
OP(WrightandBourke,2013 ,2024b).
• The numerical relationship TFP = object velocity x SFP
between preferred spatial frequency (SFP) and preferred
temporal frequency (TFP) in individual cortical neurons
(WrightandBourke,2022 ).
• The diﬀerential distribution of SFP and TFP in relation to OP
(WrightandBourke,2022 ).
• OP variation in response to moving line stimuli of given
orientation and varied speed, angle of attack, and length
(WrightandBourke,2013 )—asopposedtoﬁxedOPselection
ontheinputpathwayalone.
• Recordings made by vertical penetrations of the
somatosensory cortex showing that receptor ﬁelds for
cells exhibit continuities of the ﬁelds as the recording
electrode is advanced, as well as sudden breaks and reversals
of continuity—consistent with the organization of local cell
connectionsinaMöbius-likeconﬁgurationthatspiralswithin
thecorticallayers( Wrightetal.,2014 ).
6.5 Orderly organization of mirror pairs
As development unfolds, initially highly asymmetric signal
exchanges occur between layers 2, 3, and 4 in radial development
and between all layers in circumferential development. These
exchanges would proceed imperfectly, with later and local self-
organization further minimizing total free energy in a manner
similartotheformationofeddiesinturbulentﬂow.
Figure2 shows the stages of the proposed development of the
mirrorpairorganization.
In Figure2a, the central long dashed arrow indicates the
orientation of the neuraxis, with the three sections of the spinal
cord representing the cord and brain stem. The ﬁne dashed
radial lines indicate the direction of embryonic development from
limbic origins toward special cortical sensory/motor areas. Lateral
intra-cortical and cortico-cortical connections (gray arrows) add
circumferentialconnectivity.
The radial development in depth of the cortical layers of the
ventral and dorsal divisions, respectively, is shown on the left
and right hand sides from center. Laterally projecting red arrows
indicate cortico-cortical connections projecting from higher in
the sensory hierarchy to lower, and diagonal blue arrows mark
the counterﬂow of signals from lower to higher in the hierarchy.
Small blue vertical arrows mark the onward projections of axons
preferentially directed toward the surface from layer 4 to layers 2
and 3, and small red vertical arrows mark counterﬂows of traﬃc
from layers 2 and 3. Interaction between the counterﬂows at layers
2, 3, and 4 is characterized as a Markov blanket, indicated by the
double-dashedlines.
Figure2b represents the development of interareal and
interhemispheric projection via U-shaped cortico-cortical
connections, with approximate mirror symmetry. Superﬁcial
patch cells and columnar cells are shown embedded in the cortical
sheets (An area on the lower left is shown with overlapping patch
connections as a reminder that apparent columnar order can be
absentwithoutlossofmodularorder).
Figure2c shows the arrangement of superﬁcial patch cells on
the cortical surface, forming a communication network between
column-like groups of shorter axon excitatory cells that connect
in an interpenetrating meshwork, akin to systems of interlocked
Möbiusstrips.Projectionsfromthepatchcellstothecolumnsthus

Figure2d illustrates how the maximization of synchrony
between adjacent columns necessitates mirrored arrays in
neighborhoods, with a degree of broken symmetry imposed by the
roughlyhexagonaltilingofthepatchcellnetwork.
Figure2e, shown in cortical depth as inFigure2a, shows how
the mirror arrangement would develop as lateral connectivity in
layers2/3and5/6,respectively.

to a two-dimensional surface. Speciﬁc images in a time-varying
three-dimensional world require an object scale/rotation frame
of three dimensions plus a position reference frame of three
dimensions. The inclusion of information on image velocities then
requiresatranslationwithinbothoftheseframes.Therefore,when
compressedtoaneﬀectivelyﬂatsurfaceandstoredasstaticcortical
synaptic connections, image representations must be deﬁned by
sets of twelve points, and these sets must be laid out within an
equivalentofafour-dimensionalframe—arisingasfollows.
WhereO isapatternofactivityatthescaleofthepatchnetwork,
and o is the projected image to any given column-like short-axon
system,then,accordingtomapping(10)

Representation of O(P,t) has been dispersed across a set
of synaptic connections that form a four-dimensional reference
framework, with positions deﬁned by the complex numbers,P
(global map) andp − p
0 (within each of the set of local maps).
Within this frame, associations within sets of twelve neurons can
deﬁnespatiotemporalimages.
Because (10) and (11) are invertible 1:1 maps, and since
projections at a large scale are topographically ordered and receive
and project to primary sensory and motor areas as topographic 1:1
projections, generative models developed at the mesoscale would
maintaintopologicalconsistency.
7.2 Broken symmetry and sequences of
spatiotemporal images
Organizing into mirror pairs would minimize, but not
eliminate, broken symmetry. As the gradient of free energy
diminishes, in contrast to the idealization ofEquation9, with a
degree of asymmetry, an unstable, rather than a stable, ﬁxed point
wouldbeapproached.i.e.,
as F and
dF
dt −→0 d2F
dt2 →+ ve (12)
This may be favorable rather than fatal in functionality.
Spatiotemporal images must be stored in sequences much longer
than the timescale of intracortical conduction. Longer sequences
require cortical areas to activate each other sequentially, creating
cognitive order. Therefore, asymmetry would enable the switching
andmanipulationofspatiotemporalimagesonlongertimescales.
8 The evolution of agency
Given the above properties, it is possible to argue that agency
canemergeprogressivelyintheevolutionarysequence.Thecaudal-
to-rostral evolutionary sequence can be regarded as a progression
from hard-wired to soft-wired connectivity, as is apparent in
the progression from lower plasticity to higher plasticity seen
in enzyme expression in the radial lines of the structural model
(Garcia-Cabezas et al., 2017, 2019; Gomez et al., 2019; Sancha-
Velasco et al., 2023). Concurrently, the expansion of mirror pairs
incircumferentialorderprovidesforparallelandfeedbackrelations
withhigherdegreesoffreedomthanthehierarchicalorderalone—
asystematicvariantofsleep/wakingnetworkoptimization( Hinton
et al., 1995, 2006), in which network connectivity evolves toward
optimuminthepartiallyrandomizeddreamingphase.
Wecancomparetheneocortex,whichisconsideredsoft-wired,
vs.thelimbic,morecaudalcomponents,andapplytheNyquistand
Shannon relations to measure the channel capacities of both parts
of the CNS. The separation into neocortical and limbic systems, as
a division between soft- and hard-wired systems, is a convenience,
but the argument is general and applicable at various stages as
the number of neurons increases in a caudal-to-rostral sequence
throughoutevolution.
Treating each of n synaptic ﬂuxes as binary valued for
simplicity, the channel capacity of the entire CNS network,D,
measuredinbits,isasfollows:
D = n log
2
(
1+ C
A
) (13)
where C and A are the total cross-correlation and
autocorrelations of synaptic ﬂux (Equation7). C
A is equivalent to
a signal/noise ratio, and as the asymptotic limit is approached,
C → A andtherefore D → n.
If the neocortical component is composed ofn
neoﬂuxes and
a limbic and subcortical component ofnlimb ﬂuxes, then there
are 2nneo /2 distinguishable neocortical states in mirror pairs and
2nlimb /2limbicstates.
Survival requires that an organism avoid conditions
incompatible with any of the strongly inherited limbic states
that constrain and bind its behavior. However, ifnneo > nlimb,
there are 2nneo−nlimb possible neocortical states available for each
limbic state. These neocortical states arise internally through
couplings that minimize synaptic free energy. Consequently, as an
organism interacts with its environment, various combinations
of neocortical and limbic states are generated, and some of
the internal neocortical states, by linking to limbic states, gain
behavioral expression. The expanded range of states enables the
emergence of novel responses that can be tested for their survival
potential—either incurring risk or achieving unprecedented
success—and, if successful, become incorporated into the
organism’s behavioral repertoire. This mechanism may underlie
the phylogenetic evolution of agency. A parallel process can be
proposedforindividualdevelopment.

9.1 Summing up
Wehavearguedthatpredictionerrorminimizationisbuiltinto
the signal exchanges between every neuron in the brain and every
other, so that cortical neural networks tend to always maximize
synchronous oscillation in the face of ongoing perturbations.
Flexible evolution toward this elementary equilibrium at fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales of synaptic consolidation
would impose the formation of neuronal assemblies in mirror-
pair topologies at micro-, meso-, and macroscales, and between
scales. This, in turn, allows a four-dimensional generative model
to emerge, mapping the four-dimensional interactions of a self in
theworld.
Frontiersin SystemsNeuroscience 09 frontiersin.org
Wright and Bourke 10.3389/fnsys.2025.1683448
We have extended the argument to demonstrate that it
is consistent with the evolution of the brain being shaped
by apoptotic selection interacting with genetic sequences and
chemical organizers and, by allowing the addition of extra and
ﬂexible information-processing capacity, to progression toward
increasingagency.
This theoretical account, if valid, goes some way to countering
strong criticisms that have been made of the Bayesian brain
and the free energy principle. We have argued that information
management is not limited to hierarchical processing, and
the primary mechanism of synchrony is robust to the eﬀects
of non-linearities and statistical variations that deviate from
Gaussianideals.
9.2 Comparisons and further
considerations
Ourproposalbuildsuponandextendsearlierconceptsofbrain
functionandorganization.
We have earlier mentioned adherence to the “good regulator
theorem,” which requires control systems to model what is
controlled and allows for interacting and collaborative control
subsystems. The classical Hebbian concept of phase sequences and
cellassemblies( Hebb,1949)couldbeexpressedintermsofcoupled
spatial eigenmodes. The same notion of self-organization into
dynamic groups of neurons with partial computational autonomy,
bounded by surrounding Markov blankets, is expressed in the
NeuronalPacketHypothesis( YuﬁkandFriston,2016 ;Yuﬁk,2019).
The present view posits that minimization of prediction error is a
universalprincipleintheinteractionsofanypairofneurons,aswell
asinemergentgroupswithmirrorsymmetry.
The development of this skeletal concept of neural function
into a more comprehensive model of brain function is beyond
the scope of this paper; however, areas of interest include, ﬁrstly,
the interactions between limbic/neocortical systems. Functional
correspondences between the structural model and alerting,
surprise,habituation,andsleephavebeenanalyzedby Tuckeretal.
(2022), Tucker and Luu (2021, 2023), Luu and Tucker (2023),
Luu et al. (2024), and Tucker et al. (2025). The activation and
regulatoryrolesoflimbiccomponents,positionedastheyareatthe
roots of neocortical development and therefore at the crossroads
of signal control, oﬀer a guide to the way the old brain and new
brain collaborate in the development toward increasing agency.
By minimizing the risk of fatal outcomes, they would inﬂuence
overall “policy” and, in maneuvering toward optimum adjustment
of limbic and neocortical components, would be executing active
inference (Ramstead et al., 2021; Kavi et al., 2025). Moreover, the
roleofsleepproposedinthesemodelsdrawsupontheresemblance
to Hinton’s “dreaming” networks (earlier cited) and the idea of
self-organization through the maximization of synchrony in the
presenceofnoise,withnoiseandhighdegreesoffreedomassisting
movement toward stable basins of attraction. This aligns with the
present model’s essentially steady-state dynamics, characterized by
convergenceafterperturbationtowardmaximumsynchrony.
Secondly, the interaction of cortical areas, e.g., Yeo networks
(Yeo et al., 2011), requires explanation. High asymmetry in the
mirror matching of many areas would limit their demarcation via
unstable Markov blankets, not only due to the conformation of
their boundaries and connections, but also to the mismatching
of spatial frequencies resulting from diﬀering ﬁber ranges for
cells in diﬀerent areas. This would result in relatively weak
coupling between some cortical areas vs. others. Such relative
isolation between cortical areas might account for cortical
areaspecializations.
Finally, the idea of the brain being organized into systems
withmirrorsymmetriesinvitescomparisonwiththeroleofmirror
neurons (Bonini et al., 2022). Since mirror neurons show that the
neuronsofindividualswatchingotherindividualsrespondasifthe
observer were experiencing the other’s sensations and actions, it
mightbethoughtthattheterm“mirror”maybemerelyalinguistic
link. This is not necessarily the case. The internal generation of
mirror neuron activity might itself arise as an imposition upon
mirroringofsensoryvs.motoractivitywithinthe“host.”Ifso,then
there is scope for extending the concept of mirroring more widely
than just the individual and the immediate environment, but also
totheworldofinterpersonalandsocialinteractions.
9.3 Testing against connectomic data
The occurrence of approximate mirror symmetries at
spinal and telencephalic levels is readily apparent, as is the
mirroring between cortical areas by cortico-cortical ﬁbers. To
a ﬁrst approximation, the existence of mirror symmetries is
uncontroversial—but a critical proposition requiring testing
is that superﬁcial patch connections project to shorter axon
cells within columnar-sized areas in a manner analogous to the
projection of a Euclidean plane onto a Möbius strip. The existence
of such structural order is theoretically required for topographic
consistency in signal exchanges, and the possible existence of
this hypothetical structure is already supported by a range of
indirect observations. Three-dimensional schematic diagrams
reconstructing the expected connectivity are given inWright and
Bourke(2024b).
Itisnecessarytoshowthatamongthemanysparselyconnected
neurons within a column, patch cells with somas diametrically
opposite across any column make synaptic connections in arcs
radiating outwards from the central OP singularity and do so
over superimposed arcs outwards from the singularity in surface
view—but, crucially, that opposite patch cells project to closely
interpenetrating, but separate, systems of local cells. This should
applysystematicallytoallpatchcellgroupsaroundeachsingularity
and should hold for each patch cell’s connections to all columns in
thevicinity.
Testing hypotheses in this way faces considerable diﬃculty,
particularly with data from small animals or in cortical data
obtained from non-columnar cortex. In these cases, the analysis
mustdealwiththeinterpenetrationofthehypotheticalcolumns,as
well as the intertwining of local connections within each column.
Data for the mouse brain obtained in the MICrONS Project (The
MICrONS Consortium, 2025) have a suitable resolution; however,
since the mouse is small, the connectivity to be analyzed will
face the problem of interpenetration. Mosaic-like connectivity

surrounding the line of minicolumns is revealed in the MICrONS
mouse data (Miyashita, 2025). This corresponds to the anticipated
interweavingofcellsfoundwithverticalelectrodepenetrations(see
Section 6.4), but explicit consideration has not been given to patch
cellsinrelationtotheinterwovenlocalcellsintheconnectomedata.
An easier test case would require data from the columnar visual
cortexofalargemammal.
