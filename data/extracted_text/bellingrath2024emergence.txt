Abstract
The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized
mechanism by which the ‘width’ of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-
modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the
emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration
estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep
parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described
dynamics on a computational level. Two ‘biases’ (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge
from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the
compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory
consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states
of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic
and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a
unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the
respective domains. This concerns – next to more general scale-invariant effects of explicit timing and
central tendency effects – the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-
states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational
theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the
subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes,
subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational
mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.
1. Introduction
‘Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river.’ (Borges,
1962)
Has time ever seemed to pass by too quickly? Have moments ever seemed like an eternity? While the
subjective experience of time seems as prevalent as the experience of change, the experience of the
subjective present is not simply the experience of change, or change of change, etc. (Kent and
Wittmann 2021). Our experience of the subjective temporal Now is the experience of an extended
moment, a specious present (James 1890), extending retrospectively to the moments that just
happened, and prospectively to the moments that are predicted to subsequently arise. Historically,
estimates for the ‘width’ of a subjective temporal moment range back over the centuries, with the
Buddhist Treasury of Abhidharma, for example, estimating there to be 65 temporal moments in the
time it takes to snap ones fingers – with the ‘width’ of the subjective temporal Now thereby becoming
about 1/65 of a second (i.e. about 15 milliseconds) (Thompson 2014). Essentially, physical time just is,
and does not extend in the subjective sense. Accordingly, the ‘width’ of subjective temporality cannot
be perceptually inferred but must be the consequence of a counterfactual inference process (i.e.
prospective or retrodictive inferences), entertained at a given moment of physical time.
Counterfactual self-simulations constitute one possibility for this inferential process – indeed, at least
in the normal waking state, there is always someone flowing in the temporal river. Mirroring this
phenomenology, numerous empirical connections between temporal inference and self-modelling
have been discovered. For instance, signals from the heart cycle and timing responses in a duration
reproduction task are characterized by a certain synchrony (Pollatos, Yeldesbay, et al. 2014).
Additionally, the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential is associated with the length of the
estimated durations (Khoshnoud et al. 2024; Richter and Ibáñez 2021); and individuals which
demonstrate a higher interoceptive accuracy (i.e. individuals that are more accurate at counting the
number of heartbeats during a given internal) show a better performance in duration reproduction
tasks (Meissner and Wittmann 2011). Consistent with these studies suggesting the existence of a
system-relative temporal reference frame, neuroimaging meta-analyses reveal both self-modelling
and temporal inference as centrally implicated in insula functioning (for a meta-analysis on self-
modelling, see e.g. Qin, Wang, and Northoff 2020; for meta-analyses on temporal inference, see
Mondok and Wiener 2023; Naghibi et al. 2023). This is consistent with earlier proposals of the insula
cortex as, on the one hand, the neuronal substrate of subjective time perception (Craig 2009) and the
conscious feeling of presence (Seth et al. 2012); and, on the other hand, the neuronal substrate of
2
interoceptive inference and self-modelling (e.g. Seth 2013; Seth and Friston 2016). Moreover,
subjective time perception and the conscious feeling of presence have been already – by these very
accounts – tied to the ‘material me’ (Craig 2009) and self-modelling and agency more generally (Seth,
Suzuki, and Critchley 2012). Psychologically, furthermore, various normal (e.g. (Rey et al. 2017;
Witowska, Schmidt, and Wittmann 2020)) and altered (for a review see (Wittmann 2015)) states,
traits, and psychopathological conditions (e.g. Kent, Nelson, and Northoff 2023; Martin et al. 2014)
are associated with covariant changes in self-modelling and temporal inference. These states and
traits include – as will be reviewed and explained below – amongst others, varying levels of valence,
impulsivity, boredom, the flow-state, near-death experiences, the intentional-binding effect, and
concentrated states of deep meditative absorption. Consistently, many of these temporality-
modulating constructs are related to functional activation, and structural alterations, in the insula
cortex (for a review in the context of psychopathologies, for instance, see (Vicario et al. 2020)). While
this covariation, holding across levels of description, methods, tasks, and theoretical perspectives, is
too close for a coincidence to be likely, a theory explicitly relating self-modelling and temporal
inference – in the sense of one being emergent from the other – has been lacking. The self-
simulational theory of temporal extension (SST) is a theory about the emergence of the ‘width’ of
subjective temporality from processes of self-modelling; formalized with information-theory and
formulated on a neuronally plausible level of description (Bellingrath 2023). Importantly, temporal
inference is conceptually and functionally not unidimensional (e.g. (Binder 2024; Dainton 2010; Pöppel
1997; Singhal and Srinivasan 2021; Wittmann 2011); comprising, in the current context, (i) the ‘width’
of subjective temporality (i.e. the ‘length’ of the present moment); (ii) the felt (speed of the) passage
of temporality; and (iii) explicit duration inferences. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy
principle (FEP) (Friston 2010) will be assumed, to cast the emergence of (i) the ‘width’ of subjective
temporality, along with (iii) a hierarchical Bayesian mechanism for duration-estimation, from first
principles of the physics of self-organization. Reports on (ii) the felt passage of time are assumed to
correspond to varying duration estimations; with a ‘faster’ felt passage of time corresponding to
smaller estimated durations, and a ‘slower’ passage of time corresponding to longer estimated
durations. The first part of this paper will – after a section introducing the FEP and active inference
(the corollary process theory of the FEP) – be concerned with a computational level description of the
‘width’ of subjective temporality and hierarchical duration estimation. In the second part of this paper,
the described dynamics are simulated with a deep parametric generative model of temporal
inference. Two empirically documented ‘biases’ (i.e. variations) of time experience will be shown to
naturally emerge from the simulation of the computational model. In the third part of this paper,
empirical evidence on systematic variations of temporal experience from diverse psychological states,
3
traits, and psychopathological conditions will be explained, based on active inference accounts
mapping onto the respective domains. This deployment of mutual constraints between
phenomenological, computational, neuronal and behavioural levels of description is historically and
methodologically in line with the neurophenomenological research program outlined by Francisco
Varela (1996), which has recently – based upon integration with the free energy principle and active
inference – been revived in terms of the nascent field of computational (neuro-)phenomenology
(Sandved-Smith et al. 2024; Ramstead et al. 2022).
2. Introduction to the free energy principle and active inference
If things exist, what must they do? Specifically, how can self-organizing systems, or things, “maintain
their states and form in the face of a constantly changing environment” (Friston 2010)? This question
is attempted to be answered by the free energy principle (FEP), with active inference as a corollary
process theory being resultant (e.g. Clark 2013, 2015; Friston et al. 2023; Hohwy 2013; Parr, Pezzulo,
and Friston 2022). Originally proposed within the context of theoretical neuroscience as a unified brain
theory (Friston 2010), accounting for perception, attention, action, and numerous phenomena in
between, the explanatory scope of the FEP has been expanded to include every thing (Friston 2019).
But what does it mean to be a thing in the first place?
A thing can be characterized via the notion of a Markov blanket (Pearl 1998). A Markov blanket, 𝑏, is
the set of states that separate the internal parts of a system, 𝜇, from its surrounding environment, 𝑥.
Intuitively, for the brain, internal (neural) states are statistically insulated from external objects by
sensory receptors and muscles. This is a statement of conditional independence: Given knowledge of
the blanket, internal and external states are conditionally independent – any influence that 𝜇 or 𝑥
have on one another, are mediated by 𝑏 (Parr, Da Costa, and Friston 2019):
𝜇 ⊥ 𝑥 | 𝑏 ⟺ 𝑝(𝜇,𝑥|𝑏) = 𝑝(𝜇|𝑏)𝑝(𝑥|𝑏)
This enables us to speak about both the system we seek to characterize, as well as its surrounding
environment, as entities, or things, with independent existence. To remain in their characteristic low
entropy state, however, things must minimize the model-conditional improbability of impinging
sensory data – known as surprise, ℑ(𝑦) (Friston 2010). This is because entropy, 𝐻[𝑃(𝑦)], is the long-
term average of surprise, 𝔼 [ℑ(𝑦)]:
𝑃(𝑦)
4
𝐻[𝑃(𝑦)]= 𝔼 [ℑ(𝑦)]= −𝔼 [𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦)]
𝑃(𝑦) 𝑃(𝑦)
Mathematically, the minimization of surprise is equivalent to the maximization of model-evidence,
𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦), enabling a formulation of systemic preservation in terms of Bayesian inference (i.e. self-
evidencing (Hohwy 2016)). However, as exact Bayesian inference is usually computationally
intractable, as there are many hidden states that all need marginalizing out, the intractable quantities
(the model-evidence, 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦), and the posterior probability, 𝑃(𝑥|𝑦), are substituted with quantities
that approximate them (the variational free energy, 𝐹[𝑄,𝑦], and the approximate posterior, 𝑄(𝑥),
(i.e. the recognition distribution)) (Parr et al. 2022). Accordingly, the minimization of variational free
energy is equivalent to the maximization of model evidence, 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦), while simultaneously minimizing
the KL-divergence, 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑥)||𝑃(𝑥|𝑦)], of the approximate posterior, 𝑄(𝑥), from the posterior
𝐾𝐿
probability, 𝑃(𝑥|𝑦). Variational free energy, 𝐹[𝑄,𝑦], is equivalent to surprise, − 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦), if this
divergence is zero (i.e. free energy is an upper bound on surprise) (Parr et al. 2022):
𝐹[𝑄,𝑦]= 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑥)||𝑃(𝑥|𝑦)]− 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦)
𝐾𝐿
This enables a perspective on the emergence of genuinely inferential architectures from nothing but
systemic preservation itself (e.g. Friston et al. 2017). For example, in active inference, the minimization
of 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑥)||𝑃(𝑥|𝑦)] corresponds to perception and the maximization of 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑦) corresponds to
𝐾𝐿
action (i.e. selectively sampling and changing the world to conform to prior expectations about it)
(Parr et al. 2022). Considering a simple generative model of Bayesian perceptual inference (see Figure
1), the likelihood mapping from hidden causes to their outcomes, 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠), is inverted using prior
beliefs, 𝐷, and sensory data, 𝑜, giving the perceptual inference of hidden causes given outcomes,
𝑃(𝑠|𝑜). The likelihood mapping, 𝐴 (i.e. 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)), is equipped with a precision term, 𝛾 , by
𝐴
exponentiating each element in the 𝑖th row and 𝑗th column of 𝐴 by 𝛾 and normalizing (Parr et al.
𝐴
2018). This precision-weighting is understood in terms of attentional processes (Feldman and Friston
2010). A higher precision-weighting maps onto an increased attentional resource-allocation, with
faster and more reliable inferences being resultant (e.g. Sandved-Smith et al. 2021).

prior over hidden states is combined with sensory data to infer the posterior over hidden states given observations. Here,
Bayesian beliefs are noted in bold, bar notation represents posterior beliefs, 𝜎 is the softmax function (returning a
normalized probability distribution), and 𝛿 is the Kronecker delta function (returning 1 for the observed outcome and zero
for all non-observed outcomes). The precision term, 𝛾 , over the likelihood mapping, 𝐴, is sampled from a gamma
𝐴
distribution with inverse temperature parameter 𝛽 . For the derivation of the precision belief update equation see (Parr and
𝐴
Friston 2017) (supplementary appendix A.2); for the derivation of the latent state belief update equation, see (Friston et al.
2017b) (supplementary appendix A). By convention in the active inference literature, the ‘dot’ notation is used to represent
a backwards matrix multiplication and renormalization when applied to a matrix A of shape (m, n) and a set x of n
probabilities, i.e. A· x = y, where y is a normalized set of m probabilities such that Ay = x (Friston et al. 2017). Figure and parts

While variational free energy enables inferences about the future based on past data, it does not yet
account for prospective forms of inference (i.e. planning as inference (Botvinick and Toussaint 2012))
over extended timescales based on anticipated future consequences (Figure 2). Counterfactual
simulations of sequences of actions (i.e. policies, 𝜋), associated with expected future observations
under those policies, are evaluated in terms of expected free energy, 𝐺(𝜋) (Friston et al. 2015).
Mathematically, the minimization of 𝐺(𝜋) is equivalent to the minimization of the divergence of the
outcomes expected under a policy from the outcomes phenotypically expected (i.e. risk),
𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]; while simultaneously minimizing ambiguity, 𝔼 [𝐻[𝑃(𝑦̃|𝑥̃)]] (i.e. the
𝐾𝐿 𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)
expected inaccuracy due to an ambiguous mapping between states and outcomes) (Parr et al. 2022):
6
𝐺(𝜋)= 𝔼 [𝐻[𝑃(𝑦̃|𝑥̃)]]+ 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋) 𝐾𝐿
𝐺(𝜋) can also be decomposed in terms of epistemic and pragmatic value, with epistemic value,
𝔼 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑥̃|𝑦̃,𝜋)||𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)], corresponding to the amount of information expected to be gained
𝑄(𝑦̃,𝑥̃|𝜋) 𝐾𝐿
under the pursuit of a particular policy, and pragmatic value, 𝔼 [𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)], being an expected
𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)
utility:
𝐺(𝜋)= −𝔼 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑥̃|𝑦̃,𝜋)||𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)]−𝔼 [𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
𝑄(𝑦̃,𝑥̃|𝜋) 𝐾𝐿 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)
As the only self-consistent belief for a system which minimizes variational free energy is that it, in fact,
minimizes variational free energy, policies evaluated in terms of low 𝐺(𝜋) are a priori more likely to
be enacted. Equivalently, policies which have a high 𝐺(𝜋) are a priori surprising – which leads to their
avoidance (Friston et al. 2015). Essentially, free energy minimizing systems come equipped with prior
preferences, 𝐶: These prior beliefs assign high probabilities to observations that are preferred to be
obtained. For example, human beings probabilistically expect their blood-glucose level to be in a
phenotypically beneficial range. By probabilistically presupposing prior preferences, 𝐶, and by then
acting to bring them about (as enabled by the selection of actions in terms of 𝐺(𝜋), influenced by 𝐶),
self-organizing systems self-evidence (Hohwy 2016) as adaptive self-fulfilling prophecies (Friston
2011). Selected policies are also influenced by a baseline prior over policies, 𝐸, which can be
understood in terms of the influence of habits (i.e. what the agent would do independent of 𝐺(𝜋)).
For detailed introductions to active inference see (Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston 2022; Smith, Friston, and
Whyte 2022; see also Friston et al. 2017).
The FEP and active inference present a parsimonious framework for computational phenomenology
(Sandved-Smith et. al. 2024.; Ramstead et al. 2022). Indeed, many phenomenologically and
computationally central phenomena, such as self-modelling (Limanowski and Blankenburg 2013),
attention (Feldman and Friston 2010), valence (Hesp et al. 2021), and meta-awareness (Sandved-
Smith et al. 2021), have already been understood in terms of the FEP and active inference. This
includes excellent work on subjective time experience (Albarracin et al. 2023; Bogotá and Djebbara
2023; Hohwy, Paton, and Palmer 2016; Parvizi-Wayne 2024; Wiese 2017).

3. Subjective temporality as inference
‘In this account one’s body is processed in a Bayesian manner as the most likely to be “me”’ (Apps
and Tsakiris 2014)
Self-modelling is a complex multidimensional process ranging across various experiential domains;
with self-modelling comprising interoceptive, emotional, and bodily aspects, next to social,
intentional, narrative and more broadly cognitive aspects (e.g. Metzinger 2003). The minimally
sufficient form of phenomenal self-modelling is known as minimal phenomenal selfhood (MPS)
(Blanke and Metzinger 2009). MPS is the simplest form of self-consciousness. In its original
formulation, MPS comprised three necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) global self-identification
with the body as a whole, (2) spatiotemporal self-location, and (3) a (weak) first-person perspective
8
(Blanke and Metzinger 2009). In the following – and even though SST is also compatible with MPS
being a cluster-concept without a central individuating essence – current functional level descriptions
of self-modelling will be presented in the broader context of MPS (for a review on minimal self-
modelling and the FEP, see (Limanowski and Blankenburg 2013)). This will illustrate how subjective
temporal experience emerges in the context of the simplest forms of self-modelling.
Self-identification (with the body as a whole; the first condition of MPS) is the consequence of a
transparent inferential format (Blanke and Metzinger 2009; Metzinger 2003). An inference is
transparent if the system is unable to attend to the process of construction of that inference. Precisely
by not being able to introspectively notice that a given inference is, in fact, constructed, the inference
is imbued with a transparent, or “naïve realistic”, status. Conversely, if the system can direct its
attention to the process of construction of a given inference, that inference can be inspected opaquely
as ‘just a construct’ (i.e. ‘just a thought’) (Metzinger 2003). The opacification of a transparent
inferential format, is, in active inference, understood in terms of the deep parametric architecture of
hierarchical generative models (Limanowski and Friston 2018; Sandved-Smith et al. 2021) – with
‘parametric depth’ referring to a nested architecture of ‘beliefs about beliefs’ (Hesp et al. 2021). Here,
the precision-weighting, 𝛾 , of the likelihood, 𝐴 (i.e. 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠)), corresponds to a central aspect of the
𝐴
process of construction of a given probabilistic inference. Accordingly, the process of construction of
a hierarchically lower level probabilistic inference can be inspected by predicting its precision-
weighting and inferred state via an inference on a hierarchically higher level – with an opaque
inferential format of the hierarchically lower level inference being resultant (Limanowski and Friston
2018; Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). Transparency (i.e. ‘naïve realism’) is the default inferential format
(Metzinger 2003) – as evidenced both phenomenologically and by the computational cost
opacification (i.e. the additional presence of inferences on a hierarchically higher level) engenders.
Interestingly, complete intentional opacification is logically impossible, because the highest-order
inference is necessarily transparent – its precision-weighting and inferred state would have to be
predicted by yet another higher-order prediction, which leads to an infinite regress of hierarchical
height (Limanowski and Blankenburg 2013). Expressed in the words of (Friston, Thornton, and Clark
2012): “I can never conceive of what it is like to be me, because that would require the number of
recursions I can physically entertain, plus one”. While the global self-identification with the body as a
whole (the first condition of MPS) can be understood in terms of a transparent inferential format of
the body-representation (Blanke and Metzinger 2009), empirical evidence from asomatic out-of-body
experiences and bodiless dreams suggests that a global self-identification with a body is not a
necessary feature of MPS, as in these states, self-identification occurs without a global body-
9
representation (e.g. self-identification as an extensionless point in space) (Alcaraz-Sánchez et al. 2022;
Alvarado 2000; Metzinger 2013b). The second condition in the original formulation of MPS,
spatiotemporal self-location (Blanke and Metzinger 2009), refers to a representation of a determinate
volume in a spatial frame of reference, normally localized within the bodily boundaries as represented,
alongside the represented ‘Now’ in a temporal frame of reference (from this conceptual perspective,
MPS presupposes (a minimal degree of) temporal “width”; with the latter – as will be detailed below
– emerging from subpersonal (i.e. sub-MPS) dynamics of aspects of self-modelling, accordingly). A
weak first-person perspective, the third and last necessary condition of MPS, is a purely geometric
feature of self-modelling, which functions as the geometric origin, or centre of projection, of the
embodied system (Blanke and Metzinger 2009). While the weak first-person perspective was originally
tied to perceptual processing (e.g. visuospatial- or auditory-processing) (Blanke and Metzinger 2009),
the weak first-person perspective has also been understood completely independently of perceptual
processing (Windt 2010).
Functionally, in term of Bayesian inference, (Metzinger 2013b) identifies the origin of the first-person
perspective not with a specific inferential content – but rather with the systemic region of maximal
invariance. Indeed, the very existence of the agentic model mandates the inclusion of the prior
expectation that its form and internal states are contained within some invariant set (Friston, 2011).
As (Friston 2011) writes: “This is easy to see by considering the alternative: If the agent (model)
entailed prior expectations that it will change irreversibly, then (as an optimal model of itself), it will
cease to exist in its present state. Therefore, if the agent (model) exists, it must a priori expect to
occupy an invariant set of bounded states (cf., homeostasis)”. The hierarchically highest (i.e. maximally
invariant) inference – the belief that “I am a cause in the world, or an agent” (Hohwy and Michael,
2017) – is thereby equivalent to the belief that “I act to maintain myself in certain states” (Hohwy and
Michael, 2017) – i.e. the prior preferences. As elaborated above, prior preferences, denoted by 𝐶,
specify phenotypically expected outcomes, 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶), such as the expected blood-sugar level, or the
expected socio-emotional situatedness, and it is precisely the systemic presupposition of the prior
preferences that engenders their adaptive actualization akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy (Friston
2011). “Given the important links between the notion of priors and the conditions that undergird an
organism’s existence, we can also say that in Active Inference, the identity of an agent is isomorphic
with its priors” (Parr et al. 2022).
Self-modelling, however, is not unidimensional. In counterfactual inferences (i.e. in prospectively
predicting or retrodictively recalling) – for the transient time the simulated episode persists – it is an
aspect of our self-model that is being simulated (Friston 2018; Limanowski and Friston 2020). This
10
aspect of our self-model ‘lives through’ the simulated action sequence, being confronted with the
‘outcomes that would result if I were to act this way’ (i.e. 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)). This is the domain of mind-
wandering (Smallwood and Schooler 2015), episodic memory (Tulving 2002), planning as inference
(Botvinick and Toussaint 2012), and related notions that centrally comprise self-relational inferences
in counterfactuality. Indeed, it has even been suggested that it is precisely the change in the unit of
identification that could serve to individuate individual episodes of mind-wandering (Metzinger
2013a). Owing to the generality of the computational problem that these counterfactual inferences
(i.e. policies) are engendered to solve (i.e. minimization of expected free energy), policy-simulations
are a virtually all-prevalent aspect of our inferential architecture, being present over nested
timescales, different levels of hierarchical height, and in diverse inferential domains (e.g. Badcock,
Friston, and Ramstead 2019; Friston et al. 2017; Pezzulo, Rigoli, and Friston 2018).
Motivationally, the outcomes expected under a counterfactual self-simulation, 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋), are always
evaluated in terms of a comparison (i.e. dissimilarity-relation) with phenotypically preferred
outcomes, 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶). Intuitively, ‘what could’ is always motivationally evaluated in terms of a
comparison with ‘what ought’. In active inference, this dissimilarity-relation between 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋) and
𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶) is expressed with the KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler 1951), a central concept in
information-theory. The divergence of 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋) from 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶), 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)], constitutes part
𝐾𝐿
of the expected free energy, 𝐺(𝜋), decomposed in terms of risk (i.e. 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]) and
𝐾𝐿
ambiguity (i.e. 𝔼 [𝐻[𝑃(𝑦̃|𝑥̃)]]), in terms of which policies are evaluated (Parr et al. 2022):
𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)
𝐺(𝜋)= 𝔼 [𝐻[𝑃(𝑦̃|𝑥̃)]]+ 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋) 𝐾𝐿
Self-simulational dissimilarity-relation
As elaborated above, 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋) and 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶) are computational level descriptions of aspects of self-
modelling. Expressed from the transparent perspective of self-modelling itself, 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
𝐾𝐿
corresponds to the ‘change that would have to happen for (a part of) me to become that other (part
of) me’. The central claim of the self-simulational theory of temporal extension is that this self-
simulational dissimilarity-relation is identical to the ‘width’ of subjective temporality: The subjective
extension of time is equivalent to the lived experience of the ‘length of the way towards another
version of yourself’.
𝑇 = 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
ℕ𝕠𝕨 𝐾𝐿
11
Mathematically, by virtue of the properties of the KL-divergence, 𝑇 cannot be negative (i.e.
ℕ𝕠𝕨
𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)] ≥ 0). Indeed, it is not even clear what a ‘negative width’ of the subjective
𝐾𝐿
temporal Now could mean in principle. Crucially, physical time just is, and does not extend, as
subjective time does. Accordingly, because the ‘width’ of subjective temporality cannot be
perceptually inferred, 𝑇 must be the consequence of a counterfactual inference, entertained at a
ℕ𝕠𝕨
given moment of physical time. Because 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋) (i.e. ‘what would result, if I were to act this way’) is a
counterfactual inference, it neither unfolds in the three-dimensional space available for external
action, nor in the n-dimensional space available for internal (attentional) action. However, a given
counterfactual self-simulation could, if selected (in terms of 𝐺(𝜋)) be enacted in those spaces.
Accordingly, because a counterfactual self-simulation could be instantiated in the three- (and n-)
dimensional space of bodily and mental actions, and because it is evaluated in terms of a dissimilarity-
relation, 𝑇 , of how far it diverges from this instantiation, it extends in a distinct dimension of self-
ℕ𝕠𝕨
simulational counterfactuality, anchored on these spaces. Extension in a counterfactual dimension is
however simply what an inference of the ‘width’ of subjective temporality conceptually presupposes
– hence the proposed mechanism. 𝑇 varies – for some policies, 𝑇 might be very small – with
ℕ𝕠𝕨 ℕ𝕠𝕨
subjective time being barely extended at all (i.e. temporal contraction). For other policies, 𝑇 might
ℕ𝕠𝕨
be larger – corresponding to a ‘wider’ temporal Now (i.e. temporal dilation). Furthermore, subjective
temporality – as opposed to other inferences, such as the mental number line – is extended not only
in a “cognitive”, or opaque, sense, but in an immediate, transparent, felt sense (Metzinger 2003; Seth
et al. 2012). Essentially, transparency is the default inferential format, being both phenomenologically
evident and entailed by the computational cost opacification (i.e. the additional presence of
inferences on a hierarchically higher level) engenders (Limanowski and Friston 2018; Metzinger 2003).
Accordingly, it is precisely because introspective attention is not turned towards the process of
construction of the subjective temporal Now, that we simply live within it without realizing its
inferential nature – with its extension varying systematically across our experience.
Using the tools of information-geometry (e.g. Amari 2016), the asymmetric KL-divergence can –
assuming infinitesimally small changes of the parameters, 𝜃 – be interpreted in terms of the symmetric
Fisher information, 𝛪(𝜃) – a Riemannian metric of a statistical manifold, 𝛭 (i.e. a space of probability-
distributions) – thereby providing a genuine metric. This is possible because by measuring the
divergence over an infinitesimally small change, 𝑑𝜃, a second-order Taylor series expansion becomes
sufficient for its characterization; and 𝛪(𝜃) is the Hessian matrix of the KL-divergence (Da Costa, and
Friston 2019; Friston 2019). After integrating over a path in 𝛭 (obtaining the traversed length in the
12
statistical manifold), we can take a derivative with respect to (external) time: yielding, in this context,
the idealized concept of an instantaneous relative measure of subjective and objective time, ℛ(𝑡):

In a non-idealized setting (i.e. not presupposing the computation of an infinite number of 𝐷 over
𝐾𝐿
infinitesimally small parameter changes), explicit Bayesian duration inference can be cast as a
hierarchically higher level, that takes
𝑛
∑𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋 )||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]
𝐾𝐿 𝑖
𝑖=1
from 𝑛 policy-evaluations as evidence. This enables, given variance over 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋 )||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)], on
𝐾𝐿 𝑖
average a more reliable inference of temporal durations as 𝑛 increases. Durations are overestimated
following temporal moments that are very extended, or ‘wide’, and underestimated for ‘shallower’,
or fewer, temporal moments. The Bayesian nature of this inference-scheme directly enables an
account of Vierordt’s law (the central-tendency effect): Participants in temporal reproduction tasks
overproduce shorter durations and underproduce longer durations (for reviews, see Gu and Meck
2011; Lejeune and Wearden 2009). In line with Bayesian frameworks of timing generally (e.g. Shi,
Church, and Meck 2013), this central-tendency effect can be explained by the influence of the
(acquired) hierarchically higher level duration inference priors – with duration estimates being drawn
towards previously inferred interval-lengths. Furthermore – and owing to the presence of
hierarchically nested policy-simulations – duration inference unfolds over multiple hierarchical levels
and over multiple different timescales (Figure 3); thereby explaining scale-invariant effects in interval
timing experiments (e.g. the variability of the reproduced interval is proportional to the duration of
13
the interval (Ivry and Hazeltine 1995; Rakitin et al. 1998)) through the successive coarse-grainings of
the state-representations as hierarchical height increases (characteristic of generative models). For an
example of a deep generative model equipped with duration inference states see Figure 4.
Figure 3. A depiction of temporal duration inference across levels of hierarchical height, illustrated with two levels. The
temporal domain over which durations are inferred increases with the hierarchical height. On each hierarchical level,
∑𝑛 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)] is taken as evidence from 𝑛 policies simulated on the same level.
𝑖=1 𝐾𝐿 𝑖
Generally, empirically, self-modelling and temporal inferences covary too systematically for a
coincidence to be likely (see sections 1, 4 & 5). The self-simulational theory of temporal extension
explains this close covariation: subjective temporality emerges from self-modelling. Put
metaphorically, the ‘width’ of the subjective temporal Now is the ‘length of the way towards another
version of yourself’. The observations that are expected if a sequence of actions were enacted,
𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋), are evaluated relative to the observations that are phenotypically preferred, 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶); with
subjective time experience emerging from their dissimilarity-relation implicated by the never-ending
phenomenological pursuit of ‘that other me, where I would have finally reached my goal’.

levels (perceptual & attentional). Each hierarchical level is equipped with duration inference states. A more extensive
description of this kind of model-architecture can be found below. Adopted from a template given by (Sandved-Smith et al.

4. A deep parametric generative model of temporal inference
The following simulation of a deep parametric generative model will serve to illustrate the
computational dynamics of the ‘width’ of subjective temporality; demonstrating how two ‘biases’ (i.e.
variations) of temporal inference naturally emerge from this minimal model. The model-architecture
features two modifications from the deep generative model of mental action (Sandved-Smith et al.
2021), from which the use of the oddball-perceptual task (consisting of the presentation of either a
“standard” or a “deviant” stimulus, with the former being presented 19/20 and the latter 1/20 times)
15
has also been adopted. The generative model is composed of different hierarchical levels. The lowest
layer of the model is concerned with perceptual inference; specifically, with inferring whether the
presented stimulus is a deviant (i.e. oddball) stimulus or not, being equipped with a state-transition
matrix 𝐵(1). As described above, the precision-weighting, 𝛾 , of the likelihood, 𝐴, is understood in
𝐴
terms of attention (Feldman and Friston 2010). In this generative model, the precision-weighting of
the likelihood of the perceptual inference level is conditioned by hierarchically higher level attentional
states, which are in turn conditioned by attentional policies (Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). This is in
accord with work on attentional control as precision deployment (Brown, Friston, and Bestmann 2011;
Kanai et al. 2015). Faster and more reliable perceptual inferences are resultant from a higher
precision-weighting, whereas the agent attributes less reliability in their observations for a lower
precision-weighting; with the perceptual inference being slower to adjust. The hierarchically higher
level attentional states are “focused” and “distracted”. These attentional states are, just as the
perceptual states, inferred via variational inference and equipped with a state-transition matrix, 𝐵(2).
The attentional actions on the second hierarchical level are either “stay” or “switch”, where “stay”
leads the agent to remain in his current attentional state and “switch” flips the attentional state. The
attentional actions are chosen from attentional policies (also comprising “stay” or “switch”) based on
their expected free energy, 𝐺(𝜋). Actions are exclusively defined on this second hierarchical level,
conditioning the state-transition matrix 𝐵(2). The prior preferences, 𝐶(2), over attentional states are
set such that the agent prefers being in the state “focused”. This generative model (Figure 5) was
originally deployed as a generative model of mental action, modelling the dynamic attentional cycle
in meditative practices (for a more detailed description see Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). The original
model architecture (Sandved-Smith et al. 2021) has been modified in two distinct ways. These changes
concern (1) the sequentialization of policy-simulation, and (2) the incorporation of resource-sensitive
habitual control mechanisms. Specifically, while in the original model, the two distinct policies (‘stay’
and ‘switch’) were both simulated at each time-step, here, policy-simulation is sequentially unfolded
in time, such that, at each time-step, only one policy is (at most) simulated. Consistent with previous
extensions of active inference to resource-sensitive habitual control (Maisto, Friston, and Pezzulo
2019), policy-simulation is entirely absent at some time-steps. Specifically, first, if, at the end of a
simulation epoch (comprising the two policies ‘stay’ and ‘switch’ once, each), a policy is evaluated in
terms of a sufficiently low 𝐺(𝜋) (and thereby deemed sufficiently ‘good’), the next simulation epoch
is skipped entirely, with the selected policy being enacted for the next two time-steps. Intuitively,
‘once a sufficiently good plan has been found, there is no need to reconsider for a while’. Second, if
during each simulation epoch (the order of the two policies is alternated), the 𝐺(𝜋) of the first
simulated policy is sufficiently low (and, more specifically, also below the 𝐺(𝜋) of both policies from
16
the previous simulation epoch), the rest of the simulation epoch (i.e. the other policy) is skipped, with
the first policy being immediately enacted. This, too, amounts to the implicit assumption that
contingencies do not change significantly in the absence of policy-simulations (as deliberative control
would be more advantageous otherwise (Maisto et al. 2019)), and can also be understood as the agent
refraining from over-simulating possible policies, given that a sufficiently adaptive policy has already
been found, thereby saving significant resources. This is consistent with current perspectives on the
importance of resource-control for brain functioning (e.g. Barrett, Quigley, and Hamilton 2016). From
another perspective, this can be considered as simply another consequence of free-energy
minimization: Analogously to model-selection, non-necessary computations are avoided by the
removal of excessive parameters (FitzGerald, Dolan, and Friston 2014; Friston et al. 2017; Maisto et
al. 2019; Pezzulo, Rigoli, and Friston 2015). Furthermore, the decreased frequency of (sequential)
policy-simulations on the hierarchically higher level, with selected policies thereby being (on average)
enacted for a longer time, mirrors empirical evidence on the increase of intrinsic neuronal timescales
with the hierarchical height of the cortex (Friston et al. 2017; Golesorkhi et al. 2021; Kiebel, Daunizeau,
and Friston 2008; Murray et al. 2014).

simulation of policies, and their evaluation in terms of expected free energy, is omitted at some time-steps (see the text).

Strikingly, given the minimality of this generative model, two ‘biases’ (i.e. variations) of temporal
inference naturally emerge from the simulation. In cognitive psychology well-known, the intentional
binding effect (sometimes known as the temporal binding effect) refers to the compression of the
temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences; often
measured in terms of a direct interval estimation procedure (for a review see Moore and Obhi 2012).
Indeed, this covariation of temporal inference and self-modelling has been observed so reliably, that
intentional binding has been proposed as an implicit measure for the sense of agency (Haggard,
Aschersleben, et al. 2002; Haggard, Clark, and Kalogeras 2002; though see Suzuki et al. 2019 for
another perspective on intentional binding in terms of multisensory causal binding). As elaborated
above, and due to the free-energy minimizing resource-sensitive habitual control, if a policy is
evaluated in terms of a sufficiently low 𝐺(𝜋), the rest of the simulation epoch (comprising the
(alternating) second policy; ‘stay’ or ‘switch’) is skipped. 𝑇 (i.e. risk) mathematically constitutes,
ℕ𝕠𝕨
together with ambiguity, expected free energy, 𝐺(𝜋); in terms of which simulated policies are
evaluated. Accordingly, given the low 𝐺(𝜋) (implying a contracted 𝑇 ) of the selected policy, and
ℕ𝕠𝕨
the absence of policy-simulation (and -evaluation) for the rest of the epoch, the temporal interval
between voluntarily initiated actions and resulting sensory consequences is underestimated –
explaining the intentional binding effect (i.e. the intentional binding effect is a direct consequence of
a generic functional level description of resource-sensitive habitual control and SST under the FEP).
The emergence of the intentional binding effect is demonstrated in Figure 6 in terms of an increased
number of ‘congruent’ episodes – episodes where the simulation and selection of a policy occur at the
same time-step. This congruence implies, on average – because the simulated policy is "already good
enough" – a relatively decreased 𝑇 and relatively fewer subsequent policy simulations. In contrast,
ℕ𝕠𝕨
‘incongruent’ episodes – where a policy is not selected immediately upon its simulation – imply
(because of the increased 𝐺(𝜋)) a relatively increased 𝑇 , and more subsequent policy simulations.
ℕ𝕠𝕨
The generative model enables a computational account of alternating episodes of concentration and
distraction (Sandved-Smith et al. 2021) – characteristic of mindfulness meditation: Starting in a state
in which the agent is focused while also self-inferring its own attentional state to be focused; the agent
– reflecting the intrusion of all-too-frequent mind-wandering-episodes (Schooler et al. 2011;
Smallwood and Schooler 2015) – becomes distracted without inferring this very fact. Then, after a
period of being distracted without having noticed, the agent infers that it is distracted, leading to a
reallocation of attentional focus (Figure 6). Mindfulness meditation has traditionally (e.g. Anālayo
2003) and more repeatedly been associated with attenuations of self-referential processing (Dahl,
Lutz, and Davidson 2015; Milliere 2020; Tang, Hölzel, and Posner 2015; Wright 2017), being mirrored
18
on the neuronal level of description in terms of a reduced activity of a network of regions implicated
in mind-wandering and self-referential processing (e.g. Brewer et al. 2011). From the perspective of
active inference, the effects of meditation, and ‘selfless’ experiences generally, have been understood
in terms of a reduced frequency and a reduced counterfactual depth of policy-simulations (i.e. self-
simulations) (Laukkonen and Slagter 2021; Limanowski and Friston 2020).

In line with a rich tradition in eastern philosophy, alterations of temporal experience are attested in
deep states of meditative absorption (Metzinger 2024): A recent factor-analytic analysis of 1403
qualitative reports from meditators, directed at the experience of ‘pure awareness’ – an entirely non-
conceptual and contentless form of awareness as such (i.e. awareness of nothing but awareness) –
converged on a 12-factor model to describe the phenomenological character of these experiences in
a fine-grained way (Gamma and Metzinger 2021). The factor that explained most of the variance
(‘Time, Effort and Desire’) integrated goal-directedness, effort and temporal experience. Describing
the phenomenological profile of this factor in meditative experience, (Gamma and Metzinger 2021)
write: “Typically, there will be an attentional lapse, followed by the phenomenology of noticing,
remembering the goal state and re-focusing. As a result, temporal experience is preserved: for
example, we find the phenomenology of duration and of time passing”. This factor is positively
correlated with mind-wandering, memories, the simulation of future events, and the arising of
thoughts and feelings generally (Factor 7: ‘Thoughts and Feelings’). This association of temporal
experience with goal-directed counterfactual inferences is also evident in the generative model: The
‘width’ of subjective time experience (i.e. 𝑇 = 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]) varies characteristically,
ℕ𝕠𝕨 𝐾𝐿
dependent on the counterfactual observations expected under a given policy, 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋), evaluated in
terms of systemic goal states, 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶). Strikingly, evidence from these qualitative reports attests to
alterations of temporal experience that culminate in the limit in phenomenal states that are described
as atemporal (Metzinger 2024). However, because these states nevertheless often feature
experiences of change, it may be asked: “How can a physical system like the human brain create
conscious models of reality that, on a conceptual level, seem to necessitate paradoxical descriptions
like ‘timeless change’?” (Metzinger 2024). As can be seen in Figure 6 of the generative model of
temporal inference, perceptual states are inferred at each time-step – with the perceptual state
changing over time. However, while the perceptual state may change, policies are not computed at
each time-step. Crucially, because the existence of 𝑇 depends on the simulation of a policy
ℕ𝕠𝕨
(specifically, its evaluation in terms of 𝐺(𝜋)), 𝑇 is entirely absent if no policy is computed. In the
ℕ𝕠𝕨
generative model, furthermore, and consistent with the target phenomenon, the probability for
policies to not be computed increases in the focused attentional state. As elaborated above, this
reduced frequency of policy-simulation is consistent with active inference accounts of the effects of
meditation and ‘selfless’ experiences generally (Laukkonen and Slagter 2021; Limanowski and Friston
2020). Furthermore, the absence of deliberative control (i.e. the absence of policy-simulations), and
the concomitant absence of a feeling of effort (Factor 1 integrated effort and time (Gamma and
Metzinger 2021)), is consistent with an active inference account of effort – with effort being
constitutively dependent on the presence of policy-simulations (i.e. effort being absent in the absence
20
of policy-simulations) (Parr et al. 2023). Accordingly, as the computation of counterfactual policies
recedes more and more, the subjective temporal Now ceases to be constructed. A continuous flow of
perceptual states unfolds in an effortless and atemporal phenomenal state: Dynamic succession
without temporal extension – the specious present (James 1890) is not specious anymore.
“The early Dzogchen scholar–practitioners in Tibet knew all of this very well, but through their own
meditation practice: “Nowness” is empty” (Metzinger 2024)
5. Variations of the ‘width’ of the subjective moment
Psychologically, much is known concerning systematic variations of subjective time perception. While
probably everyone has experienced time slowing down in highly emotional moments, or speeding up
during pleasurable episodes of absorption, numerous systematic variations of temporal inference
have been described and experimentally tested in detail. This empirical evidence ranges from
transient situational factors to stable dispositional constructs – including variations of temporal
inference in diverse psychopathological conditions. Methodologically, and building on current
computational (active inference) accounts of the various temporality-modulating psychological
constructs, diverse branches of empirical evidence concerning variations of temporal inference will be
explained by domain-specific modulations of the information-theoretic structure corresponding to the
‘width’ of subjective temporality.
The extension of the subjective moment increases in negative experiences, with temporal durations
being overestimated. Experimentally, for instance, temporal durations are overestimated when
negative stimuli are expected (Ogden et al. 2015) or fear-inducing videos are seen (Pollatos, Laubrock,
and Wittmann 2014). Indeed, this association is so reliable, that even the reverse inference can be
empirically demonstrated: For (illusorily) shortened time-periods, an equally intense painful stimuli is
reported to be decreased in magnitude (Maia et al. 2023). This emerging picture, in which the
presence of negative valence covaries with temporal overestimations, has recently been meta-
analytically supported (Cui et al. 2023). To give another example, participants overestimate time when
their hand is immersed in water at painful, as opposed to neutral, temperatures; with increases in
pain perception covarying with increases in temporal overestimation (Rey et al. 2017). Put in the
words of the authors: “Being in pain reflects a deviation from homeostasis which threatens integrity
and prompts repeated conscious access to one’s self” (Rey et al. 2017). Whether it is a painful physical
21
sensation, a situation constraining possible behavioural options to non-desired outcomes, or whether
the constraints are largely internal and self-imposed, the dissimilarity between the outcomes
expected under simulated policies (‘what could come true, if a sequence of actions were performed’),
𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋), and the outcomes expected under prior preferences (‘what you prefer to observe’), 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶),
increases. Indeed, negative states might be conceptually individuated by nothing but a certain
difference between expectations of possible and preferred outcomes, holding across policy-
simulations, and over a given episode, as – by definition for negative experiences – ‘you just cannot
get what you want’ (for an active inference perspective on valence, see (Joffily and Coricelli 2013)).
Essentially, by SST, the ‘width’ of the subjective temporal moment, 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)], is itself
𝐾𝐿
nothing but this difference-relation. Accordingly, it is precisely this increased dissimilarity-relation
between possible and preferred outcomes, characterizing negative influences, that explains the
increased extension of the subjective moment in negatively-connotated circumstances; with
impressions of ‘moments feeling like eternities’ being resultant. This is also consistent with a
perspective offered by research on functional asymmetries in valence-processing, documenting a
deeper processing for negative stimuli across various domains (Alves, Koch, and Unkelbach 2017;
Baumeister et al. 2001). Computationally, these processing asymmetries might be manifested in terms
of an increased policy-simulation frequency and depth, necessitated because a policy evaluated in
terms of sufficiently low 𝐺(𝜋) is yet to be simulated – with an increased temporal ‘width’ being
resultant (𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)] is constitutive of 𝐺(𝜋)). Consistently, time is perceived to be ‘slower’
𝐾𝐿
in depression (for a meta-analysis see Thönes and Oberfeld 2015) and for advanced cancer patients
(van Laarhoven et al. 2011); and temporal overestimations occur in schizophrenia (for a meta-analysis,
see (Ueda, Maruo, and Sumiyoshi 2018)) and PTSD (Vicario and Felmingham 2018).
While variations in valence span across many psychological domains in which temporal processing is
altered, temporal inference is also – more specifically – modulated by impulsivity. This can be
parsimoniously explained by virtue of a domain-specific variation of the information-theoretic
structure corresponding to the ‘width’ of subjective temporality under a current active inference
account of impulsivity (Mirza et al. 2019). First, empirically, a meta-analysis of temporal inference in
attention-deficit hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) – a condition closely associated with increased levels
of impulsivity (e.g. Patros et al. 2015) – has shown that affected individuals overestimate time (Zheng
et al. 2022). Borderline personality disorder, too – being also coupled to heightened levels of
impulsivity (e.g. Links, Heslegrave, and Reekum 1999) – is related to a negatively felt expansion of time
(Mioni et al. 2020) and temporal overestimations (Berlin and Rolls 2004). Consistently, time is
overestimated during abstinence in tobacco use disorder (Miglin et al. 2017), with time passing more
22
slowly during withdrawal (Sayette et al. 2005). A similar trend has been shown in heroin users during
the withdrawal period (Aleksandrov 2005). Cocaine- and methamphetamine dependent individuals,
too, overestimate time to a degree that is correlated with their level of impulsivity (Wittmann et al.
2007) (for reviews on the relationship between time perception and impulsivity disorders, see
(Moreira et al. 2016; Paasche et al. 2019); see also (Wittmann and Paulus 2008)). Computationally,
one perspective on impulsivity is in terms of time-discounted prior-preferences (i.e. ‘selling the future
for the present’) (for an active inference account, see Mirza et al. 2019). Essentially, the steeper the
discounting of the prior preferences, the stronger the preference for rewards in the present,
discarding the future (for a review on smokers devaluing the future more than non-smokers, for
instance, see (Barlow et al. 2017); for a more general review on temporal discounting and unhealthy
behavior, see (Story et al. 2014)). Furthermore, the prior preferences may not only be more strongly
focused on the temporal proximity of the rewards, but also on a specific subset of outcomes (e.g.
being overly focused on obtaining a given addictive substance, relative to other rewards). Given this
‘narrowing’ (i.e. the reduction in the variance around temporally proximate and/or specific outcomes)
of the prior preferences, 𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶), is not mirrored (on average) by the outcomes expected under
simulated policies, 𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋), the latter are (on average) more divergent from the former. Accordingly,
the ‘width’ of subjective temporality, 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)], is, on average, increased for impulsive
𝐾𝐿
traits, with temporal overestimations being resultant – explaining the empirical evidence.
Furthermore, the passage of time is judged to be slower in acute episodes of boredom (e.g. Droit-
Volet, Monier, and Martinelli 2023; see also Danckert and Allman 2005). For example, for participants
shut in an empty room alone for 7.5 minutes, the experienced extent of boredom is associated with
the feeling of time passing more slowly (Witowska et al. 2020). Computationally, boredom has been
understood in terms of switching between exploitation and exploration: Tasks that are too easy
provoke boredom – signifying the transition from pragmatic action to novelty seeking (Danckert 2019;
Darling 2023; Gomez-Ramirez and Costa 2017; Parvizi-Wayne et al. 2023). Mathematically, if the
pragmatic value (i.e. 𝔼 [𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]) currently afforded by a given situation, decreases, 𝑇 (i.e.
𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋) ℕ𝕠𝕨
𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]) increases – explaining empirical evidence on an overly extended temporal
𝐾𝐿
moment in acute states of boredom. On the other hand, the flow-state (Csikszentmihalyi 1990) –
characterized by an increase in concentration on a task that is subjectively perceived as meaningful
and challenging, and a decrease of narrative self-modelling – has repeatedly been associated with a
fastened temporal experience (e.g. Im and Varma 2018; Rutrecht et al. 2021; for a meta-analysis see
Hancock et al. 2019). Indeed, participants even reverse infer having been in the flow-state, given that
they are (falsely) informed about much time having passed (Christandl, Mierke, and Peifer 2018).
23
Computationally, a recent active inference account explains the attenuation of narrative self-
modelling in flow-experiences by virtue of an exclusive attentional focus mandated by the challenging
nature of the task (Parvizi-Wayne et al. 2023). Furthermore, by this account, because the agent is, in
the flow-state, because of experience and training, already confident about the consequences of
actions, action-selection is primarily influenced by pragmatic (as opposed to epistemic) value.
Accordingly – and again because a high pragmatic value mathematically maps onto a small 𝑇 (i.e.
ℕ𝕠𝕨
a low 𝐷 [𝑄(𝑦̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑦̃|𝐶)]) – this explains the fastened temporal experience empirically attested in
𝐾𝐿
the flow-state. As a last empirical constraint, consider near-death experiences. In near-death
experiences, such as car-crashes or other accidents, the subjective temporal Now is reported to be
extended to such a degree that time subjectively “stands still” (Noyes and Kletti 1976). Indeed, how
could the predicted outcomes of a simulated policy be more divergent from prior preferences (with
the subjective temporal Now, 𝑇 , extending accordingly) than the expected outcomes of a policy
ℕ𝕠𝕨
where one is predicted to be dead, or potentially so?
6. Conclusion
Nothing in the physics of time corresponds to an extended moment in the subjective sense. This paper
has described – along with a mechanism of hierarchical Bayesian duration inference – how the ‘width’
of subjective temporality emerges as a transparent and counterfactual inference from the dynamics
of self-modelling, cast in terms of free energy minimization. Because a given counterfactual self-
simulation could, if selected, be instantiated in the three- (and n-) dimensional space of bodily (and
mental) actions, and because it is associated with a dissimilarity-relation, of how far it diverges from
this instantiation, it extends in a distinct dimension of self-simulational counterfactuality, anchored
on these spaces. But this transparent counterfactual extension is simply what an inference of
subjective temporal ‘width’ conceptually presupposes – hence the proposed mechanism. Another
theoretical constraint – next to transparency and counterfactuality – that is fulfilled by the proposed
mathematical structure is non-negativity: Intuitively, it is not even clear what a negative temporal
“width” could mean in principle. Following a simulation of a deep parametric generative model
illustrating the emergence of two empirically attested alterations of temporal inference (i.e. the
intentional binding effect & alterations of temporal experience in deep meditative states), numerous
systematic variations of temporal experience and biases of temporal inference have been explained
via the proposed mathematical structure. This concerns classic psychological effects such as scale-
invariant effects of timing and central-tendency effects; as well as variations of subjective temporal
24
experience across varying levels of valence, boredom, impulsivity, flow-states, near-death
experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. Across all these states, the explanatory
strategy has been the same: Demonstrating that current active inference accounts mapping onto the
respective states mathematically imply systematic variations of precisely that information-theoretic
structure that is – by SST – identical to subjective temporal “width” in precisely the direction that the
psychological evidence respectively indicates. This systematic covariation between the dynamics of
self-modelling and temporal inference is consistent with neuroimaging meta-analyses revealing both
self-modelling and temporal inference as centrally implicated in insula functioning (for a meta-analysis
on self-modelling, see e.g. Qin, Wang, and Northoff 2020; for meta-analyses on temporal inference,
see Mondok and Wiener 2023; Naghibi et al. 2023). The proposed self-simulational dissimilarity-
relation is epistemically parsimonious – not only because the computation of a dissimilarity-relation
between “what could” and “what ought” is psychologically all-prevalent, but also because the
corresponding mathematical structure is implied by variational free energy minimization. Concerning
states of minimal phenomenal experience (i.e. awareness of nothing but awareness) (Metzinger
2024), entirely atemporal (without a subjective temporal Now) and non-dual (without a phenomenal
self-model), SST describes how atemporality emerges as a consequence of non-duality – potentially
paving a way towards a deeper understanding of minimal phenomenal experience itself.
