This article proposes a new conceptual framework calledcol‑
lective predictive coding as a model of science (CPC‑MS) to formal‑
ize and understand scientific activities. Building on the idea
of CPC originally developed to explain symbol emergence,
CPC‑MS models science as a decentralized Bayesian inference
process carried out by a community of agents. The frame‑
work describes how individual scientists’ partial observations
and internal representations are integrated through commu‑
nication and peer review to produce shared external scientific
knowledge. Key aspects of scientific practice like experimenta‑
tion, hypothesis formation, theory development and paradigm
shifts are mapped onto components of the probabilistic graph‑
ical model. This article discusses how CPC‑MS provides in‑
sights into issues like social objectivity in science, scientific
progress and the potential impacts of artificial intelligence on
research. The generative view of science offers a unified way
to analyse scientific activities and could inform efforts to auto‑
mate aspects of the scientific process. Overall, CPC‑MS aims to
provide an intuitive yet formal model of science as a collective
cognitive activity.

1. Introduction
Science is a massive cooperative venture of mankind. Even though each person has limited observations
of natural phenomena, their own experience, perceptions and actions, we can integrate our knowl‑
edge through scientific communication and accumulate scientific knowledge throughout the global
human community. Science is a collective behaviour of humans, which explores the world in an active
manner. Meanwhile, science has its specific way of communication involving proposing hypotheses,
formulating theories, conducting experiments, writing papers, submitting them to journals and con‑
ferences, and performing peer reviews. While they have diversity depending on the specific scientific
field, most people believe that such scientific activities integrate our knowledge and lead us to better
understand the world. However, in what sense do the overall scientific activities bring us a model and
better understand the world? How can we improve the rules, regulations, games and habits in our sci‑
entific activities? To understand and improve scientific activity itself, a wide range of studies have been
undertaken, including philosophy of science; science, technology and society (STS) and science of science
[1–5]. Despite these efforts, we have not obtained an intuitive framework that models the total scientific
activities. A systematic understanding of science as a whole is also strongly called for in light of recent
changes in the scientific landscape, e.g. the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies [6] and
huge problems of research ethics including the replicability crisis [7]. This article proposes a new con‑
ceptual and computational framework of science based on the idea ofcollective predictive coding(CPC)
[8].
The CPC hypothesis was originally proposed to explain the phenomenon of symbol emergence [8–
10], namely, the process by which a shared system of symbols, such as language, arises and evolves
within a population of agents through their interactions with each other and the environment. The CPC
hypothesis extends the idea ofpredictive coding(PC) andfree‑energy principle (FEP) [11–15] to a group of
people and argues that we, humans, improve prediction capability by updating the symbol system, i.e.
external representation systems, we have as a group. In cognitive science and related fields, PC, which
can be generalized from a probabilistic viewpoint to the FEP, has become a dominant idea, which re‑
gards human cognition as a process of reducing prediction errors [11,16]. The PC and FEP provide a
generative view of cognition that takes into account not only perceptual aspects of cognition but also op‑
erational aspects, including decision making and active exploration. However, the primary focus of PC
and FEP is individual cognitive processes, with little or no attention to how these individual activities are
coordinated. In contrast, the CPC hypothesis was proposed as a generative model for symbol emergence,
where a shared language emerges as a representational vehicle for coordinating cognitive agents.
Notably, scientific knowledge we share in our society is also a representative symbol system. This
naturally suggests the possibility of extending CPC to an explanatory theory for formalizing science
activities (figure 1).
Science—including natural, social and various other disciplines—attempts to model and understand
the world. Although the quality of theories in science is evaluated in many ways and the values of
theories are not monolithic, prediction capability is a central criterion to evaluate scientific theories [1,3].
This is particularly true in the physical sciences; for example, Newtonian equations describe the genera‑
tive process that determines the trajectory of a target object [17]. In the context of PC and FEP, robots or
AI agents are expected to construct and continuously update an internal model that enables them to pre‑
dict incoming sensory information and navigate their actions [14,15,18]. Similarly, scientific knowledge
accumulated in our society can be seen as an external model that enhances our ability to predict phe‑
nomena in the world. In other words, we can regard scientific knowledge as an external representation
of an explicit world model, shared and collectively refined by scientists. This view allows us to extend
the CPC hypothesis to scientific activities.
Building upon these perspectives, this article aims to introduce a novel conceptual framework called
collective predictive coding as a model of science (CPC‑MS) to formalize and elucidate scientific activities.
CPC‑MS is a framework that models science as a collective predictive coding activity, as the name
suggests. We argue that the general CPC framework extends naturally to encompass various scientific
activities, including experimentation, measurement, hypothesis formulation and testing, paper writing,
peer review and more. This correspondence between CPC and scientific activities is not conceptually
isolated but positioned within a broader research landscape. Prior research has explored variational
approaches to niche construction to explain how scientific communities create and maintain shared
knowledge structures [19], examined the extension of scientific cognition beyond individual scientists

Figure1. Overviewofcollectivepredictivecodingasmodelofscience(CPC-MS).Thisfigureillustrateshowscientificknowledgeemerges
through collective processes. Scientists conduct experiments and observations, engaging with the target objects, i.e. environment,
through their research methodologies. These individual interactions generate data and insights, which are then synthesized and en-
coded into a shared system of scientific knowledge, analogous to how language emerges in linguistic systems. The diagram depicts a

through culturally mediated inferential processes [20], and conceptualized scientific discourse as a form
of collective active inference that facilitates adaptive knowledge generation [21].
These complementary perspectives reinforce our approach by demonstrating how the internal/exter‑
nal representation distinction is crucial for understanding collective knowledge systems.
The aforementioned view of science presents a vision to model the entirety of scientific activities as
a probabilistic generative model [22]. We term this perspectivegenerative science. While developing the
concept of generative science in relation to CPC, we establish clear correspondences between the proba‑
bilistic generative model underlying CPC and concrete, practical scientific activities. Crucially, CPC‑MS
posits that shared external representations—scientific knowledge in this context—are updated through
a form of peer‑review process that functions as a decentralized Bayesian inference [8].
The view of generativescience proposed in this article also aims to provide a clear view of the to‑
tal scientific activities from the viewpoint of generative models and allow people who work on science
automation to have a more intuitive roadmap for automated science (§4). Since the theory is formu‑
lated in terms of probabilistic modelling and machine learning, it offers a natural framework to in‑
tegrate generative AI into scientific activities. While there has been intense discussion and significant
progress in automating individual research tasks, such as information retrieval [23], paper writing [24],
hypothesis proposition [6], paper review [25] and experiment execution [26], much work remains to be
done in automating the entire social scientific process. CPC‑MS may provide a new perspective on such
automation.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces CPC as a model for scientific
activities, explaining the CPC hypothesis and its application to modelling these activities. This section
also includes a detailed explanation of the mathematical framework of CPC‑MS, including its formula‑
tion based on the theory of active inference; §3 applies the CPC model to understand the social objectivity
in science, scientific progress and the shift from confirmatory to generative science; §4 explores the impli‑
cations of CPC for the future of science, including speculations on AI’s impact on scientific practices and
providing guidelines for implementing automated total scientific activity; §5 discusses future research
directions; and §6 concludes this study.

2. Scientific activities as collective predictive coding
2.1. Collective predictive coding hypothesis
The CPC hypothesis proposes that the dynamics of human language can be modelled as a process of CPC
across society [8]. This hypothesis is based on the mathematical fact that a certain type of language game
played among agents, i.e. Metropolis–Hastings naming game (MHNG) (figure 2), can act as a decentral‑
ized Bayesian inference of a shared latent variable, sampled instantiation of which can be regarded as
an utterance of a name of an object [27]. The CPC hypothesis extended the idea of PC and FEP to the
phenomena of language emergence in human society. If the hypothesis is held, human language is con‑
sidered to collectively encode information about the world as observed by many agents through their
sensory–motor systems.
From a mathematical perspective, CPC can be modelled using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)
where latent variables representing shared external representations are inferred in a decentralized way
through agent interactions and communication.Figure 3represents a general form of CPC, ignoring the
temporal and dynamic aspects of agent–environment sensory–motor interactions, and focusing on repre‑
sentation learning perspectives. The computational model for CPC was obtained by extending the PGM
for individual representation learning to a social one. We first defined the total PGM by integrating mul‑
tiple elemental modules representing agents, i.e. people. Each elemental PGM was assumed to involve
latent variableszk
d representing theinternal representationof an agent, andobservations ok
d corresponding
to thekth agent. A shared latent variablewd is placed as a parent node of{zk
d}k. The latent variablewd
represents a sign, e.g. a sentence in language, which can be generally called anexternal representation.
The generative model infigure 3characteristically corresponds to a two‑layer hierarchical representa‑
tion learning system, in which internal representations{zk
d}k owned by each person are influenced by and
connected via a prior distribution parametrized bywd. Symbol emergence corresponds to the inference
of the shared external representation. A nomenclature of variables is provided in appendix A.
The CPC hypothesis assumes that a language game played between agents acts as a decentralized
Bayesian inference and the posterior distributionp(wd|{ok
d}k) can be inferred approximately. Taniguchi
et al. proposed MHNG and showed that the naming game can realize the approximate inference of
p(wd|o1
d, o2
d) in a two‑agent setting [27] in a fully decentralized way. Inukaiet al. extended the idea
to N‑agent conditions and proposed recursive MHNG [28]. A brief explanation of MHNG is given in
appendix B.
Mathematically, the inference ofq (zk ∣ ok) corresponds to representation learning by thekth agent,
and q (w ∣ {zk}k
) is assumed to be estimated through a language game within a group. As a whole, sym‑
bol emergence by a group is performed to estimateq (w, {zk}k ∣ {ok}k
) in a decentralized manner. We
assume that we cannot estimate the true posteriorp (w, {zk}k ∣ {ok}k
), but can only estimate its approxi‑
mate distribution q (w, {zk}k ∣ {ok}k
). In MHNG,q(w|⋅) is considered to be approximated by the sample

Carlo approximation.
However, if humans could participate in a language game that enables decentralized inference ofwd,
akin to the MHNG, a symbolic system like language could develop to unify the sensorimotor information
collected by individual agents. Consequently, a symbolic system emerges when agents work together in
PC. A more detailed formulation from the perspective of the FEP can be found in §2.3.
In summary, the CPC hypothesis proposes that language emerges and evolves as a shared represen‑
tation system that encodes information about the world in a compressed way, allowing agents to align
their models of the world.
2.2. Collective predictive coding as a model of science
The main argument of this article is to extend the idea of CPC to a model of science. Assuming that
the total goal of science is to build theories that model the world and predict future observations, the
framework of CPC seems to be suitable for modelling scientific activities. Especially in science, we need
to describe and share theories explicitly, even though insights and thoughts are profoundly internal
phenomena in our brains. The explicit theories, which are often described in scientific papers, should
be shared among society. We found a clear correspondence between language emergence and scientific
activities. We call this frameworkCPC as a model of science, as introduced in §1.
In CPC‑MS, it is assumed that each agent has partial observations and limited capability for experi‑
mentation and measurement. Based on such partial observations of the world, each agent, or scientist,
tries to refine their hypothesis to predict their data more accurately. This corresponds to the representa‑
tion learning ofzk
d. Based on such a hypothesis, an agent proposes a theory or writes a paper. The paper
or theory can be accepted or rejected by reviewers. This is quite similar to the communication in MHNG.
The PGM of CPC (figure 3) provides a framework for understanding and modelling the process of
scientific inquiry. The key components of the PGM, including external representations (w), internal rep‑
resentations (z) and observations (o), correspond to different aspects of scientific activities. The parameter
𝜃 is a local parameter for thekth agent, which represents agent‑specific properties such as the agent’s bias
and internal world model.
We assume that scientific activity aims to reveal the structure of the world and encode it into a system
of external representations. We consider a scientific paper to represent explicit knowledge that can be
interpreted by everyone, unlike tacit knowledge that only the owner can access. Imagine that scientific
knowledge consists of a large number of logical descriptions, e.g. mathematical equations of physical
laws, structural formulae of compounds in chemistry and descriptive theories of social systems. In this
sense, w represents a paper or a theoretical argument. We callw global scientific representationsin this
article.

Table 1represents the correspondences between mathematical notations in CPC, phenomena in sci‑
entific activities and language emergence. Assuming the goal of science is to obtain better external
representations, i.e. theories, to better predict the world, within the framework of CPC‑MS, CPC of{ok
d}k
and Bayesian inference ofwd are the goals of science.
The following is a scenario of two‑agent scientific communication, which can be extended to a
multiple‑agent setting, playing scientific communication possibly corresponding to a decentralized
Bayesian inference in the same way as MHNG. The schematic correspondence between MHNG and
the scientific communication is depicted infigure 2.
(1) Experimentation and measurement. Each agent (scientist) performs experiments on thedth target
and collects observations, which represent the datao = {o∗
d}d. Due to limited access to the world,
scientists can only perform a subset of possible experiments and obtain partial observations.
(2) Testing and refining hypotheses. Based on the observations (o = {o∗
d}d), scientists update their internal
scientific representations, i.e. internal representations, (z∗
d) through the inference processP(z|o).
This process mirrors how scientists evaluate and refine hypotheses in light of experimental re‑
sults. Testing hypotheses is represented by the evaluation of the likelihood termP(o|z) in the CPC
model, from generative perspectives. Scientists seek hypotheses that maximize the likelihood of
the observed data.
(3) Externalization of scientific representations. Scientists externalize their ideas mainly by writing papers
to communicate their internal representations (z) to the broader scientific community as explicit
knowledge. This process can be modelled as a sampling process from the distributionP(w|z), map‑
ping internal representations to external representations (w), which correspond to theories and
models described in scientific papers.
(4) Judgement of scientific representations. When a scientist submits a paper (w) for review, other scien‑
tists evaluate it based on their own internal representations (z). Reviewers assess the compatibility
of the proposed theory with their understanding and their beliefs. If successful, the distribution
of accepted papers can be regarded as samples ofq(w ∣ {zk}k), similar to the MHNG. In other
words, when reviewerk′ makes acceptance decisions based onp(zk′
|w), the sample distribution
of w is influenced by reviewerk′’s knowledge, resulting in a sample distribution that approxi‑
mates p(w|zk, zk′
) rather than p(w|zk). This means that through the judgement process, reviewer
7royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
k′’s knowledge is integrated into the distribution.1 In other words, this scientific communication
consisting of sampling, i.e. externalization, and judgement, i.e. peer review process, is considered
as the approximate (decentralized) Bayesian inference ofP(w|z) in the CPC framework.
(5) Iteration. The process returns to step 1, with scientists designing new experiments based on the
updated consensus, continuing the cycle of scientific inquiry.
Through ongoing communication of theories and evidence via papers and discussions, the scientific
community, here the group of two agents, updates its shared understanding of the world. This pro‑
cess corresponds to the decentralized Bayesian inference of shared external representations (P(w|o)). In
generative science, the ideal scientific consensus corresponds to the inference of the posterior distribu‑
tion, i.e.p (w ∣ {ok}k
) ≈ q (w ∣ {ok}k
). Notably, the CPC‑MS framework models social scientific activity from
the viewpoint of Bayesian inference that aggregates the evidence obtained by agents who have partial
capabilities. The CPC‑MS framework does not necessarily provide a method enabling the agents to reach
the objective ‘truth’, but rather provides a view of scientific communication to better understand, justify
and refine the mechanism of scientific activities played by the multi‑agent system, i.e. scientists.
By mapping the components of the CPC framework to specific scientific activities, we can see how the
PGM provides a unified view of the scientific process. The interplay between observations, internal rep‑
resentations and external representations in the CPC model mirrors the way scientists gather evidence,
propose hypotheses, test theories and communicate their findings to the broader community. The CPC
framework offers a principled way to understand the emergence of scientific knowledge through the
collective efforts of individual scientists.
2.3. Active inference on collective predictive coding as a model of science
In transitioning from a MHNG‑based perspective of the CPC model to one grounded in active infer‑
ence, we open a new dimension of understanding scientific processes. Active inference [29], which has
been pivotal in explaining cognitive processes through the minimization of prediction errors, offers a
robust framework for reinterpreting the CPC model. This approach not only aligns with the principles
of active inference but also provides a comprehensive view of scientific inquiry as a collective cognitive
process. By adopting this perspective, we can better elucidate how individual scientists’ observations and
hypotheses are integrated into a cohesive body of scientific knowledge, facilitating a deeper understand‑
ing of the dynamics of scientific progress and the role of collective intelligence in scientific discovery.
This shift in perspective underscores the potential of CPC‑MS to model science as an active, generative
process, driven by the continuous interplay between prediction and observation within the scientific
community [8,30].
To operationalize this active inference perspective within CPC‑MS, we must consider how scien‑
tific communities overcome information asymmetry among individual scientists. Recent research has
explored various approaches to collective inference processes among agents with asymmetric informa‑
tion. One approach based on the concept of ‘federated inference and belief sharing’ proposes a model
for how agents with different observation spaces can still perform collective inference effectively [31].
While such research focuses on belief integration, our CPC‑MS framework takes a complementary ap‑
proach by emphasizing the emergence of shared external representations (scientific knowledge) through
communication protocols analogous to the MHNG. Both existing approaches and CPC‑MS address the
fundamental challenge of information asymmetry in multi‑agent systems, but differ in their mechanisms
for consensus formation. Federation‑based models primarily focus on how individual agents update
their beliefs by incorporating others’ inferences, whereas CPC‑MS additionally models the emergence of
explicit external representations that serve as communal scientific knowledge. This distinction provides
the foundation for our mathematical formulation of CPC‑MS as a generative model that captures both
individual cognitive processes and collective knowledge creation.
Because the CPC‑MS regard the science community as a collective intelligence performing a decentral‑
ized Bayesian inference from the viewpoint of generative models, the system as a whole is also viewed as
an integrated cognitive system that performs free‑energy minimization and active inference [32]. Within
1Note that there are two types of interpretation of the review process. One is that two researchers, thekth and thek′th agents, have
different observationsok ≠ok′
, and the reviewerk′ judges the paperw written by thekth agent, i.e. a sample fromp(w|ok), by using
q(zk′
|ok′
). However, in this case, if there is a significant difference between the distributionsp(ok) and p(ok′
), it may result in an unfairly
low acceptance ratio. The other interpretation is that two researchers share the same dataok = ok′
, i.e. the data is shared publicly. In
this case, the reviewer uses their knowledge, i.e. the global parameter ofp(zk′
|w) and p(zk′
|ok′
= ok), without being affected by the
difference in data distributions.

the system, each individual is driven to explore based on their individual and collective motivations. Ac‑
tive inference is a theory that explains how living things understand their surroundings, act in the world
and learn. It is based on the idea that organisms try to minimize the difference between what they expect
and what they actually experience, both now and in the future. Several studies have demonstrated that
active inference can explain how organisms balance exploring new options with exploiting known re‑
wards. This approach offers a clear mathematical solution to a long‑standing problem in decision‑making
research.
Mathematically, the CPC‑MS in the simplest case can be described as follows:
Generative model: p (w, z, o ∣ a, C) = p(w)p (o ∣ z, a, C) p (z ∣ w, a) , (2.1)
Inference model: q (w, z, o ∣ a, C) = q (w ∣ z) q (o ∣ C) q (z ∣ o, a) , (2.2)
where w is external (collective) representations,z = {zk}k is the set of representations by thekth agent,
o = {ok}k is the set of observations by thekth agent, a = {ak}k is the set of sequence of actions taken
by the kth agent and C = {Ck}k is the set of sequence of rewards taken by thekth agent. The infer‑
ence of q (z ∣ o, a) corresponds to representation learning by the kth agent, and q (w ∣ z) is assumed
to be estimated through a language game within a group. As a whole, symbol emergence by a
group is performed to estimate q (w, z ∣ o, a, C) in a decentralized manner. We assume that we can‑
not estimate the true posterior p (w, z, o ∣ a, C), but can only estimate its approximate distribution
q (w, z ∣ o, a, C).
Based on these premises, the negative variational free energy—F—of the CPC‑MS, which exactly
corresponds to the model’s variational lower bound (ELBO), is defined as follows:
F = DKL
[q (w, z, o ∣ a, C) ‖p (w, z, o ∣ a, C)

[ln q (o ∣ C)
] are constant terms and
therefore do not affect the parameter estimation in the inference model. Additionally, while individual
term can be described as the sum of the values for eachkth agent, collective term cannot be expressed as
a sum overk.
In equation (2.7) , the individual prediction errorterm represents an individual’s predictive capabil‑
ity based on their internal scientific representations{zk}
k. In generative science, we take the stance
of evaluating theories and hypotheses based on how well they can predict observed values, and this
term corresponds to that. The individual regularization term signifies how consistent the inferred zk
based on the external and explicit scientific knowledgew is with the inferredzk based on one’s own
observation ok. This term represents the interaction between top‑down and bottom‑up information,
which is essential for PC and FEP. While the above two terms appear in general FEP, the first term,
the collective regularization term, is essential for CPC. The existence of this term gives rise to lan‑
guage and scientific knowledge as external representation systems. This term suggests that it is better
for the w represented or inferred by all agents to be as consistent as possible. Notably, bothzk and
w do not come from the environment but are created by people. The collective regularization term
9royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
works to adjust latent variables. This means that there is arbitrariness here. In other words, the sym‑
bol w representing zk inferred via q(zk ∣ ok, ak) has various degrees of freedom as long as it satisfies
social consensus represented by the collective regularization term. This corresponds to the ‘arbitrari‑
ness’, which is considered to be a nature of symbols in semiotics [33]. We, humans, are adapting
to the environment as a group and modelling the world in a generative manner, not only through
synaptic plasticity in our nervous system but also by using semantically and structurally flexible
symbol systems in society with this plasticity. CPC‑MS expresses this quality of scientific theories
that enables the group to be an adaptive predictor, i.e. a group of agents attempting to model the
world.

Scientific progress is exploratory in nature. The CPC theory provides a new perspective on collective ex‑
ploration in science. Individual scientists explore research fields and reach scientific discoveries through
hypothesis generation, experimentation, simulation, etc. Drivers of human exploration including sci‑
entific activities can be based on extrinsic and intrinsic motivations [34–36]. Intrinsic motivation of
theme selection and scientific discovery is especially described as individual drivers such as curiosity.
This individual exploration of science can be supported by theories of information gain. The informa‑
tion gain theory states that the relationship between curiosity and confidence is a inverted U‑shape
function [37]. Information gain as a proxy of curiosity measures the reduction of uncertainties after
samplings. This information‑theoretic principle inspired multiple related studies on agents’ exploration
[38–40].
Analogous to the information gain theory, individual scientists attempt to seek novel scientific dis‑
covery by rewarding gaining new information based on current situation. The information gain theory
of curiosity states that exploratory behaviours are driven by information gain between what an agent
knows (internal representationzk) and what an agent obtains (observationok, ak). This process can be
formulated as refinement of a hypothesisq(zk ∣ ok, ak). However, this view lacks organizational aspects
of science since theme selection of scientists is constrained by multiple collective factors such as sci‑
entific trends, grant opportunities and collaborators. In other words, individual exploration of science
can be biased by global constraints. These global constraints may be interpreted as external (collective)
representation w.
The CPC theory can capture collective aspects of scientific discovery and exploration as hypoth‑
esis updating and hypothesis testing. We here describe different exploratory patterns and scientific
activities.
— Hypothesis test.In scientific activities, doing an experiment is crucial for testing hypothesis. Hy‑
pothesis testing can be driven by sampling based on researcher’s internal model and theories
as global representation.
— Hypothesis update. Updating a hypothesis is another important scientific activity. Updating an
internal model of a researcher as hypothesis update is driven by the information gain between
models given by observation and global representation.
— Theme selection. Theme selection is also exploration in scientific activities. This exploration can be
driven by comparisons between information gains from multiple targetsIGd1,d2,...,dm . Each scien‑
tist has preference on which target is more interesting or curious to him or her. Such preference
to hypothesis update promotes theme selection of scientific topics in a decentralized manner.
In summary, the CPC theory can describe multiple collective aspects of scientific discovery such as
hypothesis test, hypothesis update and theme selection.

2.4. Example
For illustrative purpose, let us explain the case of ‘verifying whether drugX has a pharmacological effect
on diseaseY’ within the CPC‑MS framework.
(1) Experimentation and measurement. A research teamk ∈ K designs and conducts an experiment to in‑
vestigate the effect of drugX on diseaseY. For example, they perform clinical trials and collect data
ok
d on patients’ symptom improvement and biomarker changes. The actionak
d here corresponds to
the specific experimental procedures, such as administering the drug, measuring biomarkers and
recording patient outcomes. Though multiple research teams can obtain their respectiveok
d(k ∈ K),
each group can only perform a subset of possible experiments and obtain partial observations
due to ethical constraints, experimental design limitations and limitations, such as constraints on
experimental equipment and number of subjects.
(2) Testing and refining hypotheses. Research teamk analyses the observational datao = {ok
d}d and evalu‑
ates whether drugX shows a statistically significant effect on diseaseY. Based on this, they update
their hypothesis (internal representation)zk
d about the effect of drugX. This process is represented
as approximate inference of the posterior distributionp(z|w, a). For instance, they refine their hy‑
pothesis by evaluating the presence and strength of drugX’s effect through statistical analysis.
From a generative perspective, the fitness of hypothesis to the data corresponds to evaluating
the likelihood termp(o|z, a, C). The rewardCk in this context could represent the potential ben‑
efits of the drug, such as improved patient outcomes or reduced healthcare costs, which motivate
the research. CPC‑MS assumes that researchers pursue hypotheses that increase the likelihood of
the observational data while being influenced by the top‑down effectp(z|w, a) (prior distribution)
given byw, which represents prior knowledge in the field. This aligns with Bayesian inference as
p(z, o ∣ w, a, C) ∝p(z|w, a)p(o|z, a, C), appropriately updating one’s hypothesis under the influence
of prior knowledgew. If the hypothesis (z) is supported, they may plan additional experiments to
obtain more data (o) for further verification. If not supported, they consider the reasons and either
review the experimental methods to verify the hypothesis or modify the hypothesis (z).
(3) Externalization of scientific representations. Researchers externalize their internal scientific represen‑
tations z as papers and communicate them to the scientific community. This can be modelled as a
sampling process from the distributionP(w|z). Specifically, they write a paperw on the theory and
data analysis results regarding the effect of drugX to convert internal representations into external
representations.
(4) Judgement of scientific representations.When a paperw is submitted, other researchers (i.e. reviewers)
evaluate it. Reviewers judge the validity of the proposed theory based on their internal represen‑
tations z, which are informed by existing knowledge in the world and their own expertise. They
evaluate aspects such as the appropriateness of the experimental design, the accuracy of statistical
analysis and the validity of conclusions.
This corresponds to the listener’s acceptance judgement in MHNG, and when done properly, the
distribution of accepted papers can be viewed as samples fromq(w ∣ {ok
d}k). The scientific activ‑
ities through this process, i.e. CPC‑MS, can be considered as approximate distributed Bayesian
inference ofp(w ∣ {ok
d}k)).
(5) Iteration. The process returns to step 1. Based on the updated scientific consensus, researchers de‑
sign new experiments. Now, other research teamsk′ conduct experiments on the same targetd.
For example, they plan experiments to verify the effect of drugX in different patient groups or to
elucidate the detailed mechanism of action, continuing the cycle of scientific inquiry.
In this way, CPC‑MS represents scientific inquiry not so much as ‘the pursuit of true descriptive
knowledge w∗’ but rather as ‘an overall mechanism for integrating knowledge from limited observa‑
tions’
3. Explainingthescientificactivitieswiththe collectivepredictivecodingas
a model of science
This section examines the CPC‑MS framework’s implications for understanding the social dynamics and
progress of scientific inquiry. By emphasizing the collective nature of knowledge formation, it chal‑
lenges the traditional view of science as an individual, confirmatory process. Instead, the framework
highlights how diversity and social interactions among scientists contribute to objective knowledge and
11royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
drive scientific advancement. Additionally, the Bayesian perspective reframes scientific progress not as
the accumulation of truths but as the continuous refinement and generation of new ideas, emphasizing
the generative aspects of scientific activity.
3.1. Social objectivity
One salient feature of the CPC‑MS is that scientific knowledge emerges through social interactions among
individual scientists who have only partial and possibly distorted understanding of the world. Im‑
portantly, the establishment of a global scientific understanding does not entail the consensus among
individual scientists: they may well disagree with each other (q(zk|o) ≠q(zl|o) for k ≠l) or have incorrect
posterior (q(zk|o) ≠p(zk|o)) even at the limit where the community as a whole approximately attains the
true posteriorq (w ∣ {ok}k
) ≈ p (w ∣ {ok}k
). The holders of scientific knowledge, therefore, are the scientific
community as a whole rather than individual scientists. This aligns with the social approach to scien‑
tific knowledge [41,42], which frames the objectivity of scientific inquiry as arising from the interplay
of social interactions and empirical investigation. In this picture, scientists are depicted not as detached
truth seekers who strictly adhere to universal methodologies, but as situated individuals influenced by
their backgrounds, beliefs and values. The individual biases, however, get corrected in critical dialogues
including peer reviews and replications of experimental results.
The CPC‑MS provides a Bayesian model for such social processes through which objective knowl‑
edge emerges from diversity. As described in §2, scientists in the CPC‑MS model may have their own
parameter values𝜃 and thus form different inner representationz based on the same observationo. Thus,
their research outputw well reflects individual biases. This result, however, will not be integrated into
the scientific body unless it is accepted by other scientists (i.e. reviewers), who make the decision on the
basis of their own probability criterionq(w|z). The key observation of the CPC‑MS model is that such
mutual criticisms can be seen as an essential part of the decentralized Bayesian inference, e.g. MHNG,
which realizes the inference to the posterior distribution at the scientific community as a whole.
Moreover, our model predicts the ways in which diversity and heterogeneity even promote objec‑
tive scientific investigations, by allowing for the inclusion of diverse perspectives and the exploration
of varied research paths. First of all, Bayesian inference becomes skewed or biased if data concentrate
on a limited range, e.g. if the scientific community conducts experiments and observations only within
a specific range of interests and subjects. Second, the asymptotic convergence to the true posterior via
the repeated decentralized sampling is conditioned by the sampling process beingergodic, which roughly
means that every part of the hypothesis space is eventually explored. This condition is violated if, among
others, there is any ‘blind spot’ theoryw that has no positive probability of being proposed by any scien‑
tist (so that the Markov chain becomesreducible), or if scientific activities are trapped in cycles, with no
chance of escaping and exploring new theoretical possibilities (so that the chain isperiodic). Moreover, an
effective convergence of Metropolis–Hastings algorithm requires that samples are independent of each
other, which, in the present context, is translated as that scientists carry out their research according to
their own interests and concerns. In contrast, if particular topics or groups become too influential within a
research community, scientific explorations can become skewed towards a specific region of the hypoth‑
esis space, resulting in slower convergence. These pitfalls may be avoided by increasing the diversity of
a scientific community, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and approaches are represented.
3.2. Scientific progress
Science is expected to be progressive as well as objective, continually making solid improvements over
past achievements. In the CPC‑MS model, scientific progress is understood as the diachronic improve‑
ment of the posterior distribution through decentralized Bayesian updating. As scientific inquiry con‑
tinues and more datao accumulate, the posterior distributionq(w|o) is expected to better approximate
the data‑generating process. This can be seen as an optimization process in which probability mass is
progressively concentrated around the parameters with higher likelihood (figure 4). At the same time,
this is accompanied by an optimization of the model parameter𝜽 = {𝜃k}
k, which represents the scientific
understanding of each individual agent. More specifically, by mediating individual’s inner representa‑
tion zk
d and observationok
d (figure 3), each𝜃k influences how thekth agent interprets observations and
forms hypotheses about their environment. By doing so, it also serves as a bridge between individual
internal representations and the shared global scientific representationwd. This perspective allows us
12royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
Figure 4.(a) Left: expected classical CPC models show gradual, continuous updates of the posterior distributionq(𝜃 ∣ o) as sample
size increases. Right: singular CPC models demonstrate discontinuous jumps in the posterior distribution, representing paradigm shifts
in scientific understanding. (b) A network representation of the singular CPC model, where scientists (Agent 1 and Agent 2) act as neu-
rons. The connections between nodes illustrate how scientific concepts or theories interact and evolve, potentially leading to sudden
structural changes in the collective knowledge network.
to view Bayesian optimization as a form of scientific progress—the process through which scientists’
understanding of the world, represented by𝜽, improves over time.
Under this identification, the conventional Bayesian update corresponds to a gradual improvement
of the posterior distribution, where the weights of neural connectivity get refined continuously and
smoothly on the basis of incoming data (figure 4a, left). This mode of updating process captures the
gradual scientific progress in ‘normal science’, where the scientific community as a whole concentrates
on a given vicinity of the parameter space—circumscribed by one paradigm—and seeks to its refinement.
When the parameter space of the model is singular, however, the Bayesian updating process of the
posterior distribution may involve jumps from one singular point to another corresponding to a local
optimal solution (figure 4b, right). In singular learning theory, the concept of a singular model refers to
a model whose parameter space contains singularities, as opposed to a regular model which lacks such
singularities. Developed by Sumio Watanabe, this theory employs theorems from algebraic geometry to
rigorously analyse the behaviour of Bayesian updating in singular models [43,44]. The key finding is that,
in stark contrast to regular models, the Bayesian updating process of the posterior distribution in singu‑
lar models can exhibit discontinuous jumps from one singularity to another. These jumps correspond
to phase transitions between local optima and are a frequently observed phenomenon in the Bayesian
updating of posterior distributions in deep learning models. Mathematically, the singularities in the pa‑
rameter space of these models determine the architecture of the model itself, dictating the presence or
absence of edges connecting neurons. Consequently, learning in Bayesian deep models can be interpreted
as a process whereby the model architecture is updated discontinuously via Bayesian updating of the
posterior distribution. This jump of the posterior distribution from one singularity to another is called
a phase transition, a phenomenon frequently observed in the Bayesian updating process of the poste‑
rior distribution in deep learning models. In deep learning models, singularities in the parameter space
correspond to the architecture of the model and determine the presence or absence of edges connecting
one neuron to another. In other words, learning a Bayesian deep learning model can be interpreted as a
process in which the architecture of the model is updated discontinuously through Bayesian updating
of the posterior distribution. In the context of the CPC framework, this can be viewed as a discontinuous
change in the internal representationz of individual scientists, which in turn may induce a radical shift
in the distribution of the global latent variablew.
13royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
Thomas Kuhn [2] famously described scientific progress as consisting of two distinct periods: the pe‑
riod of ‘normal science’, in which scientists engage in puzzle‑solving activities and piecemeal refinements
of a given paradigm, and the period of ‘extraordinary science’, during which accumulated anomalies
encourage the critical scrutiny of foundational assumptions and exploration of new theoretical possibil‑
ities, eventually leading to a scientific revolution. The CPC‑MS framework offers a Bayesian model that
accommodates these two periods as distinct modes of Bayesian optimization. Normal science, in this
framework, is modelled by the gradual Bayesian update of the posterior distribution towards a given
local optimum. During this period, scientists espouse more or less similar local representations, mak‑
ing proposals of external representations that deviate significantly from the shared paradigm (namely,
the set ofw’s constituting a local optimum) rare, and, if made, likely to be rejected. On the other hand,
scientific revolutions are represented by phase transitions that leap the posterior distribution from one
singularity to another in a discontinuous fashion. Such transitions induce significant reconfigurations in
the collective external representations (w) held by the scientific community, such that a set of propositions
that enjoyed high probabilities before the transition cease to do so afterwards.
Kuhn infamously claimed that the incommensurability between different paradigms makes the com‑
parison and evaluation of competing scientific theories difficult, if not impossible, because the standards
of evidence, methods and the very concepts used in the theories can change so drastically between
paradigms. However, within the CPC framework, there is a potential resolution to this problem that
acknowledges the incommensurability while still allowing for a form of rational progress. This is be‑
cause a phase transition between paradigms can still be understood as an improvement in the collective
posterior distribution. Since a more refined posterior distribution enhances the explanatory power for
observed data and sharpens the predictive accuracy for unobserved phenomena, the transition to a new
paradigm can be considered a rational and objectively superior advancement in the scientific commu‑
nity’s collective understanding, even if the paradigms themselves are internally incommensurable. In
this way, the CPC framework reconciles Kuhn’s notion of incommensurability with the idea of scientific
progress by proposing a unified model of Bayesian optimization that accommodates both the continuous
and discontinuous phases of scientific change.
3.3. From confirmatory to generative science
Finally, the CPC‑MS framework prompts us to reconsider the very nature and purpose of the scientific
enterprise. The traditional realist perspective in science views its primary goal as the pursuit of true
knowledge, placing strong emphasis on the confirmatory role of scientific methods to distinguish valid
hypotheses from invalid ones [1,45]. In the twentieth century, statistical tests provided precisely such
a universal tool for confirmation, establishing methodological standards across various scientific disci‑
plines [46,47]. The realist picture aligns with the aforementioned image of scientists as ‘lone truth seekers’
who independently collect data, test hypotheses and publish results, the accumulation of which forms
the body of scientific knowledge.
On the other hand, the CPC framework highlights thegenerative aspect of science, viewing it as a
coordinated system for producing new hypotheses, research plans, actions and predictions. In the CPC‑
MS model, scientific knowledge is encoded as a posterior distributionq(w|o) that reflects the collective
opinions within of the scientific community. The primary function of this distributional knowledge is
to induce scientists to take the next step in their inquiry. There are at least two such generative aspects.
First, it serves as a key reference point for individual researchers when planning their next studies or
experiments. While some researchers may strive to find exceptions to hypotheses with high posterior
probability, others may design experiments that prompt a reconsideration of less attended hypotheses.
In this way, scientific knowledge serves to streamline research directions that produce further evidence.
This leads to a continuous cycle of proposing hypotheses, conducting experiments and refining theories,
much like the iterative updates in a Bayesian model.
The second and more obvious generative role of scientific knowledge is prediction: theories are used
to predict unobserved phenomena. In the Bayesian framework, a prediction of new datão on the basis
of past observationo is given by the posterior predictive distributionp(̃o ∣ z, a, C)q(z ∣ o, a)q(w ∣ z):
p(̃o ∣ o, a, C) =∫p(̃o ∣ z, a, C)q(z ∣ o, a)q(w ∣ z) dwdz. (3.1)
Given that an accurate posterior distributionp(̃o ∣ o, a, C) leads to better predictions, both in terms of
mean squared error and the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the predicted and true distributions,
14royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
the scientific progress discussed above can also be seen as an improvement in predictive performance.
The emphasis on prediction becomes even more apparent in light of the discussion on active inference
(§2.3), where the scientific community as a whole is viewed as a collective agent aiming to minimize the
predictive error.
The shift from confirmatory to generative approaches induced by the CPC framework is intrinsically
linked to its social and progressive visions of science discussed above. From the generative perspective,
scientific knowledge is seen as less an end than a means that promotes scientists to pursue new projects.
Social exchanges and information sharing accelerate this research cycle, enabling the scientific commu‑
nity as a whole to effectively explore the vast hypothesis space in an efficient manner. The focus on
prediction also substantiates the common intuition that science is progressive, an idea that has posed
a vexing issue for the confirmatory view of science—precisely because the history of science seemingly
presents us with successive scrap‑and‑build cycles through the refutation of past theories rather than the
cumulative build‑up of true propositions over time [48]. The Bayesian perspective, on the other hand,
offers a clear sense of scientific progress in terms of predictive performance, for the diachronic refine‑
ment of the posterior distribution, as discussed in the previous section, directly leads to the improvement
of the posterior predictive distribution shown inequation (3.1). This suggests that the aspect of science
that can be said to progress, particularly before and after a paradigm shift, is not its stock of confirmed
knowledge, but rather its generative capability.
In conclusion, the CPC framework provides a comprehensive view of scientific activities that high‑
lights their social, progressive and generative nature. This stands in contrast to the traditional view,
which portrays science as a predominantly individual, cumulative and confirmatory procedure. The
view of science as a generative process, driven by CPC, provides a new perspective on how scientific
knowledge evolves and advances. It emphasizes the importance of diversity in scientific approaches, the
value of paradigm‑shifting discoveries and the collective nature of scientific progress. By understanding
science through this lens, we can better appreciate the complex dynamics that drive scientific advance‑
ment and potentially develop strategies to facilitate more efficient and effective knowledge generation
in the scientific community.
4. AI and research automation
As we have repeatedly emphasized throughout previous sections, CPC‑MS provides a comprehensive
model of scientific activities carried out by scientists. Notably, as discussed earlier, it uses probabilistic
generative models to mathematically describe these processes. This unique characteristic of compre‑
hensive modelling and probabilistic approaches enables CPC‑MS to offer profound insights into: (i) the
potential impact of AI on the future landscape of scientific research; and (ii) the development of intuitive
guidelines for implementing automated scientific activities.
4.1. Speculating AI’s impact on science for shaping the future science
AI has made remarkable progress, its influence spreading throughout society. Science is no exception
to this trend; AI has become an innovative tool in the field, and its applications in science are rapidly
expanding [6,49,50]. Furthermore, AI’s development is not limited to its use as a mere tool; scientists are
now exploring whether AI can do research on its own as a scientist [51,52]. They are trying to figure out if
AI can come up with its own research questions, plan and run experiments and make sense of the results.
Research has also increasingly explored the use of AI for generating hypotheses and producing survey
papers [53–55]. The possibility of AI acting as an autonomous scientist points towards a future novel sci‑
entific community where both human and AI scientists coexist and contribute to scientific endeavours
[56,57].
Given this rapid advancement of AI for science and its potential to revolutionize scientific practices,
there is growing interest in how AI is affecting science. One of the most evident impacts of AI in research
is its ability to dramatically enhance productivity through automation. AI can process an enormous vol‑
ume of scientific literature that humans could never read, perform computations at speeds far beyond
human capability, operate continuously without rest and be easily replicated, all of which contribute to
significantly accelerating research progress. In the terminology of CPC‑MS, this translates into an un‑
precedented increase in the sampling of observationsok
d and hypotheseszk
d, thereby facilitating a more
efficient mode of scientific process.
15royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
Another perspective is to consider the impact of AI entering the scientific community as scientists.
The main feature of CPC‑MS is its proposal of a model of science as a CPC activity involving multiple
agents. This characteristic allows us to discuss important aspects of how AI might change the nature of
science. Specifically, by modelling the scientific community as a hybrid system composed of fundamen‑
tally different agents—AI and humans—CPC‑MS enables us to explore how this transformation might
impact science or even alter the very nature of scientific inquiry.
For instance, the entry of AI into the scientific community might reduce the overall bias of the com‑
munity. Humans are constrained by biological and cognitive limitations that restrict what they can
understand, and their cognition is distorted by cognitive biases and social pressures. In the CPC frame‑
work, 𝜃k for each agentk represents these biases and hence their world models, which in turn affect the
generation ofok
d and zk
d. Since bias is prevalent in human agents, its effect on the global scientific repre‑
sentations wd can be proliferated through collective inference in human‑only scientific community. Such
bias would lead to skewed or biased inferences, the ‘blind spot’ theory and slower convergence, poten‑
tially degrading the social objectivity of science, as we have discussed in §3.1. It could also introduce
noise and bias in observations or violate the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) condition,
disturbing asymptotic improvement (§3.2).
On the other hand, AI would probably have a different𝜃k than humans’, suggesting the possibility of
generating differentok
d and zk
d. Thus, the entry of AI agents into the scientific community might enable
the generation ofwd that reflects more diverse aspects of target of studyd. In other words, the involve‑
ment of AI in conducting science suggests that it could introduce greater diversity, which is key for social
objectivity in science as discussed in §3.1, into the process of scientific knowledge production. Therefore,
AI potentially alleviates some of the limitations currently faced by human science, leading to potentially
better scientific outcomes.
Simultaneously, the integration of AI also raises concerns about the shared common ground among
social members, which is a prerequisite for objectivity as discussed in §3.1. CPC‑MS emphasizes the role
of consensus formation through communication among agents in the creation of scientific knowledge.
From this perspective, science involving AI can be described as a hybrid system composed of entirely
different agents—AI and humans. This bears structural similarities to the AI alignment problem [58]. In
this sense, the CPC‑MS framework naturally frames the challenges of AI in science as a specific example
of the broader AI alignment issue.
In current science, communication between agents works well because they are all humans who share
similar biological bodies and language. However, AI lacks this commonality with us, potentially raising
the issue of communication barrier. This suggests that the premise of science as distributed PC, which
we explained in §3.1, could collapse with the participation of AI as a scientist in the scientific community.
Moreover, a significant increase in the differences between agents could make global scientific rep‑
resentation production inefficient too. In a two‑agent MHNG with agentsk and l, for example, agentl
updates wd by either accepting or rejecting proposals from agentk. If agentk and agentl are an AI and
a human, respectively, their internal scientific representationszk
d and zl
d and then the distributions they
follow are expected to be significantly different. Consequently, the generatedwk
d and wl
d will also be very
different. Therefore, if the originalwd is wl
d and the proposal iswk
d , the acceptance rate is expected to be
quite low (e.g. in MHNG,wk
d is accepted with probability min(1,
P(zk
d|𝜃k,wl
d)
P(zk
d|𝜃k,wk
d) ), and whenwk
d and wl
d differ
significantly, this probability is likely to be small). This could lead to poor convergence efficiency.
As the diversity and heterogeneity among agents increase, the common ground they share tends to
decrease. This presents a fundamental trade‑off: while greater diversity can enhance social objectivity
in science, it also risks undermining the shared basis necessary for effective communication and collab‑
oration. To maximize the potential of AI in expanding new scientific possibilities, it is thus crucial to
proactively develop and establish this common ground among diverse constituents, in anticipation of
AI scientists’ future participation. This involves creating a new scientific framework that maintains the
benefits of heterogeneity while ensuring effective collaboration between human and AI agents.
So far, we have focused on the differences between AI and humans. However, it has also been pointed
out that AI and humans share similar biases [59,60], and the internal representations of AI may be similar
to each other [61]. In this case, the entry of AI into scientific research may, rather than mitigating biases,
reinforce existing human biases and further steer science in that direction. While it remains an open ques‑
tion how AI scientists resemble human scientists and how this resemblance influences the trajectory of
scientific inquiry, CPC‑MS provides a framework for discussing the impact of such agents.
16royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
Like this, we can see that the integration of AI scientists into the human scientific community has the
potential to significantly impact even the fundamental premises of science. Therefore, the emergence of
hybrid system of AI and human scientist is creating opportunities to debate and reshape the very nature
of science itself, moving beyond simply considering their impact on traditional scientific practices. Hu‑
mans might have only explored a limited portion of the possible space of science [62], and it has been
pointed out that the current scientific system faces many problems. The rise of AI offers us a chance
to do more than just passively observe how science is changing. Instead, we can take an active role in
reimagining and reshaping science itself.
4.2. Guideline for implementing automated total science activity
CPC‑MS has the potential to provide guidelines for implementing and automating the entire scientific
process of a group of scientists as a machine learning model. This could bring a new perspective to the
efforts of automating science, which have traditionally focused on automating specific tasks within an
individual scientist’s research workflow.
The pursuit of automating scientific practices by machines dates back to the early days of comput‑
ing, with pioneering systems like DENDRAL [63] and BACON [64]. Subsequently, as exemplified by
the term, fourth paradigm of science, the advancement and proliferation of computational capabilities
led to the automation of certain tasks within scientific activities [65]. The 2000s saw machine learning
techniques like Bayesian optimization applied to scientific processes. However, it was the deep learning
revolution of the 2010s that truly accelerated the integration of AI into science, a field now known as
AI for science [6,49,50]. This integration has enabled discoveries previously unsolved by humans, with
AlphaFold [66] serving as a prime example.
While these activities have brought tremendous progress to humanity, they have largely been limited
to the automation and substitution of a specific task in a scientific process. Current research involves
activities like formulating questions, conducting experiments and writing papers. However, attempts to
fully automate an entire research cycle, encompassing all of these activities from start to finish, remain
few and far between.
There are few examples of attempts to automate an entire research cycle, with systems like Adam
[67] and Eve [68] being notable exceptions. Adam is a closed‑loop automation system that combines tra‑
ditional symbolic AI with robotics to automatically generate hypotheses, verify them and modify them
based on feedback. More recently, groundbreaking research has proposed an AI system capable of con‑
ducting machine learning research in a highly automated, end‑to‑end manner, handling a wide range of
tasks from initial idea generation to paper writing [52].
However, even these attempts are specialized, focusing on automating specific areas of scientific re‑
search rather than achieving a general automation of science. Furthermore, the automation achieved so
far typically replicates the research process of a single scientist. The AI scientist by Luet al. [52] represents
a significant step forward in automating the social aspects of scientific work, as it not only automates
paper writing but also the peer‑review process. However, even this study still falls short of automating
the entire scientific activities.
As this article emphasizes, science is inherently a collaborative effort. It is common for multiple re‑
searchers to work together to understand a single phenomenon, and peer review—the process by which
other researchers validate research outcomes—is a crucial aspect of scientific activity. The existing closed‑
loop research automation systems have not yet managed to incorporate these social aspects, leaving the
automation of the entire scientific process, including its collaborative nature, still unrealized.
To achieve this goal, we need a model that captures both the social dimensions of science and the
entire process from discovery to knowledge representation and communication by scientists, without
being too tied to specific scientific practices. Moreover, to actually automate this model in practice, it
needs to be implementable, which means it must be expressible mathematically. CPC‑MS offers such a
model of science. In essence, CPC‑MS could serve as a foundation or starting point for developing a sys‑
tem capable of automatically executing the full spectrum of scientific activities performed by a scientific
community.
CPC‑MS takes a unique approach by modelling science as a probabilistic generative process. This per‑
spective allows us to view the whole range of scientific activities through the lens of statistical machine
learning, enabling us to potentially implement these activities as a machine learning model. Furthermore,
by framing science in terms of generative models, CPC‑MS can easily incorporate the latest developments
17royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
in generative AI—a field that has been making waves across society in recent years. To conclude, CPC‑MS
offers a novel framework for understanding and advancing the future direction of research automation.
5. Future work
5.1. Network structure in scientific communities
The CPC framework can be extended by considering the network structure of multiple agents. Interac‑
tions between multiple agents with the CPC framework describe biases and effects in scientific commu‑
nities. Global scientific representations are often generated by a small scientific community with a few
dozen members. Demographics of such small community may bias or influence scientific activities such
as paper citation [69], peer review [70] and recruiting [71]. For example, gendered citation patterns are
known in contemporary physics [69]. This pattern can be described as inferences from a smaller number
of agents. A small number of agents easily biases collective decision making.
Another bias can come from whether researchers work with famous or non‑famous researchers,
notably the Matthew effect [72,73]. The difference between famous and less famous researchers may
influence range of broadcasting global representations. Less famous researcher may not be able to broad‑
cast global scientific representations to other members effectively while famous researcher can do. A
similar pattern also appears in famous and less famous research institutes [74]. Academic success may
also be influenced by the structure of social network. For example, diverse intellectual synthesis between
mentors and mentees influences success in academic careers [71].
It is also interesting to discuss the influence of scientific communities on the growth of scientific con‑
cepts. Scientific concepts are developed within scientific communities composed of many researchers,
so the dynamics of these concepts reflect the decision‑making processes of these communities. Scien‑
tific concepts evolve by filling knowledge gaps, and scientific discoveries are often accompanied by the
awarding of the Nobel Prize as an indicator of recognition by the scientific community [75]. Scientific
consensus, measured by the frequency of consensus‑related words such as ‘agreement’ in academic pa‑
pers, is associated with the dynamics of the network structure of scientific concepts [76]. Since the CPC
framework was developed to explain symbol emergence in humans, it should also be capable of describ‑
ing how scientific concepts are developed, accepted or rejected by scientific communities through the
interactions of multiple agents.
It is worth mentioning the relationship with science of science (SciSci) [5]. SciSci is an emergent inter‑
disciplinary field to uncover mechanisms of doing science using computational methods. Geographical
and temporal interactions between scientists are targets of SciSci in addition to conventional citation
and co‑authorship analyses. The CPC framework is based on interactions between multiple agents and
concurs with SciSci from the perspective of analysing network structure.
Furthermore, SciSci also aims to influence the network structure of agents and scientific activities.
One solution is to create open datasets and softwares visualizing biases in scientific activities. Some stud‑
ies contribute to policy making in scientific commercialization [77] and public funding [78,79]. Ohniwa
et al. showed that diverse and smaller grants are more effective than centralized and larger grants to
generate new fields and promote technology transfer in Japan public funding [79]. Such evidence may
theoretically support effectiveness of decentralized communities, so‑called decentralized autonomous
organizations, to support science projects [80]. Recently, there has been a growing momentum around
the movement known as decentralized science (DeSci). DeSci are practices of science or related activities,
which often are designed with decentralized mechanisms and technologies such as blockchain. In this
regard, the CPC theory can be extended by theoretical understanding of social biases and computational
frameworks to analyse new forms of science management models including DeSci. Further studies of
social network will contribute to the extension of the CPC framework.
5.2. Simulation study of collective predictive coding science model
CPC provides a computational model of science. Therefore, by executing this model on a computer, it is
possible to simulate how the scientific community produces knowledge. The advantage of being able to
simulate science is that it allows us to conduct pseudo‑experiments on science, which is a social activity
where actual experiments are not possible. This enables us to discuss how various factors could poten‑
tially influence the scientific community and in what ways. For instance, changing the distribution that
18royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
𝜃k follows for eachk may allow us to study how the diversity among scientists actually influences scien‑
tific activity (§§3.1 and 4.1). Moreover, if we limit the communication to agents within the same cluster
c and restrict inter‑cluster communication, we may be able to reveal the impact of clustering on the pro‑
duction of global scientific representations in scientific communities, as discussed above. Additionally,
introducing malicious players who make false reports, for example, we may introduce players with an
irrational acceptance ratio ofwd or players that randomly suggestwk
d independent ofzk
d. Alternatively,
we may also introduce agents that excessively prioritize individual epistemic value or pragmatic values
(§2.3) and how these agents affect scientific integrity.
5.3. Non-stationarity
In the current CPC‑MS, for simplicity, it is implicitly assumed that the distribution thatwd follows is
stationary. However, in reality, the distribution thatwd follows may change over time. For example, in
fields where claims are difficult to verify and established theories can change significantly when new ev‑
idence emerges, the distribution ofwd is expected to be non‑stationary. Extending CPC‑MS to naturally
model such non‑stationary distributions ofwd is one potential direction for expanding the framework.
5.4. Causal inference in scientific activities
The current CPC‑MS framework primarily focuses on correlational patterns between observations and
internal/external representations within scientific activities. However, a significant aspect of scientific
inquiry involves establishing causal relationships rather than mere correlations—scientists often aim to
determine what causes what, not just what predicts what. While our current formulation captures the
predictive aspect of science through the Bayesian inference framework, it does not explicitly address
how causal inferences are made or how interventional data (as opposed to observational data) is in‑
tegrated into the scientific process. Judea Pearl’s framework of causal inference distinguishes between
statistical predictions and causal statements, where the latter requires intervention in the system being
studied [81]. Scientists make causal statements by taking action—by manipulating variables and ob‑
serving the effects—going beyond inferences about language or symbols. Future extensions of CPC‑MS
could incorporate formal causal modelling tools such as causal Bayesian networks, do‑calculus or poten‑
tial outcomes framework to explicitly represent how scientists form and test causal hypotheses [82–84].
This extension would bridge the gap between the current predictive framework and the causal nature
of scientific explanation, potentially providing insights into how collective scientific activities establish
causal knowledge despite individual limitations in experimentation and observation.
5.5. Incorporating external players
In the current framework, only scientists are considered agents, but in actual science, multiple non‑
scientist players are essential. These include funders, influencers of scientific direction and educators.
The current CPC‑MS framework does not explicitly model these players, limiting discussions of their
influence. Incorporating non‑scientist players could extend the model. For example, funders influence
research themes, indirectly corresponding to selecting certain objectd to be studied from this world. This
decision making is closely related to howwd is used and what is required aswd for a society [78]. The
current framework models the inference ofwd of target of study but does not address how the target is
selected or howwd is used. Modelling such target selection process, as mentioned above, could provide
deeper insights into the effect of the society to science.
5.6. Utilities and values
When selecting research topics, the value to society and individuals becomes a crucial factor driving re‑
search activities. At first glance, the generative model of CPC (figure 3) may appear to focus solely on
the encoding of observational information, without incorporating elements such as individual values
or rewards. However, the PGM of CPC can be naturally extended to include decision making based on
rewards and values. In many cases, decision making based on rewards and values can be reformulated
as Bayesian inference of action sequences to reach a desired state [85,86]. Building on this theory, Ebara
et al. have proposed a multi‑agent reinforcement learning algorithm that extends the MHNG based on
CPC to include symbol emergence [87].
19royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsosR. Soc. Open Sci.12:241678
.............................................................................................................
Following the formulation of active inference presented in §2.3, pragmatic value can be used to model
both utilities and values.
Based on the CPC‑MS framework, future challenges include discussing the selection of research topics
based on values and the impact of individual agents’ (researchers’) incentives on scientific exploration
as CPC.
6. Conclusion
The CPC‑MS framework presented in this article offers a novel perspective on scientific activities, view‑
ing them through the lens of CPC and decentralized Bayesian inference. By modelling science as a gen‑
erative process carried out by a community of agents—namely, generative science—CPC‑MS provides
several key insights.
It formalizes the social nature of scientific knowledge production, demonstrating how individual ob‑
servations and hypotheses are integrated into explicit scientific knowledge, i.e. global scientific represen‑
tations, through communication and peer review. The CPC‑MS framework offers a mathematical foun‑
dation for understanding scientific progress, paradigm shifts and the role of diversity in scientific com‑
munities. It bridges the gap between individual cognitive processes and collective knowledge creation
in science, offering a unified view of scientific activities, from experimentation to theory development.
The CPC‑MS framework aligns with and extends existing ideas in the philosophy of science, such as
social objectivity and the generative nature of scientific theories. It encourages us to view science not just
as a collection of facts or theories, but as a dynamic, collective cognitive process that continually refines
our understanding of the world.
As we move towards an era where AI plays an increasingly significant role in scientific research, the
CPC‑MS framework provides a valuable tool for understanding and shaping the future of science. Ad‑
ditionally, the mathematical nature of CPC‑MS allows us to integrate generative AI‑based automated
scientific research as a part of the CPC‑MS framework.
Future work could focus on refining the mathematical models underlying CPC‑MS, conducting em‑
pirical studies to test its validity in modelling actual scientific studies, and exploring its implications for
science policy, research management and research ethics. Ultimately, this framework aims to contribute
to a more comprehensive understanding of how scientific knowledge is created, validated and advanced
through collective effort.

(3) Learning. After MH communication was performed for every object, the listener updates its global

(4) Turn‑taking. The speaker and listener alternate their roles and go back to (1).
They showed that the MHNG is a Metropolis–Hastings sampler ofp(w, z1, z2, 𝜃1, 𝜃2, 𝜙1, 𝜙2|o1, o2), where
𝜃k and 𝜙k are global parameters of the generative model corresponding to thekth agent. As a result, the
MHNG can perform fully decentralized approximate Bayesian inference ofw. For more detail, please
refer to the original paper [27]. Taniguchiet al. validated the MHNG on a PGM called Inter‑GMM+VAE,
modelling a two‑agent symbol emergence system [9,10] using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for
p(zk|w)p(w) and variational autoencoder (VAE) forp(ok|zk)p(zk) and combining them using the Neuro‑
SERKET framework [89]. While initial MHNG studies focused on two‑agent systems, Inukaiet al. [28]
extended this toN‑agent conditions by introducing recursive communication structures.
Although these theories originally define signs categorically, the MHNG framework naturally allows
for broader types of signs, including compositional word sequences [90] and continuous signs like voice
pitch [91]. Saitoet al. [92] modelled the emergence of compositional signs from continuous time‑series
signals.
To validate the CPC hypothesis and MHNG’s validity in explaining human symbol emergence be‑
haviours, Okumuraet al. [93] conducted experimental semiotic studies and showed that MHNG’s sign ac‑
ceptance rate effectively predicts human behaviour in joint‑attention naming games, bridging theoretical
models with empirical evidence.
