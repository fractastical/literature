Abstract 
This article presents a neuroscientific interpretation of Carl Jung’s theory of archetypes and their experience in altered states of 
consciousness. We begin by rehearsing the Free Energy Principle and Predictive Processing as foundational frameworks that subserve 
and inform the thesis that follows. The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical 
systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher 
cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between the high-level cortex, the low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective 
systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, 
developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses 
of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal
phenomena. We conclude by discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research. By bridging these
disciplines, we aim to lend construct validity to Jungian concepts and encourage further empirical investigation of archetypes and the
collective unconscious.

Introduction 
In this article, we address the problem of how the Jungian con-
struct of archetypes can be understood from a neuroscientific 
perspective. We parse the concept of archetype into distinct cate-
gorizations, arising from discrete cortical and subcortical circuits. 
Echoing Jung, we distinguish between the “archetype as such,” 
the “archetypal image,” and the narrative or symbolically based 
“archetypal story .” Archetypes ‘as such’ refer to the tendency to 
form particular predictions, or the recurrent brain-based patterns 
that give rise to the archetypal ‘images’ and ‘stories’. The archety-
pal ‘image’ is the sensory representation or manifestation of the 
archetype as such, and the archetypal ‘story’ refers to the narra-
tive form. We suggest that the archetypal ‘core’ is primarily affec-
tive; this ‘core’—close but not quite identical to the archetype ‘as
such’—becomes clothed in sensory aspects (the archetypal expe-
rience in prereflexive consciousness); and finally reaches highest
levels of the cortex where it takes narrative form (the archety-
pal ‘story’, or the rational, conscious conceptualization of the
archetype). We principally refer to the archetypal ‘image’ outlined
above but note when we discuss other archetypal instantiations.
We consider each instantiation of archetypes as arising from 
fundamental patterns, or semantic themes, principally expressed 
and depicted through interplay between the visual modality (i.e. 
as “archaic images”), low-level cortex, and affective/subcortical 
systems (see below for further discussion. The resultant archety-
pal patterns and themes transcend the individual (i.e., they are 
universal, shared, or collective), and are multi-scale: (i.e., they 
apply both at a low (e.g., sensory visual, in some cases geomet-
ric)), and high, abstract level (such as benevolent or malevolent 
others). In keeping with the complexity of the issues at hand, 
our cardinal aim is to raise questions on the processes by which 
phenomenological experiences of archetypes arise. We thus note
that we do not seek to provide a definitive framework under which
archetypes must be understood. Rather, we seek to understand
and discuss the neural correlates, primarily of archetypal images,
or the experience of archetypes, such as when one enters altered
states of consciousness.
We further suggest that advances in the neurosciences 
enable planning of experiments that could test key tenets of 
Jungian psychology , especially as they pertain to the construct
2 | McGovernet al.
of archetypes. We take inspiration from the complementary 
frameworks of the Bayesian Brain, Hierarchical Pr edictive
Processing, and the Free-Energy Principle (Friston 2010) a n d w e 
consider psychedelic (translated “psyche revealing”) drugs as 
powerful tools for probing the target phenomena of interest. 
Specifically , we propose that archetypes can be understood as 
shared minima, evinced by regular or stable spatiotemporal 
patterns that encode sufficiently stable patterns or themes across 
conspecifics. That is, for the experience to be shared, we assume 
that the specific properties of its br ain instantiation must be
sufficiently conserved or consistent across individuals. In other
words, there must be a shared (neural and cultural) basis for
specific archetypal experiences (i.e. archetypes as such).
Although the task won’t be easy , we argue that the empiri-
cal work we consider could lend ‘construct’ validity to the Jun-
gian notion of the “collective unconscious” where archetypes are 
a special property of this that can be evoked and examined. 
Validating constructs from psychoanalytic psychology (e.g. by 
demonstrating the shared biological basis of shared archetypal 
images or visions) will have broad and specific implications. These 
implications include increasing the validity of psychoanalytic psy-
chology and the utility of psychedelic drugs as experimental tools 
for inducing the emergence of relevant phenomena. Moreover, 
validation of theoretical principles from depth psychology lends
a scientific grounding to some of the guiding assumptions of
psychoanalytic psychotherapy . Lastly , the work we propose will
have implications for competing epistemologies, for example, by
demonstrating the biological (brain) basis of exceptional or so-
called “mystical” experiences (
Romeo et al. 2021). Below, we situ-
ate our discussion by rehearsing the fundamental assumptions of 
the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Predictive Processing. We then 
move to discussion of the affective and subcortical/limbic basis 
of archetypes as such, archetypal imagery , and how psychedelic 
effects solicit archetypal imagery (i.e. letting off the leash, see p.
9), before finishing with discussion of how such archetypal instan-
tiations flow between conspecifics. We conclude with offering
implications of this novel synthesis.
Before proceeding with rehearsal of key neuroscientific con-
cepts, we will briefly orient the reader to core Jungian concepts. 
Jung posits that the psyche consists of both interpersonal and 
transpersonal aspects. Most relevant for our purposes is the 
notion of the collective unconscious, a tr anspersonal aspect of
the psyche in which lie archetypes, defined broadly as innate and
preconceptual forms that provide shape to emotion, perception,
and meaning (
Jung 1959). Importantly , archetypes are proposed to 
manifest in several ways, including in symbolic motifs, mythology , 
imagery or patterns, or altered states of consciousness. Jung notes 
that archetypes are not reducible to specific contents (i.e. there is 
no one instantiation of an archetype) but instead reflect recurring 
propensities toward how subjective experience is organized,
which Jung has referred to as typified modes of apprehension
(
Jung 1959). 
In what follows, we note that our aim is not to provide neu-
roanatomical mappings of Jungian constructs. Rather, we seek 
to explore how recent advances in the neurosciences provide 
clarity on the neurological conditions under which archetypal 
content becomes more especially salient and how the hierarchi-
cally structured organization of the brain affords the emergence 
and experience of the collective unconscious and archetypes. We 
are careful to note the fact that Jungian concepts are symbolic and 
imaginal in nature, marking them as particularly rich. We seek 
to draw parallels with Jungian symbolic or imaginary language,
and the mechanistic accounts of contemporary neuroscience,
rather than proposing a one-to-one mapping. We thus seek to
offer a ‘synthesis’, wherein Jungian thought can be meaningfully
described in terms of modern neuroscience, without losing the
theoretical richness of Jung’s work.
The Free Energy Principle and predicti ve
processing
Primarily attempting to explain imperatives for self-organizing 
systems, the FEP extends the Helmholtzian notion of unconscious
inference (Helmholtz 1867). The FEP assumes adaptive cognitive 
systems instantiate hierarchically organized models to minimize 
variational ‘free energy’—an information theoretic term indexing
divergence between predicted and sampled data in the sensorium
(
Friston 2010). The FEP describes how the brain resolves a funda-
mental imperative of biological systems, namely , to resist nature’s 
natural tendency toward entropy . For individual organisms and 
the brain, this imperative—of remaining in characteristic and 
sustainable states (i.e. attr acting states)—translates to a recur-
rent (short-term) motivation to avoid surprise (or variational free
energy , often cast as prediction error;
Friston 2010). 
Predictive pr ocessing
Falling under the general framework of the FEP , predictive pro-
cessing suggests the brain, to attain its imperative of reducing 
surprise, self-organizes to match and anticipate the most likely
causes of sensory data (
Keller and Mrsic-Flogel 2018). Predictive 
processing assumes bottom–up and top–down circuits operate in 
terms of “message passing” to facilitate prediction or modeling 
of the environment. In predictive coding formulations of implicit 
Bayesian belief updating, ascending (bottom–up) prediction errors 
update r epresentations or statistical expectations—at higher lev-
els—to resolve prediction errors at lower levelsviadescending
(top–down) predictions. (
Friston 2010, Hohwy 2013). Top–down 
neural activity linked to re-entrant loops (i.e. recurrent message 
passing between hierarchical levels; seeBastos et al. 2012, Walsh 
et al. 2020) propagate predictions about inputs given a prior rep-
resentation about its cause (Friston 2010). Conversely , ascendant 
signals from sensory levels propagate e nsuing prediction error
(Friston 2008, Friston 2010, Clark 2013). If descending predictions 
sufficiently account for the ascendant sensory signals, no predic-
tion error or surprise is registered. In such cases, the prediction 
error is “explained away”— via inhibitory mechanisms—driven by
descending or top–down information flow encoding “predictions”
from the higher cortex (
Friston 2010). 
These recursive exchanges with the external milieu, and recur-
rent message passing in cortical circuits, facilitate the emergence 
of a generative world model. The hierarchical minimization of 
prediction error is key here, as it offers a criterion on which 
organisms can build and update a world model that can gener-
ate sensory predictions: allowing then to subsequently explain 
sensory data. This framework allows us to describe how the 
brain makes sense of—and resolves—ambiguous sensory data. 
A crucial aspect here is that relatively higher regions of this
hierarchy encode more abstract information accrued over longer
temporal windows, whereas lower levels encode more concrete,
sensory representations accrued over shorter temporal windows
(
Hasson et al. 2015, Friedman and Robbins 2022). 
Predictions, ontogeny, and evolution
An important point here is that the brain, and by virtue its predic-
tive capacities, is not formed in vitro, but is steadily constructed 
and scaffolded throughout development. To properly understand
how archetypal material is constrained in hierarchical generative
Eigenmodes of the deep unconscious| 3
models (we later describe psychedelic experiences as relaxing or 
letting these constraints “off the leash”), we first need to situate 
brain dev elopment within a broader ontogenetic and evolutionar-
ily literate framework.
The dynamic of ascending signals from subcortical structures, 
with accompanying constraint from descending cortical pre-
dictions, may r eflect a more general neurodevelopmental and
evolutionary pattern.
Sterelny (2012) notes that human lineages 
are characterized by an unusually long ontogeny encompassing 
infancy , childhood, adolescence, and beyond. This extended 
developmental arc is important for two reasons. First, it allows 
an extended period of cultural scaffolding and intergenerational 
apprenticeship through repeated engagement with culturally 
specific or mediated practices such as storytelling, through which 
children learn to interpret emotional experience via symbolic 
narratives like myth and folklore. This supports the development 
of what Sterelny calls an information commons. Second, extended
ontogeny introduces a developmental lag between the early
emergence of affectively salient subcortical systems and the
later maturation and integration of large-scale cortical networks
such as the default mode and frontoparietal control networks
(
Fair et al. 2008, Andrews-Hanna et al. 2014, Sherman et al. 2014, 
Whitaker et al. 2016). 
Research in developmental neuroscience shows that regula-
tory networks important for higher-order cognition and inhibitory 
control are only sparsely connected in early and middle childhood 
and become mor e coherent in late adolescence. This lag has been
described as a neural maturation gap (
Jones 2013), where evolu-
tionarily ancient brain systems and more recently evolved cortical 
structures are not yet fully differentiated or coordinated. This gap 
may increase vulnerability to psychopathology but also provides 
a neur odevelopmental basis for what Jung referred to as the
split psyche (
Jung 1921/2014b). For Jung, the tension between ego 
consciousness and the broader collective unconscious reflected a 
deeper antagonism betw een recently evolved and more ancient
brain structures (
Jung 2014b, pp. 253–264). In particular, Jung 
suggested that ego development could create intrapsychic disso-
ciation, soliciting conflict between what one consciously aims to 
be, and what one unconsciously is. Such tension, in turn, could
create neuroses, but also can initiate the process of individuation
when properly symbolically integrated.
Clark (2022, 2025) develops this insight further, arguing that 
Jung’s psychic antagonism maps onto the asynchronous emer-
gence of subcortical and cortical systems. From this perspective, 
the split psyche reflects the structure of human ontogeny , specifi-
cally the temporal gap between early developing affective systems
and later developing regulatory systems.
Clark (2025) further 
suggests that cultural practices including ritual, myth, and altered 
states of consciousness may be understood not just as social tools 
but as symbolic strategies evolved to manage such mismatch. For 
example, rites of passage do not just transmit cultural norms but 
facilitate symbolic reconciliation between unconscious material 
and ego consciousness. This interpretation resolves a puzzle: if 
altered states are evolutionarily useful, why do they suppress 
the cortical systems central to human cognition? Clark notes 
that such states are not just adaptations in the e volutionary
sense but rather culturally evolved responses to developmental
tensions between evolutionary more ancient affective circuits and
newer regulatory cortical systems. Jung anticipated this idea in his
description of ritual as a symbolic vessel that supports psychic
integration and individuation (
Jung 2014a, Jung 1921). 
The metaphor of being off the leash, developed in what fol-
lows, reflects this developmental architecture. Psychedelic states, 
for example, may briefly disrupt the gating effects of cortical
maturation (
Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), permitting access 
to emotional and archetypal material that is normally inhibited 
in maturity . Such states do not just disrupt cortically instantiated 
prediction but also reveal earlier stages of psychological organi-
sation. In this view, ontogenetic delays in brain development and
their symbolic resolution through cultural forms are crucial to
understanding the reemergence of archetypal content in altered
states of consciousness.
The brain, prediction, and archetypal 
modes of representation
The predictive processing paradigm and accompanying ontoge-
netic and evolutionary frameworks situate the thesis we develop 
here. Namely , we propose that archetypes ‘as such’ and archety-
pal ‘images’ are instantiated via a prediction cascade over var-
ious cortical and subcortical systems. Crucially , we posit that 
these notions of archetypes (i.e. archetypes ‘as such’, archetypal 
‘images’, and archetypal ‘stories’) are instantiated via a “trilogical 
interplay” involving the high-level cortex, the low-level cortex,
and subcortical/affective systems. Below, we review evidence for
how each of these systems supports instantiating archetypes ‘as
such’, archetypal ‘images’, and archetypal ‘stories’, before turning
attention to modes of archetypal transmission.
The affective core and archetypes
The first component of our thesis concerns the affective core of 
archetypes. Jung considered the subcortical systems of the brain 
as the physiological bases for archetypal emergence: character-
ized by an affective core (
Jung 1958). 
I have long thought that, if there is any analogy between psychic and 
physiological processes, the organizing system of the brain must lie 
subcortically on the brain stem. This conjecture arose out of considering 
the psychology of an archetype [the Self] of central importance and 
universal distribution represented in mandala symbols. . . . The reason 
that lead me to conjecture a localization of a physiological basis for this 
archetype in the brain stem was the psycholo gical fact that besides
being specifically characterized by the ordering and orienting role, its
uniting properties are predominantly affective. I would conjecture that
such a subcortical system might somehow reflect characteristic of the
archetypal form of the unconscious.—(Jung 2014, para 582).
This supposition is supported by contemporary neuroscience. 
Subcortical midline structures have recently been referred to 
as the affective core of the self, and a primary filter through
which objects of consciousness are interpreted (
Alcaro et al. 
2017, ( Solms and Friston 2018, Solms 2021). Such structures 
are fundamental processes including regulation of visceral and
somatic states ( Damasio 1996, 1999, Porges 2011), orienting 
movements (e.g. survival stances, sexual behavior) ( Tinbergen 
1951, Denton 2006), and integration of sensory experiences into 
affective value (Merker 2007) ( s e eAlcaro et al. 2017, for overview). 
This has led to speculation that subcortical midline structures 
serve as a fundamental basis of primordial subjectivity in humans
and animals (
Panksepp 2016, Seth et al. 2005, Northoff and 
Panksepp 2008, Edelman and Seth 2009, Panksepp and Northoff 
2009, Revonsuo 2009, Ward 2011, Panksepp and Biven 2012, 
Fabbro et al. 2015, Feinberg and Mallatt 2016). This notion is 
reflected in Jung’s perspective of the mind as hierarchical and 
proposed to be supported by a hierarchical neural architecture
(
Alcaro et al. 2017).
4 | McGovernet al.
A crucial aspect of the thesis forwarded here is that these sub-
cortical and limbic systems must project predictions into cortical 
structures, so to facilitate the emergence of subsequent collating 
of information that supports archetypal imagery . At the level of
the brain, this necessitates predictions regarding the self and the
world, fed from subcortical and limbic regions (
Joseph 1992) t o 
cortical regions, to integrate affectively based predictions into a 
kind of general representation instantiated by cortical structures
(Hansen et al. 2024). This is supported by recent work (Siman-Tov 
et al. 2019, Clark et al. 2021, Ficco et al. 2021). Siman-Tov et al. 
(2019) found evidence of a ‘prediction network’ involving directed 
predictions from subcortical structures which enact influence on 
how cortical structures integr ate sensory information. Subcortical
regions such as the thalamus
Sherman and Guillery 2006, Halassa and Kastner 2017, p a r -
ticularly the pulvinar (Saalmann and Kastner 2011) can medi-
ate the influence of top–down cortical predictions, and tr ansmit
predictions to cortical regions (Kanai et al. 2015). Solms 2019, 
Solms 2021) formulates the influence of certain subcortical struc-
tures as equipping cortical prediction errors with the right preci-
sion, through ascending (classical) modulatory projections. In this 
sense , this influence underwrites affect and anxious feelings as
a form of “felt uncertainty” (e.g. seeMcGovern et al. 2022) ( N B , 
precision is the counter-weight of uncertainty) (Solms 2018, Solms 
2021). 
Synthesis 
Jung suggested archetypes likely emerge from subcortical regions, 
particularly the brain stem, and are likely characterized by an 
affective core. The evidence above points to an organizing and 
central role of subcortical systems in subserving subjectivity and 
projecting predictions—including predictions of precision—to a 
hierarchically higher cortex. Subsequent representations in the 
cortex are thus infused with this affective undertone. This is 
supported by comparative and neuroscientific work, which sug-
gests that subcortical structures, particularly midline subcortical
structures, may serve as an affective core, thence serving as
a fundamental basis of primordial subjectivity in humans and
animals alike.
The archetypal image and altered states
Jung distinguished between archetypes ‘as such’ (tendency to 
form predictions, and stemming from subcortical regions) and 
archetypal ‘images’. These images were proposed to be the 
sensory instantiations of archetypes ‘as such’ and are o ften
experienced in altered states of consciousness, such as those
solicited by psychedelic drugs and in the dream or dreamlike
states (
Carhart-Harris 2007). Subjective reports of archetypal 
‘images’ (in the Jungian sense) are a consistent theme in
psychedelic and dream states ( Masters and Houston 2000; 
Shanon 2002, Lawrence et al. 2022). This is consistent with 
much of what Jung argued, namely , that the unconscious houses
psychological remnants of phylogenetic ancestry (Carhart-Harris 
2007, Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). Under psychedelics, these often 
latent and recurrent themes become manifest in conscious 
experience. This is consistent with the phenomenology of 
psychedelic experiences, where people often r eport encounters
with archetypal patterns and beings (e.g.feminine archetypes, divine
beings). Jung states:
“Experiments along the line of mescaline and related drugs are cer-
tainly most interesting, since such drugs lay bare a level of the 
unconscious that is otherwise accessible only under peculiar psychic 
conditions. It is a fact that you get certain perceptions and experiences
of things appearing either in mystical states or in the analysis of
unconscious phenomena”—
Jung 2015, p. 382.
The phenomenological alterations under psychedelics are 
thought to be because serotonergic psychedelics are 5-HT 2A 
agonists. 5-HT 2A receptors mediate neuromodulatory changes 
in postsynaptic gain (i.e. modulate precision) and are densely 
expressed in domain-general regi ons of cortex such as not only
the high-level cortex, including the default mode network (DMN),
but also the primary visual cortex (V1) (
Beliveau et al. 2017, 
Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019). The affinity of serotonergic 
psychedelics toward 5-HT2A receptors—densely expressed in the 
high-level cortex—is thought to result its functional disintegra-
tion (a.k.a. loss of intra-network functional connectivity), with
concomitant increased connectivity between networks (
Lebedev 
et al. 2015, Tagliazucchi et al. 2016, Girn et al. 2023). In other 
words, regions of high-level cortex become less entraining of 
lower-level regions and more sensitive to ascending inputs (c.f. 
ascending prediction errors from hierarchically lower levels). In 
the acute phase, psychedelics decrease functional connectivity
in intrinsic networks, and increase between-network cross-talk
(
Roseman et al. 2014, Lebedev et al. 2015, Palhano-Fontes et al. 
2015, Carhart-Harris et al. 2016, Nichols 2016, Tagliazucchi et al. 
2016, Atasoy et al. 2017, Müller et al. 2018, Mason et al. 2020, 
Mertens et al. 2020, De Gregorio et al. 2021, Grandjean et al. 2021, 
Daws et al. 2022, Madsen et al. 2021). 
Moreover, insofar as psychedelics increase between-network 
connectivity , they alter consciousness experience (Letheby and 
Gerrans 2017, Müller et al. 2018, Smigielski et al. 2019, Mason 
et al. 2020, dos Santos and Hallack 2021, Daws et al. 2022). As 
such, the acute phase of the psychedelic experience is thought 
to be characterized by a sharp departure in brain dynamics: 
from a modular and functionally segregated organization to more
chaotic and distributed neuronal dynamics (
Palhano-Fontes et al. 
2015, Smigielski et al. 2019, Girn et al. 2023). 
With the classic psychedelics, visual imagery or hallucina-
tions during the acute psychedelic experience seemingly result 
from the impact of activation of 5-HT 2A receptors. This activa-
tion, in turn, enhances excitability of layer 5 pyramidal cells
in the cortex, facilitating increased glutamate release (
Nichols 
2016, Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019, Mason et al. 2020). Acti-
vation of cortical 5-HT2A receptors results in asynchronous gluta-
mate release, causing subsequent asynchr onous activity in neural
ensembles (
Riba et al. 2006, Celada et al. 2008, Nichols 2016, Tagli-
azucchi et al. 2014). Spontaneous ensemble activity subsequently 
becomes more asynchronous, with the end r esults being a loss
of synchronous gain (Aghajanian and Marek 1999, Tagliazucchi 
et al. 2014). See Chawla et al. (1999) for a mechanistic discussion 
of this neuromodulatory effect. These disruptions translate across 
scales [i.e. at the initial level of a spike-to-wave decoupling, then 
ensemble-level fields, netw ork “disintegration,” and whole-brain
level network desegregation (Nutt et al. 2020, Girn et al. 2023)]. 
Perceptually , this “entropic” and “anarchic” quality of brain 
function is hypothesized to parallel a decreased precision of 
predictive mechanisms (predictions are referred to as “priors” 
in Bayesian nomenclature) such that, for example, precepts are 
less stable and constrained. An increased sensitivity to ascending
afferents is a corollary of the relaxation of top–down predictive
mechanisms. Also in parallel, an excitation (
Aqil and Roseman 
2023) of lower levels of the functional hierarchy (e.g. the visual 
cortex) likely drives ascending information flow from the visual
Eigenmodes of the deep unconscious| 5
cortex up the visual hierarchy . This mechanism may encode 
reports of increased information content in conscious experience
(Timmermannet al.2023)—also scored as increased psychological 
insight (Lyons et al. 2024). In one model, the relaxation of entrain-
ing and constraining top–down information flow, combined with a 
direct excitation of visual regions in particular, driving ascending
information flow (
Aqil and Roseman 2023) could account for the 
arising of archetypal ‘images’ such as patterns and beings under 
psychedelic drugs, where “information” carried by excitation of 
an organized or structured visual cortex is allowed to propagate 
(Ermentrout and Cowen 1979). Some recent d ata suggest that
this manifests as higher spatiotemporal frequency patterns or
harmonics on the cortical surface and across the whole brain
(Atasoy et al. 2016,
Atasoy et al. 2017). Harmonics here refer to 
spatiotemporal patterns of activity arising from the brain’s con-
nectome. As musical harmonics can describe the vibrations of a 
violin string, harmonics refer to the patterns of how brain activity 
propagates across the cortex. These connectome harmonics thus
come to resemble a kind of base set of possible states the brain can
inhabit, with higher-frequency harmonics corresponding to more
complex and detailed activation patterns (
Atasoy et al. 2017). 
With respect to archetypes, it is reasonable to posit that a 
flattening of the implicit free energy landscape—mediated by a 
loss of synchronous gain and precision in the (otherwise entrain-
ing) descending information flow (
Girn et al. 2022, Singleton 
et al. 2022)—could enable the arising of (unstable) motifs or 
images encoded in ascending information flow and ordinarily 
latent or suppressed. These motifs are ordinarily precluded from 
conscious experience (due to the constraining and entraining 
influence o f precise (heavily weighted) descending activity from
higher levels of the cortex onto lower levels (
Girn et al. 2022). 
The hypothesized “release” via decreased pr ecision-weighting of
priors (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019) and direct excitation 
of lower sensory representations (Aqil and Roseman 2023) m a y 
cause archetypes to enter conscious awareness, i.e. as a rchetypal
imagery , patterns, and symbolism (Szára 2014, Gallimore and Luke 
2015), analogous, perhaps, to a projector projecting (affect-laden) 
visual information onto a screen (Winkelman 2018). 
In phenomenological terms, archetypal visions (e.g. ‘entity 
encounters, sages, feminine phenotypes, processes of transforma-
tion’) under psychedelics may arise due to: (i) indirect eman-
cipatory effect through dysregulated activity in the high-level
cortex (
Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019) and (ii) a direct excitation 
effect within visual cortex ( Aqil and Roseman 2023) causing 
distinct spatiotemporal patterns (encoding representations) to 
resonate throughout the brain’s functional hierarchy . We do not 
discount a role for medial temporal structures, and the ventral 
visual stream in particular, performing a similar role, i.e. high-
frequency spatiotempor al patterns or “harmonics” traversing
the visual hierarchy , connecting V1 to the higher-level medial
temporal regions (see
Carhart-Harris 2007). Empirically , one might 
predict a “flip” in the directionality of traveling waves between 
these hierarchical levels under a psychedelic, such that there is 
less top–down and mor e bottom–up information flow, as seen
previously in two independent studies with DMT (
Alamia et al. 
2020, Timmermann et al. 2023). It is curious to hypothesize 
that this phenomenon may differentiate the visually rich DMT 
experience from the typically less visual 5-MeO-DMT experience, 
the latter being an atypical psychedelic apparently without an
appreciable 5-HT
2A agonist action.
Phenomenological accounts of archetypal beings (e.g. sages, 
witches, angels) and processes (e.g. rites of passage/coming of 
age, hero’s journey) could therefore reflect the outlay of innate 
(complex) spatiotemporal patterns underlying recurrent social
cognitive scripts and representations of ancestral social life
(
McGovern et al. 2025) that are conserved across individuals 
within our species. As such, experiences of archetypes under 
psychedelic drugs may be a product of the human brain 
representing recurrent social motifs and themes accumulated 
by sensory and affectively charged encounters and stored, 
represented, and then released by liberated information flow 
under specific conditions. Almost by default, these would reflect 
the kinds of recurrent ada ptive challenges and motifs (e.g.
transformation or coming of age processes) and representations
that were salient for a successful navigation of ancestral social
life (e.g. protector figures, the mother archetype) (
Neumann 2015). 
Synthesis: psychedelic brain effects and 
archetypal representation
We have thus far offered a synthesis and explanation of how 
the neurobiological effects of psychedelic drugs may relate to the 
phenomenological experience of archetypal (entity) encounters
often reported under psychedelic drugs. Psychedelics increase the
entropy of spontaneous cortical activity (
Schartner et al.2017)a n d 
disrupt hierarchical information passing in the acute phase of a
psychedelic “trip” (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019). This is con-
sistent with the notion of hierarchically higher regions losing their 
characteristic constraining and entraining influence on lower-
level sensory systems. In turn, this could mean that the archetypal 
imagery and simulations latent in the brain can be “liberated” 
under such conditions (i.e. archetypes as such in subcortical/lim-
bic regions, archetypal stories in the default mode network, and 
archetypal images in the visual cortex). This effect may be dose-
dependent: where higher doses are required to engage and disrupt
the deepest aspects of the hierarchy , while lower doses may
favor the direct excitation of low-level aspects (
Aqil and Roseman 
2023), which encode more elemental features, such as spatial
geometries, motion, and color (Ermentrout and Cowan 1979). 
Psychedelics could thus enable the brain to liberate archetypal 
simulations, causing a liber ated or anarchic quality to message
passing (Alamia et al. 2020) (we note this would be dependent 
on affective structures first being engaged first, projecting to the 
higher cortex, which then descends predictions to the sensory 
cortex). We suspect that this may manifest as an increase in spa-
tiotemporally finer-grained brain activity patterns or “harmonics”
and a decrease in coarse-grained (information constraining or
compressing) patterns (Atasoy et al. 2016; 2017; Siegel et al. 2024). 
Thus, the relinquishment of typical top–down, hierarchical causa-
tion in the brain and the liberation of bottom-up flow may mean 
that phenomenological (archetypal) visions can shimmer into 
perceptual awareness, as representations of recurrent motifs from 
our shared ancestral environments and encounters as human 
animals. Having discussed the neurological basis of archetypes 
‘as such’, and ar chetypal ‘images’, we now attend to the ways in
which archetypal ‘stories’ come to be represented and transmit-
ted between conspecifics.
From the personal to the collective: the collectiv e
unconscious and modes of transmission
Consistent with his predecessor and mentor—Freud—Carl Jung 
argued that cognition could be parsed into different subtypes 
such as primary and secondary processing. Secondary processing 
refers to cognition of modern humans in a standard waking 
state, and the former being an archaic style of cognition, now
only entered during altered states such as dreaming. Recent
work argues that Freudian ideas such as the ego, primary , and
6 | McGovernet al.
secondary processing could be usefully recast in terms of hier-
archical predictive processing (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2010). 
Specifically ,Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) argued that the 
secondary process cognition—which could also be called “ego 
consciousness”—relates to the functioning of high-level trans-
modal cortex with the DMN being an exemplary system in this 
regard. In that work, special emphasis is placed on the DMN 
constraining activity within limbic and paralimbic systems, a
default style of information processing that is likely to underpin
the controlled, executive quality of ego-consciousness and the
“civilized” behaviors it subserves.
Carl Jung largely accepted the core tenets of psychoanalysis put 
forward by Freud but began his theoretical divergence by exam-
ining and highlighting the importance of the “collective uncon-
scious” (see
Jung 1936, 1959). Specifically , whereas constructs such 
as libido, the “id,” repression, and other defense mechanisms are 
classically Freudian—being especially pertinent to an individual’s 
own psychology and experience—Carl Jung argued that much 
of the unconscious is shared among individuals, which is to 
say , its character is “collective” or universal in nature. Jung took 
special inspiration from religious iconography where he high-
lighted common patterns or themes, which he argued reflect 
foundational matters pertinent to human evolution and thus, 
human nature. Jung r eferred to these common cross-cultural
patterns and themes as “archetypes”—basic semantic elements
or components from which copies or versions can arise—as in
genetic transfer to progeny , where there is mostly conservation (of
information encoded within the parents’ genome and “memome”
or culture) but also some natural variation.
A brief point of clarification here is how Jung conceptualized 
his notion of the ‘unconscious’ in contradistinction to Freud. 
Scholars have begun to question the assumption that Jung 
developed his notion of the unconscious primarily in opposition 
to Freud, suggesting that his conception of the unconscious
was likely derived from a deeper and common lineage with
19th-century German Romantic Philosophy , especially of the
Naturphisosophentradition (
Balenci 2022, Clark 2023). Indeed, Jung 
himself noted affinities between his own conception and that 
of scholars such as Schelling and Carus (Jung 2014a, p .3 ,Jung 
2014b, p. 515). In contradistinction to Freud’s more retrospective 
and reductive notion of the unconscious, these earlier notions 
conceptualize the unconscious as serving a futur e-oriented and
creative function, which has been described as prospection-
oriented and ripe with unactualized potential ( Rogers 2020). 
Indeed, recent treatments of such traditions point to their overlap 
with Jung’s emphasis on mythological imagery and symbolism
(
McGrath 2012, Cambray 2017, Barentsen 2020, Clark 2023). Most 
important for our thesis, this notion of the unconscious confers 
a more natural overlap with phenomenology of psychedelics, 
wherein e ncounters with meaningful and prospective insights are
a predominant feature (
Gandy et al. 2022, McGovern et al. 2024, 
Kugel et al. 2025). On this view, the German Romantic lineage 
offers a more accurate intellectual genealogy of Jung’s thought, 
and a richer framework for understanding how unconscious
content manifests during altered states.
Jung called the archetypes ‘archaic images’ implying that they 
generally express in the visual or imagistic modality and that they 
are evolutionarily ancient, being pr eserved across many genera-
tions, effectively canalized into the human psyche (
Carhart-Harris 
et al. 2022); why? Because they are recurrent salient aspects of 
our character as a species. Another important distinction between 
Freudian and Jungian psychology is the emphasis Jung placed 
on spiritual experience and its relationship to the emergence of 
the unconscious into consciousness. Indeed, Jung believed his 
psychology better reflected the quality and capacity of the human 
psyche that transcends the ego, and he argued Freud placed
excessive emphasis on sexuality and negative, e.g., aggressive
qualities of the psyche.
Thus, in assuming a broader range of themes and motifs to 
human cognition and behavior, Jung argued beyond the notion 
of a personal unconscious, for a collective unconscious that was
universal and a product of a common, inherited past (Jung 1912, 
1919). Prototypical notions of the collective unconscious were 
initially outlined in Symbols of Transformation (1912). The idea of 
the term “collective unconscious” was iter ated further in Instincts
and the Unconscious (1919) and then expanded on in lectures in
1936 (Jung 1936), Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (1959), 
and in a lecture called “The Concept of the Collective Unconscious”
(Jung 1936). Jung argues that aside from the individual uncon-
scious, there are inherited patterns of thought common to all
humans. He writes:
“My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate con-
sciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we 
believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal 
unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of 
a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all 
individuals. This collective unconscious d oes not develop individually
but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes,
which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite
form to certain psychic contents”—Jung,Archetypes of the Collective
Unconscious,1959, p. 43.
It should be noted here that there are more and less deflationary 
interpretations of the collective unconscious. A more deflationary 
account is that the collective unconscious simply corresponds to 
the fact that human brains have pr edispositions about the types
of mental models they would form, based on what is common
across human populations through evolutionary history (
Gooch 
1972). More elaborate, metaphysical accounts consider the col-
lective unconscious as being a means o f accessing some type of
divine aspect of being (seeCook 1987). We work with the more 
deflationary account that the collective unconscious as simply a 
propensity to form specific internal psychological patterns and 
imagery based on commonalities across ancestral populations 
that share the same (cultural) eco-niche and thereby come to
share the same generative models of their lived world.
The social brain and archetypal stories in the
collective unconscious
Extending on Freudian formulations, Jung suggested that human 
motivation to action was drawn from a broader set than aggres-
sion and sex or “thanatos” and “eros” (Freud 2001). 
The (collective) unconscious, Jung proposed, consists of sym-
bolism of basic life processes (e.g. ‘Birth, Initiation’), and social 
roles (e.g. ‘Mother, Father, Child’).Jung further proposed that such 
mental imagery was represented in m ythology and folklore, as
well as in dreams (e.g. Undirected Thinking—seePsychological
Ty p e s,Jung 1921, pp. 20–50). Jung labelled these mental symbols 
“archetypes” and proposed that the y are universal to all humans.
“Just as the human body represents a whole museum or organs, each 
with a long evolutionary history behind it, so we should expect to find 
that the mind is organised in a similar way. It can no more be a produce
without history than is the body in which it exists...I am referring to
Eigenmodes of the deep unconscious| 7
the biological, prehistoric, and unconscious development of the mind in 
archaic man, whose psyche was still closer to that of an animal”(Jung 
1959, p. 64) .
One issue, which requires brief elaboration, is the notion of 
inheritance. It is sometimes inter preted that inheritance here
means a kind of genetic inheritance (see
Goodwyn 2020). However, 
Jung noted in later work that this is not what he meant and 
instead noted that archetypes would arise via complex r eciprocal
interaction between natural selection, cultural, and learning
processes (see also Becker and Neuberg 2019). Moreover, the 
notion of archetypes is often misinterpreted as being specific to a 
particular image (e.g. the mother archetype being consciousl y
imagined as representing one’s actual mother). On this, he
noted:
“The term ‘archetype’ is often misunderstood as meaning certain 
definite mythological images or motifs. But these are nothing more 
than conscious representations; it would be absurd to think that 
such variable representations could be inherited. The archetype is the 
tendency to form such representations of a motif- representation that
can vary a great deal in their detail without losing their basic patterns.
There are, for instance, many representations of the hostile brethren,
but the motif itself remains the same (
Jung and von Franz 1964, 
p. 58).
Thus, while the specifics of the representation are not inherited, 
the basic motif (i.e. archetype ‘as such’) is. Recent work has 
reformulated archetypes in accor dance with modern advances in
evolutionary psychology , niche construction and cognitive science
(
Creanza and Feldman 2014, Laland et al. 2016, Heyes 2018, Bad-
cock et al. 2019, Vaughn Becker and Neuberg 2019, Veissiere et a l.
2019, Vasil et al. 2020, Krafft et al. 2021). 
This work ( Vaughn Becker and Neuberg 2019) describes 
archetypes as such arising from core social goals and motivations 
that characterized ancestral social environments. According to 
this view, archetypes can be characterized as “core representa-
tions of social instincts: dynamic patterns of perception, memory , 
and action that develop ontogenetically (they can take culturally
and individually variable forms) within phylogenetically sculpted
channels that preserve a species typical form” (
Vaughn Becker 
and Neuberg 2019, p. 59). Eager readers will recognize the 
relevance of “canalization” to this description of “phylogeneticall y
sculpted channels” as the two are synonymous (Carhart-Harris 
et al. 2022). Whilst archetypal representation likely reflects the 
social–cognitive challenges faced by ancestral populations (where 
challenges are evolutionary pressures that drive natural selection, 
and thus, phenotypic canalization), variance of life experiences
necessitates them being crucially dependent on experience (see
Cosmides 2000, Becker and Neuberg 2019). 
Complementary work has aimed to recast archetypes under 
the rubric of the FEP . This work suggests archetypes correspond 
to internal representations or mental simulations of recurrent
social patterns and species’ typical motivation across evolution
(
McGovern et al.2025). These accounts share the perspectives that 
archetypal representations may arise as a function of specific sur-
vival imperatives (e.g. avoid being killed by hostile beings), result-
ing in social–motivational systems (e.g. avoiding hostile beings), 
resulting in a propensity for humans to evolve psychological 
(and neurological) templates enabling optimal navigation of these
threats (e.g. hostile or malevolent archetypes such as the monster
or beast, trickster, or witch;
Hess et al. 1997 Marsh et al. 2005, 
Neuberg and Schaller 2015; McGovern et al.2025). We touch on the 
mechanisms of how archetypes (i.e. archetypal stories) emerge
below.
Synthesis: the default mode, archetypal 
tr ansmission, and archetypal story
The claims advanced by recent work on archetypes ( Vaughn 
Becker and Neuberg 2019) are commensurate with the notion 
that brain activity (as a hierarchical inference) gives rise to the 
emergence of archetypes. Much research supports the notion that 
the brain integrates sensory data and creates generativ e models
of the world through recursive and ongoing sensory feedback and
initiates predictive simulations based on this feedback (Mesulam 
2002, Buckner et al. 2008, Hassabis and Maguire 2009, Yeshurun 
et al. 2021). This multimodal information descends the subcor-
tical–cortical hierarchy and becomes more concrete (and less 
abstract) the closer the proximity to sensory regions. Via this 
ongoing sensory feedbac k, the domain-general cortex is thought
to impose high-level (more abstract) priors on sensory input (Parr 
et al.2022). If we accept the generative model may be differentially 
susceptible to updating as a function of developmental stage (e.g. 
an infant primarily motivated toward attainment of food and 
safety , differentiating their mother from stranger, or an adolescent 
prioritizing social acceptance)—and that domain-general regions 
generate descending predictions for sensory regions—then it is
plausible to imagine that archetypal scripts may be encodedvia
reciprocal and recursive exchange with external milieu.
If forced to offer a mechanistic hypothesis, it seems natural to 
speculate that archetypal ‘images’ and ‘stories’ will be encoded in 
the brain’s functional architecture, with archetypal ‘stories’ more
likely to be encoded in temporally slow trajectories, see
Peill et al. 
2024, for example. The representation of archetypal ‘images’ may 
depend on a flip in information flow, away from the ordinarily 
dominant constraining, entraining, and compressing top–down 
flow to something more anarchic and free-flowing. Thus, our 
thesis could be stated as ‘archetypes manifest when the high-level 
cortex and the lower-level cortex exchange information more 
freely and with greater parity’. In terms of a functional marker 
of this effect, an expanded repertoire of brain states including 
lower as well as higher-frequency spatiotemporal wave patterns
(harmonics) traversing the brain’s various hierarchical levels, may
be a promising candidate marker or index to empirically explore
(
Atasoy et al. 2017). Another would be the so-called “collapse” 
of the brain’s functional gradient (Girn et al. 2022), decreased 
top–down and increased bottom–up information flow—as seen 
through altered travelling wave patterns, for example (Alamia 
et al. 2020), and increased fine-grained (and decreased coarse-
grained) spatiotemporal patterns in brain activity (Atasoy et al. 
2016, 2017, 2018, Siegel et al. 2024). There is another possibility , 
however, which is the transient recovery of constraint or organiza-
tion in brain activity within the psychedelic state, “pushing back” 
against an otherwise entropic background. This could be con-
strued as unstable attractors, like saddle points, where archetypal 
images not only form but also readily fragment or change. It is
a working hypothesis, motivated by preliminary data pertaining
to DMT “entity encounters” that such transient “negentropic”
moments underlie the emergence of complex visions such as DMT
entity encounters (
Timmermann et al. 2019). 
It is a central position of this piece that archetypes emerge 
because of recurrent evolutionary pressures, and associated 
patterned sensory encounters and behavioral practices, through 
human phylogeny (see below). In a sense, the general theme
of learning and the evolutionary construct of “canalization”
bears some relevance in this regard. We also propose that the
8 | McGovernet al.
manifestation of these simulations occur via the mechanisms 
of hierarchical generative models (see Kiefer and Hohwy 2018, 
Ramstead et al. 2022). These representational systems are 
experientially dependent and emerge due to a complex interplay 
between innate (and thus, evolved) cognitive phenotypes and 
(developmentally contingent) en vironmental feedback reinforc-
ing when serving beneficial adaptation, in keeping with principles
of natural selection.
Or, in terms of variational free energy minimization, Bayesian
model selection (Frank 2012, Campbell 2016, Da Costa et al. 2021, 
Vanchurin et al. 2022, Friston et al. 2023). 
We note that the specific content of archetypal representa-
tions naturally varies according to cultural context, but the same
underlying themes are apparent (seeVaughn Becker and Neuberg 
2019), i.e. in their most basic form, archetypes are uni versal and
culturally independent.
Social–motivational attractors: fundamental 
motivators as attractor sta tes in development
As alluded to above, archetypes may develop, at least in part, 
as a function of the moti vational imperatives during develop-
ment (
Vaughn Becker and Neuberg 2019). Attention is a crucial 
modulator of model building (Feldman and Friston 2010), where 
it modulates the precision weighting or influence of feedfor-
ward information, such as increasing the salience of attended-to 
sensory information. Precise sensory data, when propagated up 
hierarchical le vels, are more likely to influence or update model
parameters and representations (
Feldman and Friston 2010, Parr 
and Friston 2018, 2019). This is well reflected in work that finds 
that more emotionally salient stimuli are more likel y to solicit a
shared neural response among a crowd (Schmälzle et al. 2015). 
Even at high levels of the brain’s functional hierarchy , there is 
evidence that higher attention paid toward different stimuli can 
solicit a more pronounced sync hrony in brain signaling between
conspecifics in higher hierarchical levels (Cohen and Parra 2016, 
Ki et al. 2016). 
Toward a shared narrat ive
An important implication of early attentional propensities is that 
they allow a construction of a shared reality , in which interact-
ing agents communicate and interact from a relatively common
thematic encyclopedia or story book (Campbell 2008). From early 
in development, children seek understanding and to compl y with
normative behaviors (Haun et al. 2014, Köster et al. 2020), a 
mechanism through which downward causation is likely to be 
learned within the brain, mind, and behavior (Freud 1923). As 
such, the attentional patterns and motivation toward normative 
or valued behavior are particularly consequential for the types
of information that would comprise an adaptive internal model
indexing frequent and valued occurrences of the social world.
Consistent with this, recent functional near-infrared spec-
troscopy work observes coupled responses in the prefr ontal
cortex between caregivers and infants (Andrews-Hanna et al. 
2010, Raichle 2015, Buckner and DiNicola 2019), as well as older 
children (Miller et al.2019). In adulthood, the DMN is an important 
hub for remembering and imagining (motivationally relevant) 
events, important for planning and enacting adaptive behaviors
(
Sambuco et al. 2022). The DMN thus seems to support narrative 
building and social action between conspecifics. In turn, this 
enables the internal simulations of recurrent social themes and 
motifs, the kind that constrain generative models (i.e. the set of
predictions descending from higher brain regions).
Enactment of these generative models in action selection may 
result in less surprise (prediction error) and more confidence 
(precision weighted priors) in social exchange and perhaps help
conspecifics reduce each other’s prediction errors, favoring align-
ment (
de Bruin and Michael 2021) or attunement (Stern 1985). 
An emergent question here pertains to what types of behaviors 
or encounters enable organisms to converge on a shared narrative 
or set of assumptions and representation in social exchange. 
In recent work, the notion of asymmetric information flow (i.e. 
when one social agent has more precise priors than another 
based on experience) is leveraged to explain how expectations
attune attentional patterns. This type of information flow is
thought to characterize many interactions between (for exam-
ple) adults and children (see
Vasil et al. 2020). Consistent with 
principles of hierarchical predictive processing, evidence from 
experimental and computational work suggests that expecta-
tions (priors) in older adults ar e relatively more precise than
younger adults and children (Wolpe et al. 2016, Karmali et al. 
2018). This suggests that (particularly older) adults have relatively 
more precise priors (more constraining and “rigid” beliefs) and 
ascribe relatively less precision to incoming sense data (Moran 
et al. 2014). In iterant couplings between infants/children and 
adults, the prior beliefs of more inexperienced conspecifics will 
dominate and influence those of the less experienced, with a
biased directionality toward alignment (
Friston and Frith 2015). 
This coupled and recurrent asymmetric information flow nat-
urally imbues the inexperienced conspecific with the ability to 
learn the kinds of narrative and information that make up a
generalized and generative model (see also
Boyd and Richerson 
1988). In turn, this allows learning and integration of recurrent 
social motifs, and behavioral scripts characterizing their eco-
niche. One can think of such evolutionary learning as a “propagat-
ing facture” (
Azarian 2022), iteratively adding depth to canalized 
phenotypes over generations. Interestingly , recent work character-
izes psychedelic experiences as opening a kind of critical period 
for adults, wherein the dynamic of relaxed beliefs coupled with
the more precise (and hopefully adaptive; see
McGovern et al. 
2024) input of conspecifics, allows model revision (Nardou et al. 
2023). 
With respect to how this evolutionary learning process 
influences belief updating in coupled agents—attunement to the 
(social and environments) niche instantiates a kind of synchro-
nization of prior beliefs (i.e. each other’s mental states)—such 
that the structure and dynamics of embodied brains recapitulate 
the structure and dynamics of the social niche in which they find 
themselves. This is well captured by theoretical wo rk that shows
how endowing two coupled hierarchical dynamical systems with
an expectation to infer hidden causes that generate other agents’
actions, which enables a mutual informational flow that serves
to synchronize statistics of their prior beliefs (
Friston and Frith 
2015). In the case of two communicating agents, prior beliefs are 
thus used to recognize canonical behaviors generated by oneself
and others (seeFriston and Frith 2015, Constant et al. 2018). This 
is substantiated by a series of hyper scanning (i.e. interacting 
brains scanned at the same time), which shows the sync hronizing
effects of cooperative communication between older and younger
conspecifics (
Stephens et al. 2010, Pérez et al. 2017, Nummenmaa 
et al. 2018, Liu et al. 2024). As such, environments with more 
and less experienced social actors allows younger conspecifics 
the ability to learn the value and of behavioral scripts and action
policies that enable convergence to shared narrative and common
representations (Ramstead et al. 2016, Renzi et al. 2017, Veissière 
et al. 2020).
Eigenmodes of the deep unconscious| 9
Interestingly , the degree of interbrain synchrony can predict 
subjective meaningfulness of communication (Stolk et al. 2014, 
Bilek et al. 2022), recall accuracy of communicativ e encounters
(Zadbood et al. 2017), and emotional resonance with p olitical
speech ( Hasson et al. 2012, Hasson and Frith 2016, Schoot 
et al. 2016, Stolk et al. 2016). This suggests that synchronous 
brain dynamics map to attuning attentional policies—enabling 
increased parsimony and overlap in the kinds of generative 
models held by communicative social agents. More generally , this 
process facilitates initially chaotic social dynamics to converge 
on a set of attr actor representations, allowing for a generally
shared narrative. The psychological construct of “communitas” is
relevant in this regard (
Kettner et al. 2021). 
Individual agents can thus instantiate their models via a br a i n 
architecture that is sensitive to information learned over different 
temporal scales, enabling emergence of time-invariant (i.e. how 
to forage for food) and time-variant (i.e. how one greets others 
according to sociocultural niche) social motifs and action policies. 
As such, the archetypal stories and narratives may arise partially
due to this iterative communicative process, coupled with the
hierarchically instantiated architecture of the brain.
Synthesis: development and convergence to a 
collective minima
In this section, we have outlined evidence that infants have atten-
tional regimes that preference the type of information important 
to ancestral populations. This work suggests that the morphology
and core motivational needs of human, throughout our extended
ontogeny (
Sterelny 2012), preference social information. In turn, 
this allows for the learning and integration of socially adaptive 
information. This is reflected in the brains of infants in both 
perceptual tasks and in coupled dynamics with other embod-
ied brains. This learning and integration process depends on a
hierarchically structured neural architecture. Through systems
such as the DMN simulating recurrent social patterns (
Mars 
et al. 2012, Xie et al. 2016), the brain can learn to integrate 
and represent useful and adaptive information. The process of 
multiple embodied brains learning information in the service 
of evolutionary imbued social goals (e.g. ‘seeking a caregiver, 
avoiding predators’) allows the generation of shared narratives 
and representations. Archetypes can therefore be seen as canal-
ized motifs—that have been canalized through recurrent social 
encounters that carry salience for the given species. For example, 
human infants, with their extended ontogeny and exceptional
vulnerability and dependence on others, must be able to model
the notion of a caregiver to discern who serves their survival
and well-being ‘versus’ who does not or who may intend harm
toward them.
Discussion 
We have endeavored to explain how Jungian ideas, particularly 
of the collective unconscious and archetypes, can be reconciled 
with the latest neuroscientific accounts of brain function. Whilst 
this is an ambitious synthesis, we have suggested that there is 
growing evidence that enables us to begin such a project and 
point toward empirical investigations for deepening our under-
standing. Our synthesis, we suggest, carries two primary impli-
cations. First, archetypal representations are likely a reflection of 
social imperatives and motivations enabling resolution of recur-
rent adaptive challenges (e.g. an infant being able to distinguish 
caregiver from non-caregiver) and behavioral scripts facilitating 
their resolution (e.g. a hero’s journey or coming of age process
Figure 1. Depiction of our trilogical interplay model, depicting 
archetypes as such, archetypal images, and archetypal stories within the 
context of the hierarchically instantiated systems in the brain, ranging
from high-level networks to subcortical systems.
enabling acceptance in the local socio-cultural niche). Second,
these representations naturally emerge from the notion of the
brain as an inference engine, with cascading predictions facili-
tating the emergence of archetypes as such, archetypical images,
and archetypal stories or narratives (see
Fig. 1 for overview). We 
mean “hierarchical” in the sense that hierarchically higher regions 
(a.k.a., domain general regions such as the high-level transmodal 
association cortex) coarse grain (via downward causation) infor-
mation processed by domain-specific regions (e .g. sensory cor-
tex)—enabling an effective simulation of the world or “controlled
hallucination” (
Seth 2021)—as sharp in fidelity as it may seem.
We propose that during archetypal visions such as those occur-
ring under psychedelic drugs, this hierarchical divergence in infor-
mation passing and processing collapses such that high- and low-
level cortices can communicate more freely . We also speculate 
that this communication expresses as an extended repertoire of
brain states including increased activation of higher frequency
spatiotemporal patterns or harmonics (
Atasoy et al. 2017) t h a t 
more easily traverse the (distributed) functional hierarchy . We 
also hypothesize that this anarchic quality to brain function is
indexed by greater bottom–up and less top–down information
flow (
Alamia et al. 2020), and finally , we encourage an exam-
ination of high frequency harmonics within the ventral visual 
stream, with more information flow across hierarchical levels 
therein (e.g. between medial temporal structures and V1), as
another promising candidate marker of archetypal visions under
psychedelics, or other inducers for that matter.

Returning to the psychology , construction of archetypal 
motifs allows agents to construct shared narrative of increasing 
abstraction and temporal depth (e.g. one’s initial representation 
of mother is your biological mother or primary caregiver but 
then becomes a more abstract and temporally invariant as one 
samples more instances of mother: resulting in an average based 
on all encounters with mother, and an understanding of how 
that abstraction differs from non-mothers or fathers). We suggest 
that (i) the emergence of these archetypal patterns reflects social 
imperatives/instincts and the types of beha viors that enable or
disable their attainment, and (ii) these internal representations
arise through two types of reciprocal exchange: one in the cortex
between hierarchically higher and lower brain regions, and that
between the agent and other social agents. To close, we briefly
outline theoretical and clinical implications of our proposal.
This synthesis is multi-faceted, covering depth psychology and 
human neuroscience, but there are tangible potential applications 
of it to discrete fields depending upon the emphasis one wishes to 
draw. For example, a clinician may adopt the view that archetypes 
correspond to basic narratives on which one rests one’s view 
of themselves and the world. Working with this assumption in 
psychoanalysis could bear fruit, as is already done in Jungian
analysis. However, this approach could also be incorporated into
psychological integration work done after a psychedelic experi-
ence, e.g. most obviously as psychedelic therapy (
Carhart-Harris 
et al. 2016). Additionally , a social neuroscientist may wish to 
understand the neural events (within and between individuals) 
that signal the establishment and maintenance of shared narra-
tives. In a general sense, then, viewing archetypes through the lens 
of the hierarchical Bayesian brain representing recurrent social 
motivation, challenges, and solutions offers the chance for theo-
retical pollination between discrete fields, as well as a deepening 
and validation of Jungian theory . Moreover, this proposal offers 
tangible and testable hypotheses of how archetypal r epresenta-
tions can emerge into conscious experience. Further development
of these contact points in discrete fields could enable further
refinement to core Jungian ideas, primarily to establish construct
validity of archetypes, as well as other Jungian ideas.
Limitations and future directions
It is important to note that we do not argue that all Jungian 
constructs fare well in light of modern neuroscience. For exam-
ple, his views on psychedelic use were at times prejudiced and 
ethnocentric, and his views on schizophrenia do not fare well 
with modern evidence. Furthermore, there are other concepts 
of Jungian thought (which are not covered here) which may not 
stand up to scrutiny . For example, we have not discussed Jungian 
complexes, thought to originate in the collective unconscious.
There is potential for further exploration into complexes. For
example, they could be interpreted as erroneous but highly pre-
cise predictions that hinder the process of model optimization
(alternatively described as canalized pathological beliefs serving
as a psychological defense;
Carhart-Harris et al. 2022). Alterna-
tively , complexes may be considered as psychological adaptations 
designed to resolve competing imperatives—such as the need for 
attachment and authenticity (e.g. due to an attachment figure 
who can be threatening), resulting in a “negative mother com-
plex”. In this latter case, the issue is less to do with the erroneous
prediction and more to do with the fact that there is no clear
way to meet or resolve the dispute between these competing
imperatives.
This line of research could provide novel insights and have 
clinical applications. Our analysis also does not extend to dream 
states, which form a crucial part of psychology and could rea-
sonably profit from integration between Jungian psychology and 
modern neuroscientific work. Another limitation of the account 
forwarded here is that aspects of account may be speculative in 
places. F or example, one aspect of our account suggests that sub-
cortical structures may encode “archetypes as such.” While extant
work suggests increase in bottom–up signaling, as well as emer-
gence of archetypal imagery under altered states (
Carhart-Harris 
et al. 2014), the notion that archetypes as such are encoded in 
subcortical structures would require further empirical verifica-
tion. This could be addressed in future work through different 
methodological or analytical means. For example, future research 
could leverage multi-modal imaging to test if recurrent archetypal 
imagery directly corresponds with activity in midline and limbic 
structures, including the hippocampus, periaqueductal gray , or 
basal forebrain. More indirectly , future work could additionally 
implement techniques such as natural language processes (e.g. 
semantic embedding or clustering algorithms) to dream reports 
or r eports of psychedelic phenomenology . These reports could
then be used to ask if particular archetypes relate to activity in
evolutionarily older subcortical regions (e.g. hippocampus, peri-
aqueductal gray , hypothalamus) using techniques such as repre-
sentational similarity analysis (RSA) or model-based fMRI.
Another prediction our trilogical interplay also gives rise to 
is the relationship between inhibition of cortical inhibitory net-
works, brain entropy , and propensity to experience archetypal 
imagery . We predict that archetypal imagery should principally 
arise when higher cortical networks are inhibited, reducing their 
inhibitory function. Likewise, we would also expect that increased 
entropy in brain dynamics could be an important prerequisite 
for encounters with ar chetypal imagery . This could be tested
by seeing whether increased frequency and depth of archetypal
experiences correspond with both an inhibition of large-scale net-
works and increased signal complexity (measured with metrics
such as the Lempev–Ziv complexity metric).
A more conceptual limitation concerns the fact that Jungian 
constructs emphasize symbolism rather than attempting to 
describe mechanistic processes. Given the nature of our synthesis, 
we must note the inherent risk of conflating metaphor present 
in Jung’s work with literal operationalization. While we note 
parallels between neural behavior and archetypes, we note that 
these should be interpreted primarily in a heuristic sense , rather
than as a one-to-one mapping of phenomenology onto brain
regions. To avoid such errors, including the mereological fallacy
(i.e. attributing psychological properties to neural substrates;
Bennett and Hacker 2003), we note that archetypes should 
principally be understood in terms of emergent and symbolic 
phenomena, whose appearance in brain activity more likely 
reflects structural predispositions rather than bespoke encoding. 
While phenomenology (including archetypal imagery) no doubt 
corresponds with underlying neural architectures, this should 
not be read as a mutually causal relationship or as having a 
direct correspondence. As such, our use of terms such as shared 
minima or interbrain synchrony is intended to provide a kind 
of neurophenomenological scaffold for archetypal imagery or 
experience, rather than providing a purely mechanistic account. 
This is important, as we aim to preserve the teleological, symbolic, 
and affective richness of Jung’s accounts of archetypes, whilst also
providing meaningful engagement with extant neuroscientific
literature. Despite limitations, and appropriate precautions, we
propose that our work offers a way in which Jungian archetypes
can be more seriously considered and adopted for the purposes
of understanding the brain and (particularly its social) function.
Eigenmodes of the deep unconscious| 11
Conclusion 
Our work provides a novel interpretation of Jungian archetypes 
as installed in generative models and are allowed “off the leash” 
as unstable attractors, e.g. their manifestation can perhaps most 
clearly be seen under the effects of psychedelic drugs, due to 
their specific action on the mechanisms of hierarchical predictive 
processing in the brain. We have also argued that extant evi-
dence from social, theoretical, and developmental neuroscience 
lends support to the Jungian constructs of the collective uncon-
scious and archetypes. We leveraged evidence from developmen-
tal, social, and clinical neuroscience to argue for the validity of 
these concepts and point the reader towar d ways to test specific
hypotheses about how archetypes are encoded in brain activity
and may be decoded from this activity . In doing so, we hope this
synthesis can foster a dialogue between modern neuroscientific
and psychoanalytic communities and lend a warranted validation
to some important constructs embraced by the latter and tradi-
tionally neglected by the former.
