Abstract 
Background 
Nutritional status has been compromised by ongoing war and restrictions on food deliveries in the Gaza 
Strip. We developed a mathematical model that outputs retrospective estimates and scenario-based 
projections of acute malnutrition prevalence among children given caloric intake and other factors. We 
present here the model and its application to the crisis in Gaza. 
 
Methods 
We extended an existing mechanistic model for weight change as a function of energy balance, 
calibrating it to represent variability in growth curves observed in pre-war Gaza. We simulated open 
cohorts of children exposed to time-varying caloric intake, infant exclusive breastfeeding prevalence, 
incidence of infectious disease and coverage of malnutrition treatment, while allowing for adult caloric 
sacrifice to supplement child intake in times of food scarcity. 
 
Results and conclusions 
The model accurately replicates growth standards, pre-war growth patterns and expected parameter 
dependencies. It suggests that a considerable increase in acute malnutrition occurred in northern Gaza 
during early 2024. Projections for late 2024 include a serious nutritional emergency if relatively 
pessimistic assumptions are made about food availability. The model may hold considerable promise for 
informing decisions in humanitarian response but requires further validation and development.

Introduction 
Since October 2023, the Gaza Strip has endured intense military operations and severe restrictions on 
circulation of people and goods. During the first seven months of the war (October 2023 to April 2024), 
reduced food deliveries caused highly prevalent food insecurity and triggered warnings of impending 
famine [1, 2]. There were consistent media and civil society reports of food scarcity, particularly among 
people who had remained in the two northern governorates (Gaza City, North Gaza), where food 
deliveries had been scarcest, and instances of fatal starvation were recorded [3]. From April 2024 
onwards, an apparent improvement in food security coinciding with re-opened border crossings was 
noted [4], but objective data were obscured by Israel’s takeover of customs points from which the United 
Nations had previously tracked the content of incoming truckloads [5]. 
Acute malnutrition is a short-term consequence of dietary insufficiency and, in crises, disproportionately 
affects children and pregnant or lactating women [6]. Its population burden is typically measured by 
cross-sectional surveys in which children aged 6 to 59 months old (mo) are classified as severely or 
moderately malnourished based on their weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) and/or the presence of bilateral 
pitting oedema [7, 8]. In Gaza, these surveys have been hampered by insecurity; humanitarian actors 
have instead relied on rapid community-based screening based on middle-upper-arm circumference 
(MUAC), an anthropometric index that, while predictive of the risk of death [9], does not correlate well 
with WHZ [10]. These screenings have, to our knowledge, relied on convenience rather than population-
representative samples. 
In a separate publication, we analysed multiple sources of food to estimate caloric availability over time in 
both northern Gaza and the south-central governorates [11]. Here, we introduce a mathematical 
modelling framework to estimate acute malnutrition prevalence based on caloric availability, whilst 
accounting for protective or risk factors including malnutrition treatment, incidence of common infectious 
disease, reduced breastfeeding and disproportionate sharing of food by adults with their children 
(hereafter ‘caloric sacrifice’), a plausible coping mechanism. We apply the model to the Gaza context and 
reconstruct the evolution of acute malnutrition prevalence, while also forward-projecting it under 
alternative scenarios. 
 
Methods 
Study population and period 
We stratified Gaza into a northern (North Gaza, Gaza City governorates) and south-central region (Deir al 
Balah, Khan Younis, Rafah). The northern region contained approximately 1,200,000 people pre-war [12] 
but only about 250,000 by March 2024 [13]. We sourced Gaza’s age- sex distribution and proportion of 
pregnant and lactating women from UN projections of the 2017 census [14] and the distribution and 
mean number of household members from the census itself [15].  
Our retrospective analysis period spans 7 October 2023 to 6 May 2024, when the Israeli Defence Force 
(IDF)’s takeover of the southern border crossings meant the UN could no longer collect comprehensive 
food trucking data [5]. We present scenario-based forward projections for the period from 7 May to 31 
December 2024.

Overall model description 
We simulate an open cohort of children 0 to 59mo with daily time steps. Each child is attributed a random 
age, sex and height and weight growth percentiles at birth that determine their anthropometric trajectory 
through age and time under non-crisis conditions. These percentiles are based on the estimated 
distribution of growth curves for pre-war Gaza (see below), which are assumed to already reflect 
exposure to pre-crisis levels of different risk factors and used to estimate pre-war caloric intake. The 
cohort is aged up to the crisis’ start date and is then progressed through the retrospective estimation 
period by exposing it to the estimated caloric availability per day during the crisis, adjusted for the extent 
of adults’ assumed caloric sacrifice, as well as time-varying factors including excess (i.e. crisis minus 
baseline) burden of acute respiratory infection and acute watery diarrhoea, excess prevalence of non-
exclusive breastfeeding during infancy, and the coverage of severe and moderate acute malnutrition 
(SAM, MAM) treatment. The model then exposes the cohort to one or more forward-projection scenarios 
in which the values of the above variables are arbitrarily set to explore possible crisis trajectories. 
Children who age out of the cohort are replaced by newborns with the same sex, breastfeeding 
exclusivity and height-weight percentiles. Mortality is omitted and population assumed constant. We 
adapt a published mechanistic model [16] to predict children’s weight change over each time step as a 
function of caloric intake and resulting energy balance. We present model components and inputs below. 
Data and code for implementation in R [17] are publicly available on 
https://github.com/francescochecchi/nut_cal_model_gaza. 
 
Pre-war growth curve estimation 
Before the war, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 
(UNRWA) offered free growth monitoring visits to Gazan children up to age 5y. We sourced from UNRWA 
2,704,336 (1,307,754 female or 48.8%) individual weight and height observations collected longitudinally 
between 2019 and 2023 (a median 10 observations per child), reduced to 2,697,477 (99.7%) after 
removing children with <3 observations and implausible values (weight-for-height, weight-for-age and/or 
height-for-age <> 5 Z-scores as computed using the R anthro package developed to accompany the 
World Health Organization’s 2006 growth standards [18]). As shown in the Supplementary Material 
(Figure S6), observations were mostly spaced three months apart and decreased after age 18mo. 
We applied to the above data the WHO’s method for constructing a pre-war distribution of sex-specific 
weight-for-age (WAZ) and height-for-age (HAZ) growth curves (Figure S7, Figure S8), which relies on a 
generalised additive model for location, size and shape (GAMLSS, implemented through the gamlss 
package [19]) with a Box-Cox-power-exponential distribution [18]. From each model fit we extracted the 
predicted 0-99% percentiles of weight and height at any age. 
We assumed that children would remain at the same percentile through life if pre-war conditions 
persisted. In reality, children exhibit individual heterogeneity in their trajectory, but our simplifying 
assumption should be appropriate as long as it accurately replicates observed population variability (see 
Results): this should occur if heterogeneity is random. Accordingly, we allocated an equal fraction of the 
cohort to each weight percentile. We also attributed a random height percentile, accounting for the 
observed correlation of height with weight curves (Figure S9). We did this by first fitting (in package mgcv 
[20]) a generalised additive negative-binomial model to the count of children within each mean weight-
height percentile combination, featuring a tensor smoothing product of each child’s mean weight and 
height percentile as observed over their longitudinal observations, adjusted for sex and with the log of the 
number of children in each mean weight percentile as an offset (Figure S10). We used the model-fitted 
counts of height percentile within each weight percentile as a probability distribution from which to

sample when attributing a random birth height percentile to each child in the cohort, conditional on 
weight percentile. We also tried sampling from the empirical weight-height correlation matrix, but this 
resulted in cohorts with height-for-age variance well below that observed. 
 
Weight sub-model 
Hall et al. [16] have developed a mechanistic model that predicts weight change over time 𝑡 as the sum of 
change in fat (FM) and fat-free (lean) mass (FFM), given the balance of energy (caloric) intake and 
energy expenditure (𝐼𝑡 −𝐸𝑡). Briefly, 𝐸𝑡 sums requirements due to baseline metabolism, food digestion, 
physical activity and growth, which vary by sex and age based on set constants. FM and FFM are burnt if 
intake is insufficient and accrete if intake surpasses expenditure; both processes entail energy costs and 
gains. Partitioning of energy between FM and FFM is age-dependent and a function of their relative 
availability. The model, developed to support weight management programmes, has been validated in 
older children and adults, but to our knowledge not applied widely among young children (see 
Discussion). We verified that it satisfactorily predicted the expected WHO standards by setting birth 
weight at the 0 WAZ level as per WHO standards and FM and FFM at birth based on Fomon et al.’s 
expected median values [21], and running the model to age 60mo (Figure S11). When applying the 
model to Gaza, we set birth weight percentiles as outlined above, and apportioned birth weight into FM 
and FFM using the sex-specific regression equations provided by Eriksson et al. [22]. 
Unless a caloric deficit/surplus is specified, the weight model outputs growth under energy balance, i.e. 
its predictions default to the population median no matter which birth weight a child starts out with 
(Figure S13). This masks the expected variability of WAZ and compromises the model’s application for 
SAM and GAM prevalence estimation, which relies on accurately estimating not just the central tendency 
but also the distribution of WAZ, HAZ and thus WHZ, so that SAM and GAM cases, who exist at the 
negative end of the curve, may be modelled accurately [23]. To correctly replicate the weight trajectories 
corresponding to different growth percentiles, we introduced a sex (𝑠)-, age (𝑎)- and weight percentile 
(𝑤)-dependent calibration factor 𝑚𝑠,𝑎,𝑤 defined by a two-parameter cumulative log-normal function, 
which seemed suitable for the pattern evident in growth curves, namely rapid weight gain in infancy 
followed by lower weight gain velocity:

where 𝜗0,𝑠,𝑤 and 𝜗1,𝑠,𝑤 are unknown parameters and 𝛿𝑐 ={1,𝑤≤50%
−1,𝑤>50% .  
When predicting weight change, we calibrated daily energy expenditure 𝐸𝑡
∗ as 𝐸𝑡(1+𝑚𝑠,𝑎,𝑤), such that 
children at low weight percentiles were modelled as less energy-efficient, and vice versa. We estimated 
𝜗0,𝑠,𝑤 and 𝜗1,𝑠,𝑤 by two-dimensional grid search, minimising the root sum of squares of model-predicted 
versus GAMLSS-fitted weight-for-age curves at each percentile, under each pair of candidate parameter 
values. Maximum-likelihood values, shown in Figure S14, were then associated with each weight 
percentile in further model application. As shown in Figure 1 for representative percentiles, the model 
thusly calibrated closely replicated GAMLSS-fitted growth percentiles.

Other model components 
Adult caloric sacrifice 
We assumed that, in a situation of scarcity, adults (≥20yo) within each household would sacrifice a 
proportion of their available food to feed children, as shown in Gaza [1] and elsewhere [24, 25]. To work 
out the extent to which this sacrifice would increase children’s intake (as a multiplier adjustment factor 𝑓), 
we simulated 1000 households with size randomly sampled from the distribution of pre-war household 
size in Gaza, comprising of at least one adult and with remaining members’ age and sex allocated 
randomly based on Gaza’s age-sex distribution, with a Poisson-distributed random number of pregnant 
and lactating women, based on their population prevalence. We explored how 𝑓 would vary as a function 
of (i) the proportion of their recommended intake that adults would be willing to sacrifice, (ii) the 
proportion of children’s recommended intake that adults would try to safeguard and (iii) the mean 
available per-capita Kcal/day. We assumed that food would be distributed equally among households 
based on their requirement (i.e. the sum of each member’s recommended intake), and that within 
households food would flow from adults to children until either the former’s sacrifice limit or the latter’s 
intake target were reached. As shown in Figure 2, a substantial adjustment to children’s intake would only 
occur when food is scarce yet enough that adults can spare some; below ≈600 Kcal/day, adults 
themselves are unlikely to afford sharing food, as this is already about one fourth of their recommended 
intake.

Effect of infectious disease 
We modelled the effect of common endemic infectious diseases as a reduction in daily caloric intake 
applied over each disease episode’s duration. After a non-systematic key word search of Medline, we 
identified five cohort studies of children with acute watery diarrhoea [26–29] and one of children with ARI 
[27], both conditions broadly defined according to WHO syndromic definitions, in which intake was also 
measured; we averaged these studies’ estimates of the ratio of intake when ill to intake when healthy. 
To simulate disease episodes, we adapted Schmidt et al.’s method [30], whereby children are attributed a 
random annual incidence drawn from a gamma distribution whose shape parameter is the average local 
incidence and whose scale parameter captures expected heterogeneity. Children are also attributed a 
random episode duration (in days), itself drawn from a gamma distribution but adjusted (i) for observed 
positive correlation of duration and incidence based on a linear regression coefficient and (ii) for 
individual variability, based on a random normal deviate. We sourced the scale parameter of incidence, 
the shape and scale parameters of duration and the regression coefficient of duration by incidence from 
studies reviewed by the same authors [30]. 
Because incidence is rarely if ever measured in crisis settings, we worked out its correspondence with 
more survey-amenable indicators (point prevalence or period prevalence based on caregiver recall of 
symptoms over the previous two weeks) at various levels within a realistic range (Figure S15) by running

a simulation of 1000 children over two years, with a burn-in period of one year to achieve steady state, in 
which for different incidence levels we computed corresponding prevalences. 
Within the main model cohort, we set a daily point prevalence of ARI and diarrhoea, and worked out how 
many children would newly fall ill to make up this prevalence, after subtracting prevalent cases. We 
attributed new cases based on individual probabilities equal to zero if children were already ill (this 
prevented episode overlap) and the ratio of the child’s incidence to the mean incidence otherwise (to 
reproduce heterogeneity). As mentioned above, prevalence was specified as an excess level (crisis – 
baseline). The model does not currently accommodate a reduction from pre-crisis levels. 
 
Effect of incomplete breastfeeding 
We represented the effect of non-exclusive breastfeeding as an increase in the energy requirement of 
infants below 6mo, reflecting the lower caloric efficient of formula versus breastmilk; multipliers were 
taken from the Food and Agriculture Organisation [31] (Figure S16). As above, the excess prevalence of 
non-exclusive breastfeeding was specified. 
 
Acute malnutrition treatment 
While various protocols for SAM and MAM management exist, we simulated the simplified outpatient 
version with weekly follow-up common in acute emergency responses [32], whereby SAM cases receive 
1000 Kcal/day (reduced to 500 if they improve to and stay at MAM over two consecutive weeks) while 
MAM cases receive 500 Kcal/day; treatment ends for both SAM and MAM if cases maintain a WHZ ≥ -2 
over two consecutive weeks. We assumed that children would experience a delay before accessing 
treatment, sampled from a lognormal distribution with mean 15d and standard deviation equal to half the 
mean. We also assumed that children on treatment would continue to consume non-therapeutic food. We 
ignored additional therapeutic food that may be given in inpatient settings (e.g. specialised milk), as most 
SAM cases are usually treated on an outpatient basis; we also omitted MUAC and oedema (an infrequent 
and geographically clustered presentation of acute malnutrition [33]) as alternative admission and 
discharge criteria, since the model cannot estimate these anthropometric indices. Whenever the actual 
number of children admitted to treatment was known, we calculated the daily mean number of 
admissions given the cohort size relative to the total population, and attributed these among as-yet 
untreated SAM/MAM cases in the cohort based on a random Poisson process. The model also allows for 
treatment coverage (proportion) as an input, obviating the need for population data; this option is 
implemented as a random binomial probability. For simplicity we assumed 100% cure and no defaulting. 
 
Crisis-specific data sources 
Recommended and actual caloric intake 
Recommended intake by age-sex, with additions for pregnant and lactating women, was sourced from 
WHO guidelines [34]. Hall et al. [16] however offer an analytic solution for the recommended intake by 
age-sex, given an expected age- and sex-dependent FM to FFM ratio among healthy children. We 
applied this solution to compute recommended intakes among children 0-10yo (Figure S12) and used 
them in lieu of WHO’s. Among girls and boys aged 0 to 4yo, a mean 1117 and 1284 Kcal-day were 
predicted by Hall et al. compared to 1250 and 1320 recommended by WHO, with corresponding figures 
among 5 to 9yo’s being 1629 and 1725 versus 1730 and 1980.

We estimated pre-war actual intake per capita by doing a grid search over a range of candidate values of 
the ratio of actual to recommended mean caloric intake and finding the value of this ratio (and thus the 
actual intake) that minimised the root mean square error (RMSE) of weight model predictions, compared 
to the median WAZ growth curve. While the estimated actual mean intake was only 2% less than the 
recommended value (Figure S17), this small adjustment graphically improved model fit to the median 
pre-war growth curves (Figure S18). Intake during the war is estimated in a separate paper [11] and 
introduced here as an empirical distribution of 1000 simulation run outputs per day for both northern and 
south-central Gaza, from which we sample over the retrospective analysis period. 
 
Other factors 
We sourced the number of MAM and SAM treatment admissions from a Nutrition Cluster dashboard [35]: 
these are available from January 2024, prior to which we assume that no MAM/SAM treatment was 
occurring. ARI and diarrhoea two-week period prevalences were estimated by the MICS before the war 
[36]; during the war, rapid surveys [37–39] also estimated this indicator intermittently [40] but with a 
simpler questionnaire compared to MICS, so we crudely assumed that only half of cases identified were 
indeed ARI and acute diarrhoea (i.e. 50% positive and 100% negative predictive values). Further disease 
assumptions are in Table S3 and Table S4. The MICS estimated a 58% prevalence of complete or partial 
formula feeding among infants <6mo, which we assumed to have risen to 70% by 1 February 2024 in line 
with observed deteriorations in exclusive breastfeeding across crises in the Middle East [41–44]. We 
assumed that adults would seek to safeguard 100% of children’s caloric requirement and sacrifice up to 
80% of theirs on any given day. Lastly, we sourced population estimates by region from the Palestinian 
Central Bureau of Statistics [45], the Food Security Cluster [46], the United Nations Office for 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA [47] and UNRWA [48], and interpolated these linearly to 
fill in periods of missingness. 
 
Scenario assumptions 
Table 1 details values and assumptions for a central (most plausible), reasonable-best and reasonable-
worst scenarios. For simplicity we assumed that during the projection period (May to December 2024) 
only intake (Figure S19) and malnutrition treatment would vary by scenario, with ARI and diarrhoea 
prevalence as observed in the previous season (Table S3, Table S4) and all other factors at their April 
2024 level. 
We had actual MAM/SAM treatment admissions up to 30 September 2024 [35]. Thereafter, we crudely 
calculated total treatment capacity as the number of functional outpatient and inpatient MAM/SAM 
treatment points [35] times up to 5 MAM and 5 SAM admissions/day, reducing this total by a certain 
percentage for each scenario. 
From 7 May onwards UNRWA was unable to comprehensively monitor food truckloads into Gaza, 
particularly those from the commercial sector, and appeared to capture only truckloads into south-central 
governorates: accordingly, for the south-central region we updated our published caloric availability 
estimates up to 30 September, but upward-adjusted trucked-in amounts from 7 May by assuming 
underreporting fractions corresponding in the reasonable-best scenario to the proportion of food coming 
from commercial sources during May-September 2024, namely 44% as reported by UNOCHA [49], and 
in the reasonable-worst scenario to half that level, closer to the proportion of commercial deliveries 
before May. For northern Gaza, we assumed a level of caloric intake relative to April 2024. From early

Results 
Model testing 
Table 2 and Figure S20 compare the model’s simulated pre-war distributions of HAZ, WAZ and WHZ to 
those obtained from the UNRWA growth monitoring dataset and the 2019-2020 MICS, indicating 
reasonable concordance, albeit with a lower modelled-than-observed variance. Figure S21 compares the 
model to a pre-war survey done among children <2yo by Albelbeisi et al. [51].

As shown in Figure 3A, the model exhibits the expected behaviour as hypothetical scenarios progress 
from caloric requirements being exactly met (stable GAM prevalence) to unmitigated caloric insufficiency 
(steep increase), insufficiency with adult sacrifice, excess infectious disease and finally partial treatment 
coverage. Figure 3B illustrates the strong influence of adult caloric sacrifice in model dynamics (see 
Discussion).

Crisis estimates 
As shown in Figure S22, the model generally yielded wide uncertainty intervals, especially for the 
retrospective period, during which uncertainty in food intake is propagated from our prior analysis. For 
easier readability, Figure 4 only reports point estimates. We estimated that acute malnutrition peaked 
around March 2024 in northern Gaza, with GAM prevalence considerably increased from its ≈ 4% pre-
war modelled level (Table 2). Under the reasonable worst-case scenario, we projected that GAM and 
SAM prevalence would reach serious levels in both regions by December 2024, with a relatively higher 
increase in northern Gaza. 
 
Discussion 
Main findings 
To our knowledge this is the first instance of a mechanistic model that estimates expected acute 
malnutrition burden on the basis of caloric intake while accounting for obvious modulating factors. As 
such, our paper should mainly be viewed as introducing the model and reporting on its first application in 
a real-life crisis, thereby showcasing its current potential and limitations (see below). 
The model accurately predicts the median WHO growth standard if parameterised with recommended 
caloric intake and, calibrated to pre-war data, reproduces expected distributions of anthropometric 
indices, albeit with a possible, small underestimation of variance and thus SAM/GAM prevalence. It 
suggests a strong role for adult caloric sacrifice as a coping strategy during periods of food scarcity. 
Some 95% of households in Rafah governorate employed food security coping strategies with caretakers 
often skipping meals to feed their children [39].  
The model suggests that in northern Gaza, food scarcity during January-March 2024 caused a rapid 
increase in acute malnutrition, reversed by May likely thanks to improved food availability [11]. These 
retrospective estimates for Gaza seem broadly in line with available ground data (Figure 5), but the latter 
are not a suitable dataset for validation as they do not arise from representative sample surveys and rely 
on MUAC-based measurement; moreover, ground data from northern Gaza during the first half of 2024 
are particularly scant. Retrospective model estimates also feature wide uncertainty. Scenario projections 
suggest that, in both northern and south-central governorates, a substantial decline in food availability 
(unlike at the war’s outset, not mitigated by pre-existing stores [11]) could result in a serious nutritional 
emergency.

covered by data.

Limitations 
In addition to being computationally intensive, the model has several limitations, of which the most 
important are emphasised here. Upstream, the model ignores food waste and access inequity; adult 
caloric sacrifice is modelled statically, but may in fact be function of how long adults have already been 
depriving themselves and/or of children’s nutritional status at the time; adding a sub-model of adult 
weight [52] while tracking its evolution through primary data would help improve this model component. 
The model’s calibration to represent inter-individual variability may not successfully replicate growth 
curves outside Gaza, and is unlikely to be biologically plausible, though its performance can be tested on 
new growth monitoring data. 
Our treatment of risk factors is incomplete. We only feature half of the known vicious cycle of infection 
and malnutrition (infection leading to malnutrition, but not the reverse), omit epidemic and other endemic 
infections and the energy cost of infection through symptoms such as fever. We also ignore the higher 
risk of infection (especially diarrhoea) among formula-fed versus breastfed infants, e.g. due to 
contaminated water or bottles and the increased frequency of low birth weight, thereby probably under-
estimating infant malnutrition. Lastly, in a protracted crisis our model would eventually deviate from reality 
because it does not predict changes in height, i.e. stunting. 
The specification of model inputs for Gaza also suffers from considerable uncertainty. We made strong 
assumptions about caloric intake since May 2024, the extent of adult caloric sacrifice and other factors 
such as ARI and diarrhoea prevalence, observed values of which may have suffered from some 
misclassification. While the retrospective analysis is at least not grossly inconsistent with ground-
observed malnutrition prevalence, this does not necessarily indicate model validity, but merely that 
reasonable model inputs can reconstruct a plausible trajectory of nutritional status in Gaza. 
 
Conclusions 
An accurate model to project malnutrition in humanitarian responses on the basis of various input data, 
available or assumed, would complement nutritional surveillance based on primary data collection and 
could considerably enhance situational awareness by enabling near-real-time estimation including for 
populations that are hard to access and thus survey. The model’s forward-projections can potentially 
support decision-making by exploring the consequences of worsening food security, hostile actions such 
as obstruction of food delivery and humanitarian interventions to improve food access and support child 
nutrition. Projections can also support planning, e.g. by quantifying the expected incidence of SAM and 
MAM requiring treatment. 
While the model presented here appears to accurately replicate both the WHO growth standards and 
pre-war anthropometry in Gaza, further validation of its predictions against primary data from other 
settings is warranted. Further model development should, at a minimum, seek to represent food inequity 
and a more dynamic relationship between scarcity and caloric sacrifice than featured so far; account for 
the synergy between infection and malnutrition; and better specify neonatal and infancy factors including 
low birth weight and incomplete breastfeeding. Parameter values (e.g. effect of infectious disease on 
intake) should be informed by more thorough literature review. Data on the evolution of adult weight 
during the crisis could, in particular, help to validate the adult sacrifice sub-model. 
As regards Gaza, the model suggests that past periods of food scarcity resulted in sizeable increased in 
malnutrition prevalence. Scenario projections indicate that, during the last quarter of 2024, the population 
was on the brink of a serious nutritional emergency, with the balance between moderate and severe
