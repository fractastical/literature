ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 2
Abstract
A growing body of research indicates that active control of learning improves episodic memory for
material experienced during study. It is less clear how active learning impacts the integration of
those experiences into ﬂexible, generalizable knowledge. This study presents a novel active transitive
inference task to investigate how people learn a relational hierarchy through active selection of
premise pairs. Active control improved memory for studied premises as well as transitive inferences
involving items that were never experienced together during study. Active learners also exhibited a
systematic search preference, generating sequences of overlapping premises that may facilitate
relational integration. Critically, however, advantages from active control were not universal: Only
participants with higher working memory capacity beneﬁted from the opportunity to select premise
pairs during learning. These ﬁndings suggest that active control enhances integrative encoding of
studied material, but only among individuals with suﬃcient cognitive resources.

Active transitive inference: When learner control facilitates integrative encoding
A central function of cognition is the formation of generalizable knowledge from discrete
experiences. Memory not only enables recollection of independent events from the past, but also
lets us link those events together to identify common elements or structure. For example, if a child
remembers that two animals, seen at diﬀerent points in time, were given the same label (e.g., “look
at theDOG!”), that common association provides the foundation for generalizable knowledge about
a category of objects and its typical features.
Modern educational philosophies such as constructivism (Phillips, 1995) recognize the learner
to be the locus of such knowledge construction: conceptual understanding is built from the
ingredients of direct experience through cognitive processing. Constructivism was a response to
traditional pedagogy which emphasized rote memorization of materials delivered by a teacher with
little opportunity for learner-driven elaboration or conceptual integration (Dewey, 1938). Although
constructivists may acknowledge that rote learning has a place in education (Von Glasersfeld, 2012),
they argue that conceptual knowledge cannot be delivered whole via memorization. Instead, each
learner must assemble a new concept by processing their experiences in relation to each other and
existing prior knowledge.
Learner-centric approaches to instruction, including constructivism and its close relatives,
share this assumption that knowledge formation occurs through internal cognitive processing. At
the same time, advocates of these approaches have commonly argued thatexternal, overt control
over the learning experience—expressed through behaviors such as physical interaction, information
search, and exploration—are integral to knowledge construction (Bruner, 1961; Dewey, 1929;
Phillips, 1995). In contrast to the former, seemingly uncontroversial claim, this latter view has not
been without criticism. Debate continues over whether overt learner control, as in instruction that
prioritizes learner-driven discovery and exploration, is aligned with the goal of building conceptual
knowledge (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006; Mayer, 2004; Tobias & Duﬀy, 2009). A recent review
of classroom interventions suggests that moderate amounts of control lead to better learning
outcomes than either direct instruction or unassisted discovery (Alﬁeri, Brooks, Aldrich, &
Tenenbaum, 2011). However, the diversity of instructional methods and outcomes in this literature
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 4
makes it diﬃcult to draw clear conclusions about when and why learner control is advantageous.
There is a need to better understand how overt control over study interacts with basic cognitive
processes involved in memory and knowledge formation (Bernstein, 2018; T. M. Gureckis &
Markant, 2012).
The present study addresses this need by examining the impact of active control in relation
to the fundamental distinction between rote memory for experienced materials and the construction
of integrated knowledge from that experience. I focus on a simple, well-known example of relational
generalization from memory: transitive inference (TI). In TI people learn about an ordered
hierarchy (e.g., A < B < C) by studying premises comprised of adjacent items (e.g., A < B, B <
C). They are then tested on their memory for the ordering of studied pairs (recall trials; e.g., A ?
B) and their ability to infer relationships between items that were never experienced together
(inference trials; e.g., A ? C). TI has been the subject of a wealth of past research, but it has always
been examined under passive conditions in which control is absent. This study introduces a novel,
active TI task in which participants choose which premises to study during learning. In a passive
control condition participants experience the same training procedure but make no study decisions.
Active and passive study are compared in terms of both recall of directly experienced premises and
the ability to draw inferences that require their relational integration. This comparison provides
new insight into how overt control during study aﬀects the construction of generalizable knowledge.
Eﬀects of active control on memory and concept learning
A growing body of experimental research suggests that exerting control over study beneﬁts
learning and memory. Many of these studies have relied onyoked experiments in which the
information observed during passive study is matched to the experience actively selected by other
learners. In the domain of episodic memory, control over the selection of information leads to
enhanced recognition memory compared to yoked observation of the same study sequences
(Markant, DuBrow, Davachi, & Gureckis, 2014; Voss, Gonsalves, Federmeier, Tranel, & Cohen,
2011). Similar eﬀects have been found across a range of materials and procedures, suggesting that
control over the study experience tends to improve later memory of it. This enhancement might
arise from a number of mechanisms depending on the kind of control aﬀorded to the learner,
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 5
including improved coordination of attention with the ﬂow of experience, additional metacognitive
processing, or enriched encoding processes that result from volitional choice (for a review, see
Markant, Ruggeri, Gureckis, and Xu (2016)).
A separate line of research has found that active control also leads to more eﬃcient
acquisition of abstract concepts, including causal relationships (Lagnado & Sloman, 2004; Steyvers,
Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers, & Blum, 2003) and categories (Markant & Gureckis, 2014). For
instance, Markant and Gureckis (2014) found that control over the selection of training exemplars
led to faster learning of unidimensional category boundaries compared to yoked observation of the
same training sequences. Critically, however, these studies were not designed to distinguish between
the acquisition of abstract, conceptual knowledge and memory for directly experienced training
items, leaving open the question of what mechanism causes those advantages from active control.
Do they reﬂect better memory for experienced information itself, which then supports
generalization at the time of test? Or does active control change how information is processed
during learning, enhancing the formation of relational knowledge that abstracts away from the
study experience? Following Zeithamova, Schlichting, and Preston (2012), these alternatives can be
conceptualized as two types of memory formation during study:elemental encodingof stimuli or
associations that are directly experienced, andintegrative encodingthrough which disparate study
episodes are linked together into a uniﬁed representation. Whereas existing research has established
that active control enhances elemental encoding in a variety of contexts, its impact on integrative
encoding remains unclear.
Elemental vs. integrative encoding in transitive inference
Transitive inference is well-suited to examine whether active control has broader beneﬁts for
knowledge construction beyond enriched elemental encoding of studied items. Performing TI from
memory involves comparing two items that have never been experienced together (e.g., A ? C) but
are related by two or more overlapping premise pairs that were directly studied (e.g., A < B, B <
C). It has long been recognized that multiple mechanisms can support TI, which for the present
purposes can be distinguished by their reliance on either elemental or integrative encoding.
Elemental encoding-based inference occurs by retrieving studied premises at the time of test and
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 6
reasoning across overlapping relations (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012). In this case, successful
inference hinges on robust encoding of pairs during study to ensure later retrieval. This process
implies that test performance will be best for direct recall of studied pairs (e.g., A ? B) and will
decline as the distance between test items increases (e.g., A ? C, A ? D, etc.). Larger distances
between test items are predicted to lengthen response times since a greater number of intervening
pairs must be traversed, and decrease accuracy since there are more opportunities for retrieval
errors along the way.
In contrast, integrative encoding-based accounts of TI postulate the formation of a uniﬁed
representation of the hierarchy during study (Dusek & Eichenbaum, 1997; Hummel & Holyoak,
2001; Shohamy & Wagner, 2008; Zeithamova & Preston, 2010). By combining information from
premise pairs as they are experienced, people induce a spatial (De Soto, London, & Handel, 1965;
Huttenlocher, 1968) or propositional (Hummel & Holyoak, 2001; Trabasso, Riley, & Wilson, 1975)
representation by mapping items onto an integrated ordinal dimension (e.g., A < B < C < D < E
...). Inference then simply entails comparing the positions of any two items along that dimension.
Integrative encoding is associated with a diﬀerent pattern of test performance from elemental
encoding: Accuracy shouldincrease (and response time decrease) with distance, as items that are
further apart on that latent dimension are easier to distinguish. Suchsymbolic distance eﬀects
(SDEs) are a hallmark of integrative encoding (Acuna, Sanes, & Donoghue, 2002; Moyer &
Landauer, 1967).
Integrative encoding typically leads to better test performance than other strategies in TI,
but at the cost of explicit, eﬀortful reasoning during study (Acuna et al., 2002; Moses, Villate,
Binns, Davidson, & Ryan, 2008). Integrative encoding is more likely when participants are aware
there is an underlying hierarchy to be learned (Lazareva & Wasserman, 2010; Moses, Villate, &
Ryan, 2006). Moreover, when people rely on integrative encoding their performance is correlated
with working memory capacity (WMC) (Libben & Titone, 2008). Thus, although constructing an
integrated representation during study leads to superior generalization, it also depends on explicit
awareness and incurs larger cognitive costs, factors which may have important implications for the
eﬀects of active control on TI. If exerting control over the selection of information imposes

additional processing costs (as has been suggested by critics of learner-driven instruction; see
Kirschner et al. (2006)), individual diﬀerences in cognitive function (including WMC) may limit
any potential advantage from the opportunity to control study.
Overview of the present study
Two experiments were conducted using a novel transitive inference task to investigate how
active control impacts the construction of relational knowledge. The participants’ goal in the task
was to learn the “chain of command” at a set of 9-person companies, where each item in the
hierarchy was an individual represented by a face image (see Figure 1). Each premise comprised an
employee and their direct supervisor (the immediately superordinate item). In the active study
condition, participants controlled the selection of premises by choosing a person to learn about their
supervisor on each trial. In the passive condition all selections were predetermined. The test
procedure involved judging for any possible pairing which person was higher in the corporate
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 8
hierarchy. Test performance is analyzed as a function of the distance between items in the
hierarchy: adjacent items made up studied premise pairs that could be directly recalled whereas
non-adjacent items required transitive inference. Because elemental and integrative encoding
predict distinct relationships between distance and test performance, this design makes it possible
to examine whether learner control aﬀects how materials are processed. In particular, the presence
of symbolic distance eﬀects (SDEs), such that accuracy increases (or RT decreases) with greater
distances between items, is taken as evidence for integrative encoding during study (see the General
Discussion for discussion of alternative accounts for SDEs).
Active control was predicted to improve accuracy on inference trials, but this advantage
might arise from enhancements to either elemental encoding or integrative encoding. Enhanced
elemental encoding implies that active control improves memory for premise pairs themselves, in
line with prior ﬁndings of better recognition of experienced materials following active study
(Markant et al., 2016). A key reason to expect such an eﬀect is that making selection decisions may
prompt metacognitive processing about the premises that is absent during passive observation. For
example, given a choice to learn about one of two items from the hierarchy, the learner may try to
recall the superordinate item (i.e., the person’s direct supervisor) for each option. Enhanced
memory for the premise pairs could then result either from the eﬀects of retrieval practice
(Roediger & Karpicke, 2006) or because learners allocate study eﬀort to those pairs that are less
well-learned (Metcalfe, 2009).
A related set of processes might underlie enhanced integrative encoding, with the key
diﬀerence that active control promotes relational processing across premise pairs during study. For
example, when choosing which option to study, a learner might attempt to relate each option to
their existing knowledge of the hierarchy, including other premises that have already been
experienced. Like retrieval practice, such elaborative processing involved in making a selection
could on its own contribute to integrative encoding. Alternatively, it may allow the learner to
generate study sequences that aid relational integration. For instance, passive training that involves
successive presentation of overlapping premise pairs (e.g., A < B, B < C, C < D, ...) leads to
faster learning than random sequences of pairs (Halford, 1984; Waltz et al., 2004). If studying
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 9
nearby premises helps learners to construct a representation of the hierarchy, active learners may
beneﬁt from choosing such options for study. The TI task was designed to explore whether people
exhibit such a preference, with each selection involving a choice between anear and far option
which diﬀered in their distance from the pair studied on the previous trial (see Figure 4A).
To summarize, the task was designed to evaluate whether active control improves both recall
and transitive inference compared to passive observation. The relationship between inferential
distance and performance provides insight into whether any such advantage reﬂects enhanced
elemental or integrative encoding. Experiment 1 examines the diﬀerence between active control and
passive observation of randomly generated training sequences, both at an immediate test and after a
week delay. In Experiment 2, active control is compared to yoked observation of training sequences
generated by participants in Experiment 1. This provides a test of whether the eﬀects of active
control arise from the process of making study decisions (e.g., due to additional metacognitive or
elaborative processing) or the consequences of those decisions in the form of more eﬀective training
sequences. Finally, to evaluate whether individual diﬀerences in cognitive resources aﬀects the
ability to construct relational knowledge through active selection, an assessment of WMC
(operation span) was performed in each experiment and included as a covariate in the analyses.
Experiment 1
The methods described in this and the following experiment were approved by the
Institutational Review Board at UNC Charlotte (IRB #17-0405).
Participants
N = 100 participants (60 women; age:M = 21.94 years,SD = 5.60) were recruited from the
student population at UNC Charlotte. The sample size was chosen prior to the experiment based
on a target of 25 participants for each of the four counterbalancing conditions (see below).
Participants received either course credit or $8 ($4 per session) as compensation for participating in
the study. All participants received an incentive payment based on their performance in the ﬁrst
test session ranging from $0 (< 50% correct) to $5 (90–100% correct). Payments were made in the
form of Amazon gift cards.N = 62 participants (62%) returned for the second session.
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 10
Materials
Face stimuli were obtained from the 10k US Adult Faces Database (Bainbridge, Isola, &
Oliva, 2013), a collection of pictures from Google Images designed to be a representative sample of
the US adult population. The database includes subjective ratings of each face on a number of
attributes, including judgments of perceived age, emotional aﬀect, and memorability. For each sex,
the stimulus set was ﬁltered to include only faces that were non-famous and which had mean
ratings within a 1-point interval centered on the midpoint of the rating scale for perceived age,
emotional aﬀect, and memorability. Thirty-six images (18 male, 18 female) were manually chosen
from the ﬁltered set to ensure high image quality and the absence of other distinctive features (e.g.,
jewelry, background objects). Two hierarchies were generated for each participant by randomly
sampling 9 face images for each sex.
Procedure
There were two sessions. In the ﬁrst session, participants completed the transitive inference
task followed by the operation span task. The second session occurred 6-8 days after the ﬁrst
session and included only a second run of the test phases from the transitive inference task.
Transitive inference task. The transitive inference task (Figure 1) used a within-subjects
design with two rounds. Participants learned about one 9-item hierarchy in the active condition
and a second 9-item hierarchy in the passive condition. Each hierarchy was composed of either all
female faces or all male faces in order to reduce interference between study conditions. The order of
conditions and mapping of stimulus sex to condition were counterbalanced across participants.
Each round was comprised of a learning phase (56 trials) followed by a test phase (72 trials).
Participants were instructed that the task involved learning about the “chain of command” at
two diﬀerent companies. During the instructions all 9 images from the to-be-learned hierarchy were
presented in a horizontal array in random order. The instructions included an example of a 3-item
hierarchy in which participants learned about two premise pairs (person A < person B, person B <
person C) and were asked to infer the transitive relation (person A < person C). All participants
were therefore informed of the hierarchical nature of the stimuli and were explicitly instructed to
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 11
learn to judge the relative rank of individuals in the company.
Learning phase.The learning phase involved a series of choices between two options
corresponding to non-adjacent items in the present hierarchy (excluding the highest item in the
hierarchy, which had no superordinate item and was never presented as a choice option). The
options on the ﬁrst learning trial were any two non-adjacent items sampled at random. On all
subsequent trials, option sets were sampled in order to systematically vary their distance from the
option selected on the previous trial: Each set included anear option that was 1–2 positions away
from the option selected on the previous trial (either above or below), and afar option that was 3
or more positions away from the option selected on the previous trial. This manipulation of option
distance was designed to test whether participants preferred to select items based on their distance
in the active condition. In the passive condition selections were evenly divided between near and far
options.
Learning trials: Active condition.Each learning trial began with the presentation of
the two options in a vertical array in random order (Figure 1, middle). Participants were instructed
to select an option using the mouse at their own pace in order to learn that person’s direct
supervisor. Following their choice the unselected option disappeared and the premise pair (selected
item and superordinate item) was displayed for 2 s. The options then disappeared and the
experiment immediately proceeded to the next trial.
Learning trials: Passive condition.In the passive condition participants did not decide
which option to select. As in the active condition, the trial began with the presentation of two
options, one of which was already highlighted with a red border. Participants were instructed to
select the highlighted option at their own pace, at which point the trial proceeded in the same
manner as in the active condition.
Test phase: All conditions.In each test trial, two items were presented side-by-side and
the participant was instructed to click on the item they judged to be ranked higher in the hierarchy.
Test responses were self-paced and there was no time limit. The test phase was comprised of three
types of trials:recall trials involving a choice between items from studied premise pairs (e.g., A ? B),

near inferencetrials involving items that were 2–3 positions apart (e.g., A ? C), andfar inference
trials involving items that were 4 or more positions apart (e.g., A ? E). There were 3 blocks of 24
trials, with each block made up of an equal number of recall, near inference, and far inference trials
presented in random order. In the second session, participants completed a second run of the same
test phase experienced during the ﬁrst session, with test pairs presented in a new random order.
Operation span. Operation span is a well-established measure of working memory
capacity in which participants attempt to hold a sequence of items in memory while evaluating a
set of interleaved math operations (Turner & Engle, 1989; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle,
2005). In the version used for this study (obtained from
http://www.cognitivetools.uk/cognition/tasks/Verbal-WM/operationSpan/) participants
attempted to remember sequences of numbers while judging the validity of arithmetic problems.
The presentation of each number was followed by a math operation which participants judged to be
either correct (e.g.,2 - 4 = -2) or incorrect (e.g.,2 - 4 = 6). At the end of a trial involving
multiple such steps, they then attempted to recall the sequence of numbers in the order in which
they had appeared. The set size (number of operations/numbers) ranged from 2–7, presented in
increasing order. There were three trials of each set size for a total of 18 trials. Operation span was
scored according to the summed number of digits recalled in the correct order for those trials in
which no errors were made (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics from all three studies).

Results
The results described below are based on data from all participants, including those who did
not return for the second session. Returning and non-returning participants did not diﬀer in overall
accuracy on the ﬁrst test,∆ M = −0.04, 95% CI[−0.10, 0.02], t(64.03) = −1.35, p= .182, or
operation span,∆ M = −0.54, 95% CI[−5.14, 4.06], t(81.28) = −0.23, p= .816. All error bars in
ﬁgures represent within-subjects 95% conﬁdence intervals calculated using the Cousineau-Morey
method (Morey, 2008).
Test performance
Test performance was analyzed for trials that did not involve either endpoint of the hierarchy,
as participants may rely on non-transitive strategies to respond in inference trials that include an
endpoint (Dusek & Eichenbaum, 1997). For instance, the highest-ranked item only appeared as the
superordinate outcome during study and never as a choice option, allowing a learner to infer that it
is at the top of the hierarchy without relying on memory of its relationship to any other items. The
following analyses therefore included only non-endpoint trials in order to focus on test trials that
required transitive inference.
Accuracy. Test responses were scored according to whether participants correctly
identiﬁed the superordinate item in each test pair (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct). Accuracy was
modeled using mixed eﬀects logistic regression (see Appendix A for the model selection procedure).
Figure 2 displays test accuracy during the immediate test (top) and delayed retest (bottom), along
with the prediction of the best-ﬁtting model. Table 2 presents parameter estimates for ﬁxed eﬀects
in the best-ﬁtting model in terms of relative odds ratios (OR), which indicate the multiplicative
change in the odds of responding correctly given a unit change in the predictor. AnOR below 1
indicates a decrease in the probability of a correct response, whereas anOR above 1 indicates an
increase in the probability of a correct response. Individual model contrasts, including those which
involve combinations of factors, are presented in the text along with 95% conﬁdence intervals and
hypothesis tests.
In the initial test, passive study did not diﬀer from active study for recall (OR = 0.81 [0.44,

inference (OR = 0.71 [0.36, 1.38],z = -1.62,p = 0.11). In the delayed retest, however, passive
study led to lower accuracy for recall (OR = 0.62 [0.34, 1.12],z = -2.52,p = 0.01), near inference
(OR = 0.61 [0.33, 1.12],z = -2.55,p = 0.01) and far inference (OR = 0.53 [0.28, 1.03],z = -2.96,p
= 0.003). Overall, active study therefore produced a clear advantage over passive study at the
delayed retest for both recall and inference.
There was strong evidence of SDEs in both study conditions. In the initial test, accuracy in
the active condition was higher for far inference than both recall (OR = 1.89 [1.11, 3.23],z = 3.72,
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 16
p < .001) and near inference (OR = 1.89 [1.20, 2.96],z = 4.40,p < .001). An even clearer eﬀect
was observed in the active condition in the delayed retest: far inference accuracy was higher than
both recall (OR = 2.04 [1.16, 3.60],z = 3.93,p < .001) and near inference (OR = 1.64 [1.02, 2.65],
z = 3.22,p = 0.001), while near inference accuracy was also higher than recall (OR = 1.64 [1.02,
2.65], z = 3.22,p = 0.001). Weaker SDEs were also found in the passive condition. In the initial
test, far inference accuracy was higher than both recall (OR = 1.64 [0.98, 2.74],z = 3.01,p =
0.003) and near inference (OR = 1.66 [1.09, 2.54],z = 3.72,p < .001). At the delayed retest, far
inference accuracy was higher than both recall (OR = 1.77 [1.03, 3.06],z = 3.29,p = 0.001) and
near inference (OR = 1.45 [0.92, 2.28],z = 2.53,p = 0.01), and near inference was higher than
recall (OR = 1.23 [0.89, 1.69],z = 1.98,p = 0.05). Consistent evidence of SDEs in both conditions
suggests that integrative encoding drove performance and that the gap between active and passive
performance was unlikely to have arisen from diﬀerences in encoding strategy.
Recall decreased from the test to retest in both the active (OR = 0.75 [0.53, 1.06],z = -2.62,
p = 0.009) and passive condition (OR = 0.57 [0.40, 0.80],z = -5.12,p < .001). In the passive
condition, accuracy also declined to a lesser extent for both near inference (OR = 0.70 [0.49, 1.02],
z = -2.98,p = 0.003) and far inference (OR = 0.61 [0.39, 0.95],z = -3.45,p < .001). In contrast,
performance on inference trials did not change from test to retest in the active condition (near
inference: OR = 0.93 [0.66, 1.31],z = -0.68,p = 0.50; far inference:OR = 0.81 [0.52, 1.24],z =
-1.55, p = 0.12). Thus, the emergence of larger SDEs in the retest reﬂected decreases in recall but
relatively preserved inference accuracy after the week delay.
Eﬀects of WMC.Working memory capacity had a dramatic inﬂuence on these results. The
best-ﬁtting model included signiﬁcant predictors for operation span and its interaction with study
condition and distance (Table 2). Operation span was positively related to performance in the
active condition at any distance (recall:OR = 1.85 [1.18, 2.91],z = 4.23,p < .001; near inference:
OR = 2.02 [1.21, 3.36],z = 4.30,p < .001; far inference:OR = 3.14 [1.52, 6.49],z = 4.91,p <
.001). This eﬀect was greater for far inference trials than both recall (OR = 1.70 [0.98, 2.94],z =
2.99, p = 0.003) and near inference (OR = 1.55 [0.99, 2.44],z = 3.04,p = 0.002), whereas it did not
diﬀer between recall and near inference (OR = 1.09 [0.80, 1.48],z = 0.89,p = 0.38). In contrast,

operation span was unrelated to performance in the passive condition at any distance (allp > .21).
WMC was therefore selectively associated with performance in the active condition, particularly for
more distant inferences.
In order to explore the eﬀect of WMC further, a followup analysis was performed using a
median split on operation span to divide participants into low WMC and high WMC groups
(Figure 3). Among low WMC participants, there was no diﬀerence in overall accuracy (collapsing
across distance levels) between study conditions at either the test (OR = 1.42 [0.70, 2.87],z = 1.33,
p = 0.18) or retest (OR = 1.39 [0.74, 2.62],z = 1.42,p = 0.15), and accuracy declined from test to
retest in both conditions (active:OR = 0.74 [0.56, 1.00],z = -2.73,p = 0.006; passive:OR = 0.73
[0.51, 1.04],z = -2.37,p = 0.02) Among high WMC participants, passive performance was lower
than active in both the test (OR = 0.46 [0.22, 0.95],z = -2.87,p = 0.004) and retest (OR = 0.27
[0.14, 0.53],z = -5.24,p < .001). Accuracy declined from test to retest in the passive condition
(OR = 0.53 [0.37, 0.75],z = -4.79,p < .001), but did not change in the active condition (OR = 0.89
[0.59, 1.33],z = -0.79,p = 0.43). In sum, the overall gap in accuracy between active and passive
study was driven by high WMC participants, who showed an advantage from active study in both
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 18
test sessions and for whom performance in the active condition was sustained across a week delay.
Reaction time. Reaction time at test was analyzed using linear mixed eﬀects regression.
The parameters of the best-ﬁtting model are presented in Table 2. RT declined from the test to the
retest (β = -0.71 [-0.85, -0.57],z = -13.83,p < .001). Responses were slower in the passive
condition than the active condition for far inference (β = 0.18 [-0.03, 0.40],z = 2.32,p = 0.02), but
there were no other diﬀerences between conditions.
There was also evidence for SDEs based on RT. Within the active condition, responses were
faster for far inference compared to both recall (β = -0.41 [-0.63, -0.19],z = -5.19,p < .001) and
near inference (β = -0.24 [-0.46, -0.02],z = -3.04,p = 0.002). Responses were also faster for near
inference compared to recall (β = -0.17 [-0.39, 0.05],z = -2.15,p = 0.03). Similarly, within the
passive condition, RTs were smaller for far inference than both recall (β = 0.29 [-0.01, 0.60],z =
2.63, p = 0.009) and near inference (β = 0.27 [-0.03, 0.58],z = 2.45,p = 0.01). In contrast to the
accuracy results, operation span was not related to RT (β = 0.10 [-0.10, 0.30],z = 1.35,p = 0.18).
Selections during learning
The next analysis examined participants’ selections during learning and whether they could
account for diﬀerences in test accuracy described above. Study condition was not related to premise
frequency during study (multinomial logistic regression, likelihood ratio test:χ2
(1,7) = 7.20,p =
0.41), indicating that the distribution of experienced premise pairs was similar across active and
passive study. The remaining analyses focused on the preference to select either near or far options
during study.
Proportion of near option selections.Each learning trial involved a choice between a
near option (1–2 positions away from the option selected on the previous trial) and a far option (3
or more positions away). By design, the proportion of near choices in the passive condition was
approximately 50% (M = 0.50,SD = 0.01). In the active condition there was a small but robust
preference to select the near option (M = 0.56,SD = 0.07;M = 0.56, 95% CI[0.55, 0.58],
t(99) = 77.86, p<. 001). As a result, the average distance between successive selections was smaller
in the active condition (M = 2.63,SD = 0.13) than the passive condition (M = 2.83,SD = 0.13;
Md = −0.21, 95% CI[−0.26, −0.15], t(99) = −7.53, p<. 001).

The top row displays the proportion of trials in which the near option was chosen. The bottom two
rows display the median selection RT on those trials in which the far option was chosen (middle

Near selections may be especially useful if they cause overlapping premise pairs to be
experienced in successive trials. If representations of overlapping pairs are simultaneously active in
memory, the learner may be better able to integrate them together into a uniﬁed hierarchy. I next
examined whether the preference to select near items in the active condition depended on the
distance between the near option and the item selected on the previous trial
(distnear ∈{−2,−1,+1,+2}). When distnear = +1, the near option was immediately superordinate
to the previously selected item; that is, the near option belonged to an overlapping pair that
appeared in the previous trial (see Figure 4A).
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 20
Figure 4B (top row, left column) shows the proportion of near selections as a function of near
option distance. In the passive condition, the likelihood of selecting the near item was ﬁxed at .5
regardless of its distance from the previous selection. In the active condition, the proportion of near
selections did not diﬀer from chance whendistnear = −2 (OR = 1.10 [0.95, 1.26],z = 1.59,p =
0.11). However, the proportion of near selections was greater than chance whendistnear = −1 (OR
= 1.22 [1.07, 1.40],z = 3.77,p < .001),distnear = +1 (OR = 1.78 [1.55, 2.04],z = 10.47,p < .001),
or distnear = +2 (OR = 1.15 [0.99, 1.32],z = 2.33,p = 0.02). Thus, in the active condition
participants preferred to select the near option when it was close to the option selected on the
previous trial, and this preference was strongest when the option had apppeared as the
superordinate outcome in that trial. Compared to the passive condition, participants generated
study sequences during active study in which overlapping premise pairs were more likely to be
experienced in successive trials.
Can this tendency to select overlapping pairs account for the higher accuracy seen in the
active condition? A new model of test accuracy was ﬁt which included predictors for the overall
proportion of near selections and its interaction with condition, but this indicated that the
proportion of near selections was not related to accuracy in the active condition (OR = 1.14 [0.88,
1.49], z = 0.99,p = 0.32). The proportion of near selections at any distance was also unrelated to
operation span (distnear = −2: OR = 0.93 [0.80, 1.07],z = -1.31,p = 0.19;distnear = −1: OR =
0.95 [0.83, 1.09],z = -0.91,p = 0.36;distnear = +1: OR = 1.06 [0.92, 1.21],z = 1.00,p = 0.32;
distnear = +2: OR = 0.96 [0.84, 1.11],z = -0.62,p = 0.54). Selection of overlapping pairs therefore
appeared to be a general preference that did not vary with WMC, suggesting that this search
behavior cannot account for the divergence between active and passive study among higher WMC
participants.
Selection response time. The ﬁnal analysis examined the amount of time taken to either
choose an option for study (active condition) or to select a predetermined option (passive
condition). Median response times during selection were higher in the active condition (M = 3.15 s,
SD = 1.54) than the passive condition (M = 2.49 s,SD = 1.26;β = 0.65 [0.37, 0.93],z = 5.52,p <
.001), suggesting that active selection decisions were associated with an additional processing load.
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 21
In addition, selection RT in the active condition was positively related to operation span (β = 0.49
[0.16, 0.81],z = 3.55,p < .001), whereas there was no such relationship in the passive condition (β
= 0.21 [-0.12, 0.53],z = 1.52,p = 0.13). Higher WMC participants who tended to have high
accuracy in the active condition therefore also took longer to make selection decisions in that
condition.
Lastly, I examined how selection RT depended on the distance of the near option, which was
shown in the previous section to be strongly preferred when it was immediately superordinate to
the option selected in the previous trial (distnear = +1). Figure 4B shows median RT on trials in
which the far option was selected (middle row, left) and trials in which the near option was selected
(bottom row, left). A three-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed with condition
(active/passive), near option distance (-2/-1/+1/+2), and selection (near/far) as within-subjects
factors. In addition to the main eﬀect of condition noted above (F(1,1483) = 121.71, MSE = 1.65,
p<. 001, ˆη2
G = .076), there was a main eﬀect of selection (F(1,1483) = 4.46, MSE = 1.65, p= .035,
ˆη2
G = .003) with RT lower when the near option was selected. There was also a main eﬀect of near
option distance (F(3,1483) = 6.22, MSE = 1.65, p<. 001, ˆη2
G = .012) and an interaction between
selection and near distance (F(3,1483) = 7.79, MSE = 1.65, p<. 001, ˆη2
G = .016). Post-hoc
comparisons indicated that when the far was option was selected (Figure 4B, middle left), there
were no diﬀerences in RT as a function of distance in either condition (Tukey HSD, allp > .4).
When the near option was selected in the active condition (Figure 4, bottom left),distnear = +1
options were selected faster than all other types (allp < .001) but there were no other diﬀerences
between option distances. In the passive condition,distnear = +1 options were also selected faster
than distnear = −2 options (p < .001) but there were no other diﬀerences between near option
distances. In sum, the preference to select options that had appeared as the superordinate item on
the previous trial was also evident in faster selection decisions. The primacy of thesedistnear = +1
options was even apparent in the passive condition in which participants merely had to select
predetermined options.
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 22
Discussion
Active control over the selection of premise pairs improved TI performance relative to passive
observation in both an immediate test and a retest one week later. Symbolic distance eﬀects,
whereby accuracy increased (and RT decreased) with greater distances between test items, were
found in both the active condition and, to a lesser extent, in the passive condition. This pattern
suggests that participants engaged in integrative encoding of a uniﬁed representation of the
hierarchy during study (Acuna et al., 2002; Zeithamova et al., 2012) and that this process was
enhanced by control over the training sequence.
This study provides the ﬁrst evidence of systematic search in TI: There was a strong
preference to select options that appeared as the superordinate item on the previous trial
(distnear = +1). Participants thereby naturally generated “chained” sequences of overlapping
premise pairs. This preference was widespread: 82% of participants chose thedistnear = +1 option
in more than half of trials in which one appeared. Participants were also fastest to select
distnear = +1 options in both study conditions. Previous research on TI suggests this preference is
adaptive, as chained sequences produce more eﬃcient learning under passive conditions compared
to random sequences (Andrews, 2010; Halford, 1984; Waltz et al., 2004). Studying overlapping
premises in successive trials may facilitate integrative encoding for learners with limited capacity to
remember experienced premises. If a learner sees the sequence A < B, B < C, C < D and all three
premises are simultaneously held in short-term memory, they can combine the premises to construct
a single ordering of four items (A < B < C < D). In contrast, consider the training sequence A <
B, C < D, E < F. Although the premises themselves might be encoded successfully, they cannot be
used to order items from diﬀerent pairs with respect to one another. By the time an overlapping
premise is experienced (e.g., B < C) the earlier pairs may no longer be maintained in short-term
memory, reducing the opportunity for integrative encoding.
Although selection of overlapping pairs would seem to promote integrative encoding, only
those participants with higher WMC beneﬁted from this search behavior. Among higher WMC
participants, active control produced a ~10% initial advantage over passive study (increasing past
20% in the delayed retest). This is a striking demonstration of how the opportunity to control
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 23
study may not beneﬁt individuals without the cognitive resources to make use of the information
that is generated. Lower WMC participants selected overlapping premises in the active condition
with the same frequency, but did not derive any advantage over passive observation of randomly
generated sequences.
In contrast to the active condition, WMC was unrelated to accuracy in the passive condition.
This ﬁnding conﬂicts with prior reports that WMC is correlated with TI accuracy in passive
settings (e.g., Libben & Titone, 2008), but this discrepancy is likely due to the relative diﬃculty of
passive study in the present experiment. Previous studies showing eﬀects of WMC on TI have
typically involved smaller hierarchies (ranging from 3–6 items) and scaﬀolded training sequences.
For instance, Libben and Titone (2008) used clustered training sequences in which participants
were likely to experience overlapping pairs in successive trials. Other studies linking TI to working
memory (Fales et al., 2003; Waltz et al., 2004) have focused on relational integration while all
stimuli were simultaneously displayed, removing any demands on maintenance of premise pairs in
memory. With larger hierarchies, sequential presentation, and training sequences with
comparatively large distances between successive premises, the passive condition used here may
have been diﬃcult even for participants with higher WMC. In order to better match training
experiences across conditions, Experiment 2 adopts a yoked design in which the passive condition
involves observation of sequences generated by participants in the active condition of Experiment 1.
The inclusion of a delayed retest provides additional insight into the longer term beneﬁts of
active control for constructing relational knowledge. Among higher WMC participants there was no
signiﬁcant change in accuracy for the active condition, whereas performance declined in all other
conditions across a week delay. In general, drops in performance were greater for direct recall than
for inference, thereby producing stronger SDEs in the retest. This pattern is consistent with recent
studies reporting the emergence of relational knowledge after a delay due to sleep-dependent
consolidation (Ellenbogen, Hu, Payne, Titone, & Walker, 2007; Stickgold & Walker, 2013; Werchan
& Gómez, 2013). In a TI task involving training by reinforcement, Ellenbogen et al. (2007) found
that performance on more distant inferences was at chance immediately following training but
emerged after 12- and 24-hour delays that included sleep. Werchan and Gómez (2013) also found
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 24
that inference performance increased after a delay that included sleep, but only when training
involved reinforcement. In conditions involving observational training (most similar to the passive
condition here) inference accuracy did not exceed chance after the delay. It is not possible to
directly compare these results to the present study given numerous diﬀerences in design, including
their focus on inference in the absence of explicit awareness of the hierarchy and use of training to
criterion to ensure equivalent recall of premise pairs by the end the study phase. Further work is
necessary to understand whether the longlasting beneﬁt from active study among higher WMC
participants simply reﬂects more successful encoding during study, or if active control causes
changes in the encoding process that promote the consolidation of relational knowledge.
Experiment 2
The results of the ﬁrst experiment revealed a striking advantage from active study among
higher WMC participants. As noted above, the relatively poor accuracy in the passive condition
may be due to the pseudo-random training sequences in that condition. That is, the beneﬁt from
controlling study may be that it allows learners to generate more useful training sequences in which
overlapping premises are more likely to occur in successive trials. To evaluate this possibility,
Experiment 2 was designed to more closely match the training sequences across active and passive
study using a yoked design. During passive study, participants were yoked to sequences generated
by active participants in Experiment 1. The active condition was the same as in Experiment 1.
Because an advantage from active control was evident among higher WMC participants in the
immediate test in Experiment 1, this experiment did not include a delayed retest.
Participants
N = 100 participants (56 women; age:M = 20.60 years,SD = 4.07) were recruited from the
student population at UNC Charlotte. Participants received either course credit or $4 as
compensation for participating in the study. All participants received an incentive payment based
on their performance in the test ranging from $0 (< 50% correct) to $5 (90–100% correct).

Materials and Procedure
All materials were identical to those of the ﬁrst session in Experiment 1. Participants
completed a single session comprised of the TI task followed by the operation span assessment.
There was no second session in this experiment. When a participant began the TI task they were
assigned a partner from Experiment 1. The study sequence generated by the partner during the
active condition in Experiment 1 was reproduced exactly for the new participant’s passive study
round, including the set of faces, their order in the hierarchy, the choice options in each selection
trial, and the selected premise pairs. As in Experiment 1, the order of study conditions was
counterbalanced across participants.

Accuracy. The parameters of the ﬁtted mixed eﬀects logistic regression model are shown
in Table 3. There were no diﬀerences in accuracy (Figure 5) between active and yoked conditions
for recall (OR = 1.10 [0.61, 1.99],z = 0.46,p = 0.64), near inference (OR = 1.05 [0.58, 1.91],z =
0.26, p = 0.80), or far inference (OR = 0.98 [0.51, 1.87],z = -0.09,p = 0.93). Within the active
condition, near inference accuracy was lower than both recall (OR = 0.82 [0.63, 1.06],z = -2.31,p
= 0.02) and far inference (OR = 1.31 [0.96, 1.79],z = 2.56,p = 0.01), but there was no diﬀerence
between recall and far inference (OR = 1.07 [0.79, 1.46],z = 0.68,p = 0.50). Within the yoked
condition, there were no pairwise diﬀerences between recall, near inference, and far inference. Thus,
there were was only partial evidence of a SDE for accuracy in the active condition.
There were signiﬁcant interactions between operation span, distance, and condition (Table 3).
In the active condition, operation span was positively related to performance for recall (OR = 1.54
[0.95, 2.49],z = 2.67,p = 0.008), near inference (OR = 1.67 [1.03, 2.71],z = 3.15,p = 0.002), and
far inference (OR = 1.93 [1.13, 3.29],z = 3.67,p < .001). In the yoked condition, operation span
was positively related to performance on recall (OR = 1.49 [0.98, 2.28],z = 2.82,p = 0.005), but
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 27
not near inference (OR = 1.21 [0.79, 1.85],z = 1.35,p = 0.18) or far inference (OR = 1.18 [0.75,
1.88], z = 1.08,p = 0.28). For far inference only, the eﬀect of operation span on accuracy was
signiﬁcantly larger in the active condition than the yoked condition (OR = 1.63 [0.84, 3.17],z =
2.18, p = 0.03). Thus, although there were no overall diﬀerences in performance between active and
yoked study, WMC was more consistently related to performance in the active condition,
particularly for more distant inferences. This can be seen in the prediction from the regression
model in Figure 5, where accuracy in the passive condition is relatively constant but accuracy in
the active condition increases with operation span.
Reaction time. There were no diﬀerences in median RT (Table 3) between the active and
yoked conditions (β = 0.02 [-0.17, 0.20],z = 0.21,p = 0.83). Diﬀerences in RT with distance were
consistent with a limited SDE: RTs were signiﬁcantly smaller on far inference than recall trials (β =
-0.26 [-0.49, -0.03],z = -2.93,p = 0.003) but not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from near inference trials (β
= -0.15 [-0.38, 0.08],z = -1.69,p = 0.09). There was no diﬀerence in RT between recall and near
inference trials (β = -0.11 [-0.34, 0.12],z = -1.24,p = 0.21). Finally, operation span was not
related to RT in either the active (β = -0.07 [-0.31, 0.17],z = -0.72,p = 0.47) or yoked condition
(β = 0.13 [-0.11, 0.37],z = 1.36,p = 0.17).
Selections during learning
Study condition was not related to premise frequency (multinomial logistic regression,
likelihood ratio test:χ2
(1,7) = 3.68,p = 0.82), indicating that the aggregate distribution of
experienced premise pairs was similar across active and yoked study.
Proportion of near option selections.The overall tendency to select the near option in
the active condition (M = 0.55,SD = 0.07) was not diﬀerent from that of their partners from
Experiment 1 (OR = 0.94 [0.87, 1.02],z = -1.54,p = 0.12). In the active condition, the proportion
of near selections did not diﬀer from chance whendistnear = −2 (OR = 1.07 [0.92, 1.25],z = 1.19,
p = 0.23), but there was a signiﬁcant preference for the near option whendistnear = −1 (OR = 1.14
[0.99, 1.31],z = 2.47,p = 0.01),distnear = +1 (OR = 1.55 [1.35, 1.79],z = 8.40,p < .001), or
distnear = +2 (OR = 1.14 [0.98, 1.33],z = 2.37,p = 0.02). The proportion of near selections
(Figure 4B, top center) was higher fordistnear = +1 than distnear = −1 options (OR = 1.37 [1.12,
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 28
1.67], z = 4.21,p < .001), again demonstrating a strong preference to select options that had
appeared as the superordinate item on the previous trial. The proportion of near selections was not
related to operation span at any distance (allp > .09).
A new model of test accuracy was ﬁt which included predictors for the overall proportion of
near selections and its interaction with condition. This revealed that accuracy in the active
condition was higher for those participants who more often selected the near option (OR = 1.46
[1.03, 2.07],z = 2.45,p = 0.01). In contrast, the proportion of near selections in the yoked
condition (i.e., based on a previous participant’s choices) did not relate to performance (OR = 0.96
[0.72, 1.27],z = -0.36,p = 0.72). This further suggests that nearby options were more likely to
beneﬁt performance when they were actively chosen than when observed in a sequence generate by
someone else.
Selection response time. Median selection RT was higher in the active condition (M =
2.68 s,SD = 1.26) than the yoked condition (M = 2.35 s,SD = 1.34;β = 0.33 [0.13, 0.54],z =
3.78, p < .001). Selection RT in the active condition was positively related to operation span (β =
0.26 [-0.04, 0.56],z = 2.03,p = 0.04), whereas there was no relationship between operation span
and selection RT in the yoked condition (β = 0.23 [-0.08, 0.53],z = 1.76,p = 0.08).
Figure 4 shows median RT on trials in which the far option was selected (middle row, center)
and trials in which the near option was selected (bottom row, center). A three-way repeated
measures ANOVA was performed with condition (active/yoked), near option distance
(-2/-1/+1/+2), and selection (near/far) as within-subjects factors. In addition to the main eﬀect of
condition noted above (F(1,1483) = 34.90, MSE = 1.27, p<. 001, ˆη2
G = .023), there was a main
eﬀect of selection (F(1,1483) = 6.09, MSE = 1.27, p= .014, ˆη2
G = .004) with RT lower when the
near option was selected. There was also a main eﬀect of near option distance (F(3,1483) = 7.11,
MSE = 1.27, p<. 001, ˆη2
G = .014) and an interaction between selection and near distance
(F(3,1483) = 2.70, MSE = 1.27, p= .044, ˆη2
G = .005). Post-hoc comparisons indicated that when
the far was option was selected, there were no diﬀerences in RT as a function of near option
distance in either condition (Tukey HSD, allp > .4). When the near option was selected in the
active condition,distnear = +1 options were selected faster than all other types (allp < .02) but
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 29
there were no other diﬀerences between option distances. In the yoked condition,distnear = +1
options were selected faster thandistnear = +2 options (p < .01) but there were no other
diﬀerences between near option distances. Thus, responses in both conditions were again fastest
when selecting an option that overlapped with the premise pair experienced in the previous trial.
Discussion
Overall, test accuracy did not diﬀer between active and yoked conditions, suggesting that the
generation of a more useful training sequence may largely account for the beneﬁt of active study
seen among higher WMC participants in Experiment 1. As in that experiment, WMC had a strong
inﬂuence on performance in the active condition, as WMC was positively related to accuracy for
both recall and inference. However, the relationship between WMC and accuracy in the yoked
condition was notably weaker, as higher WMC was only associated with improved accuracy on
recall trials. In addition, while there was some evidence of an SDE for accuracy in the active
condition, there was no corresponding eﬀect in the yoked condition. Thus, although yoking
appeared to abolish any deﬁcit in accuracy compared to active study, there was nevertheless
evidence that WMC was positively related to the success of integrative encoding in the active
condition (Figure 5).
Why might WMC predict inference performance in the active condition but not the yoked
condition? In the aggregate, there were no apparent diﬀerences in training experiences that could
account for this eﬀect. Premise frequency and the proportion of near selections did not diﬀer
between conditions, and the proportion of near selections was unrelated to WMC. If the only role of
WMC is to support integrative encoding of a training sequence (however it is generated), then it
should be equally predictive of performance in both the active and yoked conditions. This suggests
a further role for WMC in active selection. One possibility is that higher WMC participants engage
in additional metacognitive processing when deciding which option to learn about (e.g., relating
each option to their existing knowledge of the hierarchy), and this processing either contributes to
integrative encoding or allows them to optimize their training sequence beyond what is possible
from observing a sequence generated by someone else. This interpretation is indirectly supported by
the ﬁnding that WMC was positively related to selection RT in the active, but not yoked, condition
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 30
(a relationship also found in Experiment 1).
Finally, study behavior in the active condition was highly consistent with that of Experiment
1. Learners preferred to select the near option, particularly when it had appeared as the
superordinate item on the previous trial, and this search preference was unrelated to WMC.
Participants were also faster when choosingdistnear = +1 options, even in the yoked condition
where the selection was predetermined. In one notable departure from Experiment 1, in this
experiment there was also evidence that the proportion of near selections was positively related to
accuracy in the active, but not yoked, condition. This provides further indication of a beneﬁt from
actively choosing to study nearby options, even when the resulting study sequences are highly
similar to those experienced during passive observation.
General Discussion
How does the construction of knowledge depend on the freedom to control one’s own learning
experience? Proponents of self-directed, “active” instruction argue that learner control is critical to
knowledge construction (Bruner, 1961; Dewey, 1929; Kolb, 1984). By interacting with the
environment, testing hypotheses through experimentation, or otherwise directing the ﬂow of
information during study, active instruction lets learners shape their experience according to their
own goals and existing knowledge. Despite the intuitive appeal of such personalized learning,
however, evidence for the eﬃcacy of learner-directed instruction is mixed (Alﬁeri et al., 2011;
Bernstein, 2018). Educational psychologists generally endorse the constructivist view that
conceptual knowledge is assembled by the learner, but increasingly question whether the learner
always beneﬁts from collecting the raw materials themselves (R. E. Clark, 2009).
The current study aims to advance this debate by investigating the cognitive basis of
self-directed learning (T. M. Gureckis & Markant, 2012; Markant et al., 2016). Whereas recent
studies have demonstrated that learner control enhances elemental encoding of information directly
experienced during study (Markant et al., 2014; Murty, DuBrow, & Davachi, 2015; A. Ruggeri,
Markant, Gureckis, & Xu, 2019; Voss et al., 2011), less is known about how active control impacts
integrative encoding, through which experienced information is combined into generalizable
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 31
knowledge during study. To address this gap, the present study used a transitive inference task to
compare active control with passive observation when learning a relational hierarchy (Figure 1).
The results indicate that active control enhances integrative encoding, but that this improvement is
far from universal. Active control facilitated the formation of relational knowledge for learners with
higher WMC, but among lower WMC participants did not diﬀer from passive observation either for
pseudo-random training sequences (Experiment 1) or for sequences generated by other participants
(Experiment 2). WMC predicted performance on both direct recall of studied premises and
transitive inference, but in both experiments was most strongly related to the ability to infer the
relation between more distant items in the hierarchy. These ﬁndings provide further evidence of the
importance of working memory in transitive inference (Libben & Titone, 2008; Waltz et al., 2004;
Wendelken & Bunge, 2010) and, more generally, in the construction of mental representations from
disparate elements (Hummel & Holyoak, 2003; Oberauer, Weidenfeld, & Hörnig, 2006;
Vandierendonck & De Vooght, 1997).
There was consistent evidence of symbolic distance eﬀects (SDEs) such that accuracy
increased and RT decreased with greater distances between test items. SDEs are a hallmark of
integrative encoding, reﬂecting the principle that it is easier to judge the relative positions of items
that are more distant on an integrated latent dimension (Acuna et al., 2002; Moyer & Landauer,
1967; Trabasso, 1977). In contrast, inference based solely on elemental encoding—i.e., where
premises are retrieved independently at test and used to reason across overlapping
relations—should show the opposite pattern, with lower accuracy and longer RT for more distant
items (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012). SDEs in the present task are in line with prior ﬁndings that
learners rely on integrative encoding when they are aware of the hierarchical nature of the materials
(Lazareva & Wasserman, 2010; Moses et al., 2006) and that performance in those conditions are
related to WMC (Libben & Titone, 2008).
It is important to note that alternative learning mechanisms based on associative or
reinforcement learning can also produce SDEs (Frank, Rudy, & O’Reilly, 2003; Frank, Rudy, Levy,
& O’Reilly, 2005; Leo & Greene, 2008; Moses et al., 2006; Von Fersen, Wynne, Delius, & Staddon,
1991). Value-transfer theory (Von Fersen et al., 1991) provides one such account of TI that does not
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 32
require explicit reasoning about the hierarchy or coordination of multiple premises. Value-transfer
theory proposes that the learner assigns a value to each item based on the rate at which it is
reinforced during training, and that these values generalize between items that appear together as
premise pairs. Transitive inference entails comparing the learned values of any two items and
choosing the item with a higher value. Like integrative encoding, this process produces an SDE
since distant items (which tend to be closer to endpoints with the highest or lowest values) exhibit
larger disparities in value than adjacent items. Although this account cannot be ruled out entirely,
there are several reasons to conclude that participants relied on integrative encoding in the present
study. Prior work shows that explicit reasoning is more likely when learners are aware of the
underlying hierarchy (Frank, O’Reilly, & Curran, 2006; C. Smith & Squire, 2005) and that
awareness is associated with errors that are inconsistent with value transfer theory (Lazareva &
Wasserman, 2010; Libben & Titone, 2008; Moses et al., 2006). Moreover, the inﬂuence of WMC on
performance strongly suggests a reliance on explicit reasoning rather than a simpler associative
learning process. The ﬁndings of Libben and Titone (2008) illustrate this distinction most clearly in
their comparison of participants who diﬀered in their awareness of the underlying hierarchy. Among
unaware participants, WMC was unrelated to inference accuracy and the pattern of errors was
consistent with value-transfer theory. In contrast, among aware participants, WMC was positively
related to accuracy and performance was most consistent with a reliance on integrative encoding.
Thus, it appears most likely that current task encouraged the use of integrative encoding and that
this process was enhanced by the opportunity to control study.
A preference for “chained” study sequences
Taken together, the results suggest that a principal beneﬁt of active control in TI is that it
allows learners to generate study sequences that are more amenable to integrative encoding.
Participants strongly preferred to learn about options that were nearby to items that had just been
studied, and this preference was strongest when the near option was part of an overlapping premise
pair. As a result, participants generated sequences of chained premises, a type of training that
typically leads to faster learning than random sequences under passive conditions (Andrews, 2010).
The strong preference for overlapping options even appeared to speed responses during passive
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 33
observation where selections were predetermined.
If chained sequences of overlapping pairs aid integrative encoding, why did only higher WMC
participants beneﬁt? It may be that only higher WMC individuals capitalize on chained sequences
because they are more likely to maintain representations of premises from trial to trial and
integrate information from multiple premises. In other words, those individuals with higher WMC
simply have the resources necessary for integrative encoding, regardless of whether the study
sequence is self-generated or provided by an external source. This interpretation is supported by
the ﬁnding that higher WMC participants performed equally well in the active and yoked
conditions in Experiment 2.
As noted above, however, active and yoked study diﬀered in an important respect in that
experiment: WMC was positively related to accuracy on inference trials in the active, but not
yoked, condition. This suggests that the eﬀect of active control cannot be completely accounted for
by the makeup of the study sequence. One intriguing possibility to be examined in future work is
that higher WMC individuals draw on their knowledge of the hierarchy when deciding which option
to study. This may explain why selection RT was positively related to WMC in both experiments,
reﬂecting additional time prior to choosing an option and before the superordinate outcome was
revealed. If controlling the selection of premises causes learners to reactivate their existing
knowledge, this decision process may on its own pave the way for integrative encoding. This would
lend support to the popular notion that knowledge construction is more eﬀective when the learner
decides how to study materials for themselves.
Implications for learner-directed instruction
The present ﬁndings oﬀer a note of caution regarding the eﬀects of learner control in the
formation of relational knowledge. Lower WMC participants showed no advantage from active
control compared to passive observation, despite being aware of the hierarchy and having the
opportunity to select premises for themselves. This ﬁnding may be unsurprising to researchers who
have argued that having to search for information or independently discover concepts imposes an
extraneous cognitive load that disadvantages lower WMC learners (Kirschner et al., 2006). It seems
ACTIVE TRANSITIVE INFERENCE 34
unlikely, however, that lower WMC participants here were limited by the demands of making
selection decisions, as WMC was unrelated to the frequency with which participants selected nearby
options. Moreover, performance in the yoked condition of Experiment 2 indicates that release from
the need to control study did not have any apparent beneﬁt. It appears instead that lower WMC
participants were less able to engage in integrative encoding and, as a consequence, could not take
advantage of more useful study sequences.
This ﬁnding highlights the risk of conﬂating overt control over the study experience—a
ubiquitous feature of “active” instruction—with the internal construction of knowledge. To
physically interact with or to generate useful evidence from the environment does not guarantee
that the learner extracts generalizable knowledge from that experience. For lower WMC learners in
particular, active control may be most eﬀective in environments that support integration across
study episodes, including prompts to reactivate related materials (Kesteren, Krabbendam, &
Meeter, 2018) or simultaneous presentation of materials (Eglington & Kang, 2018; Son, Smith, &
Goldstone, 2011). The construction of relational knowledge is a fundamental learning goal that
spans educational contexts (Dumas, Alexander, & Grossnickle, 2013). In order to meet the needs of
diverse populations of learners, including those with impairments in cognitive functioning, there is a
need for instructional approaches that guide conceptual integration during the course of
self-directed study.

Appendix A: Model selection
Mixed eﬀects regression was used to model test accuracy and RT. The formulae for the
best-ﬁtting models are listed in Table 4. The procedure for selecting the best-ﬁtting model was as
follows. First, a baseline model was deﬁned in each study which included relevant predictors as
independent ﬁxed eﬀects (Experiment 1: Session, Condition, Distance, and Operation span;
Experiment 2: Condition, Distance, and Operation Span). I then generated all possible
combinations of interactions between these factors, leading to 113 models in Experiment 1 and 9
models in Experiment 2. Best-ﬁtting models were selected based on the minimum AIC.
For RT models there was only one observation (median RT) for each combination of factors.
As a result, the random eﬀects structure only included random intercepts to capture
between-subject variability. For the accuracy models, a random eﬀects structure was chosen to
include as many predictors (including interactions) as possible without producing convergence
failures (see Table 4). In Experiment 2, including Distance as a random eﬀect led to convergence
failures, so this predictor was excluded from the ﬁtted models for test accuracy.
