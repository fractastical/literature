Recently, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors have become the frontier as possible target-
ing for anti-cancer and antidiabetic drugs. The contemporary observe represents a pc assisted version to in-
vestigate the importance of precise residues within the binding web site of PTP1B with numerous San g-
genon derivatives remoted from nature. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to estimate 
the dynamics of the complexes, and absolute binding unfastened energies have been calculated with exclu-
sive additives, and carried out through the usage of the Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann floor re-
gion (MM-PB/SA) and Generalized Born surface vicinity (MM-GB/SA) strategies. The effects show that 
the expected free energies of the complexes are normally constant with the available experimental stati s-
tics. MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis shows that the residues Asp29, Arg24, Met258, and , 
Arg254 in the second active site in PTP1B are crucial for the excessive selectivity of the inhibitors.

Introduction 
PTP1B (protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B) 
is a non -transmembrane enzyme found on the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a broadly 
expressed phosphatise. It plays a relevant 
modulator position in signaling pathways init i-
ated through the activation of the tyrosine k i-
nase receptor superfamily  [1, 2].  It is thought 
that PTP1B is involved in a critical node of i n-
sulin signaling by dephosphorylating and inac-
tivating the insulin receptor, thus switching off 
insulin signaling. PTP1B is likewise implicated 
in the manipulate of  immune mobile signaling, 
controlling cytokine signaling pathways via 
dephosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), 
non-receptor tyrosine -protein kinase 2 (TYK2) 
and sign transducer and activator of transcri p-
tion 5 (STAT5) [3,  4].  furthermore, it's far b e-
lieved that interleukin -4 (IL -four) induces 
PTP1B mRNA in a phosphatidylinositol three -
kinase (PI3K)-established manner and increases 
PTP1B protein stability to suppress IL -four-
precipitated STAT6 signaling. The excessive 
affinity substrate binding by PTPs i s caused by 
the phosphoryl group and amino acid residues 
flanking the phosphotyrosyl (pTyr) residue [5,  
6]. pTyr residues are liable to hydrolysis by 
cellular phosphatates  and consequently they are 
not ideally suited for inhibitor development. 
consequently incorporation of non -hydrolizable 
phosphate mimetics inclusive of phosph oneme-
thylphenylalanine (pmp), phosphonodiflourome-
thylphenylalanine (F2 pmp), into a selected gold 
standard peptide template were employed in the 
development of mighty and select ive PTP1B 
inhibitors [7].  Even though those peptide inhib-
itors are most effective, aggressive and selective 
PTP1B inhibitors, diff iculties in their cellular 
membrane shipping and the reality that they are 
peptide phosphonates cause them to less proper 
as drug applicants [8,9].  Although there are a 
number of reports on the designing and deve l-
opment of synthetic PTP1B inhibi tors, only a 
few studies cover PTP1B inhibitors d erived 
from plants. Rollinger et al. reported Sanggenon 
molecules, as antifungal compounds, and isolat-
ed them from Methanol Morus root bark extract 
by bio-guided fractionation [10]. 
It has recently been reported that San gge-
non derivatives, which has showed antifungal ac-
tivities, also possess inhibition effects on PTP1B.  
The present paper  aims to describe a d e-
tail of binding mode of PTP1B with Sanggenon 
derivatives.

The reasons for choosing these molecules 
are that they have already got expe rimental IC50 
values with PTP1B for comparison and they are 
good candidates because they can be easily is o-
lated from nature and are potential scaffolds for 
chemical modifications to develop and design 
new drugs [11]. We have chosen  this series to 
clarified their binding pose  with PTP 1B by 
docking and MD simulations and to derive struc-
ture–activity relationship. They have been e m-
ployed to reveal the structural factors responsible 
for selectivity of inhibitors between ant ifungal 
Sanggenon compounds and human PTP1B. 
The inhibition effect of the molecules was 
facilitated by the usage of the Molecular M e-
chanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area and 
the Generalized Born Surface Area Methods. 
The complex structure of every co m-
pound was modelled through the use of the 
Dock 6.5 program sc oring feature [12]. every 
complex structure become eventually subjec ted 
to a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 10 
ns long with the aid of the usage of the AMBER 
11.0 application [13,14]. primarily based on the 
configuration ensembles retrieved from the MD 
trajectories, a MM-PB/SA become employed to 
compute the binding free energies of all four 
PTP1B inhibitors. n umerous elements of the 
MM-PB/SA method have been explored in the 
take a look at with the intention to acquire o p-
timized e ffects. The X -score s coring function 
become located to produce similarly desirable 
effects as MM-PB/SA on each complex systems 
become prepared by using molecular docking, 
and the configurationally ensembles received 
thru lengthy MD simulations [15]. The mol e-
cule dynamics (MD) calculation, decomposition 
analysis and free energy  were employed to 
examined the detailed binding mechanisms of 
the Sanggenon inhibitors based on the se cond 
active site of PTP1B [16,17]  The pe rformance 
of MM -PB/SA was slightly inferior to that of 
MM-GB/SA.  
Method All molecular dynamic calcul a-
tions were executed the use of the Assisted 
model building with energy Refinement 
(AMBER) suite of programs (version eleven). 
3-D systems had been displayed using Chim era 
(UCSF [18],  DSV [19]. RMSD snap shots were 
proven by way of the XMGRACE [20] package 
program. XLeAP as applied in AMBER became 
employed to put together parameter/topology

and coordinate files and solvate and additiona l-
ly to neutralize the system for the MD simul a-
tions. Systems have been solvated wi th a TIP3P 
[21] water model with the aid of growing an 
isometric water container where the gap of the 
field is 10 Å from the periphery of the protein -
ligand complex. An ff99SB pressure area turned 
into used for the protein. Atomic partial e x-
penses had been determined by way of the ante-
chamber module of the AMBER package u sing 
AM1-Bcc (Austian model with Bond and 
charge correction) for the ligands and the ove r-
all AMBER pressure area (GAFF) [22] became 
adopted in simulation for the ligands as it ha n-
dles small  natural molecules. Hydr ogen bond 
analyses between the protein and the ligands 
and RMSD adjustments with time throughout 
MD simulations were calculated by way of the 
ptraj module as applied within the AMBER 
applications package. 
Preliminary complexes had b een placed 
in a cubic field of express TIP3P water mol e-
cules with a maximum distance between the 
protein and the edge of the container of 10 Å. 
The essential counterions have been added in an 
effort to neutralize the systems. Periodic boun d-
ary conditions were used in all simulations with 
the Particle Mesh Ewald approach [23] to co m-
pute long electrostatic intera ctions. A cut off 
distance of 10 Å was chosen to compute Van 
der Waals (VdW) non-bonded interactions. 1 ns 
MD simulation b ecame carried out for each 
ligand in a vacuum, at three hundred ok. Each 
complex shape became then subjected to a m o-
lecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 10 ns 
lengthy the use of the AMBER v11 software. 
Primarily based on the configurational ense m-
bles r evoked from the MD trajectories,  MM-
PB/SA became employed to compute the bin d-
ing unfastened energies of all 4 PTP1B inhib i-
tors. The pe rformance of MM -PB/SA became 
barely not so good as that of MM -GB/SA. Sev-
eral factors of the MM-GB(PB)/SA method had 
been explored in this observe to reap optimized 
consequences.  The molecule dynamics (MD) 
simulation, unfastened strength calculations and 
free strength decomposition analysis had been 
hired to analyze the d etailed binding mode of 
the Sanggenon derivative i nhibitors based on 
the second binding  site of PTP1B. All inhibitor 
structures are proven in (Figure1). 
Molecular Docking 
Dock 6.5 module permits the appearing 
of all tiers of a docking technique, era of ligand 
conformations, ligand docking, and scoring of 
the binding modes. As in this example, in which 
a i nflexible receptor approximation turned into 
used, it is expected that the special receptors 
taken into consideration will lead to distinct 
ligand-binding modes depending on the preli m-
inary size of the PTP1B-binding cavity. For this 
reason, the four new PTP1B inhibitors had been 
docked into the available the receptor binding 
following a multistep process. On the way to  
describe receptor-binding site , a grid of pote n-
tial energy changed into calculated for atoms 
inside the binding pocket. These atoms had 
been obtained from the analysis of each pr o-
tein–ligand complex. In this step, default p a-
rameters had been used. Then, the ligand 
changed into docked the usage of the calculated 
grid to vicinity it into the cavity and rating the 
proposed binding modes. 
Molecular Dynamics Simulations 
The initial enzyme structure of PTP 1B 
was obtained from the Protein Data Bank of 
Brokhaven Natio nal Laboratory (PDB entry 
1wax) [24]. 1wax.pdb has 2.20 Å resolution and 
already has an inhibitors in its structure for 
comparison of docking. 1wax.pdb sequence has 
shown Figure  8. Crystallographic water mol e-
cules had been removed from all of the stru c-
tures and the missing coordinates of the atoms 
had been modelled the use of xLeAP and an 
ff99SB force subject. Atoms on PTP1B h ad 
been assigned the PARM99 expenses, and all 
ionizable residues were set at their default pr o-
tonation states at impartial pH. All systems had 
been similarly processed by way of the xLeAP 
module of AMBER. Structures have been sol v-
ated with a TIP3P water model through growing 
an isometric water container, in which the space 
of the box is 10 Å from the periphery of protein. 
The molecular systems had been neutralized 
through the addition of counterions. The sy s-
tems have been minimized in two steps; i nside 
the first step, the protein and ligand had been

saved constant, most effective the water mol e-
cules had been allowed to move, and within the 
2d step, all atoms had been allowed to move. 
For step one, the energy minimiz ation became 
performed in 500 and 2500 steps with the steep-
est descent and conjugate gradient methods, r e-
spectively. For the second step, the strength min-
imizations have been done in 500 and 2500 steps 
the use of the steepest descent and conjugant gra-
dient techniques, respectively. Heating chan ged 
into done with an NVT ensemble for two hundred 
playstation  where the protein -ligand com plex 
turned into limited with a force co nsistent of 10 
kcal/mol/Å. Equilibration was achieved for two 
hundred playstation  on an NPT en semble r e-
straining the protein-ligand complicated with the 
aid of 1 kcal/mol/Å2. Final simulations, the pro-
duction phase, had been done for five ns on an 
NPT ensemble at a 300 okay te mperature and 1 
atm strain without any restrain. Step length 
changed into 2 fs for the complete simulation. A 
Langevin thermostat and barostat have been used 
for coupling the temperature and pressure. A 
SHAKE algorithm become implemented to co n-
strain all bonds containing hydrogen atoms. The 
nonbonded cut off turned into stored at 10 Å, and 
lengthy range electrostatic interactions had been 
treated by using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) 
approach with a fast Fourier rework grid with 
approximately zero 1 nm area. Trajectory sna p-
shots, which had been eventually used for evalua-
tion, had been taken at each 1 ps. [25].  
MM-PB/SA 
The MM -PBSA (molecular mechanics 
Poisson–Boltzmann surface location) technique 
is held to be one of the greater computationally 
tractable approach of acquiring affordable est i-
mates of the free energy of a complicated d e-
vice. In essence, it is quite trustworthy: one 
performs a conventional m olecular dynamics 
simulation of the complex in a periodic water 
box with counterions and the resulting traject o-
ry is then publish -processed with the aid of r e-
moving the solvent and the periodicity and c al-
culating the average of loose electricity over a 
series of static frames or “snapshots” consistent 
with the formula below. 
G = EMM + Gpolar + Gnonpolar − TSMM 
Here, EMM is the average sum of molecular 
mechanical strength terms, Ebond + Eangle + 
Etorsion + EVdW + Eelectrostatic Gpolar and 
Gnonpolar describe the unfastened power of the 
solvent continuum. The Gpolar time period can 
be obtained both thru the answer of the Poi s-
son–Boltzmann equation, or the use of an equal 
Generalized Born approximation. The G nonpo-
lar part is typically acquired by means of sca l-
ing the solvent available floor region with the 
aid of the appropriate surface anxi ety. S is the 
entropy of the solute either from quasi -
harmonic evaluation of the trajectory or from 
normal mode calculati ons on a (restrained) 
range of snapshots. Then binding free energies 
are acquired from 
ΔGbinding = Gcomplex − Greceptor − Gligand 
All energy additives have been calculated the 
use of a 100 snapshots from 1 ns to 5 ns. The 
snapshots from 1 to 5 ns molecular  dynamics 
(MD) simulation trajectories were taken from 
the calcul ation of free energy. For PBSA and 
GBSA calculations, dielectric constants so lvent 
became taken as 80.0, respectively. 
Free Energy Decomposition Analysis  
Free energy turned into decomposed t o 
estimate the contribution of every residue in the 
binding procedure and was completed the use of 
MM/PBSA. The free energy turned into calc u-
lated by using the MM/GBSA method. The 
energy of every residue -inhibitor interaction is 
given by using the subsequent equation: 
ΔGinhibitor-residue =ΔEvdw+ΔEele+ΔGGB +ΔGSA  (5) 
Where in ΔGGB is free energy due to the 
solvation process of polar contribution calcula t-
ed using the generalized Born model. MD simu-
lation trajectories in the 5 ns were taken, and all 
energies w ere calculated for each frame. Total 
energy, the average energy of backbone and 
side chains for each residue was calcula ted. In 
order to get the contribution of each resi due to 
the total binding energy.  
Where Δ GGB is free energy due to the 
solvation process of polar contribution calcula t-
ed using the generalized Born model, Δ GSA is 
free energy due to a surface area factor.  MD 
simulation traje ctories at the range of 1 -5 ns

were taken, and all the energies were calcula ted 
for each frame. The average energy of  back-
bone and side chains for each residue was sep a-
rately calculated, and the total energy was ca l-
culated as well [26]. 
Results and Discussion 
The structures of Sanggenon derivatives 
used in this study are presented in Figure 1. The 
lowest energy conformer s for each derivative 
were located by performing simulated annea l-
ing. These conformers were used for docking.  
All the ligands were selectively docked into the 
active site of the enzyme. They produce doc k-
ing scores ranging from -47 to -60 kcal mol-1 as 
shown in Table 1.

Before docking these derivatives, the 
molecule in the x -ray structure was docked into 
the protein and it was found that all the ligands 
are docked into the same location of this mol e-
cule as shown in Figure 2. 
Each complex was subjected to MD ca l-
culations for a period of 10 ns. To explore the 
dynamic stability of these four protein/inhibitor 
complexes, and to ensure the rationality sa m-
pling strategy, root -mean-square deviations 
(RMSD) values of the protein were plotted in 
Figure 3. 
The RMSD plots sh ow that the confo r-
mations of the complexes usually achieve equ i-
librium at ∼300 ps, while with some confo r-
mations; this equilibrium time is ∼600 ps. A 
Kinetic energy, potential energy and total energy 
of PTP1B complexes are represented in Figure 4. 
Trajectory data from MD trajectories were 
analyzed in terms of hydrogen bonding intera c-
tions, orientation of the inhibitor within the a c-
tive site, other interactions such as aromatic π–π 
stacking and hydrophobic intera ctions, RMS 
deviation of the active site res idues and binding 
energy (Figure 5).  
To compare the orientation of the ligands 
in the active site of the protein, all co mpounds 
were superimposed, as indicated in Figure 6.

They illustrated that all the compounds  
showed similar interaction modes of binding in 
the second active site of PTP1B. Orie ntation of 
these inhibitors in the enzyme B site indicates that 
the interaction of the hydr ogen bond is of great 
importance during binding (Deora et al., 2013; 
Puius et al., 1997).  
The presence of the occupancy between 
compound 1- 4 and residue bonds is summarized 
in Table 3. The role of Gln102 and Asp29 residues 
in particular are notable in the hydrogen bond for-
mation for the complex of the protein with the lig-
ands as shown in Table 3. Additionally, other resi-
dues play key roles in the interaction of the enzyme 
with Sanggenon derivatives. These are Arg24 and 
Arg254 via hydrogen bonds, Met258 via van der 
Waals interactions and Phe182 via pi-pi interaction 
Figure 6. The two dimensional docking diagram is 
shown in Figure 7 the effect of amino acids on it 
can be seen more clearly. 
The RMSF fluctuations for the comple x-
es of PTP1B with inhibitors showed that the 
residues in the active site of binding are more 
intact, indicating the tight binding of the inhib i-
tors (Figure 8).

The decomposition energy values are al-
so consistent with the RMSF. Overall, the struc-
tures with the same proteins share similar 
RMSF distributions and similar trends of d y-
namic features.  
The efficiency  of a ligand binding to a 
protein can be estimated by the snapshots from 
a trajectory of the complex in the MM/PBSA 
calculations. The binding free energies and the 
energy components of the complexes are shown 
in Table 2. It was gratifying that the available 
experimental data of the inhibitors (IC 50) are 
consistent with the molecular model results  as 
noted in Table  2. It ind icates that 3 (IC50=1.6 
µM) has a larger energy of binding compared 
with 2 (IC50=2.6 µM). The available  data was 
compared to the correlations between the avai l-
able experimental IC50 and each of the five free 
energy components, ΔEele, ΔEvdw, ΔGPB, ΔGGB, 
ΔH and calculated Ki. The calculated data 
demonstrated that the polar contribution, ele c-
trostatic interaction and the polar part of the 
desolvation and hydrogen bonds enhance the 
binding of the inhibitors. The r esults indicate 
that the electrostatic componets (Δ Eele+ΔGPB) 
contibute more to the binding energy compared 
with the non -polar (Δ Evdw+ΔGSA) components. 
The free energy of the complexations is o b-
served in the range of -7.37 to -13.16 kcal/mol, 
respectively. Orientation of these inhibitors in 
the enzyme B site indicates that the interaction 
of the hydrogen bond is of great importance 
during binding. The role of Gln102 and Asp29 
residues in particular are notable in the hydr o-
gen bond formation for the complex of the pro-
tein with the ligands as shown in Table 3. The 
presence of the occupancy b etween compound 
1–4 and residue bonds is summarized in Table 
3. The result shows that compound 2 and  com-
pound 4 with a similar chemical structure but 
with different stereochemistr y are effective on 
inhibition. Furthermore, compound 1 has the 
highest activity among the natural Sanggenon 
derivatives, which can be interpreted from its 
high interaction energy. Having a high total 
enclosed volume, compound 1 effectively o c-
cupied the van  der Waals contacts of Met258. 
Additional hydrogen bonds and electr ostatic 
interactions, with the residues of the Asp29, 
Arg254, Arg24 contributed significantly t oward 
the enhanced inhibitor activity of co mpound 1. 
Moreover, compound 1 and 2, co mpounds 1, 2 
exhibit similar activity and inte ractions, and 
Van der Waals with Met258, Asp29 and the 
electrostatic contacts of the inhibitors with the 
Arg24, Arg254, as ill ustrated in Figure 1, ge n-
erally belong to the same category. The three 
dimensional projection o f the complexes in 
Figure 6, point to the connection areas of the 
ligands and the locations of the connection area. 
The most effe ctive amino acids are seen in the 
connection area of the inhibitors.  
The dock results demonstrated that elec-
trostatic largely contribute to  the binding of 
inhibitors (Table 1) . The MM/PB(GB)SA re-
sults also indicate that the electrostatic comp o-
nents (ΔEele+ΔGPB) contribute more to the bind-
ing energy compared with the non -polar 
(ΔEvdw+ΔGSA) components.  The larger diffe r-
ence between  the dock scores and 
MM/PB(GB)SA results may be attributed to the 
fact the dock algorithm does not consider the 
contribution from the salv ation and also the 
protein is kept fixed during the calculations. 
The potency of the inhibitors is mainly 
governed by the π -π stacking interactions, h y-
drophobic i nteractions, and the van der Waals 
contacts of the inhibitors with the Arg24, 
Arg257, Met258, Arg254, and Phe182 in add i-
tion to the hydrogen bonding interactions. Ca l-
culated thermodynamic parameters for the com-
plexation of the Sanggenon derivatives by 
MM/PBSA method analysis are shown in  
Table 2.  
The correlation between the information 
in this projection and the decomposition anal y-
sis acquired from the calculation of MM/GB SA 
is clear (Table 4). This compound b inds to the 
PTP1B active site predominantly by both h y-
drophobic interactions and hydrogen bond bind-
ing interactions.

Conclusion 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
for a period of 10 ns on complexed PTP1B had 
been fulfilled with the g oal of disclosing the 
possible mechanisms of ligand recognition and 
inhibition. The maximum exceptional reality is 
the motion of the second one ene rgetic site, and 
the sorts of interactions with it. According to 
our calculated van der Waals and electrostat ic 
energies among PTP1B and the inhibitor San g-
genon, it is obtrusive that the greater contrib u-
tions to the  Van der Waals to PTP1B -inhibitor 
complexes conformation, binding site, the extra 
electrostatic interaction  results, which  is co n-
stant with other  to be had experimental r e-
search. By analyzing the interactions between 
PTP1B and the high -affinity inhibitor co m-
pound 1, it become observed that the residues 
adjoining to the second one active site, incl u-
sive of, Met258, Arg24, Asp29, Arg254, and, 
might be  partly accountable for the excessive 
inhibitory activity and selectivity of PTP1B. 
The MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA techniques 
produce similar binding energies and hence 
they each can be applied to calculated the bin d-
ing energies for similar structures. In step wi th 
the MD simulations, MM/PBSA unfastened 
electricity calculations, and MM/GBSA free 
power decomposition analyses, we will make 
the subsequent conclusions. The simulation 
effects imply that PTP1B may be effective and 
selective inhibitors, which now not not ed inside 
the literature, of Sanggenon molecule. 
In the designing of extra effective med i-
cine the development of such molecules and 
targeting the floor residues, as an example, the 
region containing Met258, Arg254, Gln102 and 
Asp29 of the second phosphate binding site is 
probably advantageous.
