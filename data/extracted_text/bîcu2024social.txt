Social anxiety disorder and interoceptive trait prediction error: An account from the free 
energy principle 
 
 
Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a type of anxiety disorder which impacts every 
day functioning, particularly in terms of interpersonal relationships. The cognitive-behavioral 
model is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Though this 
model has long informed clinical practice, it has been criticized for its overreliance on cognitive 
processes and rational thinking, disregarding the role of emotions as well as other biological 
and social factors. This limitation is especially evident in the treatment of SAD, where cognitive-
behavioral approaches often fail to produce long-term results. In this study, we will argue in 
favor of a new approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, emerging in the last decade 
from the field of computational psychiatry, focusing on the brain’s predictive mechanisms. We 
will show how SAD can arise from erroneous interoceptive inferences—incorrect predictions 
about internal bodily states— which lead to unreliable predictions about the social environment. 
These erroneous inferences reinforce the individual's perception that the social world is 
unpredictable and that their actions are insufficient to reduce this uncertainty, creating a state 
of learned uncertainty. 
 
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common type of anxiety disorder, characterized by a 
constant fear of social evaluation, which affects every day  functioning, especially in terms of 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  2 
 
   
 
interpersonal relationships (APA, 2000). Classical theories of anxiety center around the idea that 
people with SAD overly anticipate negative appraisals from others regarding their presence, 
leading to persistent avoidance of social environments. While early behavioral theories focused on 
the role of conditioning and learning in explaining anxious behavior (Clark, 1986; Lissek, 2005), 
the subsequent work of Beck and Ellis on cognitive biases and filters established a new view 
highlighting the role of thought patterns in generating and maintaining anxiety (Beck, 1970; Ellis, 
1980).  
These two theories culminated in what is now known as the cognitive-behavioral model 
which proposes that anxiety is a result of a combination of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. 
The theory suggests that t hought patterns like catastrophizing (expecting the worst possible 
outcome to occur) and mind -reading (assuming others are thinking negatively about you) can 
sustain anxiety by exacerbating threats and underestimating one's ability to cope with social 
situations (Beck and Weishaar,1989; Brewin, 1996; Turner, 2012) . Individuals with anxiety hold 
negative beliefs about themselves, the world and the future, believing that the world is a dangerous 
place, the future is uncertain and that they are powerless to handle life's challenges (Gústavsson, 
2021). These negative beliefs will perpetuate the cycle of anxiety leading to hypervigilance and  
avoidance behaviors (Freeston, 2023; So, 2024).  
While the cognitive-behavioral model is regarded as one of the most effective treatments 
for anxiety disorders, it does pose several limitations. It has been criticized for its overreliance on 
cognitive processes and rational thinking, disregarding the rol e of emotions, as well as other 
biological and social factors (Hambrick, 2010). Even though it is considered very successful in 
treating specific phobias and general anxiety disorder (GAD), it is not very effective in treating 
other types of anxiety such a s social anxiety disorder, and it is sensitive to relapse especially if 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  3 
 
   
 
patients don't maintain the skills learned through therapy (Turner, 2012; Van Dis, 2020). Perhaps 
the biggest criticism against the cognitive -behavioral model is the observation that anxiety and 
stress-related responses can persist even though the erroneou s beliefs have been challenged 
through therapy (Beidel & Turner, 1986; Gerrans & Murray, 2020). 
In the last decade, a new theory of anxiety has emerged from the field of computational 
psychiatry, its view positioned within the free energy principle, which aims to re -conceptualize 
anxiety as a disorder that arises from the brain's generative models' inability to reliably predict and 
act upon the world, creating a state of learned uncertainty. In this study, we will argue in favor of 
this approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, and we'll show how SAD can arise from 
erroneous interoceptive in ferences which lead to unreliable predictions about the social 
environment.  
 
The free energy principle and predictive processing  
According to Frinston (2006), t he free energy  principle framework that postulates free -
energy minimization follows adaptive change, for any kind of biological organism. According to 
the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy (disorder) of an isolated system increases 
over time, thus any system will eventually decay (Schneider and Kay, 1994). But biological 
systems have the property of resisting dissipation by m aintaining a low level of internal entropy 
through the exchange of energy with their surroundings (Kondepudi, 2022). In this way, biological 
systems can maintain themselves within a low number of "attractor" states, a process known 
traditionally as homeostasis. These are low entropy states which allow biological systems to 
maintain their own existence. According to the free energy principle, they achieve this by 
simulating the "sensed" world, both externally and internally (Friston, 2010) . Free energy can be 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  4 
 
   
 
understood as a proxy for surprise or uncertainty, thus minimizing free energy is equivalent to 
reducing the error (uncertainty) of the simulated world. 
The theory of predictive processing is an application of the free energy principle which 
states that the brain collects ambiguous sensory data from the outside and inside the body and then 
analyses it in order to construct a predictive model of the world ( Hohwy, 2013). From a 
neuroscientific point of view, the brain can be understood as an information processing machine 
whose purpose is to construct a prediction of the world and to minimize the subsequent prediction 
error (Clark, 2013). The top -down neural activity of higher integrative areas is propagating 
predictions about the cause of the sensory signals while the bottom -up or feed - forward neural 
activity of sensory areas carry the sensory signals themselves. The difference between the 
predicted outcome and the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. If the error is small 
enough, the signal will be attenuated, for example via inhibitory mechanisms, but if the error is 
big then it will propagate to the higher integrative areas where the predi ction will be revised to 
account for the prediction error (Bastos et al., 2012; Friston, 2010; Huang and Rao, 2011). In other 
words, the models that we deploy to predict the world are in line with the Bayesian framework, in 
which observations acquired a priori, shaped as beliefs, are faced with updates – the model updates 
as well. 
The prediction errors can also be reduced by interacting with the environment and testing 
out the prediction model, through a process called active inference. This process minimizes error 
by testing and updating generative models through action s that reflect the preferred outcome of 
the agent. By predicting a preferred outcome, the model can act as a "self -fulfilling prophecy" 
bringing about the preferred outcomes, while avoiding the non-preferred ones (Friston et al., 2017; 
Hesp, 2021; Smith et al., 2021).

Computational psychiatry and anxiety 
Computational psychiatry is an emerging multidisciplinary field that uses mathematical 
and computational tools to analyze how the brain processes information. A core idea of 
computational psychiatry is that the brain acts as a prediction machine, thus it u ses the theory of 
predictive processing and free energy principle to offer a more integrative and systematic approach 
compared to the classical symptom - based approach. Psychiatric disorders can be understood by 
the different balances of the ways the brain process information (Clark, 2023).  
Using this framework, we can define anxiety in terms of belief updating as a condition 
characterized by overweighted expectations. Agents act upon beliefs that the world is 
unpredictable and uncertain, and that the agent's actions are insufficient in minimizing uncertainty 
(Clark, 2023; Fradkin et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2019).  This is coupled with an inability to learn 
from subsequent prediction errors, preventing the brain from updating the models. This resistance 
to new information is what leads to a situation that Barrett (2017) calls "locked -in" brain. This 
overweighted expectation coupled with underweighted new information leads to the "lock - in" of 
the current model that the world is unpredictable.  
Uncertainty by itself doesn’t bring the negative affective valence associated with anxiety. 
Our brain is constantly searching for novelty and the opportunity to learn from new data and reduce 
uncertainty. The formation of affective valence can be described  by a process called error 
dynamics (Clark, 2023).  This refers to the difference between the actual performance of error 
minimization compared to the expected performance. Positive affect is associated with good error 
dynamics, when the brain performs bet ter than expected in minimizing error. Negative affect is 
associated with bad error dynamics, meaning the brain performed worse than expected (Anderson, 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  6 
 
   
 
2019; Hesp, 2021). We can see then that the negative affect associated with anxiety is a product 
of the agent inability (or perceived inability) to reliably reduce prediction error. 
We saw earlier how anxiety can emerge as an imbalance of the way that the brain processes 
information, attributing more weight to expectations that the world is unpredictable and that the 
action policies are not enough to reduce the uncertainty. A way to understand how this happens is 
through a process called learned uncertainty, an important concept we’ll meet again later in this 
study. Learned uncertainty (McGovern et al., 2022) is a process through which the brain reinforces 
a model in which uncertainty is the norm, and the uncertainty of action policies is irreducible. If 
the agent is exposed to sufficiently long-lasting surprising outcomes, in which there is a difference 
between the predicted consequences of action and the actual consequences encountered, the brain’s 
ability to construct adaptive models will be impaired. This will then gear the prediction -action 
cycle towards unpredictable outcomes which will reinforce the idea that the world is uncertain 
(Clark, 2023). This new “adaptive” model will still try to minimize prediction errors, but under the 
assumption that the world is inherently unpredictable and that action policies are not enough to 
resolve them (McGovern, 2022). 
  
Anxiety and interoception 
Interoception refers to the sensing of internal bodily sensations (Craig, 2002). It can include 
feelings such as heart rate, perspiration, muscle tension, stomach discomfort, blood pressure. The 
combination of all these sensations helps the individual inte grate them into a unifying perception 
of the body (Craig, 2002). Interoceptive sensitivity plays an important role in developing or 
maintaining a high level of anxiety. A lot of studies have shown that people suffering from anxiety 
disorders are very focus ed on the interoceptive signals given by their bodies (De Berardis et al., 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  7 
 
   
 
2007; Olatunji et al., 2007; Anderson & Hope, 2009). These studies have suggested that anxious 
individuals self -report hypervigilance in terms of their bodily sensations, when compared to 
controls. However, despite the importance of capturing the raw experience using self -evaluated 
assessment of subjective interoception, the perceived interoceptive sensitivity is not always 
aligned with the objective measurements (e.g. heart rate detection). Hence, in order to understand 
what exactly is measured, how and fr om what perspective, this complex construct needs to be 
formally delineated into concepts that distinguish between levels of interoceptive processing. 
In this regard, a three-dimensional construct of interoception has been proposed (Garfinkel 
& Critchley, 2013). The first one, interoceptive accuracy, refers to the objective measurement of 
bodily signals. The second one, interoceptive sensibility, refers to the self -perceived signals that 
one reports usually by means of questionnaires. The last construct, interoceptive awareness, relates 
to how accurate people think they are in estimating their bodily signals. This model is very useful 
when talking about anxiety, since it can help identify if something goes wrong in terms of people’s 
predictions concerning interoception. 
In fact, some studies showed that, despite the fact that anxious people attend a lot to their internal 
signals, they are not very good at predicting them accurately (Quadt et al, 2021; Depascalis et al., 
1984). In other words, anxious people thought they h ad a high metacognitive awareness of 
interoceptive accuracy, yet the objective measurements of heart rate detection were not in 
accordance with their reports. The authors suggest that anxiety may be caused by the discrepancy 
between low accuracy in predicting bodily signals and a distorted self-confidence in the accuracy 
of those predictions. This difference, known as interoceptive trait prediction error (Garfinkel et al., 
2016), may be a crucial factor for explaining anxiety as an altered state of predicti ng internal 
signals.

Anxiety and theory of mind 
Theory of mind is a fundamental concept in social cognition literature. It  refers to the ability to 
accurately decode and infer the thoughts, intentions and emotions of others (Wellman, 1990). 
There are two main theories which help create the foundation for the theoretical framework 
regarding mentalizing: theory-theory and simulation theory. Theory-theory relates to how people 
construct an implicit theory of mind, by making observations and hypo theses based on their 
experience with the environment. One example of this would be when someone learns that when 
people smile in their presence, they usually think he or she is a nice person. On the other hand, 
simulation theory suggests that people use perspective-taking in order to predict another person’s 
mental state. For instance, one person could simulate what others were thinking after failing a test, 
making use of his own experience of having received a bad grade.   
 
The underlying socio-cognitive mechanisms in anxiety disorders have given mixed results 
because of the heterogeneity of the disorder, and because of the diverse methodologies used in 
studies. However, a recent meta -analysis showed that people with SAD had significantly lower 
performances in theory of mind tasks, regardless of the typ e of task being evaluated (Baez et al., 
2023). This means that people with SAD have difficulties in decoding, as well as inferring other 
people’s mental states, leading to probl ems understanding social cues and situations. One 
suggested reason for this is that people with SAD allocate all their attentional resources to 
monitoring their own thoughts and actions, together with detecting potential threats from the 
environment, thus minimizing the chances to accurately predict others’ mental states and behaviors 
(Heimberg et al., 2010; Hezel & McNally, 2014). 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  9 
 
   
 
Our mindreading abilities, in theory of mind approaches such as TT, are based on the 
assumption that we ascribe via inference the mental states of others. One might argue that the 
process is also self -referential. It has been suggested that contemplating one’s own ideas and 
emotions is how one learns to understand others’ minds (Bradford et al., 2015; van der Meer et al., 
2010). Some authors suggested that there are substantial differences between mentalizing about  
oneself and about others, mostly regarding  the accessibility to one’s inner states, such as 
physiological inputs and memories (Damasio, 2010; Varela et al., 2017). Nonetheless, coming up 
with irrefutable evidence proves difficult, given that underlying mechanisms and associated 
regions are deployed in an overlapping manner for both self and other when it comes to ascribing 
mental states via inference (Legrand & Ruby, 2009; Qin & Northoff, 2011; van der Meer et al., 
2010), indicating that these processes may be more alike than initially thought.  
Excessive or limited amounts of self -referential thoughts are likely to be potential factors 
for psychopathologies characterized by problems in mentalizing (Cotter et al., 2018; Kaplan et al., 
2018), one of them being SAD (Alden et al., 2014; Heimberg et a l., 2010; Maresh & Andrews -
Hanna, 2021). In this case, people with SAD are always focused on how they are perceived by the 
audience, constantly monitoring their thoughts and feelings and updating their mental 
representation of the self on the basis of over interpretation of bodily signals (Heimberg et al., 
2010). A relevant example would be a person thinking that her sweating must mean that she will 
be judged negatively. In addition to this, there are also “safety behaviors” (Clark, 2001), such as 
avoiding eye contact, which an anxious individual might engage in so that he could avoid negative 
social evaluation (Wells et al., 1995). This may be the one of the reasons why social or 
environmental cues might not be identified. 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  10 
 
   
 
Another potential reason for the errors in mentalizing could be related to one’s inability to 
inhibit irrelevant perspectives, such as one’s own when trying to infer others’ mental states or 
behaviors (Leslie et al., 2004; Samson et al., 2005). Some studies suggest that in the case of Social 
Anxiety Disorder, individuals engage in the process of over-mindreading, in some sense they add 
more levels of mentation than necessary when dealing with others  (Hezel & McNally, 2014; 
Washburn et al., 2016), meaning that they were reading too much into what others were thinking. 
Over-mentalizing can easily be seen as a form of mental simulation, when the person uses his own 
way of thinking to infer others’ thoughts. An instance of this would be thinking that another person 
is evaluating one’s own appearance or performance in a bad way, even though that person might 
not even have noticed her. This happens because they tend to be mainly focused on the negative 
side of things, judging themselves too harshly, leading to erro neous predictions regarding others’ 
impressions. These predictions are called egocentric inferences (Clark & Wells, 1995; Heimberg 
et al., 2010) and are proven to be overly used in anxiety disorders. Moreover, another study 
suggested that relying too much on the self when reading others’ minds could lead to anxiety 
symptoms (Todd et al., 2015), indicating that simulating one’s own mental state could be a 
potential triggering factor for this disease.  
All things considered, we suggest that people with SAD are more inclined to use simulation 
theory as a means to predict other people’s thoughts and behaviors. This may arise from their 
tendency to engage in interoceptive introspection as well as from the self-confidence they put into 
those predictions. 
 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  11 
 
   
 
Learned uncertainty and interoceptive trait prediction error  
In the beginning of this article, we saw how anxiety can be explained by overweighted 
expectations that the world is unpredictable and that the action policies are not enough to reduce 
the uncertainty. We also saw how such expectations can be created by a model that learned to 
expect an uncertainly irreducible world through the process of learned uncertainty. Now we are 
going to introduce an account for the formation of SAD, based on the principle of learned 
uncertainty and interoceptive trait prediction error.  
As we showed earlier, even though people with SAD engage in a lot of interoceptive 
introspection and believe they possess a high metacognitive awareness of interoceptive accuracy, 
there is a great discrepancy between the subjective measures they give and the objective 
measurements, meaning that they have low prediction accuracy but high self -confidence in their 
predictions. This difference is called an interoceptive trait prediction error (Garfinkel et al., 2016). 
From a predictive processing perspective, t he interoception errors that anxious individuals make 
can be linked to an inability to internally model information. This means that a heightened focus 
on the self can lead to a mismatch between the sensory signals that their bodies give and the brain’s 
predictions regarding those interoceptive states. We argue that this mismatch can have a significant 
impact on social functioning. As we suggested earlier, people with SAD are more likely to use 
simulation theory to predict other people’s internal states. Bu t because they possess a high 
interoceptive trait prediction error, meaning that their predictions about their internal states are 
wrong, the predictions that they make about other people are also going to be affected. These 
overweighted predictions will lead to high prediction errors which the agent cannot explain. 
Consequently, a constant uncertainty concerning the social environment will be created, one which 
will ultimately reinforce a model that expects the world to have irreducible uncertainty and the  
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  12 
 
   
 
agent’s action policies to not be enough to effectively model the environment. In this manner, we 
can see how the interoceptive trait prediction error paired with the process of learned uncertainty 
can lead to the formation of SAD. Although this pairing gi ves an insightful explanation for the 
formation of SAD, it’s important to stress the fact that this is not an exhaustive explanation. Not 
every person that is exposed to uncertainty will develop SAD. There are many factors that might 
affect the formation o f the disorders like the diathesis stress model (Zuckerman, 1999), which 
presupposes that disorders arise through constant feedback between genetic predispositions and 
environmental stressors, or other social factors like family and friend’s support, culture, religion, 
etc. These factors can protect the agent from forming those internalized belfies about the inability 
to predict and act upon the world (McGovern, 2022). 
Having formed a model that expects uncertainty, the agent will start to overweigh 
expectation, leading to hyperactive predictions about the environment and the self. For example, 
a mild sensory signal from one’s heart can be misinterpreted as a panic attack, because of the 
hyperactive predictions that an anxious person constantly uses as a consequence of always 
expecting danger or threatening situations. This results f rom the fact that their brain learned to 
minimize uncertainty by predicting the worst-case scenario. Instead of updating the internal model 
to align with the sensory signals, they amplify the false prediction, and with each instantiation it 
becomes more weighted. This leads to a feedback loop, in which the incorrect predictions generate 
high le vels of anxiety, and these high levels of anxiety in turn intensify the bodily signals. 
Therefore, even though their brain misinterprets the prediction errors, these actions are still meant 
to minimize the discrepancy between sensory input and predictions,  in an erroneous way, albeit 
still adaptive to people’s past experiences. It is important to underline the effect of cognitions and 
beliefs in shaping an internal model of the world defined by high levels of uncertainty.  
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  13 
 
   
 
 
Shortcuts for minimizing uncertainty 
An interesting prediction from applying the predictive processing view in anxiety is that 
the agent may resort to using certain shortcuts or cognitive biases in order to reduce the uncertainty 
from the social environment. Minimizing uncertainty by predicti ng the worst -case scenario can 
explain the maladaptive thoughts and cognitive biases proposed by the cognitive - behavioral 
model. The results from literature suggest that anxious individuals are significantly biased towards 
catastrophizing and expecting da nger in any type of situation (Barlow, 2004; Beck et al., 1985; 
Clark, 1986). This means that their belief system is built with an overemphasis on the negative 
valence of things and experiences. These negative beliefs might arise from the agent’s need to 
reduce the uncertainty by any means possible. Assuming the worst scenario can be then the product 
of the negative affect associated with bad error dynamics, as well as a strategy to reduce the 
uncertainty by predicting the safest outcome through avoidance behavior.  
Another way through which people with SAD might reduce uncertainty is the use of 
stereotypes. The over -usage of stereotypes by people with SAD has been suggested by some 
studies as a mean to reduce the cognitive load or uncertainty of the social situation (Westra, 2019; 
Wilder,1993; Schneider, 2022). Stereotypes can be used as a mean to reduce the cognitive load, 
which is high in people with SAD because of their particular hypervigilance, by offering a way to 
make quick assumptions about social situations. Some empirical studies found some evidence that 
people with SAD might rely more on stereotyping, although more research in this area is still 
needed (Curtis and Locke, 2005, 2007; Demirtaş-Madran, 2020).    
From the perspective of predictive processing, stereotyping can be viewed as a cognitive 
shortcut to reduce uncertainty by relying on quick available information about the social 
SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PREDICTIVE PROCESSING  14 
 
   
 
environment. Because of the universal use of stereotypes, they can be seen as relatively reliable 
predictions about the social environment which can help counteract the uncertainty of the internal 
models.  
 
Conclusion 
All in all, this study proposes that social anxiety disorder could be understood through the lens of 
one of the most important concepts found in computational psychiatry, the free energy principle 
and the predictive processing theory. Zooming in on these ideas, we suggested that high levels of 
interoceptive trait prediction error, which is the difference between low prediction accuracy and 
high self-confidence in one’s predictions, could explain why people with SAD have difficulties in 
understanding others’ minds, since engaging in interoceptive introspection could lead to them 
being more prone to simulating their own mental states. Being so internally focused, yet so 
ineffective might also result in resorting to stereotyping or cognitive biases in order to minimize 
the uncertainty from the world. While there are still many additional factors that could explain this 
disorder, we believe that this framework offers a compelling perspective on why social anxiety 
disorder remains a challenging topic in terms of available treatments.
