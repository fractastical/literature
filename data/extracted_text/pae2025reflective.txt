Reﬂective analysis on empirical

Contemporary theories of consciousness offer a range of explanatory
perspectives. Global Workspace Theory emphasizes cognitive access, Higher-
Order Theories focus on metacognitive representation, Integrated Information
Theory centers on intrinsic experience, and Predictive Coding Theory models
cognitive processes as probabilistic inference. While each theory provides
valuable insights, they often remain in conﬂict due to differing assumptions
about the nature of consciousness. This paper proposes a phenomenologically
informed framework that clariﬁes the explanatory scope of each theory in
relation to key features of lived experience. Rather than seeking to reduce

1 Introduction
What does it mean to be conscious? What constitutes a lived experience, and what
gives us the sense that we exist here and now, as ourselves? These enduring questions
traverse the philosophy of mind, neuroscience, and cognitive science – yet a deﬁnitive
answer remains elusive. This manuscript begins from a concern that current debates
in consciousness studies often talk past each other – not because any single theory
is wholly wrong, but because each targets a diﬀerent explanatory domain under the
umbrellaterm‘consciousness’.Ratherthanchoosingsides,thispaperarguesforapluralist
perspective:onethattreatstheoreticaldivergencenotasconﬂict,butasanopportunityfor

To pursue such integration meaningfully, we must ﬁrst clarify what each theory is
actually trying to explain. Phenomenology, often understood as reﬂective analysis, is
used here as a clarifying method for determining what each theory of consciousness is
reallytryingtoexplain.Incontrasttoconceptualclassiﬁcation,phenomenologicalanalysis
brackets preconceptions to illuminate the structural conditions under which conscious
experience becomes meaningful (Embree, 2011). That being said, this paper does not
suggest that theoretical integration will yield an immediate resolution to all challenges in
consciousness studies. Rather, it aims to move beyond rigid polarization by fostering a
more collaborative and integrative discourse, one in which diverse theories can mutually
informandenrichoneanotherwithinaconceptuallyclariﬁedspace.Eachtheory,initsown
way, captures something essential. The challenge—and the opportunity—is to consider
how these partial insights might be integrated, not through reduction or assimilation, but
throughcarefularticulationoftheirrespectivecontributions.

Whilegroundedinphenomenologicalreﬂection,thisinquiryis
not pursued in isolation from scientiﬁc discourse. Recent decades
have witnessed the emergence of several inﬂuential empirical
theories of consciousness—Global Workspace Theory, Higher-
Order Theory, Integrated Information Theory, and Predictive
Coding Theory—each oﬀering distinct explanatory targets
and methodological commitments. Yet despite their empirical
sophistication, these models often begin with assumptions
that diverge from phenomenological insights. Some emphasize
functional accessibility, others intrinsicality, still others inferential
dynamics. What is often missing, however, is sustained reﬂection
on the structural features of conscious mental phenomena as
such: its intentional orientation, its temporal unfolding, its
embodied situatedness, and its pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance.
A phenomenological methodology, while not a replacement
for scientiﬁc theory, can help clarify what is at stake in such
models by specifying the explanandum with greater precision.
This paper thus aims to place phenomenological reﬂection
in conversation with contemporary scientiﬁc theories, not to
adjudicate between them, but to illuminate the deeper structural
questions they raise, and to map how their insights might be
productivelycombined.
Accordingly, the remainder of this manuscript is structured
as follows: Section 2 provides a philosophical groundwork by
clarifying the methodological tensions between representationalist
assumptions and phenomenological approaches to consciousness.
Section 3 introduces four core structural features of consciousness
derived from reﬂective phenomenological analysis. Section 4
examines four major scientiﬁc theories of consciousness—Global
Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Theory, Integrated Information
Theory, and Predictive Coding Theory—and assesses their
correspondence with the phenomenological features discussed in
Section 3. Section 5 presents a uniﬁed framework that maps each
theory onto diﬀerent dimensions of conscious experience and
exploreshowthesetheoriesmightbeintegratedratherthantreated
as competitors. Finally, Section 6 oﬀers concluding reﬂections
on the philosophical role of phenomenology in grounding
interdisciplinarytheoriesofconsciousness.
Throughout this paper, several terms such as intentionality,
qualia, awareness, attention, and self-awareness are used in their
phenomenological sense. Intentionality refers to the structural
directedness of consciousness toward an object or meaning,
not merely to representational content. Attention refers to the
selective modulation or ampliﬁcation of particular aspects within
experience, which determines what becomes prominent, but is
not a prerequisite for intentionality. Qualia denotes the pre-
reﬂective “what-it-is-likeness” of experience, rather than atomistic
orintrinsicmentalfeatures. Awareness isusedasageneraltermthat
encompassesbothself-awarenessandworld-awareness,thatis,our
awareness of objects, situations, and ourselves. Within the former
category,akeydistinctionismadebetween reﬂective self-awareness
and pre-reﬂective self-awareness. Reﬂective self-awareness involves
a thematic or introspective recognition of oneself as a subject,
whilepre-reﬂectiveself-awarenessreferstotheminimal,tacitsense
of mine-ness that accompanies all experience. These distinctions
are crucial for avoiding conceptual conﬂations and follow the
phenomenologicaltraditionratherthananalyticusage.
Also, while this paper draws on conceptual features from
Husserlian phenomenology—such as intentional matter and
quality, or pre-reﬂective self-consciousness—note that it does
not adhere rigidly to the full transcendental framework of early
phenomenology. Instead, these concepts are used heuristically as
structural tools for analyzing conscious experience. In particular,
they are re-situated within a broader framework that integrates
phenomenological reﬂection with embodied and enactive
approaches. The aim is not to oﬀer a doctrinal reading of classical
phenomenology, but to adapt its insights for interdisciplinary
engagement. The terminology and distinctions developed here
are shaped to minimize conceptual ambiguity and to support
theoreticalintegrationacrossphilosophicalandscientiﬁcdomains.
2 Investigating the science of
consciousness through
phenomenology
2.1 Historical background and the
epistemological divide
A principal tenet of phenomenological inquiry is that the
structure of phenomena, as they appear to one, is essentially the
same as the structure of phenomena as they appear to another.
This statement may seem ordinary at ﬁrst glance, but it stands in
contrast to what is often taken as the dominant approach within
analyticphilosophywhichconceivesofmentalcontentasmediated
through representational structures. On this representationalist
view, cognition involves internal representations that stand in
for external states of aﬀairs, with mental states typically treated
as distinct from the world they represent.
1 This epistemological
stance nonetheless diverges signiﬁcantly from phenomenological
thinking, which denies that consciousness consists in the internal
mirroring of an external world and instead treats the world as
disclosed within lived experience. Modern cognitive science and
psychology, largely rooted in this dominant representationalist
tradition, are shaped by a model of animal-environment dualism
in which the mind is internal and the world is external. It is
thus unsurprising that the naturalistic approach to consciousness
tends to adopt a third-person point of view. The familiar
formulations of the Mind–Body Problem, the so-called Hard
Problem,andtheexplanatorygapallinheritthisframework,which
presupposes a division between mental experience and physical
1 It should be noted that analytic philosophy is not monolithic in its
treatment of perception. Although representationalism has been widely
discussed within the analytic tradition, as exempliﬁed by Tye (1995) and
Byrne (2001), it has been challenged by alternative theories, such as the
naïve realism developed byMartin (2002) and the relationalism proposed
by Brewer (2011), both of which hold that perception puts us in direct
contact with the world. Even among representationalists, the idea that
perception is “indirect” in the Cartesian sense is often explicitly rejected;
see, for instance,Dretske (1995)and Tye (2000). Despite internal differences,
representationalist theories generally share the assumption that perceptual
experience is mediated by representational content.

reality. Consciousness, especially in its ﬁrst-person and subjective
dimensions, resists full objectiﬁcation within this paradigm, and it
is precisely this resistance that gives rise to the enduring diﬃculty
oftheexplanatorygapandthepersistenceoftheHardProblem.
2
However, we must not be misled by this inherited dichotomy.
To sharply distinguish the so-called Hard Problem from the
Easy Problems reﬂects an underlying assumption that selected
functional or cognitive aspects of consciousness suﬃce to
explain the whole. While reductionist frameworks often present
themselves as oﬀering eﬃcient solutions to complex problems,
such explanatory eﬃciency may come at the cost of ﬁdelity to the
phenomenon itself. If the proposed explanatory link misrepresents
the explanandum, or if the explanandum is itself inherently
irreducible, then the explanation fails in principle. Moreover,
classifying consciousness into categories such as Phenomenal
consciousness or Access consciousness, as suggested by Block
(1995), risks oversimplifying the mental processes and leaving
their intrinsic structure unaccounted for. This assumption is
not incidental, but deeply rooted in the history of cognitive
science itself. Early theorists such asFodor (1975) and Gardner
(2011) conceptualized the mind as a computational system that
processesinternalsymbolicrepresentationsinresponsetoexternal
stimuli, thereby entrenching a dualistic framework that separates
the internal subject from the external world. On this view,
consciousnessbecomesepistemicallyindirect,reducibletodiscrete
internalstatesgovernedbysyntacticoperations.
In response to this legacy, phenomenologists and advocates
of embodied cognition have argued that such reductionist views
fail not only by leaving out key experiential aspects, but more
fundamentally by misconstruing the ontological relation between
consciousness and world.Varela et al. (1991), for instance, argue
that experience is not a representational mirroring of a world
externaltothesubject,butasituatedenactment. Thompson(2007)
extendsthisviewbyshowingthatconsciousnessisinseparablefrom
the biological and experiential conditions of the organism.Zahavi
(2005) similarly emphasizes that consciousness is not an internal
mirror of an external world, but the condition under which the
world is disclosed as meaningful. On this view, the world is not
encountered as a domain external to the subject and waiting to
be represented, but is instead disclosed within the subject’s lived,
situatedengagement.Hence,consciousnessisnottobeunderstood

2 Denying the Hard Problem is essentially equivalent to denying the
existence or the irreducibility of Phenomenal consciousness, as argued by
Chalmers (1995). Strong reductionists and eliminativists, such asChurchland
(1983) and Dennett (1991), attempt to sidestep the issue by rejecting the
ontological reality of qualia, thereby rendering the Hard Problem moot by
deﬁnition.
3 It is helpful to distinguish between two strands within the
phenomenological tradition that have challenged representationalism.
Theﬁrst,rootedinHusserl’stranscendentalidealism,treatsconsciousnessas

within the enactive and embodied approaches to cognition, criticizes
representational metaphors by emphasizing the dynamic, sensorimotor
coupling between organism and world. This paper is more aligned with the
2.2 The misconception of introspection
Phenomenology is often mistakenly equated with
introspection, yet the two diﬀer in signiﬁcant ways. Introspection
typically assumes a division between inner mental content and
the external world, examining internal states from a quasi-
observationalstance.Phenomenology,bycontrast,seekstobracket
such preconceptions and to illuminate how consciousness and
world co-constitute one another through lived experience. In fact,
classical phenomenologists such as Merleau-Ponty and Gurwitsch
have emphasized that phenomenology is not merely a descriptive
report of inner life, but a systematic method for disclosing the
structural conditions of meaning and appearance (Merleau-Ponty,
2013,p.201–216; Gurwitsch,2010,p.89–106).
That said, the line between phenomenological reﬂection
and introspection is not always rigid. Some phenomenologists
acknowledge similarities in ﬁrst-person focus or experiential
orientation,evenwhileinsistingonkeymethodologicaldiﬀerences.
However, whereas introspection may treat inner states as objects
of observation, phenomenology discloses the structures by which
experience itself is constituted. The emphasis is not on cataloging
mental contents, but on uncovering the intentional and contextual
conditions through which meaning becomes available. Thus,
while phenomenology and introspection may share a concern
with ﬁrst-person experience, they are distinguished by their aims
and philosophical commitments. Phenomenology does not claim
epistemic immediacy, but instead calls for a methodologically
disciplined suspension of naturalistic assumptions. Its aim is to
clarify the very conditions under which phenomena are given, not
merely to describe their occurrence. This distinction, while subtle,
iscentraltothephenomenologicalmethod.

latter tradition, which seeks compatibility with empirical research without
abandoning phenomenology’s insights. At the same time, I would argue
that the distinction betweenap r i o r iuniversality and embodied situatedness
in phenomenology need not be taken as a contradiction, at least within
the framework of this paper. What this paper seeks to emphasize is that
the essential structures of consciousness are always realized through
historically and bodily situated acts of experience. This layered view
preserves both transcendental and embodied-enactive insights within the
phenomenological tradition.
4 This sharply contrasts with third-person methodologies that seek to
bypass or even eliminate the ﬁrst-person perspective altogether, such
as heterophenomenology. Heterophenomenology, proposed by Dennett,
represents a methodological stance that stands in direct contrast to
phenomenology.Itadvocatesforathird-personapproachtoconsciousness,
arguing that subjective reports should be treated as behavioral data without
committing to the existence of actual phenomenal states (Dennett, 1991,
p. 76–77; Dennett, 2018). Dennett maintains that in order to remain
scientiﬁcally neutral, researchers must abandon the ﬁrst-person perspective
in favor of what subjects say and do. This stands in opposition to
phenomenology, which brackets naturalistic assumptions to uncover the
structureoflivedexperience.Whileheterophenomenologyclaimsobjectivity
through the exclusion of subjectivity, phenomenologists have critiqued this
as a naïve stance. Since all scientiﬁc inquiry presupposes a conscious agent
engaging in experience, the complete elimination of the ﬁrst-person is
neither feasible nor conceptually coherent(Jack and Roepstorff, 2002).

2.3 On intentionality
Phenomenology identiﬁes intentionality as one of the most
universal and crucial characteristics of consciousness. More
precisely, phenomenology most clearly distinguishes itself from
analytic philosophy in its treatment of intentionality. Brentano,
who ﬁrst introduced the term into phenomenology, deﬁned
intentionality as the most decisive feature that distinguishes
conscious mental processes from non-conscious processes
(Brentano, 2014, p. 68–69).
5 Acknowledging the existence of

unique speciﬁcity. A common misconception is that phenomenal
and qualitative aspects of mental processes are non-intentional
becausetheyarenotactsofdirectedrepresentation.Thisconstrual
risks reducing intentionality to a mechanism for reportable or
functionally accessible mental content, that is, to something akin
towhatisoftencalledAccessconsciousness.
However, in phenomenology, intentionality encompasses not
just the object of experience but the particular mode in which
the world is disclosed. Conscious experience is not merely
directed at an object; it is a speciﬁc way in which a subject
encounters the world, making phenomenality about something
(world-representing) and about someone (self-involving) (Sartre,
2021, p. 3–5). The world is not only manifested to the subject
but also disclosed as meaningful through the subject’s embodied
and contextual stance toward it. This is not merely a diﬀerence
in representational content or mode, as often acknowledged
in analytic theories, but a deeper structural distinction: in
phenomenology,intentionalityisthemodeofdisclosureitself–not
a relation to an object, but the condition under which something
canappearasmeaningfulintheﬁrstplace.
6
Most importantly, according to Husserl, the intentional object
(intentional matter) and the act of consciousness (intentional
5 Although Brentano’s deﬁnition of intentionality remains foundational,
it has also been taken up and developed in divergent ways within the
phenomenological tradition. While Brentano emphasized intentionality as
the mental directedness toward an object, later phenomenologists have
challenged and expanded this interpretation.Gurwitsch (1979, p. 33) and
Merleau-Ponty(2013,p.338,358)emphasizetheﬁeld-structuredandbodily-
situated nature of intentionality, whereas Zahavi (2005) and Drummond
(1990,p.108-109,113)stressitspre-reﬂective,structuralmodeofdisclosure.
Despite these differences, what unites these views is the understanding
of intentionality not as a static relation between a subject and an object,
but as the dynamic condition through which the world is experientially
disclosed. This paper follows that broader orientation, treating intentionality
asthestructuralmodeofappearingratherthanasmereobject-directedness.
This differs from analytic accounts that focus on propositional content or
functional role; phenomenological intentionality is not about informational
access to an object, but about the horizon-structured unfolding of meaning
as disclosed through embodied subjectivity.
6 Consequently, experiences such as affection and mood, which at ﬁrst
glance may seem non-intentional, can still be understood as intentional
insofar as they express a mode of being situated in the world (Heidegger,
1996, p. 129;Sartre, 2021, p.450–452;Merleau-Ponty, 2013, p. 82).
quality) are not two separable entities but are essentially co-
constitutive (Husserl, 2001, Vol. I, p. 193–194; Vol. II, p.119–
120). This implies that a purely third-person perspective on
consciousness, one that excludes its lived, ﬁrst-person givenness,
cannot be regarded as ontologically neutral. Rather, it must be
understood as already shaped by a speciﬁc intentional stance. In
this light, the idea of complete objectivity does not refer to an
absolute or independent fact, but to an idealization that emerges
withinaparticularframeworkofepistemiccommitments.
2.4 Embodiment and the mind-world
relation
The perspective that treats mind and world not as separable
entities but as dynamically intertwined naturally extends to the
relationship between mind and body. While Husserl (1989, p.
57) laid the groundwork for phenomenological reﬂection on the
body through concepts such as the lived body (Leib), the full
articulation of embodiment as constitutive of cognition emerges
more forcefully in the work of Merleau-Ponty and later enactive
accounts of mind (Merleau-Ponty, 2013, p. 76, 350–351;Varela
et al., 1991; Clark, 1997; Thompson, 2007). The world is disclosed
to us through bodily experience, such that reﬂection on how the
world is experienced becomes unintelligible in the absence of
physical self-awareness. This orientation permits an evolutionary
interpretation of consciousness, not as an accidental byproduct,
but as something shaped by environmental adaptability and the
biologicalviabilityofembodiedforms( Varelaetal.,1991 ).
However, this should not be misunderstood as a naturalization
of the mind in the manner of biological reductionism. The aim
is not to explain consciousness merely as a functional product
articulated in the vocabulary of neuroscience. Rather, the very fact
that the mind is embodied explains the interdependency of mind
and world. Through our lived body, we encounter the world as
embodied subjects. For this reason, phenomenology calls for a
clear distinction between thelived body (Leib) and the objective
body (Körper), and insists that only the former captures what is
essential in consciousness. Here, the objective body is the body
as observed from a third-person perspective, as a physical object
among others. The lived body, by contrast, is the body as it is
experienced from within, as the medium through which the world
is disclosed and acted upon (Merleau-Ponty, 2013, p. 329–330).
This conceptual distinction highlights phenomenology’s resistance
to biological reductionism, treating embodiment not as a physical
substrate but as the existential basis of lived experience. Hence,
phenomenologydoesnotequatethemind-worldrelationwiththat
of mind and brain. To do so would be to adopt the naturalistic
paradigm that phenomenology explicitly aims to critique. Just as it

challengestheframingoftheso-calledHardProblem.
To summarize, phenomenology understands the mind not as
something set apart from the world, but as a mode of being in and
toward the world. Its central eﬀort lies in clarifying this relation
through the concept of intentionality. In exploring consciousness,
phenomenology treats the oppositions between subjectivity and
objectivity, ﬁrst-person and third-person perspectives, and mind

andbodynotasabsolutedichotomies,butasprovisionalconstructs
that conceal the continuity of experience. Such dualisms are
themselves intentional attitudes that have not been bracketed,
which obscure the essence of consciousness by placing conceptual
ﬁlters over its givenness. Phenomenology, as a mode ofreﬂective
analysis, aims to restore this givenness. In seeking to make
consciousness amenable to scientiﬁc inquiry, it insists that the
explanandum must be preserved in its integrity. By engaging in
rigorous reﬂective analysis, phenomenology oﬀers a method for
keeping consciousness as it appears, and for understanding its
structurefromwithin.
3 Properties of consciousness
discovered by reﬂective analysis
Before proceeding, it is imperative to clarify a methodological
point: the characteristics of consciousness must not be predeﬁned
in advance. Phenomenologically speaking, what holds ultimate
authority is the phenomenon as it appears to the subject.
Paradoxically, even well-intentioned eﬀorts to clarify the structure
of consciousness through theoretical categorizations often risk
obscuringwhattheyseektoilluminate.CategoriessuchasCreature
consciousness, State consciousness, Phenomenal consciousness,
and Access consciousness may be heuristically useful, but they are
notphenomenologicallyprimary.Fromthestandpointofreﬂective
analysis, it is precisely such assumptions that must be bracketed at
theoutset.
Accordingly, the features introduced in this section are
not intended to serve as necessary or suﬃcient conditions for
consciousness. To pursue such deﬁnitional aims would not only
violate the spirit of phenomenological inquiry but would also
diverge from the purpose of this paper. The aim here is more
modest and exploratory: to outline several structural features that
typically accompany conscious experience, and to consider how
these may be disclosed through eidetic variation and reﬂection.
These features are oﬀered not as rigid criteria, but as provisional
signposts, or conceptual tools, to aid inquiry into what makes
consciousness the phenomenon that it is. At the same time,
consciousness must be approached as a totality within which these
features are always already intertwined. The analytical distinctions
that follow serve only a heuristic function. They are not meant to
suggest that consciousness can be decomposed into isolated parts
ordividedintomutuallyexclusivedomains.
While some may perceive a tension between describing
consciousnessinessentialanduniversaltermsontheonehand,and
emphasizing its contextual, embodied, or evolutionary dimensions
ontheother,thispaperdoesnotregardthisasacontradiction.The
essential features of consciousness are not abstracted from lived
reality but are always instantiated through concrete experience.
They are repeatable structures that manifest within variation, not
in spite of it. Merleau-Ponty suggests that what appears as a
priori is not imposed externally or abstracted from experience, but
arisesimmanentlythroughthestructureoflivedeventsthemselves
(Merleau-Ponty, 2013,p.xii–xiii). Inthissense,phenomenological
generality is not pre-given in a rigid form but unfolds within
the variability of concrete experience. It is through this layered
understanding, where generality and particularity are seen as
mutuallyinforming,thatthefollowinganalysisproceeds.
3.1 Pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance
The primary givenness of self-acquaintance is widely
recognizedinphenomenologicaldiscourseasaconstitutivefeature
of consciousness. Heidegger holds that in every encounter with
the world, being-in-the-world (Dasein) is not merely present but
disclosed as essentiallymine (Jemeinigkeit), such that selfhood is
not derived from reﬂection but is always already a constitutive
structure of being-in-the-world (Heidegger, 1996, p. 114–117).
Sartre articulates this insight most directly, arguing that pre-
reﬂective self-consciousness is not an additional act but the very
mode of being of consciousness itself: “We should not regard
this consciousness (of) self as a new [act of] consciousness
but as the only possible mode of existence which is possible
for a consciousness of something” (Sartre, 2021, p. 13).
7 Self-
acquaintance is therefore not an auxiliary property but a
fundamental condition that makes intentionality itself possible.
Consciousness is not constituted by an act of self-reference; rather,
self-referentiality is intrinsic to what it means for something to
beconscious.
Note that this paper does not assume that all conscious acts
must be directed toward an object in the narrow Brentanian
sense. In particular, pre-reﬂective self-awareness—the immediate
awareness we have of ourselves as experiencing—is not structured
as an act that presents an object. Yet this does not place it
outside the structure of consciousness. Rather, it functions as a
foundational condition for intentionality itself. It does not possess
intentionality in the standard object-directed sense, but provides
the existential ground from which all intentional orientation
becomes possible. In this respect, consciousness can be said to
presuppose a minimal self-recognition that is not directed but is
neverthelessconstitutiveofalldirectedness.
This pre-reﬂective self-awareness underlies the privacy
of conscious experience, marking ﬁrst-person subjectivity as
phenomenologically distinct from any third-personal stance. Since
every conscious experience is intrinsically “mine,” the subject
cannot stand apart from their own consciousness as though it
were an external object. This makes it impossible, in principle, to
experience another’s consciousness as one’s own, reinforcing the
ideathatconsciousexperienceisirreduciblyﬁrst-personal.Without
this self-acquaintance, no mental state could be experienced as
present, rendering it phenomenologically non-conscious (Kriegel,
2009).
8 From this perspective, the ineﬀable and irreducible

87), who argues that both Heidegger’s notion ofDasein and Sartre’s account

as a structural feature of experience.
8 However, some theories of consciousness, particularly Higher-Order
approaches, challenge the idea that self-consciousness is necessary for
phenomenality. Higher-Order theories are grounded in the transitivity
principle, according to which a mental state is conscious only if it is
represented by a higher-order state. Phenomenology, by contrast, begins

Objections may arise from altered states of consciousness,
such as hallucinations or near-death experiences, which appear
to disrupt the coherence of self-awareness. Yet these cases do
not negate the structure of self-acquaintance but rather reveal its
ﬂexibility under novel conditions of experience. Sartre’s account of
implicitself-awarenesssuggeststhateveninradicallyalteredstates,

structure of mineness remains operative. These accounts converge
ontheideathatself-awarenessisnotasecondaryachievement,but
a structural feature of consciousness that remains even when the
coherenceofexperienceiscompromised.Hence,suchalteredstates
or pathological cases may instead be understood as breakdowns
in the horizonality of experience, that is, interruptions in the
habitual synthesis between self and world, not eliminations of the
ﬁrst-personalstructureitself.
In summary, our experience consistently exhibits a basic
form of self-givenness, even in moments where the sense of self
appears diminished or unstable. Whether articulated in terms
of Heidegger’s notion of mineness (Jemeinigkeit), Sartre and
Zahavi’s pre-reﬂective self-awareness, or Merleau-Ponty’s bodily
intentionality, the conclusion remains consistent: consciousness is
always, in some manner, given to itself. Any systematic account of
consciousness must therefore begin not with a constructed ego or
reﬂectiveself-concept,butwiththeimmediateandnon-thematized
self-acquaintancethatimplicitlygroundsallconsciousexperience.
3.2 Contextualized, environmentally
situated
Phenomenological inquiry has long regarded intentionality
as the structural core of consciousness, based on the idea that
consciousness is always directed toward something. Although this
claim serves as a foundational principle, it has been developed
in varying ways across diﬀerent strands of the tradition. In
classical phenomenology, particularly in Husserl’s transcendental
framework, intentionality is understood as a correlation between

sensitive lens. This section adopts that latter view, focusing on
intentionality not as a ﬁxed relation but as a mode of orientation

Consciousness is never encountered in isolation. Every act
of perception, cognition, or aﬀect arises against a background
shaped by bodily presence, environmental aﬀordances, and
socio-cultural patterns. Even direct perception is not a mere
reaction to stimuli, but a gestalt-like integration within a
meaningful whole (Merleau-Ponty, 1963, p. 129–136). On this
basis, phenomenologists likeGallagher and Zahavi(2007,p .9 4 –
104) argue that sensations are not the building blocks of
perception but theoretical abstractions imposed on already
structured experience. Classical illusions such as the Müller-Lyer
lines and Ebbinghaus illusion illustrate that perception depends
less on input than on contextual conﬁguration. As Noë observes,
“Phenomenology presents experience as something that could not
occurintheabsenceofsituationsandthings”( Noë,2007,p.235).
Importantly, it is intentionality that underlies and enables the
contextual nature of conscious experience. Consciousness is not
merely inﬂuenced by context; rather, it is structurally predisposed
to be contextual because it is always directed toward the world.
This directedness is not neutral or passive – it involves taking up a
perspective.Tointendsomethingistoapproachitfromaparticular
perspective, shaped by one’s personal history and environmental
situation.Thisaccountofintentionalityavoidsareductiveornaïve
interpretation that treats it as mere object-directedness. Instead,
following Husserl’s notion of horizon-intentionality and Merleau-
Ponty’s embodied “intentional arc,” we understand intentionality
as the very structure through which context is constituted, not
simply received (Husserl, 1973, Part II;Merleau-Ponty, 2013, Part
I, Chapter 3). For instance, a reader approaching the same text
either with sympathetic resonance or with skepticism will undergo
amarkedlydiﬀerentexperience,notbecausethecontentofthetext
has changed, but because consciousness engages the text from a
situated perspective. To borrow a concept from Husserl, it may be
said that the intentional quality of consciousness accounts for this
kind of contextualization (Husserl, 2001, Vol. II, p. 119–120). In
this sense, intentionality is what binds experience to context and
allowsmeaningtoemergefromlivedengagementratherthanfrom
passivereception.
Consciousness should thus be understood as a dynamically
unfolding process, shaped by past experience, bodily orientation,
aﬀective stance, and social context. Hence, subjectivity is not
enclosed but formed through ongoing relation to the world and
to others. Intersubjectivity plays a particularly important role
here, as other humans are not encountered as objects but as
subjects who perceive and interpret as we do. Sartre calls this
the “decentralization” of my world (Sartre, 2021, p. 307–331),
9 Husserlian transcendental phenomenology typically analyzes
intentionality in terms of noetic–noematic correlation, structured by
transcendental bracketing. Post-Husserlian and embodied approaches, on
the other hand, do not reject this correlation but reinterpret it as a situated
and affectively attuned mode of engagement. In this view, intentionality is
notdeﬁnedprimarilybyobject-referencebutbyasubject’sbodily,temporal,
and intersubjective positioning within a meaningful world.

through which the recognition of others’ perspectives transforms
andreconﬁguresmyown.Inthisway,subjectivityisneverentirely
self-contained but is always situated among other subjectivities.
Moreover, the ability of human beings to function as empathetic
social beings may be seen as rooted in the fundamentally
contextualized nature of consciousness itself.Scheler (2008), for
instance, understands empathy as a direct, aﬀectively informed
intuition of recognition of the other, not one grounded in analogy
or inferential reasoning. Similarly, Stein (1964) maintains that
empathy is not a projection or imaginative act, but a mode of
intentionality through which the other is disclosed as a subject
ofexperience.
Onthisbasis,consciousnesscannotbeunderstoodassolipsistic
or egocentric. A conscious individual is not a self-enclosed mind
but a being situated with others in a shared world. The horizon
within which experience unfolds is already intersubjective; ﬁrst-
person experience itself implicitly acknowledges the presence of
other perspectives. Through this interpretation, the irreducibility
and richness of lived experience are preserved without being
fragmentedintodecontextualizedelements.
3.3 Spatio-temporal expandability
Havingestablishedthecontextualandenvironmentallysituated
nature of consciousness, I now turn to two phenomenologically
signiﬁcant dimensions that arise from this orientation. This
section explores two frequently overlooked aspects of conscious
experience—spatiality and temporality—both of which reveal the
intrinsicopennessanddynamicstructureofconsciousness.
Let us begin with spatiality. Our experience of the world
is always mediated through the body, which is not merely
perceived as an external object but is felt as an integral part of
the self. This bodily embeddedness is coupled with a form of
self-acquaintance that does not require reﬂective observation. In
ordinary, non-pathological conditions, we do not perceive our
bodies as belonging to someone else or as neutral objects in the
world. Rather, we live through them as integral parts of ourselves.
Fromaphenomenologicalstandpoint,perceptionisnotthepassive
registration of sensory data. It is an active engagement that
includesbodilymovementandorientationtowardtheenvironment
(Gibson, 2014, Merleau-Ponty, 2013, Part I;Noë, 2004). Husserl
emphasized that kinesthetic movement and sensory access are not
two separate functions but aspects of a uniﬁed structure. In his
view, action and perception co-constitute the experience of the
world (Husserl, 1989, Section II, Chapter 3). This means that
even in simple perception, such as seeing a red apple, we do not
perceive it as a ﬂat visual surface. Rather, we grasp its spatiality
by anticipating its hidden sides, its volume, and its aﬀordances.
The back of the apple, though not visible, is still present in
our perceptual grasp. This inference of spatial extension arises
because perception is always embodied. Our movements, whether
byturningtheobjectorbyshiftingourviewpoint,revealthatweare
situatedagents.Throughthisbodilyembeddedness,ourexperience
expands across spatial horizons. AsNoë(2004, p. 1) puts it, “What
we perceive is determined by what we do or what we know how
to do. It is determined by what we are ready to do. In ways I
try to make precise, we enact our perceptual experience; we act
it out.” Perception, then, is not merely visual appearance, but an
active exploration made possible by the body’s capacity to move,
anticipate,andengagewiththeworld.
This spatial openness also plays a role in how we experience
others. When I recognize another person within the same physical
space, I do not merely register a body. I encounter an agent,
someone whose actions express an intentional perspective. To
understand another person is to engage in a form of empathetic
exploration, which is not unlike exploring the hidden side of an
object. It involves socio-interactive probing, a kind of exploratory
engagement that reveals the other’s subjectivity. Merleau-Ponty
and Sartre point out that our experience of others is structured
by spatial interrelation and bodily responsiveness (Merleau-Ponty,
2013, Part II, Chapter 4;Sartre, 2021, Part III, Chapter 1). From
this perspective, the social interaction involved in understanding
anothermindcanitselfbeconceivedasaformofspatialextension.
Let us now turn to temporality. Consciousness is not frozen in
isolated moments. It unfolds across time and carries within it both
memory and anticipation. Despite the discrete nature of neuronal
ﬁring, our conscious experience is surprisingly continuous. For
example,theactofreadingthistextlikelywouldnotfeelsegmented
or choppy – instead, it is continuous. Moreover, our sense of
time is context-dependent. Our metaphorical language reﬂects
this embedded temporality: time seems to slow down during
hardship and to ﬂy by in moments of joy. These expressions,
though ﬁgurative, highlight that our experience of time is shaped
by context, mood, and bodily state. Consciousness is temporally
structured not by clock time but by lived signiﬁcance. Husserl’s
analysis of time-consciousness highlights how each experience of
the present is constituted by a primal impression, which is always
accompaniedbyaretentionoftheimmediatepastandaprotention
of what is about to come ( Husserl, 1991, p. 28–35). These
structures—retention, primal impression, and protention—are not
discrete acts but interwoven aspects of every conscious moment.
Retention is not the same as remembering, and protention is not
simply predicting. Rather, they are intrinsic features of temporal
givenness. Just as our spatial ﬁeld includes what is not currently
seen but remains anticipated, our temporal ﬁeld includes what is
notyetpresentbutstillfeltasimminentlyunfolding.
10
Taken together, these insights suggest that consciousness is
expansive across both spatial and temporal dimensions. However,
this expansiveness is not limited to physical or chronological
domains. Higher capacities such as abstract thought, imagination,
and logical reasoning may be understood as further expansions
of intentionality. After all, even applying phenomenological
methodology to one’s experience is utilizing such expandability.
These acts do not occur outside space and time, but they depend
10 Note that primal impression, retention, and protention are not
merely psychological constructs but constitutive structures of temporal
consciousness. According to this account, recollection is not a simple
retrievalofpastevents,butare-enactmentwithinatemporalhorizonalready
structured by retention and protention. The same applies to anticipation,
which draws upon this dynamic temporalsynthesis. These deeper structures
form the ground from which higher-order temporal acts like memory and
prediction emerge (Husserl, 1991, p. 41, 83, 118).

upon the very expandability that bodily and temporal orientation
makepossible.Everyactofconsciousness,whetherdirectedtoward

within a meaningful horizon. In this light, consciousness is not a
mere assemblage of discrete factors but a uniﬁed experiential ﬁeld.

3.4 Selective attention focus toward
intended matter as an agent
Let us now consider the capacity for selective attention as an
essentialdimensionofconsciousagency.Itmayappearself-evident
that consciousness of a particular intentional content requires
attention to be directed toward that content. Yet, as discussed in
Section 2, not all forms of consciousness involve explicit object-
directedness.
11 For instance, when reaching to grasp a mug, one
wouldrarelybeconsciouslyattendingtoeachmuscularcontraction
of the ﬁngers or to the proprioceptive adjustments that guide
the ﬁngers. Even when our attention is engaged elsewhere, we
can perform such bodily actions with relative ease. Similarly,
when walking or driving while speaking to someone, our bodily
movements are carried out ﬂuently, without requiring focused
cognitive eﬀort. The more familiar an action becomes, the less
attentionaldemanditimposes,andthemorethebodyitselfrecedes
into transparency within our experience (Merleau-Ponty, 1963,
Part II;Sartre, 2021, Part IV).
12 Nonetheless, even in such cases,
we retain an immediate awareness that it is ourselves who are
performing certain actions – grasping the mug, walking through
the space, or steering the car. This sense of agency is not derived
through observation or inference but is directly given in the pre-
reﬂectiveself-acquaintancethataccompaniesintentionalaction.
What, then, distinguishes mere movement from action? What
renders a conscious subject anagent, rather than a passive locus
of bodily motion? Consider the simple case of being displaced
from point A to point B. There is a phenomenological distinction
between walking from A to B with the purpose of arriving there
and being pushed from A to B by an external force. Though
the bodily displacement is the same, the experience of agency
diﬀers entirely. This distinction, foundational in the philosophy of
actionsinceAnscombe’sanalysisofintentionalactionaspurposive
11 While this section emphasizes selective attentional focus as a modality
of agentive orientation, it remains important to clarify the relationship
between attention and consciousness, especially given that attention
selection is considered a key feature of subjectivity. Building on the idea
that both attention and consciousness exist in multiple forms,Marchetti
(2012) argues that non-focal or distributed attention may be constitutive of
conscious experience, thereby challenging the view that the two are entirely
separable.
12 However, it should not be assumed that bodily actions regulated below
the threshold of focal awareness are thereby non-intentional. Even when
attentionisnotexplicitlydirectedtothem,suchmovementsretainintentional
structure insofar as they are non-reﬂexive and organized in accordance with
practical goals (Merleau-Ponty, 2013, p. 144;Henry, 1975, p. 92).
movement (Anscombe, 1957), has also been explored from a
phenomenological perspective by Gallagher and Zahavi. They
approach agency not only in terms of intention but through
the subject’s ﬁrst-person experience of initiating and controlling
bodily movement. In their account, action is enacted through
the lived body and structured by pre-reﬂective awareness, rather
than deﬁned merely by causal antecedents or external observation
(GallagherandZahavi,2007 ,p.158–169).
One important insight is that action can be governed by the
subject’s own intention. In such cases, the content toward which
intentionality is directed can often be selected or maintained
by the subject. When a conscious state includes a sense of
agency, the orientation of attention may align with the subject’s
guiding purpose. If we understand attention as a mode of directed
action, then focusing attention on a particular object becomes
itself a meaningful exercise of agency. Consider, for example, the
experience of being interrupted by a sudden loud noise while
reading. Phenomenologically, such a disruption resembles being
physically pushed oﬀ one’s intended course. This suggests that
attentional focus is not ﬁxed but may be disturbed, redirected,
or actively restored. Attentional direction thus reveals itself as a
structuredanddynamicact.
Moreover, attention can function at multiple levels. At one
level, it operates as a perceptual focus directed toward a given
object. At another, it may take the form of awareness of one’s own
attentional state, often referred to as metacognitive awareness. In
this latter case, the subject does not merely attend, but also reﬂects
on the act of attending. From this perspective, metacognitive
awareness may be interpreted as a higher-order act of attention
that makes one’s own orientation a possible object of scrutiny.
The capacity to shift, regulate, and reorient such attentional
structures according to one’s ongoing aims or context constitutes
an important form of agentive involvement. Thus, to be capable of
directing the focus of attention purposefully is, in eﬀect, to possess
theabilitytodeterminethestructureofone’sattention.
Nevertheless, phenomenology does not maintain that
attentional focus is a necessary condition of all conscious
states. The aim here is not to suggest that attention must be
present for consciousness to occur, but rather to clarify that
attention, when present, can be seen as an intentional act in
its own right, or as an extension of agency. Not all forms of
consciousness are intentional in the narrow sense. For instance,
pre-reﬂective self-consciousness, as discussed earlier, is not
object-directed, yet it is undeniably a constitutive feature
ofexperience.
Even if attention is not an intrinsic property of all
consciousness, it remains something that is actively guided
by the subject. Insofar as it is purposive and directed, it
carries intentional structure and may be understood as part
of consciousness. When selective attention is grounded in a
sense of agency, it becomes continuous with other forms of
intentional action. As Sartre argues, consciousness manifests
both in pre-reﬂective and reﬂective forms, with reﬂective
consciousness always presupposing a more basic, pre-reﬂective
awareness ( Sartre, 2021 , p. 153–155 ). Therefore, when a
subject intentionally focuses attention on an object, that act
not only discloses the object but also aﬃrms the underlying

structure of self-awareness through which such direction
becomespossible.
4 Empirical theories of consciousness
and its critiques
In this section, I examine how several inﬂuential scientiﬁc
theories of consciousness attempt to account for the properties
discussed in the preceding section. The four primary theories
under consideration, as outlined by Seth and Bayne (2022) ,
are: (1) Global Workspace Theory (GWT), (2) Higher-Order
Thought Theory (HOT), (3) Integrated Information Theory
(IIT), and (4) Predictive Coding Theory (PCT). While these
approaches diﬀer in their theoretical aims and explanatory
scope, they generally prioritize either conscious accessibility
(Access consciousness) or qualitative subjectivity (Phenomenal
consciousness). Though this contrast is commonly invoked, it is
not always clearly deﬁned, and the distinction itself is contested
within both analytic and phenomenological traditions. What
unites these theories, however, is a tendency to explain one
facet of consciousness in isolation, often under the assumption
that doing so suﬃces to account for the phenomenon in its
entirety. In what follows, I brieﬂy outline the key claims of
each theory and assess their scope and limitations from a
phenomenologicalstandpoint.
Before turning to the individual theories, it is important
to clarify the broader philosophical orientation from which
this critique proceeds. Contemporary models such as GWT
and many versions of HOT often construe consciousness in
functional or representational terms – either as reducible to
informational content, or as dependent on metacognitive or
higher-order access. These models typically adopt a third-
person explanatory framework, privileging cognitive accessibility,
behavioral reportability, or functional integration as indicators of
consciousness. The phenomenological stance adopted here does
not deny the relevance of such factors, but begins instead from
a diﬀerent ontological commitment: that consciousness is not,
in the ﬁrst instance, a system output or informational relation,
but a lived structure, one that is pre-reﬂectively given and
embodied in experience. While accessibility and reportability may
beepistemicallysigniﬁcant,theyaresecondarytothelived,situated
givennessthatconstituteswhatitisliketobeconscious.
Theories such as IIT and PCT mark a partial departure from
purely classical representationalist models and, in some respects,
show promising alignment with phenomenological concerns –
particularly in their emphasis on subjective experience and the
dynamic interaction between agent and environment. Yet despite
their theoretical ambition, they too often under-specify the role
ofpre-reﬂectiveself-acquaintanceandcontextualintentionality.In
particular, IIT appears to overlook the role of attentional agency in
its account of consciousness. Thus, while the critiques that follow
focus more directly on GWT and HOT as paradigmatic of access-
based models, the explanatory limitations of IIT and PCT are also
addressed, especially insofar as none of these frameworks, on their
own, fully captures the richness of conscious experience as it is
revealedinphenomenologicalanalysis.
4.1 Global workspace theory
Global Workspace Theory (GWT), ﬁrst proposed by Baars
(1988, 1997), models consciousness as the result of global
broadcasting within a cognitive architecture. According to this
theory, numerous specialized processors in the brain operate
unconsciously in parallel, but when particular information
becomes suﬃciently salient, it is ampliﬁed and broadcast across a
central “workspace,” enabling conscious access. Consciousness, on
thisview,isnottiedtoanyspeciﬁcbrainregionbutarisesfromthe
large-scaleavailabilityofinformationacrossdistributedsystems.
With the advent of neuroimaging, GWT evolved into
the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), oﬀering a
biologically grounded version of the model. GNWT posits that
conscious access emerges through recurrent interactions among
high-level cortical regions – particularly the prefrontal, parietal,
andcingulateareas.Whenneuralrepresentationsreachathreshold
of activation, they initiate a “global ignition” event that correlates
with conscious awareness. Empirical studies using EEG and
fMRI have supported this framework, showing that conscious
perception is marked by large-scale, coordinated activation across
frontal-parietalnetworks.
4.1.1 Critiques of global workspace theory
Let us take a deeper look at what GWT considers to be
‘consciousness’. From the outset, GWT was developed to account
primarily for Access consciousness (A-consciousness). In a widely
cited distinction, Block (1995) characterizes A-consciousness
as the availability of information for reasoning, report, and
control of behavior, in contrast to Phenomenal consciousness (P-
consciousness), which refers to the qualitative, subjective “what-it-
is-like”aspectofexperience.GWTadoptsthisdistinctionandtends
tofocusitsexplanatoryeﬀortsonA-consciousness.As Baars(1997)
illustrates: “While you are conscious of words in your visual focus,
you surely did not consciously label the word ‘focus’ just now as
a noun ...” (Baars, 1997, p. 5). What becomes conscious, in this
view, is the information that enters the global broadcasting system
and becomes available for cognitive access.Mashour et al. (2020)
make this orientation explicit: “Access consciousness refers to the
fact that conscious information, unlike unconscious information,
is accessible to numerous cognitive processors... Thus, unless
otherwise speciﬁed, the term ‘consciousness’ in this review will
be replaced by conscious access” (Mashour et al., 2020, p. 776).
Here, the availability of information, rather than the raw feel
of experience, becomes the central explanandum of GWT. Or
more precisely, GWT tends to conﬂate raw experience with access
itself. Moreover, according toDehaene and Naccache(2001, p. 7),
attentionisconsideredaprerequisiteforconsciousaccess.
Block himself later acknowledged that these two forms may
not be entirely separable in practice – that is, P-consciousness can
become A-consciousness, and vice versa (Bayne and Montague,
2011, p. 8). However, from a phenomenological standpoint,
the issue is not merely whether A-consciousness and P-
consciousness can always be neatly distinguished, but whether
a theory that privileges accessibility can adequately account for
the lived, qualitative dimension of experience. The claim that
Frontiersin Psychology 09 frontiersin.org
Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
consciousness depends on cognitive availability stands in tension
with phenomenological insights. Pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance,
precisely because it is pre-reﬂective, does not require access in
the sense of reportability, inferential integration, or higher-order
monitoring. It is not something we attend to, but something
through which we are already situated in experience. In other
words, the subject is always tacitly aware of itself in the
act of experiencing, without needing to cognitively “access”
that awareness as an object. This kind of immediate self-
givenness precedes any cognitive availability and is often occluded
by attempts to explain consciousness in purely functional or
representational terms. This divergence reﬂects more than a
diﬀerence in emphasis – it reveals a fundamental philosophical
divide with direct implications for the explanatory aims of
consciousnessresearch.
It is also important to note that Block’s distinction between
A-consciousness and P-consciousness has been interpreted
by some as compatible with a broadly representationalist
framework, in which mental representations of externally
existing objects underlie cognitive access. While Block does
not explicitly frame P-consciousness as representational, his
notion of A-consciousness as information functionally available
for reasoning, report, and behavioral guidance lends itself to
representationalist interpretations. GWT, in adopting this model
of access, inherits its functionalist and information-processing
commitments. Phenomenology, by contrast, rejects the premise
that consciousness can be explained as access to internal content,
and likewise denies the dichotomy between an internal realm of
representations and an external world of objects. As discussed
in Section 2, it frames consciousness not as access to internal
representations, but as a mode of intentional engagement that is
at once structurally constituted and pre-reﬂectively given. From
a Husserlian standpoint, consciousness is grounded in a priori
structures of intentionality and self-acquaintance, while later
phenomenologistshavefurtheremphasizeditsembodied,situated,
andrelationaldimensions.
From a phenomenological perspective, we may now ask
whether A-consciousness alone can adequately capture the holistic
structure of consciousness. According to GWT, consciousness is
essentially a matter of access. But can the personal and attitudinal
stance toward objects and others—subjective stance toward the
world, including the pre-attentive familiarity with one’s own
experience—be fully captured by accessibility alone? The concept
of phenomenological intentionality cannot be reduced to A-
consciousness. Subjective intentionality necessarily involves not
only intentionalmatter but also intentionalquality. The conscious
act of “me perceiving a half-ﬁlled glass of water” is shaped not
merely by the visual sensation of the object, but by my evaluative
stance toward it. Indeed, diﬀerent intentional qualities result in
qualitatively distinct experiences, as though a diﬀerent object is
beingpresentedaltogether( Husserl,2001,Vol.II,p.119–120).
13
13 The terms “intentional matter” and “intentional quality” are used here in
the Husserlian sense as developed in the Logical Investigations, rather than
in their analytic usage. In this framework, intentional matter refers to the
objective content toward which a conscious act is directed (e.g. “a glass of
water”),whileintentionalqualityreferstotheparticularmodeofexperiencing
Can subjective feelings of ‘liking’ or ‘disliking’—attitudes
shaped by optimism or pessimism—be explained purely in terms
of awareness or attention? Can GWT account for how such
stances alter the conscious act of perceiving the same glass? A-
consciousness, concerned solely with whether a representation
is accessible, seems inherently incapable of capturing more than
intentional matter. To do so, it would need to reframe intentional
quality as yet another form of intentional matter. For example,
‘liking’ or ‘disliking’ might be explained as becoming aware of
one’s evaluative stance through meta-discovery – a move that
echoes the explanatory strategy found in some versions of HOT.
This line of reasoning is problematic, ﬁrst because it introduces
inﬁnite regress, and second because it contradicts the very notion
of intentional quality. Intentional quality is not derivative; it is a
constitutiveconditionoflivedexperience.Nomatterhowreﬂective
one becomes of one’s attitudes, these reﬂections are not fully
transparent in the way Access consciousness assumes. They are
always already shaped and distorted by subjectivity. Conscious
subjects are, from the beginning, embedded in and inseparable
fromtheirownperspectivalstance.
Furthermore, GWT seems to concentrate on cases involving
minimal expressions of subjectivity. Much of the literature relies
on sensory stimuli perceived through sensory modalities as
paradigmatic examples of experience, eﬀectively treatingsensory
stimuli under awareness as its main explanandum. While this
oﬀers methodological convenience for empirical research relying
on reportable data, it risks simplifying the deeper structures of
intentionality. Consciousness must also be explained in cases
where subjectivity is not merely present but indispensable – that
is, in experiences that could not even arise without subjective
participation. As discussed in Sections 2 and 3, sensory stimuli
do not constitute the foundational elements of perception or
consciousness;rather,theyaretheoreticalabstractions.IfGWTfails
to incorporate the complex dynamics between embodied subjects
andtheirenvironments(i.e.dynamicsfoundationaltosubjectivity),
it risks becoming less a theory of consciousness and more a model
ofattentionalstimulusprocessing.
GWT’s explanatory framework, then, appears insuﬃcient for
capturing the full scope of consciousness. It deﬁnes consciousness
narrowly, as that which is accessible to awareness. While it may
account for contextual and spatiotemporal properties of conscious
experience through global neuronal broadcasting, it remains
conﬁnedtorepresentationsofintentionalmatter.ByidentifyingA-
consciousnesswithconsciousness per se,GWTlimitsitstheoretical
reach to neurobehavioral correlates. In this sense, what it explains
is closer to “information availability during wakefulness” than to
“the emergence of subjectivity as lived experience.” This may seem
to address the question of how conscious experience arises, but in
truth,itreducestheproblemtoanarrowfunctionalsubset,thereby
overlooking the deeper issue of subjectivity. To account for the
phenomenologicalvariationsoflivedexperience,particularlythose
involving intentional quality, GWT must broaden its theoretical
or intending that content (e.g. judging, desiring, doubting). These are both
seen as essential components of the act structure (Actstruktur) and are
analyticallydistinguishablebutinseparableinlivedexperience( Husserl,2001,
Vol. II, 5th Investigation).

Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
scope beyond access-based modeling. After all, GWT is not a
representationalist philosophyper se, but a functional framework
that draws upon representationalist assumptions to interpret
neuroscientiﬁcdata.
Despite these considerations, GWT appears to maintain a
strong commitment to representationalist assumptions, thereby
sidelining phenomenological insights. In phenomenology,
concepts such as pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance and intentional
quality are not equivalent to attention and accessibility, but
are fundamentally prior. Accepting the latter as explanatorily
suﬃcient eﬀectively forecloses the former and returns us to
the specter of physical reductionism. Even if GWT argues
that qualitative, subjective experience can be fully explained in
functional terms—that is, that P-consciousness is reducible to
A-consciousness—thisdoesnotconstituteagenuinesolutiontothe
problem of consciousness. Even if we eliminate qualia and relocate
phenomenalityfromthe“internalmind”tothe“externalbrain,”the
explanatorygapremains.As Rudd(1998) notes,theHardProblem
does not arise merely because experience is diﬃcult to explain
physically; it arises because subjective experience is undeniably
real. Declaring it to be an illusion or functionally redundant does
not erase its presence. It remains experientially given, here and
now.Anytheorythatoverlooksthisessentialfeatureofsubjectivity

4.2 Higher-order theory
Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness (HOT) posit that a
mental state is phenomenally conscious only if the subject is aware
of being in that state. This idea is formalized in theTransitivity
Principle, which holds that a mental state becomes conscious only
when it is the object of a higher-order representation. In this
framework, consciousness is not intrinsic to ﬁrst-order perceptual
states;rather,itemergeswhensuchstatesaremeta-representedata
higher cognitive level. As such, unconscious perceptual processing
is not only possible but widely acknowledged within HOT, with
classic examples including absent-minded driving and blindsight
(Armstrong,2002;Carruthers,1989;Petersetal.,2017 ).
The HOT family encompasses a range of models uniﬁed by
their endorsement of the Transitivity Principle, but they diﬀer in
how the higher-order representation is construed. Some accounts
propose that these are thoughts (Higher-Order Thought theories),
while others treat them as perceptual in nature (Higher-Order
Perception theories), with recent models exploring hybrid forms
(Rosenthal, 1997; Brown et al., 2019; Lau and Rosenthal, 2011).
All versions involve at least two levels of representation: a ﬁrst-
orderperceptualstateandasecond-ordermeta-representationthat
confers conscious status. Empirical support for HOT often draws
on cases of visual awareness (e.g. binocular rivalry, blindsight), but
the theory has also been extended to aﬀective and emotional states
(LeDoux and Brown, 2017). For a more detailed comparison of
multiple HOT models, see Table 1 inLau and Rosenthal (2011)
and Table 1 inBrown et al. (2019). In the discussion that follows,
I treat HOT as a general class of theories without committing to
anyspeciﬁcsubtype.
4.2.1 Critiques of higher-order theory
Higher-Order Theories of consciousness have long stood
in tension with phenomenology, particularly in their treatment
of self-consciousness. In HOT, object-directed consciousness is
categorized as transitive consciousness, while pre-reﬂective self-
consciousness is viewed as intransitive consciousness. Crucially,
HOT posits that intransitive consciousness is not intrinsic but
derivative – it arises only through the existence of transitive
consciousness. That is, self-consciousness is taken to emerge
from consciousness that is directed at or reﬂective about
an object, making it thoroughly dependent on the existence
of object-consciousness (Rosenthal, 1986). This stance, similar
to GWT’s presupposition of A-consciousness as the necessary
precondition for all conscious states, stands in clear contrast to
phenomenologicalaccounts.
14
Consequently, many of the phenomenological critiques raised
against GWT apply equally to HOT. A phenomenologist would
likely invert the explanatory order, proposing that intransitive
consciousness is the precondition for transitive consciousness.
This view is strongly supported by Zahavi, who argues that
pre-reﬂective self-consciousness is not a byproduct of higher-
order monitoring but an intrinsic feature of experience itself.
On his account, all conscious states are tacitly self-aware in a
non-objectifying way, and any theory that fails to account for
this immediacy risks misrepresenting the structure of subjectivity.
Rather than treating self-consciousness as a representational add-
on, Zahavi (2005, p. 17–29) emphasizes its foundational role
in enabling experiential coherence and ﬁrst-personal perspective.
On this view, the foundation of conscious experience lies not
in the Transitivity Principle, but in what might be called the
Intransitivity Principle (this phrase is used here heuristically).
For phenomenology, the composition of conscious life does not
begin with object-directed content but with the lived structure of
subjectivity itself. Metaphorically, subjectivity functions not as the
spotlight that illuminates content, but as the stage that makes any
performance possible. In other words, for there to be a spotlight in
thementaltheater,thetheatermustalreadyexist.
15
Moreover, as the term “pre-reﬂective” self-consciousness itself
indicates, phenomenologists do not regard self-acquaintance or
self-intimacy as a higher-order mental activity that observes or
14 However, note that there is considerable variation across Higher-Order
approaches, depending on how they specify the mechanisms by which
higher-order states generate consciousness. Accordingly, the strictness with
which the Transitivity Principle is applied varies. Some hybrid theories,
particularly those combining representationalism with more nuanced
gradations of awareness, do acknowledge peripheral or preconscious states
inwaysthatalignpartiallywithphenomenologicalintuitions (Gennaro,2015;
Kriegel, 2009; Van Gulick, 2004). This discussion, however, focuses on the
general HOT framework rather than speciﬁc hybrid models.
15 Whilenotexplicitlyframedasphenomenological, Bennettetal.’s (2024)
recent study supports a similar claim by demonstrating the precedence
of self-consciousness in embodied, self-organizing systems. Their formal
argument, developed through a pancomputational enactivist framework,
contends that lower-order information processing must constitutionally
precede higher-order representational states for consciousness to arise. For
further discussion, see Section 5.

monitors one’s own mental states. In Husserl’s formulation, it is
non-observational and directlylived through (Erlebt); it is neither
internal perception nor reﬂective thought (Husserl, 2001, Vol.
II, 6th Investigation). The term lived experience (Erlebnis) here
refers not merely to the fact that experience is ﬁrst-personal,
but to the way it is directly undergone prior to reﬂection,
observation, or conceptualization. To experience an object in
this sense means undergoing it at the same hierarchical level,
rather than recognizing it from a detached, higher-order cognitive
position.
16 From a phenomenological perspective, pre-reﬂective
self-consciousness, or “intransitive” consciousness, is posited as an
irreducibleandintrinsicfeatureofallconsciousstates.Criticsfrom
the HOT tradition have argued that treating such properties as
irreducible renders them beyond scientiﬁc or theoretical inquiry,
eﬀectively mystifying consciousness (Rosenthal, 1993). But this
critique invites a parallel concern: by positing the Transitivity
Principle as a foundational feature of consciousness, does not
HOT also posit a limit beyond which no further reduction is
possible? At its core, the Transitivity Principle treats “orientation
toward an object” as intrinsic to conscious experience – a
move not fundamentally diﬀerent from phenomenology’s claim
aboutsubjectivity.
While both HOT and phenomenology acknowledge that
consciousness has essential features, they fundamentally disagree
on what those features are and how they should be explained.
What may appear as a perspectival diﬀerence ultimately reﬂects
contrasting commitments to the structure of subjectivity: whether
self-consciousness is intrinsic and immediate, or whether it
emerges through representational reﬂection. From the HOT
perspective, the phenomenological emphasis on irreducible
subjectivity is often seen as obscuring the conditions for scientiﬁc
or theoretical analysis. However, recognizing something as
irreducible does not mean giving up on explanation. In fact,
phenomenology takes the irreducibility of pre-reﬂective self-
consciousness as the starting point for a rich explanatory
project. As outlined in Sections2&3 ,i tc a na ccount for how
consciousness becomes contextually structured from self-intimacy
to spatial, temporal, intersubjective, and even object-directed
experiences such as attention, which HOT emphasizes. If one
framework oﬀers a broader and deeper explanatory reach,
there may be good reasons to treat it as a more promising
explanatoryframework.
16 The hierarchical distinction referenced here concerns levels within
mental processing, not levels of neurobiological organization. It is
important not to conﬂate thematic levels when discussing theories of
consciousness. Phenomenology remains neutral on the issue of naturalizing
the mind and is thus fully compatible with empirical ﬁndings, including
hierarchical mechanisms in visual perception. This allows for theoretical
compatibility. For instance, even if neural correlates of pre-reﬂective self-
consciousness span multiple processing levels, this poses no contradiction
within phenomenological logic. The same holds for Higher-Order theories:
since HOT is not inherently reductionist, hierarchical levels in mental
representation need not map directly onto neurobiological hierarchies.
4.3 Integrated information theory
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) oﬀers a computational
framework for explaining consciousness by treating qualia as
intrinsic informational properties of physical systems. Instead
of focusing on neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)
or observable behavior, IIT starts with the assumption that
consciousness is ontologically primary and aims to characterize
it in formal, quantitative terms. The theory begins with a set
of phenomenal axioms —Existence, Intrinsicality, Information,
Integration, Exclusion, and Composition—which are intended to
reﬂect universally agreed-upon features of subjective experience
(Albantakis et al., 2023 ).
17 These axioms are then mapped
onto physical postulates, which specify the structural and causal
requirements a physical system must satisfy in order to instantiate
those phenomenal features. IIT’s ultimate goal is to compute a
measure of consciousness, denoted as /Phi1, that quantiﬁes both
the presence and qualitative character of experience within a
given physical substrate (Tononi, 2005; Tononi and Koch, 2015;
Albantakisetal.,2023 ).
Central to this computation are the notions of intrinsic
information and integration. Intrinsic information is deﬁned as
the informational diﬀerence between the causal (constrained) and
non-causal (unconstrained) states of a system, distinguishing it
from Shannon information. Integration refers to the irreducibility
of the system’s informational structure: a system is said to be
integrated if it generates more information as a whole than the
sum of its parts. The amount of integrated information lost upon
partitioningthesystemdeterminesthevalueof /Phi1,which,according
to the theory’s identity assumption, is identical to consciousness
itself. In its most recent formulation, IIT introduces the concept
of a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (/Phi1
max), whose
geometricandquantitativefeaturesaretakentocorresponddirectly
tothequalityofexperience( MoonandPae,2019 ;Albantakisetal.,
2023).
4.3.1 Critiques of the integrated information
theory
Integrated Information Theory (IIT), though grounded in
neuroscience, takes an unusual and ambitious turn by placing
P-consciousness rather than A-consciousness at the center of its
explanatory framework. It aims to preserve the intrinsic, ineﬀable,
and private character of qualia, engaging directly with the so-
called Hard Problem of consciousness. Unlike many scientiﬁc
theories that either sideline or reinterpret P-consciousness in
17 Note the shift in terminology from “phenomenological axioms” in
version 3.0 of IIT(Tononi, 2012;Oizumi et al., 2014)to “phenomenal axioms”
in version 4.0(Albantakis et al., 2023). This change suggests a conceptual
departure from the intrinsic properties of consciousness as traditionally
understood in phenomenology. Similarly, the “ontological postulates” of
version 3.0 have been renamed “physical postulates” in version 4.0. These
shifts in language indicate a move away from a broadly ontological
orientation toward a more narrowly physicalist framework, emphasizing
the aim of realizing phenomenal axioms through physically instantiated
correlates.

Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
terms of functional accessibility or cognitive report, IIT treats
it as the entirety of consciousness. This orientation is reﬂected
in its foundational claim: “That experience exists—that ‘there
is something it is like to be’—is immediate and irrefutable, as
everybodycanconﬁrm,say,uponawakeningfromdreamlesssleep”
(Albantakis et al., 2023, p. 3). As commendable as this emphasis
may be, it raises a critical concern: how much explanatory traction
canbegainedbybuildinganentiretheoryofconsciousnessaround
P-consciousness alone, while marginalizing other dimensions
ofexperience?
Even if P-consciousness are central to understanding
consciousness, they do not exhaust its full structure. Just as
GWT risks reducing consciousness to cognitive accessibility, IIT
may err in the opposite direction by identifying it wholly with
qualia, understood as intrinsic, privately accessible phenomenal
properties. While phenomenology emphasizes ﬁrst-person
experience,itdoesnotequateitwithrawsensation;living-through
(Erlebt) involves structures that extend beyond mere qualitative
feel. The issue is not that IIT fails to naturalize phenomenology
as it does not aim to be a phenomenological theory, but that its
conception of consciousness is overly narrow, even on its own
terms. (Indeed, IIT researchers explicitly acknowledge that their
phenomenalaxiomsarenotderivedfromclassicalphenomenology
– see text footnote
17.) As a result, IIT’s focus on qualia/P-
consciousness risks collapsing the complexity of conscious
process into a certain internal informational conﬁguration,
leaving out dimensions such as embodiment, intentionality,
and intersubjective constitution that phenomenology regards
asessential.
IIT constructs a formally rigorous model in which qualia
are understood as informational entities, grounded in ﬁve
phenomenal axioms: Intrinsicality, Information, Integration,
Exclusion, and Composition.
18 These axioms are translated into
physical postulates that deﬁne the structural properties a system
must possess in order to generate consciousness, understood as
integrated information,/Phi1. Since/Phi1is computed from the intrinsic
causalstructureofthesystemthatisindependentofexternalinput,
it is framed as an inherent and self-contained property. In this
way, IIT aims to capture the ineﬀable and private nature of qualia
through formal means. The problem, however, is that IIT treats
its account of qualia as suﬃcient for explaining consciousness
as a whole. As a result, its model tends toward a solipsistic
conception: because /Phi1is necessarily intrinsic, the conscious
system is portrayed as fundamentally self-contained, capable of
being conscious independently of any relation to the world. This
stands in marked contrast to the phenomenological account,
as discussed in Section 2. From that perspective, subjectivity is
not a sealed inner realm but something constituted dynamically
throughsituationalcontext,embodiedinteraction,andrecognition
18 For a more detailed critique of IIT’s phenomenal axioms, see Bayne
(2018), who argues that none of the ﬁve axioms are compelling from a
phenomenological standpoint. While this paper does not pursue axiom-by-
axiom analysis, Bayne’s concerns reinforce the broader critique that IIT’s
conception of consciousness may be overly formal and detached from lived
experience.
of others as fellow agents. It is not enough for consciousness
to exist in itself; it must also existin the world. In this sense,
subjectivity cannot be fully established without the presence of
others and a shared environment. The relational structure of lived
experience—its intentional orientation, temporal openness, and
intersubjective constitution—is absent from IIT’s conception of
consciousness, which remains enclosed within the causal borders
ofthesystemitdescribes.
Still, there is conceptual space within IIT that could open it
to a richer account of subjectivity. Phenomenology acknowledges
that selfhood is not reducible to social or linguistic constructions
alone. While early phenomenologists emphasized its intrinsic,
pre-reﬂective character, later developments have increasingly
recognized the formative role of embodiment, intersubjectivity,
and cultural-historical context in shaping subjective experience.
Across these variations, a consistent theme remains: the emphasis
on pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance as a minimal yet irreducible
feature of conscious mental phenomena. IIT, for its part, posits
Existence as the most fundamental of its axioms—described as
“TheOneAxiom”or“theultimatezerothaxiom”—whichunderlies
all subsequent phenomenal axioms (Albantakis et al., 2023,p .
3). This formulation may suggest a structural parallel with the
phenomenologicalnotionofﬁrst-persongivenness.
However, upon closer inspection, IIT’s axiom of Existence
lacksreferencetoself-acquaintanceorﬁrst-personalintentionality.
It states that “experience exists” but does so in abstract and
impersonal terms, omitting any sense of mineness or self-
involvement. In attempting to explain the structure of qualia,
IIT does not engage the core condition that makes experience
subjective in the ﬁrst place. From a phenomenological perspective,
any account of existence that bypasses this minimal form of self-
consciousness falls short of describing what it means to live an
experience. The intimacy of lived experience (Erlebnis) cannot
be captured by a merely structural or computational account of
informational properties, as it arises through a continuous and
dynamic interaction with the world – an unfolding process shaped
by embodiment, temporality, and intersubjective engagement.
Thus, although IIT claims to reﬂect phenomenological intuitions,
its axioms ultimately interpret the features of consciousness as
outputs of causal and informational processes, rather than as
expressionsoflived,intentionalstructure.
Consequently, IIT not only struggles to account for the
subjectivity of qualia in a non-solipsistic manner, but also
fails to capture the broader range of conscious processes
in which qualia are embedded. While IIT aims to capture
the structural complexity of conscious experience through
conceptslikeintegrationandcomposition,itsformalizedapproach
risks neglecting the dynamically situated and context-sensitive
dimensions of experience. These include the dynamic interplay
between central and peripheral awareness, the temporal and
evaluative structures of intentionality (such as anticipation,
recollection, and valuation), and the reﬂexive self-awareness of the
consciousagent.Anycomprehensivetheoryofconsciousnessmust
addresstheseelements.
IIT’s treatment of qualia as informational correlates is,
without doubt, an ambitious and creative proposal. But qualia
alone do not constitute the whole of conscious experience.
Frontiersin Psychology 13 frontiersin.org
Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
Without integrating the notion of a self-aware agent engaged
with the world, IIT’s model risks fragmenting consciousness into
decontextualized informational structures that are far removed
fromlivedexperience.Giventhatmanyfacetsofconsciousnesscan
be meaningfully explained through intentionality, it becomes clear
that qualitative and functional aspects are not mutually exclusive
but co-constitutive. Indeed, while IIT’s phenomenal axiom seeks
to preserve the immediacy of experience by resisting reduction
to function, it ironically risks producing the very fragmentation
it aims to avoid. Its axioms, though innovative, may ultimately
function not only as guiding principles but also as limiting
constraintsonthetheory’sexplanatoryreach.
4.4 Predictive coding theory
Predictive Coding Theory (PCT), also known as Predictive
Processing Theory or Active Inference framework, understands
consciousness as emerging from inferential processes grounded
in active engagement with the environment. Drawing on
Helmholtz’s notion of unconscious inference, PCT suggests that
the brain operates as a hierarchical prediction machine, constantly
generatingandupdatinginternalmodelstominimizethemismatch
between sensory inputs and prior expectations ( Seth, 2015;
Metzinger and Wiese, 2017). Through its integration with the Free
Energy Principle (FEP), PCT formalizes this idea by proposing
that biological systems, including the brain, minimize free energy
to resist entropy and maintain functional coherence ( Friston,
2010, 2012). Perception and action are thus conceptualized as
complementary strategies for minimizing prediction error across
multiple levels of processing, with the brain functioning as a
hypothesis-testing system (Hohwy, 2012). This framework is often
illustrated through the “control room” analogy, in which an agent
must infer the state of the world based solely on internal readouts
– a metaphor for the brain’s reliance on internal generative models
ratherthandirectaccesstoreality( MetzingerandWiese,2017 ).
On this view, consciousness is not a passive imprint of sensory
data, but an actively generated simulation shaped by probabilistic
inference. The generative model maintained by the brain encodes
hypotheses about hidden causes in the world and is continuously
reﬁned through the dynamics of prediction error minimization
(Friston, 2013b, 2018). Conscious awareness is thus understood in
terms of how ascending prediction errors revise high-level priors,
therebyshapingthephenomenalcharacterofexperience.Although
PCT does not consistently refer to “state consciousness” in explicit
terms, certain interpretations—particularly those aligned with the
Free Energy Principle—suggest that consciousness may arise when
prediction errors become globally accessible and integrated into
deeperrepresentationalsystems.
19
19 Although the term “state consciousness” is not explicitly used in the
PCT literature,Friston et al. (2018)discusses how attention and phenomenal
contentcanbothbeexplainedthroughpredictivecoding: “Thisispotentially

of prediction errors. … The inferential or sentient phenomenology is
straightforward. In terms of a more phenomenological and quantitative
experience, I think the story still holds. In other words, some form of
4.4.1 Critiques of the predictive coding theory
One of the most notable strengths of PCT lies in its emphasis
on environmental interaction as central to conscious processing,
oﬀering a promising framework for modeling consciousness as the
activity of an embodied agent embedded in the world. However,
many traditional formulations of PCT retain a Helmholtzian
perspective on inference, which presupposes a sharp division
between internal cognitive states and an external, perceivable
world. This dualistic paradigm, which dichotomizes the subject
(animal) and its environment, tends to limit the theory’s
explanatory reach, as it proceeds independently of the intrinsic
properties of subjectivity. While PCT can account for types of
consciousness that are representationally accessible, it struggles
to address non-representational aspects such as pre-reﬂective
self-acquaintance. This omission renders such dimensions of
experience theoretically irrelevant or invisible within the standard
inferentialframework.
Encouragingly, not all interpretations of PCT are committed
to this Helmholtzian model. Some theorists reinterpret active
inference not as the construction of an inner world-modelper se,
but as a generative and world-involving process in its own right.
As Seth notes: “Linking these origins to their modern expression
in Karl Friston’s ‘free energy principle’ (2010), perception emerges
as a consequence of a more fundamental imperative toward
homeostasis and control, and not as a process designed to furnish
a detailed inner ‘world model’ suitable for cognition and action
planning.” (Seth, 2015, p. 3). This opens up the possibility of
reconceiving perception as a constitutively relational rather than
representational process, which is a shift that aligns PCT more
closelywiththespiritofembodiedandenactivephenomenology,as
emphasized in the work ofVarela et al. (1991), Thompson (2007),
Gallagher(2005),and Clark(2013).
PCT characterizes conscious perception as arising from the
brain’s ongoing inference of its situated context in the world –
an account that appears well-suited to explain the world-involving
dimensions of intentionality emphasized in phenomenology.
However, it is important to note that such ongoing inference of
context does not straightforwardly or self-evidently lead to the
emergence of consciousness. PCT lacks a clear justiﬁcation for
why active inference should necessarily give rise to conscious
experience. While PCT’s framing of perception as an embodied
and self-organizing process may oﬀer a structural foundation for
minimal selfhood or situated subjectivity, it does not in itself
explainwhysuchinteractionsshouldbeexperiencedassubjectively
lived. In other words, the mere modeling of one’s own body and
surrounding environment is not obviously suﬃcient to account
for the pre-reﬂective givenness of experience. This limitation
ultimately reﬂects a deeper challenge for PCT: the absence of a
principled account of why generative inference should give rise to
consciousnessatall.
While some versions of the theory treat mental states as
emergent properties of predictive processes (Seth, 2015; Friston,
2016), it remains unclear how and why these emergent properties
attentionisnecessarytounderwritetheaccessofascendingpredictionerrors
to deeper levels of processing; such that they can revise our beliefs and
expectations about states of the world” (Friston et al., 2018, p. 28).

must entail subjectivity. For instance, GWT grounds its claims
in empirical ﬁndings on global neural broadcasting, and IIT
articulates mathematically deﬁned conditions under which qualia
are said to arise. PCT, however, oﬀers a compelling picture of
inference dynamics but does not demonstrate how such dynamics
suﬃce to bridge the explanatory gap between unconscious
computation and conscious experience. The Free Energy Principle
may show how inference occurs spontaneously in biological
systems, but spontaneity alone does not resolve the philosophical
burden of showing why such processes result in consciousness
rather than merely functioning behavior. Unless PCT can provide
a principled account of why inference should lead to subjective
experience,itrisksbeingclassiﬁednotasatheoryofconsciousness
butasabiologicallyinspiredmodelofadaptiveregulation.
That said, if a defensible principle of emergence could be
articulated, PCT might oﬀer strong support for phenomenological
insights by providing a scientiﬁcally grounded account of
consciousness. Its inferential mechanisms could plausibly align
with the forms of self-acquaintance and contextual embodiment
discussed in Section 3. Indeed, PCT has already been applied to
areas ranging from temporality and attention to the modeling of
agent-basedcognition( Sandved-Smithetal.,2021 ;Ramsteadetal.,

5 Reconciling empirical theories of
consciousness
Up to this point, I have examined how four major scientiﬁc
theories—GWT, HOT, IIT, and PCT—deﬁne consciousness and
approach its explanation. I also considered how these approaches
diﬀer from the structures of experience revealed through
phenomenologicalreﬂection. Figure1a outlinesthecentralfeatures
of consciousness discussed in Section 3. Figures1b–e provide
a schematic comparison of how each theory captures certain
dimensions of this structure. GWT emphasizes representational
access, grounding its account in neural mechanisms of broadcast.
HOT focuses on meta-representational access as the condition for
consciousness. IIT approaches the issue from the standpoint of
intrinsic informational structure, while PCT frames consciousness
asabyproductofbiologicallyembeddedinferenceprocesses.
However, as the critical discussions above suggest, no single
theory oﬀers a comprehensive account of consciousness in its full
complexity. Even the features outlined in Section 3, while central,
arenotproposedasexhaustive.Fromthisperspective,theminimal
conditions for consciousness oﬀered by each theory reﬂect only
partial facets of a larger phenomenon. In this light, the prevailing
tendency to stage these theories in direct opposition, debating
which one “gets it right,” may itself be misguided. Such theoretical
rivalries risk obscuring the deeper conceptual work needed to
clarifywhateachtheoryisactuallytryingtoexplain.
What we need, I suggest, is a shift in orientation: from
theoretical rivalry to conceptual integration. I believe that
a meaningful integration of these theories is both possible
and desirable, without necessarily giving rise to conﬂict. At
the same time, such a fusion should not be mistaken for
a comprehensive solution to the problem of consciousness.
Rather, it may serve as a constructive starting point – a
way to frame the diversity of conscious phenomena without
prematurely foreclosing theoretical possibilities. Each theory
brings attention to a distinct aspect of consciousness, shaped
by its explanatory commitments. If consciousness involves both
subjective self-acquaintance and access-based awareness, situated
within embodied and environmental contexts, then it becomes
possible to see these approaches as complementary rather than
mutually exclusive. This is the perspective illustrated inFigure1a.
Rather than choosing one model over another, we might consider
howeachcontributestoabroaderandmoreﬂexibleunderstanding

To reiterate, these theories need not compete; they can
coexist in parallel, as each illuminates diﬀerent dimensions of
consciousness. What is needed is a movement toward a more

respect the explanatory boundaries of each theory while adapting
their methods to account for distinct subdomains of conscious
phenomena. By doing so, we may begin to stitch together a more
cohesive framework that draws from the strengths of existing
models. In the remainder of this section, I examine how each
theory corresponds to speciﬁc phenomenological features, and I
suggest possible conceptual adjustments that could allow for their
integrationwithoutabandoningphenomenologicalinsight.Finally,
I introduce a selection of studies that reﬂect a similar integrative
outlook, highlighting concrete eﬀorts toward bridging disparate
theoriesofconsciousness.
5.1 Reducible properties of consciousness
GWT and HOT share a broadly reductionist orientation that
aligns with representationalism. Both theories emphasize the role
of representational awareness in the emergence of consciousness
and deﬁne conscious states in terms of functional access. This
alignment stems from a shared assumption that conscious states
can be fully explained by reference to internal representations
and their functional roles within a system, thereby reducing
phenomenalitytorepresentationalaccessibility.Thiscontrastswith
phenomenologicalmethodology,whichdoesnottypicallybeginby
separatingthesubjectfromtheworld.Instead,ittreatsphenomenal

the primary object of inquiry. In this section, however, I explore
howGWTandHOTmightcoexistwithphenomenologyandother
models, provided we understand their explananda as addressing
speciﬁcsubsetsofthebroaderphenomenonofconsciousness.
GWT proposes that consciousness arises through a process
of global broadcasting, whereby information becomes accessible
across cognitive systems. In thisview, the critical unit is notneural
activation itself, but the integrated mental structure represented
by such activity (Baars, 1997). When we turn to GNWT, however,
the emphasis shifts toward the neurobiological mechanisms that
instantiate this process. Global broadcasting here refers to speciﬁc

Uniﬁed framework for consciousness theories.(a) Uniﬁed framework. This diagram integrates major phenomenological insights into a uniﬁed
structure. It depicts a conscious agent situated in a controlled environment, attentively focusing on a half-ﬁlled glass of water. The agent perceives
this object from two contrasting attitudinal perspectives—pessimistic (shaded blue) and optimistic (shaded yellow)—highlighting variations in
intentional quality. Although directed at the same intentional matter, these perspectives yield distinct conscious experiences. The depth and vividness
of experience vary with the agent’s degree of engagement, represented as a series of layered contour surfaces radiating from the bodily self at the
center. This structure reﬂects the gradation from pre-reﬂective self-acquaintance at the core to fully articulated perception. For instance, peripheral
awareness results in a less vivid experience (A), while active engagement intensiﬁes phenomenality (C), illustrating the dynamic constitution of
conscious experience.(b) Global workspace theory (GWT). GWT is mapped onto this framework as the mechanism by which attentionally selected
content becomes globally accessible. It aligns with the representation of Access consciousness, wherein the content of focus is broadcast across
cognitive systems, enabling coordinated behavioral and cognitive responses.(c) Higher-order theory (HOT). HOT is mapped here as a hierarchical
layer over intentional content. According to the transitivity principle, a mental state becomes conscious only when it is represented by a higher-order
state. This depiction reﬂects the core claim of HOT, in which meta-representational processes are taken to determine conscious status within the
model’s representational architecture.(d) Integrated information theory (IIT). IIT is represented at the level of structural integration. Rather than
emphasizing speciﬁc intentional contents, it accounts for the overall compositional structure of experience. Within the framework, IIT corresponds
to the topographical “surface” of the contour layers, expressing the intrinsic integration of phenomenological elements within the system.(e)
Predictive coding theory (PCT). PCT is represented through the dynamic interface between the bodily self and its environment. It highlights how
ongoing agent-environment interactions, mediated by active inference and predictive engagement, shape and modulate the evolving structure of
conscious experience.

neural ensembles whose activation marks the transition into
consciousawareness( Dehaeneetal.,2006 ).Thesetwoperspectives
are not contradictory; rather, they reﬂect diﬀerent explanatory
levels.GWT,initsbroadersense,capturesthecognitivestructureof
conscious content, while GNWT focuses on the underlying neural
dynamics. Taken together, they show how A-consciousness can be
studiedatboththefunctionalandbiologicallevels.
Because GWT focuses primarily on those aspects of
consciousness that are functionally explicable, it oﬀers a relatively
accessible and empirically tractable framework. Its explanatory
strength lies in identifying the neural conditions necessary for
A-consciousnesstoarise.Asillustratedin Figure1b,GWTexplains
how intentional matter becomes globally available to cognitive
systems through mechanisms of neural broadcasting, regardless of
the speciﬁc qualitative content of the target. In this respect, GWT
oﬀers a broad explanatory scope for a wide range of conscious
phenomenathatarebehaviorallyorreportablyaccessible.
However, it is important to note that not all instances of
global broadcasting necessarily result in reportable conscious
experience. Conversely, there are also cases where subjects report
a conscious experience even in the absence of globally distributed
neural activity (Brown et al., 2019; Rosenthal, 2008). This suggests
that GWT’s framework may beneﬁt from supplementation. For
example, Van Gulick’s Higher-Order Global State (HOGS) theory
(Van Gulick, 2004) adds an additional condition: that a mental
state must be integrated into a higher-order system of self-
awareness to qualify as conscious. Such reﬁnements could help
GWT better accommodate phenomenal features that it does not,
byitself,explain.
Indeed, the neural structures implicated in GWT’s account
of consciousness (Del Cul et al., 2007; Odegaard et al., 2017)
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those proposed by IIT (Boly et al., 2017;
Koch et al., 2016). This divergence has led to ongoing adversarial
collaboration projects aimed at directly comparing the predictive
power of the two models (Cogitate Consortium et al., 2023).
While this is often framed as a competitive empirical test, it
may also be interpreted as a productive comparison of theories
with fundamentally diﬀerent explananda. GWT focuses on access
mechanisms and cognitive integration, whereas IIT targets the
structural features of phenomenality itself. Rather than seeing this
contrast as a zero-sum rivalry, such collaborations might serve to
demonstrate how multiple theories can coexist by clarifying the
distinctdimensionsofconsciousnesstheyaddress.
Just as GWT emphasizes the emergence of an accessible
“spotlight” of consciousness, HOT likewise seeks to explain
consciousness in terms of accessibility – speciﬁcally, through
higher-order metacognition. According to HOT, a mental state
becomes conscious only when it is the object of a higher-
order mental state that represents it ( Rosenthal, 1997). This
criterion introduces slightly stricter phenomenological conditions
than those proposed by GWT, which treats consciousness as the
sustainedavailabilityofrepresentationalcontentacrossdistributed
neuralsystems.
In essence, both theories address A-consciousness, but they
diﬀer in the speciﬁc features they emphasize. GWT focuses on
neural broadcasting and functional availability, whereas HOT
centers on the meta-representational structure of conscious
states. The distinction lies in whether access alone suﬃces, or
whether awareness of access—i.e. a second-order representation—
is required for a state to qualify as conscious. These contrasting
emphases are illustrated in Figures1b, c, particularly in how
each theory conceptualizes the transition from unconscious to
consciousprocessing.
Despite addressing overlapping explananda, GWT and HOT
are not inherently incompatible. As noted byBrown et al. (2019),
the broad accessibility of information does not conﬂict with
the presence of self-referential mental processes.Dehaene et al.
(2017) similarly argue that global broadcasting and higher-order
metacognitive reference constitute two orthogonal dimensions of
consciousprocessing,bothofwhicharetypicallyactiveineveryday
experience. Since GWT does not specify the mental processes
by which the “spotlight of attention” becomes phenomenally
salient, it leaves room for compatibility with HOT’s account of
higher-order awareness.
20 While GWT places greater emphasis
on the neural mechanisms of conscious access and HOT on
metacognitive representation, both theories can be viewed as
capturingcomplementaryfeaturesofAccessconsciousness.Rather
than presenting mutually exclusive accounts, they may together
illuminatediﬀerentlayersofhowaccessibleexperienceisgenerated
andmaintained.
OnedimensionofA-consciousnessthatisphenomenologically
signiﬁcant is the subject’s capacity for volitional and selective
attention – the ability to modulate awareness in a goal-directed
manner. From a phenomenological perspective, this attentional
agencydoesnotrequirereﬂectiveobservationofone’smentalstates;
rather, it is lived through directly and pre-reﬂectively, as part of
theongoingstructureofexperience.HOT,despiteoperatingwithin
a representational and metacognitive framework, oﬀers a valuable
explanatory model for how such agentive modulation might be
implementedincognitivearchitecture.Althoughapproachedfrom
a diﬀerent angle, HOT’s central insight—that certain forms of
conscious mental process arise when one becomes aware of
one’s own mental states—can still be seen as engaging with the
same structural phenomenon of attentional selectivity. While the
Transitivity Principle remains philosophical disagreement, setting
that aside reveals a productive point of contact: both HOT and
phenomenology, in their own ways, recognize that consciousness
involves the capacity to guide or modulate attention through the
subject’s own activity. In this sense, HOT’s emphasis on higher-
order cognition may be read not as a rival to phenomenology, but
as a model that highlights certain mechanisms consonant with the
agentivestructureofconsciousexperience.
20 In the context of traditional psychological paradigms, GNWT also
complements Signal Detection Theory (SDT), by offering a neurobiological
framework that grounds SDT’s behavioral observations. Several studies
highlight the interdependence of these models(Van Vugt et al., 2018; King
and Dehaene, 2014; Mashour et al., 2020). Like HOT, SDT presupposes a
representationalist framework in which cognition involves the detection of
signals by a subject distinct from the world. However, it does not directly
addressthephenomenologicalcharacterofmentalstatessuchashitsorfalse
alarms. Thus, SDT may coexist conceptually with HOT, just as GNWT can.

5.2 Irreducible properties of consciousness
IIT seeks to reconstruct the question of what it means
to be a conscious being by starting not from behavioral or
representational correlates, but from the inescapable elements of
qualitativeexperienceitself( Albantakisetal.,2023 ).Itisgrounded
in the conviction that consciousness cannot be fully explained in
termsofneuralcorrelatesorfunctionaloperationsalone,especially
insofar as these rely on representational assumptions. IIT begins
fromtheassertionthatconsciousnessisnotreducible—particularly
at the neurobiological level—and that any explanatory framework
must preserve the intrinsic character of experience rather than
translating it into purely functional or representational terms. In
doing so, it focuses on intrinsic features of experience that resist
decomposition into simpler or more functionally deﬁnable parts.
This orientationsets IITapart frommore reductionistapproaches,
suchasGWTandHOT,whichbeginfromfunctional,accessible,or
metacognitive dimensions. If one were to frame these approaches
in a zero-sum logic by asking which theory alone could account
forconsciousnessinitsentirety,IIT’spositionwouldseemdiﬃcult
to reconcile with its rivals. But such framing is neither necessary
norproductive.Ifweinsteadviewthesetheoriesascomplementary,
each oﬀering insights into diﬀerent aspects of consciousness, then
IIT’s distinct focus becomes a valuable contribution rather than a
competingclaim.
Whereas GWT and HOT focus on how information becomes
globally available or metacognitively accessible, IIT turns its focus
tothe phenomenaltexturesthemselves.Asillustratedin Figure1d,
IIT may be seen as addressing the surface layers of conscious
experience, layered around the bodily self like a Russian doll. Its
concern is not with how experiences are functionally produced
or accessed, but with what intrinsic properties they must have in
order to be what they are, to appear as they do. Starting from the
brutefactofexperience(“thereissomethingitislike”),IITaimsto
identify the informational structures that such experiences entail
(Tononi et al., 2016). From this foundation, it attempts to work
backward toward the physical or neurobiological conﬁgurations
thatcouldinstantiatesuchinformationalproperties.Thisapproach
resonates with phenomenological methodology, which also begins
not with representational function, but with the lived givenness of
experienceastheproperobjectofinvestigation.
While the axioms at the heart of IIT are not
phenomenologically grounded in a strict philosophical sense
(see Bayne, 2018for detailed critiques of each axiom), the overall
approach of the theory nonetheless shows a methodological
aﬃnity with phenomenology, insofar as it takes the structure
of subjective experience as its starting point. IIT emphasizes
features such as the intrinsic, uniﬁed, and richly diﬀerentiated
character of experience, which resonate with certain structural
descriptions found in reﬂective analysis. That said, IIT’s model
remains primarily oriented toward the study of sensory experience
anddoesnotexplicitlyengagewithdimensionssuchastemporality
or pre-reﬂective/reﬂective self-awareness. Nevertheless, it oﬀers
a compelling framework for modeling certain aspects of P-
consciousnessthatremainunderdevelopedinmanyothertheories.
Rather than attempting to expand IIT’s scope prematurely, one
promisingpathmaylieinmodestlysupplementingit.Forexample,
a limited principle borrowed from HOT—such as the idea that
certain conscious contents become phenomenally salient through
higher-order access—could be used to account for those situations
in which P-consciousness and A-consciousness coincide. This
would not replace IIT’s core assumptions, but oﬀer an auxiliary
condition relevant in cases such as lucid awareness, without
assuming that all phenomenality is dependent on access. Such
integrative steps could help clarify the relations between diﬀerent
theorieswhilepreservingthemethodologicalintegrityofeach.
5.3 Embodied properties of consciousness
PCT, in particular, oﬀers a theoretical structure well-suited
to explaining the conscious subject as an embodied agent,
especially in interpretations that emphasize perception and action
as environmentally embedded processes. Among the theories
of consciousness examined so far, this strand of PCT appears
especially promising for engaging with phenomenological insights
in a scientiﬁcally tractable manner. Its account of conscious
phenomena as emerging from a fundamental hyperprior—
understood broadly as the tacit familiarity with one’s own
bodily presence—and unfolding hierarchically, like ripples
expanding in concentric circles (Friston, 2013a), closely mirrors
the phenomenological view in which intentionality is grounded in
pre-reﬂectiveself-acquaintance(see Figure1e).
For instance, gist perception, as modeled in hybrid predictive
coding frameworks (Tscshantz et al., 2023), oﬀers a clear example
of perceptual organization that precedes the emergence of focal
attention. From a phenomenological standpoint, attentional focus
is not required for intentional matter to arise; rather, experience
may be pre-structured by background bodily awareness and
context-sensitivity. Arelatedcaseis theuniformityillusion,which,
under phenomenological analysis, highlights the situational and
interpretive nature of perceptual appearance. PCT helps account
for this by showing that prediction updates are primarily driven
by foveal sensory inputs, while peripheral signals contribute
minimally to the model revision ( Otten et al., 2016 ). This
suggests that detailed visual information at the focus of attention
serves as an anchor point for the broader perceptual ﬁeld,
resulting in uniformity illusions based on incomplete prediction
error resolution. Furthermore, recent developments in PCT have
extended its explanatory reach to more temporally complex
structures, including Husserlian time-consciousness and the
layeringofmetacognitiveattention,withintheframeworkofactive
inference (Bogotá and Djebbara, 2023). While such models are
still in early stages of development, they point to promising
lines of convergence between phenomenological insight and
computationalmodeling.Inthislight,PCTappearsespeciallywell-
positioned to contribute to a scientiﬁcally tractable account of
consciousness – one that remains grounded in the structures of
livedexperienceratherthanabstractedfromthem.
Most notably, PCT’s modeling framework is marked by a high
degree of versatility, owing to its foundation in hierarchical active
inference. This structural adaptability opens the door to various
computational applications, including its integration into machine
Frontiersin Psychology 18 frontiersin.org
Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
learning architectures. For example, the hybrid predictive coding
model developed byTscshantz et al. (2023)illustrates one way in
which PCT principles can inform artiﬁcial systems modeled on
aspects of natural cognition. Importantly, such implementations
need not rely exclusively on neural networks. As shown in
computational neurophenomenology research byRamstead et al.
(2022), the same inferential principles can be formalized as a
hierarchyofBayesianprocesses,underscoringtheﬂexibilityofPCT
in modeling conscious-likebehavior within diverse theoreticaland
technologicalcontexts.
This structural ﬂexibility also points to a deeper conceptual
connection between PCT and Perceptual Reality Monitoring
(PRM), a framework that may be interpreted as an extension of
HOT. Like PCT, PRM employs hierarchical Bayesian inference
to model conscious perception (Dijkstra et al., 2022). A related
model, Higher-Order State Space (HOSS) model, shares this
hierarchical architecture and oﬀers a probabilistic account of
how perceptual states are monitored and evaluated. While
HOSS may initially resemble Signal Detection Theory (SDT) in
tracking “correct representations” through probabilistic inference,
itdepartssigniﬁcantlybypositingastructuredhierarchyofhigher-
order abstract states, something that is not required by SDT
(Fleming, 2020). This contrast mirrors the distinction between
GWT and HOT, in which the latter introduces additional levels
of metacognitive representation (see text footnote
20 for further
discussion on the link between GWT and SDT). Given these
structural parallels, it is plausible that elements such as volitional
selectiveattentioncouldbeincorporatedintopredictiveprocessing
frameworks, further enriching the interface between PCT and
higher-ordertheoriesofconsciousness.
Interestingly, PCT and IIT oﬀer complementary perspectives
on conscious systems. Whereas PCT articulates principles that are
realized through the system’s ongoing inferential dynamics, IIT
deﬁnesconsciousnessintermsofastructuralproperty—integrated
information, denoted as/Phi1—which quantiﬁes the system’s causal
irreducibility. Despite these diﬀerences, the two frameworks are
notmutuallyexclusive.IfasystemoperatingunderPCTprinciples
is suﬃciently causal (i.e. capable of computing the transition
probabilitiesofitsowninternalstatesovertime),theninprinciple,
its /Phi1value can also be computed. This opens up the possibility of
applyingPCTandIITintandem,providedthatthesystemexhibits
bothdynamicinferenceandstablecausalarchitecture.Indeed,such
integration has already been explored in simulation studies. For
example, the animat model presented inLundbak Olesen et al.
(2023) simultaneously applies the Free Energy Principle and IIT
to a single artiﬁcial agent, calculating both surprisal and integrated
information within the same framework. While computing /Phi1

5.4 Cases of integrative approaches
Let us now turn to research that resonates with the integrative
orientation proposed in this paper. A notable example is
Adam Safron’s Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of
consciousness (Safron, 2020, 2022). IWMT builds on and extends
the foundations of existing theories—most notably GWT, PCT,
and IIT—to articulate a more comprehensive framework. At its
core, IWMT emphasizes autonomy, or agentic causation, as the
basis for consciousness, arguing that conscious systems must not
only model their environments but also actively regulate their
engagement with them. In this view, consciousness emerges as
the experience of being a system that generates and updates its
world model in a causally, temporally, and spatially coherent
manner. These models serve to guide perception and action
while minimizing prediction error. IWMT thus conceptualizes
consciousness as the subjective perspective of a self-organizing,
informational entity – a world model that maintains internal
coherence and environmental adaptability. This perspective not
only helps bridge PCT and IIT but also addresses a common
criticism of predictive processing accounts: namely, the lack of a
clearly speciﬁed connection between generative models and the
phenomenologyofsubjectiveexperience.
To realize these ideas computationally, IWMT introduces
self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs), dynamical structures
that emerge from the synchronization of neural activity. SOHMs
fulﬁll core functional requirements of PCT by implementing
hierarchical predictive inference, while also aligning with the
central tenets of IIT by enabling integration across the system’s
causal structure. At the same time, SOHMs support key features
of G(N)WT by amplifying and broadcasting information across
distributed neural assemblies, enabling large-scale coordination.
Functionally, they operate as attractor states or eigenmodes that
facilitate resonance, signal enhancement, and global access –
serving as plausible substrates for phase transitions or ignition
events that mark transitions into conscious awareness. In this
way, IWMT oﬀers a cohesive account that links the architectural
mechanisms emphasized in IIT, PCT, and GWT, presenting them
ascomplementaryfacetsofalargerexplanatorystructure.
The notion of autonomy at the heart of IWMT also reﬂects a
deeperlineageinbiologicallyinspiredtheoriesofconsciousness.In
particular, Gerald Edelman’s Theory of Neuronal Group Selection
(TNGS),atheorygroundedinNeuralDarwinism,canbeseenasan
intellectualprecursortoPCT.TNGShighlightshowenvironmental
interaction and selection shape neural development, emphasizing
thatthebrainevolvesnotmerelythroughinternalmechanismsbut
in active exchange with the world (Edelman, 1987, 1993). While
TNGS itself does not originate from phenomenological concerns,
its stress on embodiment and ecological embeddedness resonates
withmanyoftheinsightsforegroundedinthispaper.
Meanwhile, Bennett et al. (2024) propose an approach that
aligns closely with phenomenological perspectives. Instead of
assuming the existence of abstract mental states and thereby
accepting a dualistic representational model that separates
animal and environment, they conceive consciousness as a
natural extension of biological life – that is, a phenomenon
that emerges from the self-organization of embodied agents
interacting continuously with their environment. Grounded
in pancomputational enactivism—the view that the emergent
properties of mind, as situated in the world, can be understood
in computational or logical terms—their study reconstructs the
Frontiersin Psychology 19 frontiersin.org
Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
emergence of consciousness through mathematical and logical
formalism. This framework oﬀers insight into how consciousness
originates from physical embodiment and environmental
engagement. Interpreted through the lens of phenomenology,
their account reveals how more complex forms of consciousness,
including higher-order stages, can be traced back to a primordial
layerofpre-reﬂectiveself-awareness.
At the same time, their work draws conceptually from
self-organization, a principle shared with IWMT’s emphasis on
autonomy, while also adopting the active inference framework
at the heart of wide PCT. The central claim is that biological
systems, unlike inert physical systems, are dissipative structures
thatmaintainthemselvesbyactivelyresistingentropy.Thisprocess
of self-organization enables them to interpret sensory information
hierarchically, based on internal needs and aﬀective valence.
Through this, organisms generate behavioral policies that diﬀer
according to the qualitative features of information processing –
what the authors term “qualitative classiﬁers.” These processes
are deeply embedded in natural selection, favoring systems that
are better able to intervene in the world. Thus, the authors
argue that subjective aspects of consciousness, such as feelings
and motivations, are emergent properties of these adaptive,
self-organizingsystems.
Importantly, the study maintains that Phenomenal
consciousness is grounded in the dynamics of self-organizing
systems and originates from lower-level processes such as
homeostatic regulation and basic sensation. These foundational
systems form the experiential basis from which higher-order
forms of consciousness, such as metacognition and reﬂective
self-awareness,emerge.Accordingly,higher-orderconsciousnessis
not autonomous; it is contingent upon the existence of ﬁrst-order
selfhood. Without such foundational systems, an organism would
lack not only reﬂective capacities but qualitative experience
altogether. In short, metacognitive awareness alone is insuﬃcient
to account for Phenomenal consciousness. While posing a
substantial challenge to HOT, this argument also points toward
a potential reconciliation: one in which higher-order processes
are not abandoned, but rather recontextualized as emerging
from the embodied and inferential dynamics highlighted by
PCT, oﬀering a richer account of consciousness grounded in
hierarchicalprocessing.
Singhal and Srinivasan (2024) likewise advocate grounding
scientiﬁc theories in phenomenological ﬁndings, focusing on
consciousness as the lived sense of the present: the feeling
of presence or temporal immediacy through which subjective
experience unfolds in time. On this view, diﬀerent theories
of consciousness can be understood as capturing distinct
aspects of how consciousness unfolds across time. Rather than
seeking a single correct model, their approach reframes the
debate: consciousness is not a static or uniﬁed entity but
a temporally layered process, one that demands integration
across multiple explanatory perspectives. Speciﬁcally, the authors
propose a nested hierarchical paradigm inspired by temporal
phenomenology (Singhal and Srinivasan, 2021). This framework
suggests that consciousness operates simultaneously on multiple
timescales,fromﬂeetingsensoryimpressionstosustainedepisodes
of awareness. It echoes Husserl’s tripartite model of time-
consciousness—primal impression, retention, and protention
(Husserl, 1991, p. 28–35)—in proposing that each temporal layer
corresponds to distinct cognitive functions, such as present-
centered perception, memory of the immediate past, and
anticipation of the near future. By integrating these layers, the
model captures the dynamic, ﬂowing nature of consciousness
into a temporally extended ﬁeld in which past, present, and
future remain continuously linked. Grounding this view in
phenomenological insight allows the framework to move beyond
reductive accounts of consciousness, oﬀering instead a richer
and more temporally textured understanding of how diﬀerent
aspects of cognition contribute to the uniﬁed experience of the
presentmoment.
To sum up, integrating multiple theories of consciousness
is not an impossible task in principle. In fact, a more thorough
and comprehensive understanding of conscious phenomena
is likely to emerge when their respective explanations are
considered from a broader perspective. Since each theory
oﬀers a distinct and legitimate account of the speciﬁc
aspects it targets, identifying ways to fully leverage their
explanatory strengths is essential, particularly if we are
to approach consciousness as a whole as a viable subject of
scientiﬁcinquiry.
6 Concluding remarks
The role of philosophy in empirical science is to delineate the
object of inquiry with maximal conceptual clarity. It establishes
the foundations of meaning and integrates them with empirical
frameworks, ensuring that scientiﬁc methods are applied to the
appropriate domain. This is especially vital in the study of
consciousness, where the risk of misidentifying the explanandum
is particularly high. Empirical theories of consciousness must
remainaccountabletophenomenologicalﬁndings.Anytheorythat
disregards the structures of lived experience cannot provide a
valid account of conscious phenomena. The target of explanation
must beconsciousness itself, not merelyneural activity in the brain
described in representational terms. The essence of consciousness
lies in subjectivity – the immediate, lived sense of experience
that is given to us prior to abstraction. It is not reducible to
qualia alone, nor is it captured solely through mechanisms of
access. While transcending the Hard Problem remains the greatest
challenge in the science of consciousness, it is important to
recognize that qualia by themselves cannot account for the full
structure of experience. Paradoxically, IIT, while committed to
explaining qualia, ends up neglecting the functional architecture
of conscious mental processes. This limitation is even more
pronounced in more overtly reductionist theories such as GWT
andHOT.
Theselimitationsarenotmerelytechnicalbutpointtoadeeper
conceptual fragmentation in how consciousness is approached
across disciplines. If we are to move forward, what is needed is not
just better models, but a more integrative perspective that remains
attentive to the full range of conscious experience.Rather than
competing, the various empirical theories of consciousness must now
move toward integration.For instance, Phenomenal consciousness
and Access consciousness are not mutually exclusive; they are
interdependent dimensions of conscious phenomena. A uniﬁed
Frontiersin Psychology 20 frontiersin.org
Pae 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1571098
framework that accounts for both is essential if we are to truly
understand what consciousness is. I do not suggest that theoretical
integration will miraculously resolve the enduring challenges of
consciousness research. However, I hope this work contributes
to shifting the discourse away from adversarial opposition and
toward a more collaborative landscape, one in which the strengths
of distinct theories can be brought into mutual alignment and
constructive dialogue. While phenomenology may not be the
ultimatekeythatunlocksallaspectsofconsciousmentalproperties
(andreﬂectiveanalysisremindsusthateventhephenomenological
attitude itself may at times be something to bracket!), we must
be careful not to trivialize consciousness into mere operational
constructs,norallowourtheoreticalcommitmentstoobscurewhat
is most evident. Rather than ﬁxating on a particular theoretical
paradigm, we should, in the spirit of Husserl’s call to“return to the
things themselves”, begin from the phenomena of conscious life as
theyaregiven.
