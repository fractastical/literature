Abstract 
In a framed-tube tall building, shear wall systems are the most efficient structural systems for increasing the lateral load 
resistance. A novel and simple mathematical model is developed herein which calculates the natural frequencies of such 
tall buildings. The analyses are based on a continuous model, in which a tall building structure is replaced by an idealized 
cantilever beam that em bodies all relevant structural characteristics. Governing equations and the corresponding eigen -
problem are derived based on the energy method and Hamilton’s principle. Solutions are obtained for three examples; 
using the separation of variables technique implemented in MATLAB. The results are compared to SAP2000 full model 
analysis; and they indicate reasonable accuracy. The computed natural frequencies for structures 50, 60 and 70 storey 
buildings were over-estimate 7, 11 and 14 percent respectively. The computed errors indicate that the proposed method 
has acceptable accuracy; and can be used during the initial stages of designing of tall buildings; it is fast and low cost 
computational process.

1. Introduction 
Tall building developments have been rapidly increasing worldwide. One of the most critical issues in tall 
buildings is choosing proper structural form to resist lateral loads. Lateral deformation must be severely controlled, 
that inhabitant feels comfort and to prevent damages to second -grade structural elements. Another vital point in tall 
buildings’ design is the dynamic analysis of these structures that is very important because of their more flexibility and 
consequently increases of vibrational amplitu de and the fact that the dynamic characteristic of structures is mainly 
governed by their natural frequencies [1-2]. Therefore, dynamic parameters calculation of tall buildings is essential for 
primary designing. Dynamic parameters such as vibrational freq uencies and mode shapes can be calculated by 
numerical methods such as finite element. While these numerical methods are used for final designing, approximate 
methods are very effective for primary designing. Approximate methods can help the designer in ca ses such as initial 
design when dimensions of some constructional members are not specified, comparison of achieved results with more 
advanced numerical methods, and finally specifying of structural dynamic behaviour which leads to better designing.  
One of the most ordinary approximate methods for dynamic parameters calculation of tall buildings is “continuum 
method” in which the tall building’s structure is substituted by a continuum beam, adopting Euler –Bernoulli or 
Timoshenko beam theory as the design t ool [3]. Considering different kinds of parameters in the substituted beam can 
help the designer to achieve natural frequencies and mode shapes with more accuracy. For resistant of high -rise

buildings subjected to lateral loadings, framed tube, rigid frame , braced frame, shear wall or coupled shear walls can 
be considered. The framed tube is an economic and ordinary form for wide ranges of tall buildings. The most primary 
type of framed tube includes four frame panel vertical on each other; this system cons ists of closely spaced perimeter 
columns tied at each floor level by deep spandrel beams to form a tubular structure. The framed tube structure can be 
considered to be composed of: (1) two web panels parallel to the direction of the lateral load, (2) two f lange panels 
normal to the direction of the lateral load. Framed tube behaviour is similar to a cantilever beam, and the columns in 
two parallel sides of the neutral axis function tensile and pressed [4]. Besides, frames parallel with lateral load under 
bending resulted from lateral loads indicate shear behaviour [5]. Tavakoli et al.  [6-7] studied the seismic performance 
of outrigger -belt truss system subjected to the earthquake and blast load using finite element and component -mode 
synthesis. 
Several methods have been presented to analyze framed tube structures. Coull and Bose (1975) presented a method 
based on elasticity theory [8]. Coull and Ahmad (1978) presented a method for the achievement of position changes of 
the circumferential frame [9]. Kwan (199 4) by using equal orthotropic planes,  energy method and  elasticity theory, 
presented equations for determining stress in columns and also for achievement of lateral deflection of the framed tube 
[4]. As the most studies of tall buildings directed toward an alysis, Alavi et al. (2018, a, b) proposed simplified 
methods which are suitable for the preliminary design of high -rise structures [10 -11]. About free vibration of tall 
buildings, different types of research have been done by several researchers, that in most of them the vibration of the 
structures is modelled as the vibration of a cantilever beam [12 -14]. Many researchers have studied fundamental 
frequencies of tall buildings [15 -17]. Kaviani et al. (2008) carried out an approximate method for determining  the 
natural periods of multistory buildings subjected to earthquake [16]. In this article, based on a continuum approach 
and Hamilton’s principle, a simple mathematical method for calculation of natural frequencies of the combined system 
of the framed t ube and shear wall is presented. In particular, Mohammadnejad and Haji Kazemi in several research 
investigated the natural frequencies of the framed tube structures in more details, considering the effects of shear lag 
phenomena [18-20].  
There are compoun d and various structural systems for increasing efficiency of framed tube buildings. A more 
uniform distribution of axial stress in flange and web frames, and also a decrease in the values of deflection at the 
highest level of structures could be obtained using the mega bracing system [21], shear walls shear core, and also 
outrigger-belt trusses in the frame tube structures [22 -23]. The system which is considered in this article is a combined 
system of the framed tube and shear wall. When framed tube and sh ear wall system subjected to lateral loads, the 
shear wall deforms in bending form with downward concavity and with maximum gradient. Interaction of forces 
causes that shear wall to restrain deflection of frames in bases, and framed tube is like a restrain  for the shear wall 
above structure. Therefore, deflection of the construction decreases. In the recent decade, studies about analysis of free 
vibration of the frame with shear wall have been done. Kuang (2001) based on continuum method and D’Alembert’s 
principle achieved governing differential equations of free vibration of structures with the symmetrical shear wall [24]. 
Wang (2005) presented an equation for computing the natural vibration of buildings with coupled shear walls which is 
proved to be the fo urth-order Sturm–Liouville differential equation, and a hand method for determining the first two 
periods of natural vibration of the buildings. Also, to determine the first natural frequency of these structures, a 
relation has been suggested [25]. In cont inuance of previous studies, Bozdogan and Ozturk represented an 
approximate method based on the continuum approach and transfer matrix method for free vibration analysis of multi -
bay coupled shear walls [26]. Kamgar and Rahgozar (2019) used energy method a s a robust method to compute the 
roof displacement and axial forces of columns in tall buildings reinforced with a framed tube and outrigger system 
[27].  
Although free vibration analysis of framed tube system and shear -walled frame has been studied extens ively over 
the past few decades, there have been few research efforts related to determining vibrational characteristics of the 
combined system of framed tube and shear -wall system. Therefore, to fill in the gap, in this study, a simple analytical 
method for calculating natural frequencies of the combined system of framed tube and shear walls is presented. On the 
basis of the continuum approach, framed tube and shear walls are replaced by an equivalent cantilever beam located at 
the mass center. It should b e noted that the first natural frequency of any structure has an important issue in 
determining the linear and nonlinear response of structures subjected to the dynamic loads. On the other hand, 
calculating the values of natural frequencies of structures u sing numerical methods is computationally expensive. 
Therefore, the main aim of this paper is related to calculate the natural frequency of tall buildings that consist of 
framed tube and shear walls using simple analytical methods. The three -dimensional st ructure is replaced by an 
equivalent beam. For this purpose, Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the governing equation of a combined 
system. Then the characteristic equation is obtained by applying the boundary conditions. The characteristic equation 
is solved to calculate the natural frequency. Several numerical examples are solved, and the results are compared with 
those obtained from SAP2000 and other work. Finally, the results show the ability of the proposed method in 
comparison with the other methods.

2. Lagrange’s Equations For Combined System Of Framed Tube And Shear Wall 
In this section a simple mathematical method for calculation of natural frequencies of a combined system of framed 
tube and shear walls is presented based on the works done by Kwan (1994); Malekinejad and Rahgozar (2010) [4, 28]. 
Kwan (1994) proposed a model for the analysis of framed tube structures; those following assumptions are considered 
for modelling the framed tube system by using equivalent orthotropic plates [4]:  
 The material of the structures is homogenous, isotropic and obeys Hooke’s law. 
 Spacing of beams and columns are uniform throughout the building height.  
 3-The floor slabs of tall buildings are not deformable in their planes and have no motion perpendicular to their 
planes. 
 The structure is assumed symmetric in plan and height and cannot twist. 
 All beams and columns are uniforms along with the building height. 
The kinetic (Equation 1) and potential energies (Equation 2) of the considered dynamic system are written as 
follows [29]:

In which y(x, t) is displacement and S(x) is the shear stiffness GA(x). In which G is the shear modulus, and A(x) is the 
cross-sectional area. 
The function A is in the form of L integral, between two arbitrary times of

Hamilton’s principle represents that A has a stationary value expressed as

 Hamilton’s principle can be written in the following form [28]:

Using properties of

 Differential equations of motion known as the Lagrange’s equation, 
 Boundary displacements,

At this step, the integrand in Eq uation 6 should be transformed into one containing only  𝛿𝑦. Therefore, this 
equation is integrated by part, both respect to space and time. After simplification, one can obtain:

By replacing Equation 5 into Equation 7, the following equation with a series of boundary conditions is derived:

Using the method of separation of variable and let
 y( x,t ) Y( x ) T(t ) , two equations can be obtained. The

Values of EI, S and m can be determined by applying the boundary conditions Equations 13 to 16. These boundary 
conditions are related to the displacement value at the bottom of the structure ( 𝑌(𝑛=0)), the value of rotation at the 
bottom of the structure ( 𝑌′(𝑛=0)), shear force ( [𝑌" − 𝛾2𝑌′]|𝑛=1) and bending moment ( 𝑌"|𝑛=1) values at the top of the 
structure.

The Y function is considered as follows to obtain a solution for the governing equation (Equation 10):

Therefore, the solutions of the equation (Equation 10) will be as follows by considering Equation 17:

By substituting the values of EI, S and m for each of the structure into the Eq uations 11 and 12,

numerical examples 50, 60 and 70 storey tall buildings. Comparison of computer analysis results (SAP2000) with the 
proposed method are listed in Table 4.

approximate method and SAP 2000 may be lead from followings: all closely spaced perimeter columns tied at each 
floor level by deep spandrel beams are modelled as a tubular structure, the equivalent elastic properties for GA and EI 
and neglecting the effect of shear lag in the approximate method have been used.  
Also the results for 60 and 70 storey tall buildings with shear walls are compared with the research carried out by 
Rahgozar et al. using B-spline functions [30]. As shown in  Table (5), the natural frequencies calculated by the 
proposed approximate method are overestimated by 15 and 9 percent for 60 and 70 storey building respectively.

4. Conclusion 
Natural frequencies and mode -shapes play an important role in structural design of tall buildings. Especially the 
first natural mode; since it is the dominant component in response of a tall building to earthquake or wind loading. In 
this article, an appro ximate method for free vibration analysis of the combined system of framed tube and shear walls 
was presented. In the proposed method, the structure is modelled as a cantilever hollow box with equivalent structural 
characteristics. The governing differential equation was derived by energy method and Hamilton’s principle. Applying 
appropriate boundary conditions, natural frequencies of the combined system of framed tube and shear walls were 
obtained. Comparing to results from comprehensive finite element mod els; the proposed method overestimate the first 
natural frequency by 7% for the 50 -storey, 11% for the 60 -storey, and 14% for the 70 -storey building. Differences are 
within acceptable ranges for a quick estimate. Hence, the proposed method may reliably be used for free vibration

analysis of framed tube tall buildings reinforced by shear walls. The proposed method is simple, accurate, economical, 
reliable, and especially suitable for use during the preliminary design; where a large number of structures with 
different features need to be analyzed.
