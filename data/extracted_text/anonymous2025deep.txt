Abstract 
The context for our paper comes from the neurophenomenology (NPh) research programme initiated by Francisco Varela at the end 
of the 1990s. Varela’s working hypothesis was that, to be successful, a consciousness research programme must progress by relating 
first-person phenomenological accounts of the structure of experience and their third-person counterparts in neuroscience through 
“mutual constraints”. Leveraging Bayesian mechanics, in particular deep parametric active inference, we demonstrate the potential 
for epistemically advantageous mutual constraints between phenomenological, computational, behavioural, and physiological vocab-
ularies. Specifically, the dual information geometry of Bayesian mechanics serves to establish, under certain conditions, generative 
passage between lived experience and its physiological instantiation. This paper argues for the epistemological necessity of such a 
passage and the inclusion of trained reflective awareness in neurophenomenological empirical approaches. In particular, it showcases 
incremental explanatory gains for the scientist that arise from incorporating the participants’ epistemic insights, shifting the focus 
from the contents of experience (i.e. what a subject experiences in a given experimental set-up) to the how of experience (i.e. the 
activities of consciousness that allow for a meaningful world to appear to us as such in live d experience). The explanatory power of the
resulting ‘meta-Bayesian’ framework, deep computational NPh, arises from the disciplined circulation between first and third-person
perspectives enabled by the formalism of deep parametric active inference, where parametric depth refers to a property of generative
models that can form beliefs about the parameters of their own modelling process. Hence, this computational formalism contributes
to understanding consciousness by bridging phenomenological descriptions and physiological instantiations, whilst also highlighting
the significance of trained first-person investigation in experimental protocols.

Introduction 
The field of consciousness science has been dominated by at least 
four theories: higher-order theories, global workspace theories, 
recurrent processing, and integrated information theory . Propo-
nents of these theories have designed multiple experiments that
aim to put these four theories into competition with each other
(
Seth and Bayne 2022) and researchers have steadily gathered an 
abundance of empirical data. Nevertheless, significant uncertain-
ties remain about how to interpret this data, and so far no clear 
winner has emerged in the competition among these differe nt
theories. There is also little reason to believe this situation will
change in the future (
Negro 2024). Moreover, it has been shown 
that the different theories make methodological choices in the 
design of their experiments that determine the results of these
experiments (
Yaronet al.2022), though this challenge has recently 
been addressed through adversarial collaborations (Olcese et al. 
2021, Consortium et al. 2023). 
In this paper, we outline a different way forward for the 
science of consciousness that starts from a methodology for 
building a bridge between first-person and third-person ways 
of knowing consciousness. Our p roposal is not new but builds on
the neurophenomenology (NPh) research programme developed
by
Varela (1996, 1997). The working hypothesis of NPh is that 
consciousness research necessitates, and is accelerated by , the 
employment of first-person phenomenological methods to obtain
rigorous and refined first-person data. Instead of testing theories

of consciousness that aim to identify the difference between 
conscious and non-conscious information processing, the aim of 
this research programme is to build neurobiological explanations 
of first-person experience, informed b y a fruitful and ongoing
circulation of knowledge between disciplined phenomenological
inquiry in trained subjects and neurobiology .
This research programme explicitly requires training in first-
person methods inspired by phenomenological philosophy 
and mindfulness meditation practices to explore the field of
conscious phenomena (Varela 1996). These practices involve the 
systematic training of attention and the recognition of features 
and structures of experience which ordinarily go unnoticed, 
such as the affective tone, fluctuations of attention or degree 
of subjective realism. This training is therefore required to obtain
refined and rigorous phenomenological analyses and descriptions
of experience that otherwise would remain unavailable for verbal
report (
Lutz and Thompson 2003, Berkovich-Ohana et al. 2020, 
Timmermann et al. 2023). Training can provide subjects with 
the ability to provide disciplined descriptions of these structures 
of lived experience that can guide and inform the interpre-
tation of empirical data. Thus , first-person accounts of the
structure of experience and empirical data relate to each other
through ‘mutual constraints’ (
Varela 1996, p. 343). While the 
methodological aspect of these mutual constraints has been
illustrated with empirical proof-of-concepts (Lutz 2002, Garrison 
et al. 2013, Petitmengin et al. 2013, Dor-Ziderman et al. 2016, 
Berkovich-Ohana et al. 2020, Timmermann et al. 2023) a n d 
discussed in clinical contexts ( Kyzar and Denfield 2023), its 
theoretical ambitions for consciousness researc h to ‘naturalize
phenomenology’ (Varela 1997, Petitot et al. 2000, Lutz 2002, 
Thompson 2007, Bitbol 2021, Ramstead et al. 2022) have received 
less traction and are still debated. This is in part due to the 
challenge of building a bridge between phenomenology and 
neur obiology that allows for the circulation between distinct first
and third-person ways of knowing consciousness.
We propose that the solution to this problem, alr eady identi-
fied by Varela (1997), lies in formal models that allow for what 
Varela called a ‘generative passage’ between the mathematical,
phenomenological and neurobiological domains (Varela 1997). A 
passage is said to be ‘generative’ when there is ‘mutual cir cu-
lation and illumination’ between these three domains (Varela 
1997, p. 372). Formal models can provide a metaphysically neutral 
vocabulary that can connect the distinct domains of first-person 
lived experience (as accessed through phenomenological meth-
ods and contemplative practices) and the n eurobiological pro-
cesses correlated with conscious experience (as measured using
the techniques of cognitive neuroscience).
Varela (1997) talked of 
‘passages’ in the plural because of the overlap between the three 
domains of knowledge. We talk about passage in the singular 
to refer to the pragmatic circulation that formal models make
possible between first-person phenomenological descriptions and
third-person neurobiological data (see
Fig. 2). 
Recently , a novel approach to generative passage has been 
proposed under the label‘computational phenomenology’ (Ram-
stead et al. 2022, see also Sandved-Smith et al. 2021, Bogotá and 
Djebbara 2023). Computational phenomenology uses generative 
modelling techniques to furnish the formal models for connecting 
phenomenology and biologically plausible inferential processes. 
A generative model provides a probabilistic mapping from some 
data of interest to infer the latent causes that best explain this 
data. In a nutshell, computational phenomenology leverages gen-
erative models to formalize phenomenological descriptions and
analyses of lived experience.
We have three aims in this paper that extend this research 
programme. First, we will demonstra te how Bayesian mechanics,
a ‘physics of beliefs’ (Ramstead et al. 2023), has a dual charac-
ter that allows for the circulation between descriptions of first-
person experiences and neurobiolog ical data, i.e. gathered by
measuring brain activity .
Second, we motivate a move to what we will call a ‘deep 
computational NPh’. This move is enabled by appealing to a 
particular kind of belief updating that rests upon hierarchical 
generative models with parametric depth. Parametric depth has a 
special meaning here. It implies a generative model in which the 
parameters of a probability distribution over one variable depend 
upon another variable. This mechanism gives rise to beliefs about 
the parameters of other beliefs and will be introduced further
below. In short, this shifts the focus from the contents of the
posterior representation to the dynamics of the process by which
the posterior is inferred. We will refer to this inference as ‘deep
(parametric) active inference’ or ‘deep inference’ for short.
This approach to formally modelling first-person experience 
broadens the scope of the neuroscience of consciousness by shift-
ing the focus from the contents of experience (i.e. what a sub-
ject experiences in a given experimental set-up) to the how of 
experience—the phenomenological structures of consciousness 
that describe how a meaningful world is given to us in lived 
experience (We offer a further clarification o f this distinction
between the contents of experience, and how objects are given
to a subject in their lived experience below). We thus make a
contrast with the neural correlates of consciousness research
programme (
Seth and Bayne 2022), which we will argue is exclu-
sively concerned with the contents of conscious experience (i.e. 
the what of experience). What contemplative practices share in 
common with the phenomenological method is that they both 
offer practical techniques for bringing our first-person experi-
ences that we unreflectively live through into the foreground of 
our awareness. The how of experience would otherwise remain in 
the background of our awareness so long as we remain involved 
with our experience and their objects by living through them. For 
instance, when one consciously hears a sound, one is also at the 
same time aware—intransitively , pre-reflectively and passively— 
of being the one to have heard it, the experience’s affective 
tone, or one’s quality of attention. To gain access to the how 
of first-person experience requires training in phenomenological 
methods and/or contemplative practices. We will refer to methods 
for actively directing our attention towards the how of experience 
as ‘dereifying’ techniques. We describe how deep active infer-
ence can be used to model the reports about the how,thereby
enabling generative passage between the domains of first-person
knowledge of subjective experience and third-person empirical
data about neurophysiological activity . Deep parametric models
enable generative passage because they have a dual character of
modelling, on the one hand, thehowof first-person lived experi-
ence; and on the other, the underlying neurophysiological activity
taking place in the subjects engaged in the NPh experiment.
Finally , we will unpack how deep computational NPh can be 
practically applied in the context of empirical consciousness 
research and demonstrate the pragmatic prerequisite for trained 
participants. Importantly , the explanatory gain made through 
deep computational NPh is not accomplished by deep parametric 
modelling or the phenomenological method considered on their 
own. We do not propose deep parametric modelling as the basis
for developing a theory of how the brain generates conscious
experience. Nor do we leverage deep parametric models to explain
the difference between conscious and non-conscious processing,
Deep computational neurophenomenology | 3
as is common in the literature on the neural correlates of con-
sciousness. Our aim is instead to use deep parametric models 
to enable generative passage between the first-person data of 
trained participants in a NPh experiment, and the third-person 
data gathered using techniques in neuroscience of consciousness.
Without this ‘triple braid’ circulation between phenomenological,
computational and physiological domains, the how of experience
would remain that ‘for which we have no name’ (see
Husserl 1991, 
p. 79).
Computational neur ophenomenology
Phenomenology is concerned with a priori conditions of the 
possibility of the cognition of any object whatsoe ver, including
the objects of scientific investigation (Husserl 1970). The neuro-
science of consciousness is concerned with the neurocognitive 
mechanisms underlying conscious experience. In what follows 
we assume that neither phenomenology nor neuroscience is 
more basic or epistemologically fundamental in understanding 
and characterizing the nature o f consciousness. They are better
viewed as distinct methods for investigating consciousness
whose findings are not reducible to one another (
Gallagher and 
Zahavi 2007, Gallagher 2022). Phenomenology and neuroscience 
provide different ways of knowing consciousness; they investigate 
different research questions, and operate with fundamentally
different vocabularies for describing consciousness (Gallagher 
and Zahavi 2007). NPh holds that both forms of evidence— 
phenomenological and scientific—are of equal importance in the 
investigation of consciousness. For instance, using the methods 
of phenomenology , we can identify phenomena that stand in 
need of explanation by neurobiologists by bringing into view 
that which would otherwise remain unobservable using third-
person methods. The participant’s training allows them to acquire 
insights into their own mind that can, in turn, facilitate new
explanatory insights for the scientist. In summary , NPh offers a
method for bringing about a circulation between these otherwise
essentially different, first- and third-person ways of knowing
subjective experience.
Computational NPh proposes to build bridges between phe-
nomenology and neurobiology by constructing computational 
models derived f rom the mathematics of the free energy prin-
ciple (FEP) (
Parr et al. 2022). Under the FEP , the Markov blanket 
formalism provides a mathematical description of the partition 
separating and coupling the organism to its environment (Fris-
ton 2019). A Markov blanket specifies the boundary or interface 
between two sets of random variables that are conditionally 
independent of one another. More concretely , the Markov blanket 
can be interpreted as formalizing the autopoietic boundary of the 
organism, including its sensory and active states (i.e. the states
that are causally affected by the environment and the states that
causally affect the environment respectively).
One of the main claims of the FEP framework is that, to 
maintain its separation from the environment, the organism must 
revisit a set of unsurprising states specified by its phenotype. 
It would be surprising for a fish to find itself outside of water 
because, given its phenotype, it must remain in water to stay 
alive. We will refer to the unsurprising or characteristic states 
that specify the system’s phenotype as the system’s ‘attracting 
set’. Ho w surprising a given state is can be quantified by an
information-theoretic quantity known as ‘surprisal’. From this
perspective, for it to remain viable, the organism must minimize
surprisal. However, surprisal is often intractable (
Parr et al. 2022, 
p. 27), therefore self-organizing systems are understood to 
maintain integrity by minimizing the ‘variational free energy’, 
an upper bound on surprisal. In this way , the FEP can be 
understood as a ‘principle of least surprisal’, from which a 
Bayesian mec hanics of thing-like systems can be derived (For
a detailed treatment of the logic and derivations of the FEP we
refer the readers to
Friston 2019, Friston et al. 2022). 
Bayesian mechanics is a set of equations of motion derived 
from the FEP that allows one to model the dynamics of stochastic 
systems that estimate posterior probability distributions over the 
causes of their sensory states. More precisely , it describes how the 
states of such systems—and the beliefs parameterized by those 
states—evolve, which can be described by their trajectories on 
statistical manifolds (i.e. on a mathematical space where each 
point represents a probability distribution). Active inference, the 
modelling framework employe d here, refers to a specific applica-
tion of Bayesian mechanics to agentic systems whose particular
partition is such that the path of active states performs ‘active’
inference, i.e. such systems engage in autonomous actions in
order to minimize ‘expected free energy’ (
Fig. 1). 
We are proposing a computational approach to NPh that uses 
the mathematics of the FEP to derive a generative model that 
formally describes the structur es of lived experience described
by the trained participants in an NPh experiment. Our proposal
extends
Ramstead and colleagues’ (2022) earlier proposal of what 
they call a ‘computational phenomenology’. There, they described 
how the FEP could be put to work to construct generative models 
that can model ‘the structure and dynamics of lived experience’
as described in classical phenomenology (
Ramstead et al. 2022, 
p. 843). Their main claim is that the posterior beliefs captured by 
a FEP-based model o f an individual can represent the contents
of experience. [See
Beckmann et al. (2023) for an alternative 
approach to computational phenomenology that employs deep 
learning artificial neural networks to model the structures of lived
experience as described by phenomenologists].
In deep computational NPh, we extend Ramstead and 
colleagues’ treatment in three ways. First, in their proposal, 
neuroscience was bracketed but we explicitly aim to address 
the neuro in NPh, explained f urther below. Second, we add
some clarifications about how generative models can allow
for generative passage (
Fig. 5). Third, we extend the Bayesian 
beliefs or posterior representations used to model first-person 
phenomenology to the ‘parameters’ of beliefs about external 
causes. In other words, the focus is on the processes by which 
the posterior representation is inferred (i.e. the dynamics of the 
parameters implicated in the inferential process), rather than the 
‘content’ of a posterior representation. Usually , the parameters 
in question pertain to the precision or inverse uncertainty 
encoded by the requisite high-order posterior representations. 
These parameters of the generative model can be interpreted as
describing structures or invariant features of lived experience as
they have been reported by subjects that have performed what
phenomenologists call ‘the phenomenological reduction’, or that
have gained access to those structures through the performance
of mindfulness meditation practice.
The function of the phenomenological reduction is to trigger 
a shift in the subject’s attention from the meaningful objects 
of experience to how it is possible for meaningful objects to be 
experienced. Here, the notion of reduction is not the one used 
when authors talk about scientific reductionism. Instead, it refers 
to its Latin root: reducere, ‘to bring back’. Through the phenomeno-
logical reduction, objects (the what) are brought back to their
original subjective appearance (the how), revealing an inseparable
correlation between subjectivity and the world as it is experienced

Figure 1. Representation of an active system (bacillus) partitioned from its environment. The diagram depicts the division of states in terms of the 
conditional dependencies of the states of a system x. The system is divided into internal statesμ and external states η that are set apart by a Markov 
blanket made up of sensory states s and active states a. Arrows represent the direction of influence between states with dashed lines representing one 
way influences. The autonomous and sensory states, or equivalently the Markov blanket and internal states, form a ‘particle’. A key aspect of this 
interaction is that the external states can only impact themselves and sensory states, while the internal states are restricted to influencing
themselves and the active states.
(this distinction between the what and the how of experience is
unpacked below).
Our aim in the remainder of the paper will be to use active 
inference to outline a deep computational NPh of the how of 
experience. Our proposal leverages two recent developments in 
active inference; (i) the dual aspect information geometry of 
Bayesian mechanics, which gives a first principles based account 
of the relationship between first-person experience as described 
by trained participants and neurobiological data and (ii) ‘paramet-
ric depth’, which provides a way to formalize the practice of the
phenomenological reduction or dereification, and the resulting
descriptions subjects provide of the how of first-person experi-
ence. Together these recent developments allow for the generative
passage at the heart of the neurophenomenological approach.
Mapping phenomenology to 
neurodynamics: a f irst-principles approach
Bayesian mechanics provides an explicit formal linkage between 
two equally valid interpretations of the dynamics of the internal 
states of a target system. It connects the ‘intrinsic’ dynamics of 
the internal states (e.g.brain activity) of the target system to the
‘extrinsic’ dynamics of the beliefs parameterized by the internal
states (
Friston et al. 2020, Fig. 2). The intrinsic dynamics are 
expressed in terms of the time-dependent probability densities 
of thermodynamic variables. They describe the evolution of the 
physical states of the system in terms of statistical mechanics. 
The dynamics are formalized as movements on a statistical man-
ifold or space where each point represents a probability distribu-
tion (i.e. a certain parameterization) (
Fig. 5). 
The extrinsic dynamics, on the other hand, are expressed in 
terms of Bayesian belief probability distributions and describe 
the evolution of the system’s beliefs about external states, as 
parameterized by the internal states. These belief dynamics are 
‘extrinsic’ in the sense that the beliefs are about ‘external’ states. 
Therefore, the dynamics of the systems described by the FEP 
have a ‘dual information geometry’: the internal states can either 
be described by a distribution over states of a random dynam-
ical system, or they can be understood as the parameters of a 
probability distribution or probabilistic belief. Hence, a change in 
the internal states implies a conjugate movement on both the
intrinsic and extrinsic statistical manifolds. These manifolds are
described as ‘conjugate’ in the sense that they are coupled, yet
orthogonal as they refer to conditionally independent states sep-
arated by a Markov blanket. The intrinsic manifold captures the
probability distribution over internal states, whereas the extrinsic
manifold captures the probability distribution over external states
(as parameterized by internal states).
The mutual constraints enabled by Ba yesian
mechanics
Herein lies the core value of employing Bayesian mechanics as a 
formal tool that allows for generative passage between the differ-
ent domains of first-person experience and third-person accounts 
of neurophysiology . The extrinsic aspect provides a formal lan-
guage that can be readily translated to and from first-person 
descriptions of the structures and categories of lived experiences
provided by participants that have performed the phenomeno-
logical reduction. This translation can be performed using the
methodology outlined in earlier work on computational phe-
nomenology (
Ramstead et al. 2022) because the parameters of 
a generative model describe probabilistic beliefs which amount 
to formalizations of the phenomenological descriptions of first-
person experience. Yet crucially , these parameters also have a 
mathematically grounded relationship to the intrinsic dynamics 
of the neurophysiological dynamics of these subjects. In short, 
the formalism serves as a ‘Rosetta Stone’ (Chris Fields, personal 
comm unication) that enables a translation between domains. We
can move between third-person formal descriptions arising from
neurophysiology and first-person formal descriptions given by
trained participants that have performed the phenomenological
reduction (see
Fig. 2). 
We argue therefore that Bayesian mechanics provides a formal 
bridge that allows for generative passage.Varela (1997) originally 
described generative passages in terms of a triple braid that com-
bined formal, phenomenological and neurobiological ontologies
(
Fig. 5). We use Bayesian mechanics as the formal ingredient in 
this triple braid. We take the formalism of Bayesian mechanics 
to be constrained in three ways that make it well suited to play
the role of a bridge between the ontologies of neuroscience and

Figure 2. The generative passage as a circulation between phenomenological and neurobiological data in DCNPh. The diagram at the top of the figure 
illustrates the dual aspect information geometry present in the FEP formulation of a self-organizing system. The top circle represents the statistical 
manifold which describes the intrinsic dynamics of the internal states per se, whilst the lower circle represents the statistical manifold which 
describes the extrinsic dynamics of the beliefs (about external states) parameterized by the internal states. First-person and third-person observations 
can be explained by , and provide evidence for, the extrinsic and intrinsic manifolds respectively . The overlapping area, which represents the dynamics 
of the internal states of t he system, therefore enables a generative passage between the first-person and third-person observations by virtue of being 
expressible in two conjugate parameterizations. The non-overlapping areas and meta-Bayesian explanatory cycle point to the epistemological 
open-endedness of the NPh experiment, and the way in which there is always more that can be said in describing lived experience and the processes
of the living organism.
phenomenology . (Note that in describing these constraints on 
the formalism we are not talking about the triple braid but just 
focusing on the Bayesian mechanisms as the formal element of
this braid. We return to the place of the formalism within this
braid below.)
The first of the three constraints is from the FEP formalism 
itself to the space of possible internal neurophysiological 
dynamics/states. By starting with the initial conditions of the FEP 
(namely , assuming the persistence of a system differentiated from 
its environment), the formalism provides a principled constraint 
on the possible dynamics of the internal states of a system given 
blanket states, i.e. the equations of motion derived from Bayesian 
mechanics. We view this constraint as an improvement on 
Varela’s initial proposal, which employed dynamical systems the-
ory (DST). The equations derived from DST have more degrees of 
freedom when fitting them to the particular dynamical properties 
of li ving systems. The equations derived from the FEP by contrast
emerge from first principles that describe a set of conditions that
are mandatory if a system is to maintain its integrity over time
in a changing environment. In the following section we describe
how the mathematics of the FEP can be applied at multiple scales,
from elementary self-maintaining [i.e. autopoietic (
Maturana and 
Varela 1980)] particles all the way up to conscious creatures that 
are able to be metacognitively aware (Friston et al. 2023). 
A second constraint is exerted on the model of extrinsic 
dynamics by the trained participant’s disciplined first-person 
descriptions of her lived experience. This is made possible because 
the parameters of the probabilistic beliefs can be understood as
formalizations of the descriptions the subject provides of their
own lived experiences. See (Clark et al. 2019, Sandved-Smith 
et al. 2021, Albarracin et al. 2022) for examples of mapping from 
phenomenological categories to generative model parameters. 
Descriptions of first-person phenomenology can therefore be
used to fit the parameters of the extrinsic dynamics (e.g.Smith 
et al. 2020, 2021). 
Finally , the intrinsic dynamics are constrained by the neu-
rophysiological dynamics and processes observed in a NPh 
experiment. In practice, making empirical neurodynamic pre-
dictions based on the ‘intrinsic’ dynamics—expressed mathe-
matically as movements on a statistical manifold (or conversely
fitting the intrinsic dynamics to empirical observations)—is
enabled by the accompanying neural process theory (
Friston 
et al. 2017, Parr and Friston 2018). The neural process the-
ory is an ongoing area of research that aims to understand 
how the function of the various model parameters, that
together describe the intrinsic internal state dynamics, might
be neurobiologically instantiated. For example,Parr and Friston 
(2017a), a s w e l la sSchwartenbeck et al. (2015) discuss the 
relationship between neurotransmitter concentrations and the 
encoding of second order precision beliefs.
The three constraints we have just described on the formal 
model allows for reciprocal constraints from the neurobio-
logical domain to the phenomenological one and vice versa, 
thereby enabling generative passage. The deep computational 
NPh (DCNPh) framework implies that a trained participant’s 
description of their lived experience can be taken as evidence for
a path on a statistical manifold representing the Bayesian beliefs
of this individual–provided that the description is sufficiently
6 | Sandved-Smithet al.
trustworthy . In turn, the ensuing statistical manifold provides 
a constraint on the predictions over the intrinsic dynamics of 
the physical system, yielding insights about the physiological 
states. The opposite is also true, fitting the model of the 
intrinsic dynamics to the observed evolution of the ph ysical
system provides a prediction about the evolution of the beliefs
parameterized by the physical states, and by extension, of the
phenomenology . This circularity (illustrated in
Fig. 2) highlights 
that DCNPh can be understood as an iterative process, whereby 
observations in the first-person domain influence hypothesis
testing in the third person domain, andvice versa.
Furthermore, once you have a model of the trained participant’s 
descriptions of their first-person experiences, you can then use 
this model to solicit new observations from the participants
that in turn maximize the evidence for the model ( Friston 
2023). This implies that insights of the trained participant into 
the how of their experience, which can be modelled in active 
inference terms as epistemic gain, create an epistemic advantage 
for the scientist engaged in the modelling. In other words, the
methodology can be seen as an extension of meta-Bayesian
computational phenotyping (i.e. gathering evidence for a model
of a participant’s self-evidencing process) (
Daunizeau et al. 
2010, Hohwy 2016). In summary , the dual information geometry 
underwrites a mathematically grounded formal bridge enabling 
the generative passage between phenomenology and neurobi-
ology , i.e. the evidential cycle depicted inFig. 2. In practice this 
also requires a methodology for relating the phenomenological 
and neurobiological data to the model itself, i .e. computational
phenomenology and computational neurobiology respectively ,
discussed below (see
Fig. 5). 
Note that we make no claims about whether this formalism 
can provide sufficiency criteria for the existence of phenomenal 
experience for a given system. This is to say that we are not 
proposing Bayesian mechanics as a theory of consciousness, as 
has already been noted above (see Introduction). Here we instead 
rely upon the descriptions of first-person experience provided by 
trained participants in a NPh experiment. We employ Bayesian 
mechanics as the formal bridge which allows for generative pas-
sage between first-person descriptions of subjective experience 
of the participants, and the third-person data that relates to the 
neurophysiological dynamics as they unfold while these subject’s 
perform experimental tasks . We remain neutral on the question of
whether the active inference formalism provides a theory of how
the brain gives rise to phenomenal experience. The aim of NPh is
notto directly answer the ‘hard problem’ of why experiences have
a particular qualitative character, or why there is any conscious-
ness in the physical world at all (
Chalmers 1996). NPh is a method 
for connecting the first-person knowledge of consciousness pro-
vided by phenomenology with the third-person knowledge of con-
sciousness provided by neurobiology . Bayesian mechanics offers 
formal tools, which we have argued, through the dual information
geometry , make possible the generative passage between these
otherwise distinct ways of knowing conscious experience.
So far, we have only given a first-principles argument for 
generative passage enabled by the dual geometry of Bayesian 
mechanics. Its actual empirical implementation will require addi-
tional methodological steps; in particular, the collection of reliable
evidence for both intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics.
A Bayesian mechanics of metacogniti ve systems
The mathematics of Bayesian mechanics, and by extension active 
inference models, can be applied to a range of different self-
organizing systems from bacteria all the way up to the lived 
experience of subjects who are tra ined to perform the phe-
nomenological reduction or to perform mindfulness meditation.
For instance, a subset of the systems whose dynamics conform
to the FEP exhibit what
Friston et al. (2023) have labelled 
‘conservative’ dynamics: in response to random fluctuations, the 
system will return to non-equilibrium steady-states characteristic 
of the system. The active states of a system with conservative 
dynamics are f ully determined by its sensory states. Examples of
such systems are the bacillus depicted in
Fig. 1, and homeostatic 
systems that have the function of keeping the organism in non-
equilibrium thermodynamic steady-state across its exchanges 
with its environment. There will be a high probability of finding 
the system, at any given moment, in characteristic states. These 
(attracting sets of) states underwrite the system’s homeostatic 
integrity , in the sense that the system remains within this 
attracting set for manifold. The existence of such a manifold 
(technically , a pullback attractor) means that the system is in a
non-equilibrium steady state. Another way of looking at this is
that there is a low probability of finding the system in states that
are uncharacteristic or incompatible with the system, given the
kind of system that it is.
Friston et al. (2023) call a second type of systemic dynamics, 
‘strange’ because it is found in systems that embody a deep 
hierarchical generative model that can be used by agents to infer 
their own actions. The adjective of ‘strange’ alludes to the loop, i.e. 
introduced once the agent is able to model their own actions. In 
Hofstadter’s words: ‘there is a shift from one lev el of abstraction
to another, which feels like an upward movement in a hierarchy ,
and yet somehow the successive “upward” shifts turn out to give
rise to a closed cycle’ (
Hofstadter 2007, p. 102). In strange systems, 
the internal states are conditionally independent from active and 
external states of the environment that comprise hidden causes 
the systems must infer. The system’s internal states parameterize 
beliefs about its own actions. While conservative systems act to
maintain homeostasis in the present moment, strange systems
act in the service of securing allostasis—stability through change
(
Sterling and Eyer 1988). Strange systems are capable of planning 
into the future, and their beliefs encode the sensory consequences 
of trajectories of actions. These beliefs can be used to evaluate 
the expected free energy of policies, selecting the policy whose 
outcomes are expected to minimize free energy . Expected free 
energy is a function of risk (i.e. the probability that expected 
outcomes will match one’s prior preferences) and ambiguity (i.e. 
the conditional uncertainty about sensory states given external
states). Systems that act to minimize expected free energy will
select actions that minimize the risk of outcomes that diverge
from prior preferences while also resolving ambiguity or uncer-
tainty in response to external events.
In our proposal, we focus on a third class of systems that 
build on the capacity of strange systems to model their own 
actions and make inferences about them. We will call this class
of systems ‘metacognitive’ (Da Costa and Sandved-Smith 2024, 
Sandved-Smith and Da Costa 2024) because they are able to 
change their relation to their own states so as to model the states 
themselves and how those states appear to their subjects as they 
unfold in time. In other words, such systems are endowed with the 
ability to form beliefs about their beliefs. Metacognitive systems
have been modelled using deep parametric active inference (
Hesp 
et al. 2021, Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). Parametric depth is a 
property of models that are able to form higher-order beliefs— 
beliefs about beliefs—and make inferences about the results of 
other inferential processes. For example, in generating samples
from the generative model, one could sample from a Gaussian

distribution with a mean and precision (i.e. inverse variance), 
where the precision itself was sampled from another distribution. 
By extension, the parameters of the distribution over precision 
could depend upon some further variable (i.e. latent state) in 
the generative model. This enables the agent to make lower-level 
inference into objects that can be tested, challenged and revised 
at the level of high-level inferences. Thus, the depth of the model
introduces an additional form of self-control to that which can be
observed in strange systems. As we will now see, this licences a
formal description of the inferential processes at play for a person
engaged in phenomenological inquiry and analysis (
Fig. 3). 
The ability to engage in phenomenological reflection implies 
a degree of metacognitive a wareness, i.e. meta-awareness
(
Sandved-Smith et al. 2021). The ensuing metacognitive or 
‘phenomenological attitude’ contrasts with the ‘natural attitude’ 
in which one is fully immersed in the flow o f experience and
one’s attention is taken up with the reality of what is experienced
(
Husserl 1982). We use the term ‘dereification’ to refer to the 
technique of suspending the natural attitude. This technique 
allows subjects to turn their attention to how things appear to 
them as subjects of experience and the subjective p rocesses by
which those appearances are constituted. Further refinements
exist to distinguish between dereification and meta-awareness
(Lutz et al.2015), or between the phases of suspension, redirection, 
and receptivity in the phenomenal reduction (Depraz 1999). Yet, 
these distinctions and their implications for the present modelling 
framework are beyond the scope of this paper.
DCNPh extends the treatment of generative passage in Ram-
stead et al. (2022) by formalizing the process of dereification and 
its methodological implementation in NPh. Dereification can be 
formulated in terms of inference under deep generative models 
simply because there are implicit inferences about the param-
eters of Bayesian beliefs that determine how the posterior (i.e. 
what) is updated. An agent performing higher level inferences
therefore opacifies aspects of the perceptual process that other-
wise would have represented an immersed transparent perspec-
tive (
Metzinger 2003a, 2003b). 
Next steps in computational 
phenomenology: broadening the scope 
fr om what to how phenomenology
The active inference literature has many examples of applying 
Bayesian mechanics to model conscious experience. Examples 
are classic studies of binocular rivalry , hallucination, and more
recently Troxler fading (
Benrimoh et al. 2018, Parr et al. 2019), to 
name a few. In general, these target phenomena are interesting 
examples of how to use active inference to model some aspects 
of the contents of experience, i.e. the evolution of what appears
in consciousness. For example, in
Parr et al. (2019), the authors 
simulate the alternating perceptual content during a binocular 
rivalry task by trac king the evolution of the posterior distribution
in time.
We suggest that focusing exclusively on the contents of expe-
rience is too limited when it comes to the comprehensive study 
of subjective experience. To show why we believe so, we pro-
pose making a distinction between the what and the how of 
experience. The what refers to the attentional object, i.e. experien-
tially given. This corresponds to the contents of consciousness as 
the y are understood within the research programme that seeks to
find the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs), i.e. as specific
contents that represent objects or aspects of the world (
Chalmers 
2000, Koch et al. 2016). In contrast, the how corr esponds to the 
subjective givenness of experiences that the subject becomes 
explicitly aware of only after they have altered their attitude 
tow ards their experience by engaging in contemplative practices
or by performing the phenomenological reduction.
When providing a phenomenological analysis of the structure 
of lived experience, Husserl often claimed that objects, the world, 
or even objectivity more gener ally (the what) are constituted
in consciousness, experience, or subjectivity (the how) (see, e.g.
Husserl 1970, p. 175). Husserl used the term ‘constitution’ to refer 
to the processes that allow for the appearance of objects to us as 
such in lived experience. The philosophical concern of Husserl is
to account for how objectivity is possible for a conscious subject.
8 | Sandved-Smithet al.
Constitution involves processes that the subject becomes aware 
of by having performed the phenomenological reduction making 
intelligible how objects, in their full variety of significations, can 
be given (i.e. can appear or manifest) to a subject of experience. 
This type of claim does not imply , a s in idealism, that the world
is internally constructed or created by consciousness. Rather,
Husserl’s idea was that it is only in lived experience that objects
become meaningful as such.
To illustrate the distinction between the what and the how of 
experience, consider John Dunne’s example of watching a beau-
tiful sunset: “During the experience, one is fully focused on the 
visual object, yet if ask ed later how one felt, one can report reliably
on one’s subjective sense of awe and so on” (
Dunne 2015, p. 261). In 
this example, the visual object (i.e. the sunset) corresponds to the 
what, whereas the subjective sense of awe corresponds to how the 
sunset is given in o ur experience. Let us provide another example,
this time of Varela’s experience of being in a concert:
The musicians (sublime Italian ensemble) arrive, tune up, and 
settle, a short silence and then begin with the sonata of the 
Musical Offering, which I love. Instantly , within the first five or 
six notes of the main theme, the break in mood and feeling 
tone arises: suddenly my chest heaves a little, my skin becomes 
goose-bumpy and it is as if the body is brought into position.
Almost at the same time there is a wave of beauty , of poignancy
which brings sudden tears into my eyes, an intensified breath-
ing (
Varela and Depraz 2005, p. 67).
Here, while the sonata played by the Italian ensemble corresponds 
to the what, the affective tonality and bodily feelings identified 
by Varela correspond to the how of experience which is ordinar-
ily li ved through so long as one is involved in listening to the
sonata.
Dunne’s and Varela’s experiences have in common the absorp-
tion of the subject in the object of their experience at the time of 
its occurrence. Both Dunne’s subject and Varela are fully taken up 
by the sunset and the sonata respectively . This kind of absorption 
in the what of experience is far from uncommon. More often than 
not, our attention is focused on the objects we are experiencing at 
a given moment (e.g. a document we are writing on our computer, 
a person whose talk we are listening to in a conference, the food 
we are eating, etc.). Focusing on the what in this way makes the 
how recede into the background from which it oper ates, allowing
the what to appear in different ways. Experiential objects are
not given under a neutral light, so to speak. Dunne’s sunset is
experienced as a beautiful sunset. Varela’s sonata is experienced
as a sublime musical piece. The meanings of these objects (i.e.
their beauty and sublimeness, respectively) are grounded on the
how, even if it remains transparent in the background of expe-
rience (
Husserl 1966, p. 284). If it were not for Dunne’s subject’s 
subjective sense of awe, and Varela’s affective tonality and bodily 
feelings, the sunset and the sonata would have not been experi-
enced in the way in which they were experienced.
Despite its usual receding into the background, it is possible 
for the how to be brought to the subject’s attention. Note, for 
example, how part of what characterizes Varela’s description of 
the sonata is the fact that he shifts his attention from the sonata 
to the subjective givenness of his experience through which the 
sonata appears to him. This shift in attention is simultaneously a 
change in attitude towards his experience. On the one hand Varela 
is absorbed by and fully taken up with his experience of the sonata 
but he is also able to shift his attention from the sonata to his 
lived experience. When he does so, he becomes reflectively aware 
of what is ordinarily pre-reflectively given in his experience— 
his bodil y feelings, his intensified breathing and so on. Thus his
attitude towards his experience changes from being pre-reflective
to being reflective. This change in attitude is possible because the
sense of being the subject living through all sorts of experiences is
always already implicitly present in them. As Dunne puts it after
introducing his example of seeing a beautiful sunset:
... even without having introspected in a way that makes one’s 
own subjectivity an object of observation, some aspect of con-
sciousness was already aware of those subjective features. 
Likewise, in at least a minimal way , the sense of oneself as the
subject seeing that object is already presented in the experi-
ence, even without turning inward and observing, “I am the one
seeing this sunset” (
Dunne 2015, p. 261).
When our friend asks us how we felt at the time of seeing the 
sunset, they are inviting us to change our attitude towards our 
experience and to reflect on what we experience. In respond-
ing to their request and performing this reflective gesture, we 
change our attitude towards our experience from one of pre-
reflective immersion to one of reflective distance. It is through 
such acts of reflection that we can become explicitly aware of 
what was already pre-reflectively given in experience, i.e. the 
how. For instance, when reflecting on the how of experiencing 
the sunset, the particularities of the experiential object (e.g. the 
colours of the sunset) are set aside to attend to the subjective 
structures that make it possible for it to be given in the way
in which it appears. Such subjective structures may involve, for
instance, an irreducible ‘for-meness’ (i.e. the sense of oneself
being who sees the sunset that Dunne mentions), as well as bodily
aspects such as a localization given by the position of our body , as
well as bodily feelings that give rise to an affective tonality that in
turn may disclose the sunset as a beautiful one.
As mentioned, we refer to this reflective gesture as ‘dereification’ 
(Lutz et al. 2015). It can be understood as the practice of 
making opaque what is ordinarily transparent, namely , the self-
manifestation of subjectivity . It is because of the first-person 
givenness of experiences to their subject that we can perform this 
reflective gesture. Through dereification, objects (the what) are 
brought back to their original subjective appearance (the how), 
revealing an inseparable correlation between subjectivity and 
world. In the examples above, the sunset and the sonata are 
objects experienced as appearing in perceptual experience, which 
involves, at the same time, implicit subjective structures such
as bodily feelings. Phenomenology and mindfulness practices
provide such techniques for directing our attention away from
its immersion in the world, allowing subjects trained in these
techniques to (more reliably) describe how a meaningful world
comes to be present or disclosed to consciousness through time.
Becoming aware of thehow
As foreshadowed, we propose that the deep parametric active 
inference architecture of metacognitive particles enables the gen-
erative passage between first and third-person ways of knowing 
consciousness. Recall that this architecture endows a generative 
model with the capacity for making inferences about the param-
eters of lower-level inferences. These parameters are the basis of 
the formation of the approximate posterior distribution, each of
them represents an aspect of how the perceptual content (what)
is inferred. Hence a metacognitive agent is therefore capable
of tracking the evolution of parameters of its generative model

Figure 4. Deep generative model of attentional perception and (mental) action. This figure depicts a Bayes graph of the inferential architecture of a 
metacognitive active inference agent performing attentional inference. The lower level represents the action perception cycle as the agent receives 
observations o(1) and calculates the approximate posterior distribution over external states s(1), given the likelihood mapping A(1) and the transition 
mapping B(1). Actions at this level are inferred and selected given the expected free energy G of policiesπ(1) given preferences C(1) and priors over 
policies E(1). The higher level represents the agent’s inference of and (mental) a ction over attentional states given observations of the likelihood

through time and can be said to be experiencing (and able to 
report on) an aspect of the constitutive process, e.g. its attentional
or affective fluctuations. This builds upon the treatments by
Albarracin et al. (2022) and Ramstead et al. (2022) by considering 
systems with the metacognitive ability to form infer ences about
these parameters.
The canonical example of relating this type of parameter to 
phenomenology is the mapping between the likelihood precision
and attention (Parr and Friston 2017b, 2019, Mirza et al. 2019). 
As a reminder, active inference can be cast as belief updating 
under a partially observed Markov decision process—in discrete 
state spaces—that can be depicted by a Bayes graph illustrating 
the stepwise inferential process or belief message passing. Under 
this formulation a number of parameters, or learned beliefs, are 
the basis of this process. The likelihood mapping (denotedA)
represents the agent’s beliefs about the likelihood of sensory
observations given the approximate posterior. Hence the precision
ofA(denoted
ζ) has been related to attention due to its functional 
role in modulating the impact of sensory data in the formation of 
perceptual content. The ability to form inferences based on this 
parameter, endowed b y a deep hierarchical generative model, can
be related to the phenomenology of inferring (i.e. noticing) where
one’s attention is allocated, see
Fig. 4. 
Thus far, the model’s higher level is restricted to attentional 
inferences based on the precision of its perceptual model (as in
Fig. 4). However, further parameters exist as part of the generative 
model that inferences can be performed over. For example, the
precision ω of the transition model B and the precision γ of the 
action model G, which have been respectively related to expecta-
tion and affect (not shown inFig. 4 for the sake of simplicity) (Parr 
and Friston 2017a, Hesp et al. 2021). Therefore, by generalizing 
this deep parametric architecture to include all the higher -order
parameters of the generative model (see Sandved-Smith et al. 
2021, Fig. 12), we propose that it provides a formal language 
that can be used to translate the descriptions of the how of 
consciousness into the model, specifically self-affection and the
pre-reflective dynamics of experience (see e.g.Varela and Depraz 
2005), though we can only gesture at this possibility and reserve a 
more in depth tre atment of this formalization for future work [see
e.g. (Albarracin et al.2022, Smith et al.2022b, Table 2] for examples 
of relating phenomenological features to activ e inference model
parameters).
This generalization illustrates the satisfaction of mutual con-
straints between the model and the phenomenology , as the model 
parameters match the phenomenological categorization, validat-
ing both sides. In fact, such modelling techniques go beyond mere 
mutual constraints by providing a true generative passage as 
originally understood by Varela due to the ability to represent 
invariant structures that can be described both in mathematical 
terms and in phenomenological terms. T his is exactly what we
should expect for a formalism that enables a generative passage.
We therefore argue that the structures of first-person experi-
ence that describe processes of phenomenological constitution
can also be formally represented through (deep) computational
modelling.
Employing deep computational 
neurophenomenology in empir ical
consciousness research
Deep computational NPh generates explanatory gains beyond 
standard NCC research by leveraging phenomenological data 
elicited from trained participants. This section will serve to 
illustrate how this framework can be practically employed in 
experimental design. Further work is required to flesh out the
detailed possibilities and identify fruitful targets, the aim here is
to provide a succinct conceptual understanding and motivation.
10 | Sandved-Smithet al.
Figure 5. Establishing generative passage in deep computational neurophenomenology . This figure illustrates the information flows and mutual 
constraints in a generic experimental design leveraging the proposed framework. Phenomenological reports are used to construct a phenomenological 
description of the conscious phenomena (NPh1). This description is couched within the phenomenological framework of choice, e.g. terminology from 
contemplative practices. This description is then translated into the computational model by the practice of computational phenomenology , which 
relates model parameters to phenomenological invariants or categories. In doing so, the generative model of the agent can be fitted to the reported 
phenomenology . The dual information geometry inherent to Bayesian mechanics then allows for a reciprocal constraint on the intrinsic dynamics 
related to the neurobiological instantiation. This can be used to guide the analysis and interpretation of the neurobiological data. Alternatively , o n e 
can fit the model of the intrinsic dynamics using the empirical data. In this case, the participant’s neural dynamics are measured via EEG, these 
measurements are processed into a standard neurobiolog ical description of the dynamics (e.g. spectral power bands). Then, using computational 
neurobiology (e.g. the neural process theory of active inference) one can translate the biological description of the empirical data into dynamics on t h e 
intrinsic manifold. This in turn will provide a constraint on the phenomenological model via the formal bridge, providing possible guidance in the 
phenomenological investigation. T his circulation of evidence between domains is the establishment of generative passage, which can be understood
as a meta-Bayesian explanatory cycle that iteratively increases the accuracy of the computational phenotyping model (i.e. our explanation).
We will use the binocular rivalry paradigm to illustrate the 
incremental explanatory gain that deep computational NPh 
provides as the participants are trained in increasingly refined 
phenomenological inquiry and report. Binocular rivalry is 
a perceptual phenomenon where two separate i mages are
presented to the two eyes, which induces a perception alternating
between the two images every few seconds.
Modelling the what of experience: ‘How is the
stimulus changing?’
When it comes to the active inference literature on consciousness, 
in most cases, the inferential processes that give rise to belief 
updating (i.e. how the perceptual content is constructed), are 
represented implicitly in the structure and parameterization of 
the generative model. The data being used to fit the model is either 
the reported content of experience or results from a behavioural
task. In both cases, the scientist must infer how to best fit the
model parameters in order to explain the data (e.g.
Smith et al. 
2020, Smith et al. 2022a). 
This means that when such a task is simulated, from the 
perspective of the in silico agent, only the what of experience 
appears. Whilst the scientist simulating the agent has privileged 
access to the dynamics of the parameters driving the output of the 
generative model, the agent has no way of reporting on the con-
stitutive process underpinning its perceptual experience . As dis-
cussed previously , this creates an unconstrained model selection
process which can make it difficult to infer what the true cause
(i.e. parameterization) of the observed phenomenon might be.
In the case of a binocular rivalry paradigm, this level of compu-
tational phenomenology restricts the first-person data to reports 
about the changing perceptual content. This limits the predic-
tions and explanations of the causes of the rivalry dynamics to 
that which can be inferred based on stimulus manipulation (e.g. 
variations in saliency). The participant is not asked to report on 
how the stimulus appears, such as their affective o r attentional
state fluctuations, but only to report on what is being perceived.
Similarly , the computational model employed in this case is not
equipped with the hierarchical depth that would enable fitting
subjective reports about the how.
As a result, the insights that can be gleaned from this approach 
will remain fundamentally limited simply because the genera-
tive model of the phenomena lacks a number of causal factors 
that impact the dynamics. The scientist is not making measure-
ments related to the constitutive dynamics and therefore the 
explanatory model will be blind to causally important elements 
of the experience. This is particularly limiting when the intended 
explanandum is the experience or consciousnessper se.Note
also that having fewer phenomenological constraints on the gen-
erative model also leads to fewer constraints in the search for
relevant neurobiological dynamics, thus compounding the loss of
explanatory generativity .
Modelling the how of experience
Ideally , the phenomenon of interest for the computational neu-
rophenomenologist goes beyond the dynamics of the posterior 
distribution (the what of experience studied in NCCs research) 
and also targets the dynamics of the parameters that underpin 
the inferential process that gives rise to the posterior distribution 
in the first place (which we take to provide a model of the how of 
experience). As discussed, this requires the involvement of trained 
participants and the employment of a generative model exhibiting 
a d egree of parametric depth. This set up would then allow the
scientist to fit first-person descriptions and classifications of the
howof experience to the explanatory model, thus refining and
broadening the process of incremental self-evidencing described
in
Fig. 2.
Deep computational neurophenomenology | 11
We will outline two ways of investigating the how that the 
trained participants develop in what follows, with incremental
explanatory generativity in both domains of neurobiology and
phenomenology .
Participants with attention training: ‘How is attention
regulation changing?’
Parr et al. 2019 investigates the how in a binocular rivalry simula-
tion by enabling the agent to perform inferences and actions over 
the precision of its perceptual model, giving the agent the capacity 
to track how its covert attention is oscillating between the two 
stimuli and thereby rendering opaque an otherwise transparent 
aspect of how its experience is constituted. Although the authors 
did not deploy this model in an empirical setting with human
participants, the structure would in principle allow the scientist to
use attentional self reports to fit the parameterization. Similarly ,
Novicky et al. (2022) develop an active inference based model 
of bistable Necker cube perception wherein they highlight that 
‘...there are distinct ways in which precision (hyper-) parameters -
associated with neuromodulators - can interact to affect bistable 
perception. . .’ p. 15. Acknowledging that it was not the aim of the 
authors to fit their simulations to empirical data, we point out 
that the model selection can be constrained with the addition of 
phenomenological data pertaining to the precision parameters in 
question. Doing so would allow for more accurate predictions of 
the phenomenological and neurobiological dynamics and guide 
further e vidence accumulation. In other words, by including ele-
ments of the how (e.g. reports about the perceived stability of the
percept, or about the magnitude of effort to maintain a chosen
percept as a function of its affective salience),the scientist can
reduce uncertainty in the model selection process, which in turn
facilitates subsequent scientific self-evidencing cycles.
A key advantage that arises from phenomenological and/or 
mindfulness training is the improved reliability and control the 
participants have over their attention when engaging with the 
task. This can increase the confidence placed in the subjective 
re ports, even if those only relate to the what, as well as cre-
ate measurable changes to any attention dependent outcomes
(
Dieter et al. 2016). For example, previous research has sho wn
that binocular rivalry (Carter et al. 2005) and other perceptual 
rivalry (Sauer et al.2012, Kornmeier et al.2019) durations can gen-
erally be prolonged through mindfulness-related meditation. A
recent phenomenological study (Abdoun et al. 2024) also reported 
enhanced meta-awareness, attention stability , dereification, and 
mental stillness during intensive mindfulness training. Given 
these results, a tangible prediction we can put forward is that 
participants that are trained to use first-person methods akin to 
mindfulness meditation can gain some control over the frequency 
of perceptual rivalry switching. They can describe the perceived 
duration of the dominant perceptual object and the perceived
sense of the attentional stability of the dominant percept. These
descriptions can then be used to fit, respectively , the likelihood
precision of theAmatrix and the precision
ω of the transition 
model B, the latter capturing how accurately and reliably the 
agent predicts the switching rate.
The epistemic gain enabled by leveraging the how of experience 
implies a pragmatic requirement to explicitly and actively 
engage the participant of a NPh experiment. This is because 
the computational structure at Level 2 requires a more explicit 
and active participation of the participant to describe not only 
the content but also the structure of their experience, which in 
most situations will require training prior to the experiment. A 
simple illustration of this comes from the findings that trained
meditators can more reliably notice and report on the perceived
duration of the dominant percept, as discussed above. This
pragmatic dimension of NPh was highlighted from the beginning
in Varela’s NPh programme and illustrated for instance in a pilot
study in
Lutz (2002), and is justified by the present formalism. 
We will not recall here the methodological requirements of 
a NPh experiment but will remind the readers that ther e are
prerequisites for obtaining reliable and accurate first-person
reports (for further discussion see
Lutz 2002, a n dBitbol and 
Petitmengin 2013). 
Participants trained in dereification: ‘How is the “real-ness”
changing?’
The full expression of the proposed deep computational neu-
rophenomenological framework emerges when the participant 
has sufficient training to be capable of monitoring, adjusting 
and reporting on their experience of dereification at a given 
moment. What is manipulated here is not how the percept is 
selectively maintained in awareness, but rather how the percept 
is affecting the agent and to what extent the agent then interprets 
the percept as subjectively real. This opens up the possibility to 
integrate refined and reliable phenomenological data related 
to how experience is being constructed moment by moment, 
which c an be used to fit a more inclusive generative model
of human phenomenology that accounts for a broad range of
causal factors implicated in conscious experience. Additional
evidence to fit the (extrinsic) generative model parameters also
gives rise to novel predictions about the intrinsic dynamics,
providing fruitful constraints on the directions for neurobiological
investigation.
In the binocular rivalry setting this would allow for further pre-
dictions and model fitting of the how aspects of phenomenology . 
A possible example would be to construct a deep computational
model for the rivalry task presented in
Katyal et al. (2024). This 
model would bridge the phenomenological data and the EEG 
results and serve as a computational explanation of the process 
of dereification itself. In this setting the degree of reification, 
or subjective realism, is experimentally manipulated by using
one image that has higher associated affordances than the other
(e.g. attractive versus neutral food image, see
Baquedano et al. 
2017), leading to an increase in the dominance of this image. 
Experienced meditators and novices are then asked to report 
on the rivalry during a meditation induced dereified state. The 
authors report that only the experienced participants attenuate 
the preferential processing of the high-affordance image. A deep 
computational model of this paradigm could in principle gener-
ate insights into the mechanisms underpinning the process of 
dereification in experienced meditators b y combining evidence
elicited from reports of the what (changing stimulus dominance)
and the how (changing degree of dereification). Furthermore, the
empirical EEG data the authors collected might constrain the
intrinsic dynamics and provide further evidence for the resulting
model of dereification.
The pragmatic requirement of NPh would consist for instance 
in training participants in the capacity to suspend the usual reifi-
cation of perceptual phenomena into ‘subjectively real’ objects 
and to report the sense of ‘realness’ and the ‘stickiness’ of the
perception or the degree of affordance related affect its triggers
(e.g.
Baquedano et al. 2017). Here the trained subject could, again, 
alter the duration of the dominant percept duration, yet using a 
different regulatory strategy as the one described in the previous 
section. The full presentation of such NPh paradigm and its
predictions are beyond the scope of the present paper.

Conclusion and future directions
We have outlined a novel empirical framework, deep compu-
tational neurophenomenology , which builds upon Varela’s NPh 
programme and recent work in active inference based compu-
tational phenomenology . In Varela’s NPh, it was the mathemat-
ics of d ynamical systems theory (DST), as a neutral vocabu-
lary , which made possible the circulation of knowledge between
phenomenology and neuroscience (
Varela 1997). More recently ,
(Beckmann et al. 2023) proposed to use the formalism of deep 
learning (DL). Both approaches are concerned with mathemati-
cally modelling and predicting the change in a system’s dynamics 
over time, capturing the intrinsic dynamics and using the same 
formalism to describe some invariants in the phenomenological 
dynamics. However, the relationship between the two is put in 
place by the scientist through some form of isomorphism. The 
challenge with these approaches is that the formalism does not 
provide a principled way to relate the intrinsic dynamics with 
the phenomenological dynamics. Rather than using DST or DL 
to enable generative passage, we have proposed to leverage two 
key developments arising from the free energy principle: the dual 
information geometry of Bayesian mechanics, and deep para-
metric generative models. As we have shown, this provides a
mathematically constrained logic for relating the two domains in
the form of a mutual constraint arising from the formalism itself.
The result is a comprehensive mathematically grounded empir-
ical framework for consciousness research that we have argued
will provide explanatory advantages over alternative approaches
which do not make use of either the first-person data of trained
participants, or the formalism of deep parametric generative
models.
NPh is historically rooted in the enactive a pproach to cognition
(Varela et al. 1991, Thompson 2007, Gallagher and Zahavi 2008, 
Colombetti 2014, Gallagher 2022). It has recently been argued 
that the FEP and the active inference framework (Friston et al. 
2022), which underwrite the generative modelling approach we 
draw upon in this paper, are fundamentally incompatible with
the enactive approach to cognitive science (Aguilera et al. 2022, 
Paolo et al. 2022), which initially guided Varela’s NPh programme. 
We have not directly responded to the specif ic objections of Di
Paolo, Aguilera and colleagues (but seeKiverstein et al. 2022 for 
the beginning of reply; see also Bogotá 2024). We have however 
attempted to demonstrate the fecundity of the FEP in providing 
formal tools that can allow for generative passage connecting 
phenomenology to neurobiology , an ambition that is in keeping
with the enactive research programme and the pragmatic aims
of NPh.
Deep computational NPh adds two features to computational
phenomenology as proposed in Ramstead et al. (2022). Compu-
tational phenomenology uses active inference as a formal tool 
for enabling generative passage between structures of lived expe-
rience as described in Husserl’s phenomenology such as the 
noesis and noema, onto biologically plausible inferential pro-
cesses. We have by contrast proposed a neurophenomenological 
method which starts from the mutual constraints between the 
first-person observations of trained participants and third-person 
measures of the neural correlates of consciousness. Second, deep
computational NPh opens up the possibility to model thehow
of experience, which can include the pre-reflective self-affective
dynamic processes that ordinarily operate in the background of
our lived experience, and which Husserl described in terms of
‘genetic constitution’ (
Husserl 1966). This is a project we plan 
to take up in future work, which will provide an opportunity to 
computationall y clarify the distinction between meta-awareness
and dereification (
Lutz et al. 2015). 
Deep computational NPh raises many questions for future 
research, some of which we have already mentioned. One ques-
tion is about the explanatory aspiration of this framework and 
its positions in relation to existing theories of consciousness. A 
second set of issues concerns the contribution of this approach to 
an old debate in introspection research regarding the reliability 
and reproducibility of first-person data. A further question is 
about the role of this framework in teaching and understanding 
contemplativ e practices and well-being. We plan to return to
these and other questions in future work in which we further
develop deep computational NPh as an approach to enabling
generative passage between first and third-person methods for
investigating the nature of consciousness.
