Traditional information theory provides a rigorous foundation for information com-
pression and reliable symbol transmission. However, in emerging applications such as
autonomous driving, remote healthcare, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT), the key
communication challenge has been shifted from accurate delivery of raw data to the effi-
cient transmission of task-relevant information [1–4]. For instance, autonomous vehicles
require timely awareness of driving-critical events rather than full sensor streams, while
remote healthcare relies on essential medical features rather than complete high-resolution
images. These task-driven communication scenarios are inherently bandwidth-constrained
and latency-sensitive, calling for integrating downstream task objectives into information
processing and transmission to improve the communication efficiency.
Semantic communication has emerged as a new paradigm that operates at the se-
mantic or effectiveness level, aiming to extract and convey only the information necessary
for a receiver to accomplish a specific goal [ 5–10]. The rapid advancement of artificial
intelligence (AI) has significantly accelerated research in this field. By leveraging AI tech-
niques, transmitters can efficiently extract, compress, and encode task-relevant information,
thereby reducing communication overhead and enabling more intelligent, goal-oriented
transmission. Consequently, semantic communication has attracted increasing attention as
a key enabler of next-generation intelligent networks.
Despite the notable progress made in semantic communications, a unified theoretical
foundation and operational analytical tools remain elusive. The relationship between
traditional information theory and semantic communication is not yet fully established,
particularly regarding the extent to which information-theoretic principles can address the
unique challenges posed by semantic communication. This Special Issue aims to bridge
this gap by promoting the convergence of information theory and semantic communi-
cation, thereby fostering deeper theoretical insights and practical advancements. After
going through a rigorous review process, twelve articles are selected in this Special Is-
sue, including two review articles and ten research articles. The review articles provide
holistic perspectives on the semantic information theory and semantic communications,
respectively. The novel contributions in the research articles can be broadly categorized
into two directions: semantic rate–distortion theory, which investigates source compression
under task-specific semantic distortion measures, and efficient semantic communication
system design, which focuses on optimizing transmission efficiency while preserving
semantic relevance.
The review article [11] takes a complementary perspective, advocating for a general-
ization of Shannon’s framework rather than a parallel theory. It introduces a “G theory”
that replaces the traditional distortion constraint with a semantic constraint, employing
truth functions to quantify semantic distortion, information, and loss. The paper illustrates

the broad applicability of this theory across domains ranging from machine learning to
statistical physics and further proposes refining Friston’s minimum free energy principle
into the maximum information efficiency principle. The review article [12] presents a sys-
tematic review of the state-of-the-art semantic communications in the Internet of Vehicles
(IoV). It covers key technologies, including semantic information extraction, system archi-
tectures, and resource allocation, and demonstrates their effectiveness in traffic perception,
intelligent driving, and traffic management. The survey emphasizes the vast potential
applications of semantic communications within IoV .
The six papers dedicated to semantic rate distortion theory [13–18] collectively push
the boundaries of theoretical analysis by introducing new analytical frameworks and
algorithms. Specifically, paper [ 13] proposes a new semantic arithmetic coding (SAC)
method for semantic lossless compression. By leveraging the concept of synonymity and
constructing synonymous mappings, the SAC method achieves higher compression ef-
ficiency for meaning-contained source sequences, approximating the semantic entropy
limits. Paper [14] proposes a framework to quantify the rate-distortion tradeoff for semantic
communication under various task-specific semantic distance measures. The authors derive
closed-form expressions for the semantic rate-distortion functions for classification and
signal generation tasks, providing theoretical results verified by extensive experiments.
Paper [15] integrates the perceptual dimension into the rate-distortion paradigm. This work
clarifies the role of perceptual constraints common and private randomness and projects an
increase in expected traffic in intelligent communication networks when perceptual quality
is considered. The paper demonstrates how a modest increase in rate can significantly
enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructions. Paper [ 16] extends the fundamental
BA algorithm to the semantic domain. It introduces the Extended Blahut–Arimoto (EBA)
algorithm, which iteratively computes the semantic rate-distortion function based on syn-
onymous mapping. The paper also proposes an optimization framework combining EBA
with simulated annealing to handle scenarios with unknown synonymous mappings and
analyzes the role of the semantic knowledge base size. Paper [17] characterizes the optimal
transition probability distribution for reproducing an intrinsic state in a composite source
model. The paper interprets this optimal solution as a “soft classifier” that generalizes the
traditional “classify-then-compress” scheme. It demonstrates that this approach, which
uses soft classification to guide lossy compression, outperforms existing coding schemes.
Paper [18] addresses a distributed source coding problem relevant to task-oriented semantic
communication. It characterizes the exact rate-distortion function for scenarios where a
central decoder aims to recover a latent variable from independently encoded sources. The
paper also develops a distributed Blahut–Arimoto (BA) algorithm to numerically compute
the rate-distortion function.
The four papers on theoretically guided semantic communication scheme de-
signs [19–22] demonstrate the practical application of these ideas. Specifically, paper [19]
proposes a new semantic communication system for image transmission that addresses
bandwidth limitations. The system uses a non-uniform quantization technique based
on the differential impact of features on image recovery at the receiver. This dynamic
bit allocation algorithm ensures image reconstruction quality under limited bandwidth.
Paper [20] fills a key gap by providing an operational interpretation of partial information
decomposition. It connects this decomposition to the capacity of the broadcast channel,
rigorously interpreting the synergistic information as a cooperative gain. This provides
a clear theoretical basis for the technique’s applications. Paper [ 21] proposes a separate
source–channel coding framework for semantic communications in MIMO systems, im-
proving adaptability and model reusability compared to joint source–channel coding. The
framework combines a VAE-based semantic coder, a communication-informed bottleneck

attribution for feature importance, and an importance-aware resource allocation scheme.
Ref. [22] proposes a task-oriented framework for multimodal digital semantic communica-
tions. It leverages a pre-trained transformer to extract semantic information and designs
three semantic source-coding schemes: quantization-based coding, compression via clus-
tering, and a vector-quantized autoencoder-based learned codebook. By combining these
semantic codes with standard channel coding, the study demonstrates that the proposed ap-
proaches achieve comparable classification accuracy while significantly improving system
time efficiency over learning-based baselines.
This Special Issue underscores the pivotal role of information theory in shaping the
emerging paradigm of semantic communication. The collected articles demonstrate how
classical tools—most notably rate–distortion theory and joint source–channel coding—can
be extended to support more efficient and reliable approaches to data compression and
information transmission. Information theory thus provides indispensable theoretical guid-
ance for the advancement of semantic communication, while the rapid progress of semantic
communication simultaneously expands and deepens the research frontiers of information
theory itself. Looking forward, we envision semantic information theory not only as a
bridge between these two domains but also as a source of practical insights and rigorous
methodologies that will inform the design of next-generation communication networks.
