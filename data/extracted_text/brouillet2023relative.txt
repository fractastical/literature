Abstract. For a growing number of researchers, it is now accepted that the brain is a predictive 
organ that predicts the content of the sensorium and crucially the precision of—or confidence 
in—its own predictions. In order to predict the precision of its predictions, the brain has to infer 
the reliability of its own beliefs. This means that our brains have to recognise the precision of 
their predictions or, at least,  their accuracy. In this paper, w e argue that fluency is product of 
this recognition process. In short, to recognise fluency is to infer that we hav e a precise ‘grip’ 
on the unfolding processes that generate our sensations.  More specifically, we propose that it 
is change s in fluency — from unfelt to felt — that are both recognised and realised when 
updating predictions about precision. Unfelt fluency orients attention to unpredicted sensations, 
while felt fluency supervenes on—and contextualises—unfelt fluency; thereby rendering certain 
attentional processes, phenomenologically opaque. As such, fluency underwrites the precision 
we place in our predictions and therefore acts upon our perceptual inferences. Hence, the causes 
of conscious subjective inference have unconscious perceptual precursors.

How living organism s adapt to a constantly changing environment is a recurrent 
question since Darwin (1859) and von Uexküll (1934). Active Inference  is an attempt to 
understand this adaptation from the point of view of brain function, cognition and behaviour. 
Active inference accounts for the way in which all living organisms manage to minimize 
surprise (i.e., the discrepancy between predicted and observed outcomes ) via the perception -
action loop. To do that,  brain constantly generates predictions about the sensorium to, 
effectively, produce an error or surprise signal  (Clark, 2013b; Friston et al., 2011; Hohwy, 
2013). This prediction error is large when sensory inputs do not correspond to what was 
anticipated. The ensuing prediction error can be minimised in one of two ways. First, it can be 
used to revise beliefs or representations of the causes of sensations to produce more accurate 
predictions, as in perception. Second, one can act upon the world to generate sensations that are 
closer to predictions (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2016; Friston et al., 2011; Lanillos et 
al., 2021; Parr et al., 2022; Seth, 2013). In other words, both action and perception can be seen 
as in the service of minimising prediction error or surprise. 
However, not all prediction errors are equal: some predictions may be very precise, or 
some sensory input may be very imprecise. This means that the imperative is not simply to 
minimise prediction errors but only those that convey precise information relevant for belief 
updating—or affordance for action  (Limanowski, 2017; Parr et al., 2018; Parr and Friston, 
2017a; Seth and Friston, 2016; Smith et al., 2019a; Sterzer et al., 2018) . This account 
foregrounds the importance of precision;  more specifically, precision-estimation and the 
ensuing precision weighting of prediction errors  (Clark, 2013a). In terms of Bayesian belief 
updating, the relative precision of prior beliefs and sensory evidence determines the degree of 
belief updating. A prior belief that is held with great precision will be resistant to updating by 
a relatively imprecise predicti on error. Neurophysiologically, the implicit sensitivity to 
prediction errors is thought to be mediated by the excitability of neuronal populations encoding 
3 
 
prediction errors (e.g., via the action of classical modulatory neurotransmitter systems and 
associated fast synchronous interactions in electrophysiology). Psychologically, this evinces a 
kind of selection that can be read as attentional selection or, its complement, sensory attenuation 
(Feldman and Friston, 2010). We will pursue the psychological reading of precision. 
To assess the precision of its predictions, brain relies on its own beliefs ; that is to say 
about the  precision of its prior predictions.  The core idea developed in this paper is that 
fluency—the subjective experience associated with any cognitive treatment —plays a key role 
in prediction because it reflects or recognizes the precision of predictions and, in so doing,  
underwrites precise belief updating. However, we argue that it is not fluency itself that is firstly 
perceived but rather changes in fluency expectation. This change instantiates attentional set or 
mediates attentional selection (or attenuation) in response to violations and unexplained 
prediction errors.  
We begin by rehearsing the principles underlying active inference. We then review the 
works that foreground the importance of fluency in cognitive processes ; particularly those  
concerning relative fluency. Finally, we suggest that if fluency underwrites the optimisation of 
precision in (Bayesian) belief updating, it is non-felt fluency (surprise) that play a key role  in 
updating predictions about precisions—and furnishing a sense of felt fluency. 
 
 
About Active Inference 
Active inference is formulation of Predictive Processing (PP), applied to the perceptual, 
cognitive and enactive functioning of the brain . As above, it inherits from the foundational 
insights of Hermann von Helmholtz (1867) that cognitive processes are inferential processes  
(for a synthesis, see Hutchinson & Barret, 2019; Wiese & Metzinger, 2017).  
It is now widely accepted that PP provides a theoretical framework that accounts for 
many aspects of human and animal cognition in a way that no model has done previously (Clark, 
4 
 
2013b, 2018; Friston, 2009, 2010; Hohwy, 2016; Knill & Pouget, 2004; see also, Friston, 2010; 
Hutchinson & Barrett, 2019; Wiese & Metzinger, 2017).  
Over the past decade, numerous studies have highlighted its relevance in major areas of 
psychology: vision (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Walsh, McGovern, Clark, & O'Connell, 2020), 
perceptual illusions (van Heusden, Harris, Garrido, & Hogendoorn, 2019), memory (Hin dy, 
Ng, & Turk -Browne, 2016; Parr & Friston, 2017 b), attention (Ainley, Apps, Fotopoulou, & 
Tsakiris, 2016; Feldman & Friston, 2010; Kanai, Komura, Shipp, & Friston, 2015; Parr & 
Friston, 2019), motivation (Tate, 2019), emotions (Joffily & Coricelli, 2013 ;  Barrett, 2017; 
Ridderinkhof, 2017; Wilkinson, Deane, Nave, & Clark, 2019), action (Friston, Daunizeau, & 
Kiebel, 2009; Shadmehr, Smith, & Krakauer, 2010), theory of mind (Friston & Frith, 2014), 
social interactions (Kahl & Kopp, 2018), and language (Kuperberg & Jaeger, 2016; Mitsugi & 
Macwhinner, 2016).  It is important to note that traditionally these psychological functions are 
considered in isolation (they would be autonomous processes). As soon as active inference 
makes it possible to account for eac h of them, it is not necessary to consider that these 
psychological functions are not so different. 
Active inference1 provides an account of  one of the major characteristics of living 
systems: that is a generalised kind of homeostasis or self-organisation that can be read as 
minimizing the discrepancy between current  sensations and predictions based on previous 
information that has been assimilated under a generative or world model entailed by the brain. 
But, minimizing discrepancy (e.g., prediction errors)  is not a passive  process, living systems 
actively control their  sensed environment to maintain their internal equilibrium : i.e., active 
inference. Technically, active inference is a process th eory for embodied brains that is an 
application of a variational principle of least action (called the free energy principle, Friston, 
2009; Friston & Stephan, 2007; Friston et al., 2012).

Active inference is an instance of the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Doya, 2007): under 
which brain is a predictive system grounded on a generative model, which scaffolds Bayesian 
belief updating of probabilistic representations of how the hidden (i.e., unobservable) causes in 
the world generate (i.e. unobservable) sensations. This belief updating corresponds to inferring 
the causes of sensations. That is to say, a probabilistic generative model of the dependencies 
between (unobservable or hidden) causes and (observable or sensory) consequences allows us 
to recognise the causes of sensations—and generate predictions of sensations given their causes. 
Hierarchical generative models entertain nested causes of an increasingly abstract and domain-
general nature at successive levels of the hierarchy; usually, with a separation of temporal scales 
(Friston et al., 2017b; Hasson et al., 2008; Kiebel et al., 2008; Poeppel et al., 2008; Ramstead 
et al., 2018).  
Under hierarchical models, recognition  or perception is mediated by top -down 
predictions and bottom -up prediction errors ; where prediction errors are  used to update  
(Bayesian; i.e., subpersonal) beliefs about hidden causes of the sensorium —and the synaptic 
weights that encode the causal regularities of the world. In short, our brain infers, from sensory 
inputs, an internal probabilistic model of the world (i.e., the body/environment system). In turn, 
this internal probabilistic model allows us to anticipate senso ry inputs  and to  evaluate the 
discrepancy between current sensations and those predicted under our generative models. 
The brain constantly generates  predictions and ensuing prediction error or surprise 
signals. As noted above, prediction errors can be reduced in two ways: by changing predictions 
or by selectively action-sorting sensory inputs (Friston, 2010). These two ways of minimising 
prediction error have been referred to in terms of perceptual and active inference, respectively.  
Both are in the service of minimising prediction errors or variational free energy (Ramstead et 
al., 2022), which can also be read as maximising (a lower bound on) the statistical evidence for 
the generative model. In philosophy, this has been referred to in terms of self -evidencing 
6 
 
(Hohwy, 2016); namely, acting or selectively sampling the sensorium to maximise the evidence 
for our generative models of the sensed world. 
Crucially, the brain has to make predictions about the precision of its own predictions. 
These precision predictions are necessary to  weight prediction errors in a Bayes optimal 
fashion; namely, in proportion to the precision or reliability of the information they contain. 
This means that inference —i.e., Bayesian belief updating —is driven by precision-weighted 
prediction errors. The idea is that the more precise a prediction is expected to be, the prediction 
errors that result  should be afforded more weight . Psychologically, this kind of precision 
weighting is often equated with attentional set (see Ainley et al., 2016; Clark, 2018; Feldman 
& Friston, 2010; Kanai et al., 2015). Physiologically, it is thought to rest upon the same synaptic 
gain mechanisms that underwrite attentional selection.  
In order to assess the precision of its predictions, our brain must have subpersonal beliefs 
about the precision of its own predictions  and therefore has to infer  the reliability of its own 
beliefs. This means that our brains  have to estimate the precision of  their predictions. This 
estimation is ubiquitous in all inference settings. Perhaps the simplest example would be in 
statistics, where one has to estimate the standard error—of some group mean or expectation—
based upon the sum of squared prediction errors. Please see (Kanai et al., 2015) for an example 
of this precision encoding or uncertainty quantification as implemented in the brain —as a 
model of attention in separating feature from ground.  
In short, predicting precision is a key aspect of inference, in the sense of estimating the 
certainty. We consider that if fluency plays a key role in  predicting precision, it is relative 
fluency that plays a key role in revising predictions about precision. 
 
About fluency and relative fluency

In the field of memory, Jacoby and colleagues (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Jacoby, Kelley 
& Dywan, 1989; Jacoby & Whitehouse, 1989; Kelley & Jacoby, 1990, 1998; Whittlesea, Jacoby 
& Girard, 1990) leveraged the ideas of Hermann von Helmholtz (1867) —in the field of 
perception—that cognitive processes are inferential processes (see also Brunswik, 1956). They 
were the first to suggest that the experience of memory originates in an inference based on a 
phenomenological cue, fluency. Fluency is generally defined as the subjective (metacognitive 
or qualitative) experience of the level of ease with which our own cognitive processes proceed 
(Alter & Oppenheimer, 2009; Reber & Schwarz, 2001)2.  
But fluency is phenomenologically transparent to its own causal source, in the sense that 
it does not represent such a source (Metzinger, 2003). Introspecting fluency will not reveal what 
brought it about, it is only a subjective feeling.  This is why assigning it a source must rely on 
an attributional process (the fluency attribution heuristic , Jacoby & Dallas, 1981 ). This 
attributional process relies on an inference: if fluency is felt, its origin can only be what I am 
aware of, the processed stimulus. Consequently, felt fluency leads to the orientation of attention 
to the stimulus selected for processing (Turo, Collins & Brouillet, 2022)3.  
As predicting precision is a key aspect of inference (see above), fluency could play a  
key role in active inference. Indeed, it informs the cognitive system about expectations toward 
the stimulus, according to the properties of the stimulus and past experiences. In short, fluency 
 
2 Several empirical studies suggest that fluency is involved in a wide variety of judgements (for an overview, see 
Alter & Oppenheimer, 2009). Furthermore, it has been shown that fluency is evinced at different levels —and 
entails diverse contents that allow people to experience the world as unitary (see Winkielman, Ziembowicz & 
Nowak, 2015). Fluency has been referred to as perceptual fluency, when it involves perceptual processes (Jacoby 
& Whitehouse, 1989), conceptual fluency  when it involves semantic processing (Whittelsea, 1993) and motor 
fluency when motor processes are involved (Yang, Gallo & Beilock, 2009).  
3 It was highlighted that: in a distance judgment task the stimulus will be perceived as closer (Alter & 
Oppenheimer, 2008; Mrkva, Travers & van Boven, 2018), in a memory judgment task the stimulus will be 
considered as old (Lanska, Olds & Westerman, 2014; Brouillet et al., 2022), in a hedonic judgment task the 
stimulus will be judged as positive (Reber, Winkielman & Schwarz, 1998; Milhau, Brouillet & Brouillet, 2013) 
and aesthetic (Reber, Schwarz & Winkielman, 2004; Zhang et al., 2022).

is interpreted as a metacognitive signal that tells us that there is minimal error in the execution 
of the current process.  
The idea that fluency is an integral part of active inference was implicit in the work of 
Hesp, Smith, Parr, Allen, Friston and Ramstead (2021). In their work, they demonstrate that 
hierarchical Bayesian networks, solved using active inference (Friston, Parr & de Vries, 2018), 
make it possible to account for emotional valence. To evince this, they formalized emotional 
valence as a state of self that is inferred on the basis of fluctuations in the estimated confidence 
(or precision) that an agent has in its generative model that informs his decisions. According to 
their results, they propose that it would be changes in processing fluency across different 
domains that that would be at the root of affective states.  
Based on the idea that fluency can be  seen through the lens of Helmholtzian inference 
— that underlies predictive coding — Brielmann and Dayan (2022) proposed a computational 
model of aesthetic value. They consider that stimuli that are predictable ( under the generative 
model) are those that are processed fluently.  Indeed, the brain continuously predicts the next 
sensory input and greater fluency corresponds to a  precise match between predictions and the 
sensory input. Thus, fluency can be thought as signifying a resolution of prediction errors, or at 
least, as a signal of smaller prediction errors and greater precision. Moreover, according to the 
so-called hedonic marking fluenc y, increasing fluency is the main determinant of how 
positively a sense experience is evaluated. 
In the model they proposed, they adapted the generative model to make the processing 
of specific stimuli more fluent, that is to say more predictable. To do that they operationalized 
processing fluency as the likelihood of a stimulus , given the system state at a given time . 
Technically, this corresponds to increasing the precision of the likelihood model . In two 
experiments, their model was able to capture the classic effects observed in the literature on 
aesthetic evaluations. In turn, these results support the idea that sensory experiences associated 
9 
 
with smaller prediction errors (i.e., greater precision), for which fluency is the marker, are more 
pleasurable.  
While Brielmann and Dayan’s model supports the idea that fluency is an intrinsic part 
of predictive processing, it seems important to consider the distinction proposed by Whittlesea 
and Leboe (2003) between absolute fluency and relative fluency4 to explain the role of fluency 
from an active inference perspective.   
Absolute fluency refers to an increasing degree of fluency (e.g., the speed of 
processing), which results in a subjective feeling of fluency  (c.f., recognising that one is 
becoming increasingly fluent)5. The works mentioned in the preceding paragraphs considered 
absolute fluency. In distinction, r elative fluency refers to a violation of expectation and 
consequent surprise: for example, you expect something to appear immediately, and it doesn't, 
but then appears after a delay. In this case, that something will seem more fluid than if it had 
appeared immediately. Cinema often uses this phenomenon to keep viewers spellbound 
According to  the SCAPE model  (Whittlesea, 1997) , the discrepancy attribution 
hypothesis (Whittlesea, 2002, 2004; Whittlesea & Leboe, 2000, 2003; Whittlesea & Williams, 
1998, 2000, 2001a, 2001b) furnishes an account of this phenomenon 6. For example, in their 
core experiment, Whittlesea and William s (1998) wanted to highlight the role of surprise in 
creating a sense of familiarity. In the first phase (experiment 3) they asked participants to learn 
a list composed of real words (e.g., table), orthographically regular non-words (e.g., hension), 
and orthographically irregular non-words (e.g., stofwus). Then, in a second phase, participants 
 
4 Westerman (2008) uses the concept of relative fluency in a significantly distinct sense from Whittlesea and 
Leboe (2003): fluency is relative to a benchmark (the proportion of fluent items to non -fluent items) 
5 A priming task is a good example: if we present the word "doctor" and immediately after the word "nurse" we 
will feel a sense of fluency whereas if "nurse" is preceded by the word "tree" that will not be the case.  
6 Since several researches have supported the discrepancy attribution hypothesis (Aßfalg & Bernstein, 2012; 
Aßfalg, Currie & Bernstein, 2017; Breneiser & Mcdaniel , 2006; Brouillet et al., 2017; Brouillet, Servajean, Josa, 
Gimenez, Turo & Michelland, 2023; Brouillet, Rousset & Perrin, 2022; Bruett & Leynes, 2015; Chen & Mo, 2002; 
Goldinger & Hansen, 2005; Hansen, & Wänke, 2013; Hansen, Dechêne & Wänke, 2008; Joorden s, Ozubko, & 
Niewiadomski, 2008; Thomas, Lindsey, & Lakshmanan, 2010; Wänke & Hansen, 2015; Wilbert & Haider, 2012; 
Willems & Van der Linden, 2006).

were presented with old items (i.e., presented in the first phase) and new items  (i.e., not 
presented in the first phase but with the same characteristics as the old items ). Subjects were 
asked to perform three tasks on each item: to pronounce it, to decide if it were a word or non -
word (lexical decision task), and to decide if it had been presented in the first phase.  
It is the results on the new words that are most interesting. They  revealed that the real 
words were pro nounced more easily than the other two types and that the orthographically 
regular non-words were pronounced more easily than the orthographically irregular non-words. 
Results on the lexical decision task showed that real words were judged more rapidly than 
orthographically regular non-words and these ones more rapidly than orthographically irregular 
non-words. They highlighted that there were more false alarms (i.e., new words are judged as 
having been presented in the first phase when they were not) for orthographically regular non-
words than for real words and for orthographically irregular non-word. The difference between 
real words and orthographically irregular non-words was no significant.   
If feeling of familiarity was only associated with absolute fluency of processing, then 
the proportion of new items judged as old (called false alarm) should have been higher for real 
words than orthographically regular non-words. But it is the opposite that was  observed. To 
explain what they called the Hension Effect , the authors evoke the discrepancy attribution 
hypothesis: the surprise associated with the pronounceability of the orthographically regular 
non-word, while their perceptual identification is more difficult than for real words (they do not 
exist in the lexicon),  generates a feeling of familiarity . This is  because—in the context of a 
recognition test—participants cannot attribute surprise to its source, so they attribute the fluency 
felt to the most obvious source , the stimulus, that is consequently regarded as having been 
present in the learning phase.  
It is important to note that felt fluency—related to the pronounceability of 
orthographically regular non-words—is relative to the fact that their perceptual identification 
11 
 
was difficult (non-felt fluency), hence the term “relative fluency” used by the authors. It is the 
surprise that emerges from the gap between a phenomenal sense of non -felt fluency and a 
phenomenal sense of felt fluency that orients attention to the ongoing sensory processing.  
Recently, Brouillet et al. (2023) observed similar results (Experiment 2, new words) to 
those of Whittlesea and William s (1998). However, their results show that the gap between 
non-felt fluency and felt fluency acts both anteriorly (forward) and posteriorly (backward). 
They manipulated the discrepancy between conceptual and perceptual fluency , using an 
adaptation of the sentence stem paradigm (Whittlesea, 1993): words to be recognized were 
predictable or non-predictable and Gaussian noise (Reber et al, 1998) was used to manipulate 
the readability of the words . With a noisy background ( no-perceptual fluency), participants 
were more likely to judge a new word as old for predictable words (conceptual fluency) than 
when the background was  noiseless (perceptual fluency). This situation is similar to that of 
Whittlesea and Williams (1998): non-felt fluency (no-perceptual fluency) precedes felt fluency 
(conceptual fluency). But, when the background was  noiseless (perceptual fluency), 
participants were more likely to judge a new word as old for non -predictable words ( no-
conceptual fluency) than for predictable words (conceptual fluency). In this situation non-felt 
fluency (no-conceptual fluency) follows felt fluency (perceptual fluency). Taken together these 
results suggest that it is relative fluency that orients attention to surprising sensory input  and 
accompanying phenomenology. In the context of a memory task — as the surprise is transparent 
to its origin — participants attribute the source of phenomenal sensations to prior experience 
with the stimulus.  
In the same vein, Brouillet, Milhau, Brouillet and Servajean (2017) tested the 
discrepancy hypothesis through the effect of motor fluency that preceded the words to be 
recognized. In this paradigm, participants had to perform a fluent gesture (e.g., dominant 
hand and ipsilateral gesture) or a non -fluent gesture (e.g., dominant hand and contralateral 
12 
 
gesture) just before the recognition task. The gesture had no relationship with the meaning 
of the words. The results showed that ipsilateral side gestures (high motoric fluency) were 
easier to execute than contralateral side gestures (less motoric fluency ), and that words 
which followed an ipsilateral side gesture were more likely to be reported as recognized 
than words that followed a contralateral side gesture. The results on new words are, once 
again, interesting. When they appear on the screen it is non-fluency that is experienced but 
before the word appeared, participants have experienced fluency. This discrepancy generates a 
non-specific signal that automatically triggers the search for an explanation. Since participants 
cannot firmly attribute this nonspecific signal to its source, they attribute it to the most salient 
source—the stimulus—and thus they infer that the word was on the learning list and report that 
they recognize it.  
In further paper, Brouillet, Rousset and Perrin (2022) showed an effect of discrepancy 
through the transfer of the motor feeling of fluency linked to the participants’ past interactions 
with the environment, independently of the stimulus in progress. In th is paradigm, they 
constructed an experiment that comprised two steps. Firstly, participants had to perform a 
perceptual discrimination task (distinguishing a square from a circle) that involved a fluent 
gesture (ipsilateral side) or non-fluent gesture (contralateral side) to respond. Motor fluency vs. 
non-fluency was implicitly associated with the colour of the geometric shapes (blue vs. 
magenta). Second, they had to perform a classical memory recognition task:  learning a list of 
pseudo-words and recognize them among new pseudo-words. During the recognition phase, 
pseudo-words (Old and New) appeared, either with the colour associated with motor fluency or 
with the colour associated with non -motor fluency. Results highlighted that pseudo-words 
presented in a  colour associated with an ipsilateral gesture (motor fluency) , lead to more 
frequent “old” (i.e., learned) responses, than non-words presented in a colour associated with a 
contralateral gesture (non-motor fluency).  Again, it is particularly interesting that new pseudo-
13 
 
words were recognized as old  — when they were presented in the colour associated with a 
fluent gesture. This strengthens previous results:  it is the discrepancy between colour (felt 
fluency) and new pseudo-words (non-felt fluency) that leads participants to attribute the origin 
of the phenomenal experience to pseudo-words, and to infer that they must be old words. So, 
these results show that the cognitive system uses motor fluency — engendered by preceding 
actions — even if these past actions have no link with items processed. On the other hand, they 
show that the cognitive system is sensitive to the gap between non-felt fluency and felt fluency, 
which results  in a  deployment of attention to  current sensory inputs  and in the context of 
recognition task they judge items as old.   
Wilbert & Haider (2012) were the first, to our knowledge, to brought out a link between 
fluency and (the processing of) prediction errors. The authors used the discrepancy hypothesis 
to explain the feeling of having committed an error. Their assumption was that a subjective 
discrepancy between the expected and the experienced feeling of typing triggers a search 
process for the cause, resulting in the attribution of the discrepancy to a typing error. To show 
this, participants had to type visually presented letters, one at a time. After having finished 
typing, they were asked to judge whether or not they had correctly typed the actual word (or 
pseudo-words). Results show that it is the perceived violation of an expectation regarding 
fluency of typing that lea ds to the subjective experience of having made a mistake (e.g., 
expecting to type pseudowords slowly and typing them quickly and correctly).  
But the most interesting result, for our purposes, was obtained in their experiment 4. Its 
aim was to find out whether an expectation violation in itself is sufficient to produce the 
subjective feeling of having made an error, or whether this subjective fe eling results from the 
attribution of the perceived expectation violation to a cause. Instead of only asking participants 
to judge the correctness of their typing after typing the letters, they were asked to first judge 
whether their typing matched their e xpectations. When a participant reported that their typing 
14 
 
differed from their expectations, they were asked to choose between two alternatives: a) they 
had to decide whether the strange sensation was due to a mistake being made or to some other 
non-specific cause, b) they had to decide whether the strange sensati on was due to a mistake 
being made or to a strange sequence of letters in the word. Two conditions were thus 
manipulated: a non-specific origin of the strange sensation vs. a specific origin of the strange 
sensation. Results showed that in the unspecific condition, the rates of false alarms (i.e., respond 
that the stimulus is present when it is not)  and misses (i.e., the stimulus is present but there is 
no response) were higher for pseudo -words—hard to pronounce (unfelt fluency) but easy to 
type (felt fluency) —than for lexical words. By contrast, in the specific condition (given an 
increased rate of misses for pseudo -words), the rate of false alarms did not differ bet ween 
pseudo-words and lexical words. This is particularly interesting, because it is the fal se alarms 
that are based on an attribution of a cause when a strange feeling during typing is experienced. 
Conversely, for misses, a judgment about a cause is not necessary, because it corresponds to 
the situation in which participants decided they did not  commit an error, even though an error 
was made. As the authors point out, the results of this experiment provide clear evidence that 
participants do not rely on only the error signal when they have to judge whether or not they 
correctly typed a word. Rather, they seem to be influenced by perceiving a discrepancy between 
expected fluency and experienced fluency of their processing, which they then resolve by 
searching for a cause that can best explain the current situation (i.e., answer the question asked). 
In short, the judgment of having made an error is, by itself, the result of an attribution of a cause 
associated with expected fluency which turned into experienced fluency. 
In short, all these experiments show that the phenomenological perception of a gap 
directs attention, and that the fluency experienced is merely the consequence of a non -felt 
fluency or an expected fluency. This is why we consider that there is a close similarity between 
what the SCAPE model tells us about cognitive functioning, via the discrepancy hypothesis, 
15 
 
and the theoretical framework of active inference. Indeed, according to the active inference 
account, these experiments support the idea that non-felt fluency or expected fluency leads, via 
the heightening of felt fluency, to a revision of precision expectations (i.e., surprise or 
unresolved prediction errors); namely, an active updating of attentional set.  Consequently, the 
results observed following the presence of a gap between non -felt fluency and felt fluency 
resonate with the principles of active infe rence. Thereafter, we shall refer to unfelt fluency as 
non-felt fluency. 
 
Unfelt and felt fluency in active inference 
According to the discrepancy attribution hypothesis and active inference framework it 
seems obvious that surprise plays a key role in cognitive processing. It is important to specify 
that surprise is not a state (i.e., an emotional state of mind induced by an unexpected event). 
Surprise is an attribute of sensations, technically known as self-information or surprisal (Levy, 
2008; Tribus, 1961): it is a warning signal which, on the one hand, informs the system that there 
is a gap between what is observed and what is predicted and, on the other hand, leads a 
redeployment of attention to the unfolding of the process being inferred. In short, the more a 
prediction is contradicted by the sensory evidence, the more sensitive we are to the ensuing 
prediction errors. As a result, it follows a stimulus-bound change in attentional set. 
 These subpersonal changes can then be recognised as unfelt fluency ; namely non -
conscient recognising a change in attentional set; i.e., recognising when our attention is drawn 
to something we cannot explain —or did not predict. On this reading, unfelt fluency  is 
phenomenologically transparent (surprise) until it is rendered opaque by the mental action that 
attends its recognition, felt fluency . Mental action in this instance refers to top -down or 
endogenous attention (Limanowski, 2017; Limanowski, 2022; Limanowski and Blankenburg, 
2013; Metzinger, 2003) . In other words, although felt fluency  may be phenomenologically 
16 
 
transparent, it may render unfelt fluency opaque, in the sense that I can report “I lost a fluent 
grip on this task because my attention was distracted”. The explicit nature of felt versus unfelt 
fluency is not unlike the distinction between endogenous and exogenous attention. Please see 
(Jiang et al., 2013; Limanowski, 2017; Solms and Friston, 2018) for further discussion. 
To our knowledge, there are relatively few studies that illustrate the importance of unfelt 
fluency for active sensing and perceptual synthesis . If the work of the Whittlesea’s team has 
paved the way, it is, in our opinion, a direction of travel where the discrepancy between what 
is expected and what is perceived does not directly concern the processing of stimuli but how 
these stimuli are processed. Indeed, these studies allow us to understand, on one hand, that the 
cognitive system considers the fluency felt regardless of its origin and, on other hand, that unfelt 
fluency underwrites perceptual synthesis because it operates as a non -conscious process that 
orients attention, even if its origin is not the stimulus processed (but rather the precision with 
which stimuli can be predicted).  
The emerging story here is that there is an intimate relationship between hierarchical 
predictive processing; particularly of precision, fluency and attention during an active 
engagement with the sensorium. In brief, we have pointed to evidence that sugges ts the 
estimation of the precision of various sources of evidence (e.g., prediction errors) in Bayesian 
belief updating in the brain is crucial for an optimal balance of prior beliefs and sensory 
evidence. This optimal balance rests on predicting the preci sion of prediction errors in 
perceptual hierarchies that, when optimal, constitutes unfelt fluency . From a psychological 
perspective, this can be likened to exogenous attention. In a hierarchical setting, the 
recognition—and implicitly instantiation—of optimal precision renders unfelt fluency opaque 
and implies a hierarchically deeper representation of fluency; namely felt fluency . Because 
predictive coding formulations of active inference rest upon ascending prediction errors and 
descending predictions, felt fluency can be read as  inferring some fluent processing at lower 
17 
 
hierarchical levels while, at the same time, issuing top-down predictions that place priors over 
the mediation of unfelt fluency; namely, precision at lower levels of the hierarchy. Because, 
neurobiologically, this kind of precision control is thought to be mediated by modulatory 
neurotransmitter systems: e.g., monoaminergic systems such as dopamine, norepinephrine, et 
cetera (Moran et al., 2013; Parr and Friston, 2017a) , there is a close connection between the 
notion of felt fluency and felt uncertainty as articulated in certain applications of active inference 
to sentient behaviour (Solms, 2018). For example, Solms (2019) assimilates consciousness to a 
sense of uncertainty. In Solms’ thesis, felt uncertainty is mediated by ascending 
neuromodulatory systems which represent the dénouement of hierarchical processing in the 
brain (Solms, 2021).  
To summarize, the theoretical considerations concerning active inference, in particular 
the need for the organism to make predictions about its own predictions on the one hand, and 
to assess the precision of its predictions on the other hand, have allowed us to propose that 
unfelt fluency  is used to assess the precision of our predictions and the feeling of fluency 
supervenes on —or is an attributional inference about —the resulting optimisation of active 
inference; i.e., fluent or skilled exchange with the sensorium, which is experienced as a precise 
grip on the world of affordances (Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014).  
 
Conclusion 
The aim of this paper was to propose, based on both theoretical  considerations and 
experimental works, that felt fluency, the subjective metacognitive experience associated to the 
causes of the ongoing process,  can be read as recognising and contextualising unfelt fluency; 
where unfelt fluency optimises predictions of the precision of sensory processing. On this view 
it is unfelt fluency that instantiates attention, in response to unresolved prediction errors or 
surprise. 
18 
 
In summary, our sentient behaviour can be understood in terms of active inference under 
a generative model that includes a certain cognitive set called fluency. This cognitive (or  
attentional) set is both cause and consequence  of a fluent, precise predictive processing of 
sensory exchanges with the world. It is a cause because it provides top -down—i.e., prior—
constraints on the precision of processing at lower levels of the hierarchy. These predictions of 
precision ensure the (Bayes) optimal deployment of a ttention and, consequently, precise and 
confident action selection. At the same time, it is a consequence of lower-level processing when 
prediction errors are lower than predicted. This “prediction error of prediction errors” furnishes 
bottom-up messages that revise (Bayesian) beliefs about cognitive or  attentional set, and a 
suitable adjustment of the precision at lower levels. See (Feldman and Friston, 2010; Kanai et 
al., 2015; Parr and Friston, 2017b, 2019; Parr et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2019b)  for a technical 
discussion and illustration using simulations and numerical experiments.  In other words, 
changes in unfelt fluency (i.e., precision) induce felt fluency.  
The key aspect of this context -sensitive predictive processing is that the cause of felt 
fluency—c.f.: felt uncertainty (Solms, 2018) —arises from internal inferences about the 
precision of predictive processing, not the sensorium. This means that a sense of fluency cannot 
be attributed to its subpersonal cause —and is therefore plausibly attributed to the sensorium. 
This formulation gracefully accommodates attribution theories of fluency while, at the same 
time, emphasising the cau sal role of changes in the precision or unfelt fluency of predictive 
processing. A closely related perspective on the key role of inferred precision can be foun d in 
computational accounts of phenomenology and metacognition. For example, (Sandved-Smith 
et al., 2021) offer a computational phenomenology of mental action, modelling meta-awareness 
and attentional control that is formally consistent with the current account of fluency. 
Specifically, the authors propose a model of meta -awareness and attentional control usi ng 
hierarchical active inference. They “cast mental action as policy selection over higher -level 
19 
 
cognitive states and add a further hierarchical level to model meta -awareness states that 
modulate the expected confidence (precision) in the mapping between observations and hidden 
cognitive states.” In so doing, they differentiate between “the capacity t o explicitly notice the 
current content of consciousness” (c.f., felt fluency) and attentional processes per se (c.f., unfelt 
fluency). 
Having made these connections, we proposed that unfelt fluency could be considered as 
the cue that increases precision in our own predictions because it is the cause of inferences. To 
support this proposition, we have presented several experiments that endorse this view. Firstly, 
it seems that the cognitive system is nothing more than an inferential process associated with 
the monitoring and recognition of the ongoing process and the resulting subjective feeling of 
(felt) fluency. Secondly, it seems that cognitive system  uses felt fluency, which supervenes 
on—and contextualises—unfelt fluency, for attributing precision to its inferences (predictions). 
Thirdly, unfelt fluency seems to underwrite a foundational kind of cognitive or attentional set, 
since it is used even  when not directly related to the processed stimulus but to the ongoing 
process associated with the individual's activity.  
If the core role of inference advanced by von Helmholtz —that any mental state  is 
realised by unconscious inference—then the causes of the subjective (conscious) inference must 
have unconscious perceptual precursors. It was James (1890) who suggested that consciousness 
was preceded by a state of pre-consciousness, called the fringe of consciousness, which shapes 
this consciousness  (see, Mangan, 2003) . On the current view 7, this fringe of consciousness 
would include unfelt fluency; namely, the subpersonal (possibly pre -conscious) changes in 
precision at low levels of hierarchical processing. This level of processing has a crucial and 
adaptive function because it signals whether or not you need to allocate more attention to 
ongoing processes.

Perspective 
We have pursued the idea that the experience of fluent processing reflects the degree to 
which beliefs are updated. Our theoretical treatment of fluency rests upon current formulations 
of the predictive brain, with a special focus on the encoding of uncertainty — or its complement, 
precision (e.g., inverse variance). This theore tical treatment can be contrasted with more 
descriptive approaches to the Bayesian brain and rational (or bounded rational) decision -
making: e.g., (Ernst and Banks, 2002; Kahneman and Tversky, 1973) . Predictive coding (and 
active inference) commits to a neuronal process theory that foregrounds the explicit 
estimation—and neuronal representation —of Bayesian beliefs  (Friston et al., 2017a; Shipp, 
2016). Bayesian beliefs in this setting are subpersonal (i.e., they are not propositional or folk 
psychology beliefs): they are implicit probability distributions encoded by neuronal activity and 
synaptic gain (Friston et al., 2006). This is an important issue from two perspectives. 
First, there is an explicit appeal to priors in the ensuing Bayesian inference that explains 
apparently irrational decision-making in terms of hierarchical inference. In other words, unlike 
appeals to Bayesian statistics as a description of decision-making, c.f., (Gardner, 2019), active 
inference tries to explain any given (e.g., perceptual) decision in terms of the appropriate priors 
that are inherited from experience: technically, for any given choice behaviour and loss function 
there are always some Bayesian priors that render the behaviour Bayes optimal—this is known 
as the complete class theorem  (Brown, 1981; Wald, 1947) . Second, this neuronally plausible 
explanation for belief updating foregrounds the importance of encoding a belief that includes 
its precision. This is the key aspect of the current account of felt and unfelt fluency that rests 
upon the observation that belief updating entails estimating or inferring the precision of beliefs. 
This precision can be read as a subpersonal ‘confidence’ in various beliefs or expectations 
during belief updating (Bays and Wolpert, 2007; Feldman and Friston, 2010; Limanowski and 
Friston, 2018; Mathys et al., 2011; Moran et al., 2013). However, optimising this subpersonal, 
21 
 
unfelt ‘confidence’ rests on mental action, which equips it with a certain phenomenology that 
we associate with felt fluency.
