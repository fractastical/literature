Since the early experimental studies of the late 19th century, research on unconscious 
perception has been shaped by persistent methodological challenges and evolving 
experimental approaches aimed at demonstrating perception without awareness. 
In this review, we will discuss some of the most relevant challenges researchers 
have faced in demonstrating unconscious perception, and examine how different 
measures of awareness (e.g., objective vs. subjective) yield different awareness 
thresholds—often leading to two alternative approaches to demonstrating 
unconscious perception. We will further explore new methodologies in the field, 
such as regression-based Bayesian modeling, sensitivity vs. awareness (SvA) curves 
derived from General Recognition Theory (GRT), the liminal-prime paradigm, and 
two-interval forced choice (2IFC) designs. Finally, we emphasize the need for 
brain-based approaches to unconscious perception and discussed some promising 
studies in this area, while also highlighting the role of individual differences and 
alternative frameworks such as predictive coding and active inference views in 
future research. Overall, the new approaches and methodologies discussed here 
will advance the field by addressing the challenges inherent in demonstrating 
cognition in the absence of awareness.

1 Unconscious perception: a journey of 
methodological struggles
To what extent can information outside our consciousness influence our behavior? Since 
the early experimental studies in the late 19th century (Pierce and Jastrow, 1884; Sidis, 1898), 
research on unconscious perception has been shaped by persistent methodological 
challenges and shifts in experimental approaches to demonstrate perception without 
awareness1 (Jimenez et al., 2023; Rothkirch and Hesselmann, 2017; Shanks and John, 1994; 
Y aron et al., 2024). As Michel (2023) illustrates, the scientific study of the unconscious mind 
1 Note that in the present article, the terms ‘consciousness’ and ‘awareness’ will be treated interchangeably, 
referring to the subjective experience of perceiving a stimulus. Similarly, ‘unconscious perception’ and 
‘unconscious processing’ will be also used as synonyms, the latter understood as unconscious stimulus 
processing.

seems to parallel the myth of Sisyphus: Researchers advance the 
‘unconscious rock’ toward the summit, only to see it regress, 
requiring the effort to begin anew. In this review, we focus on the 
field of unconscious (visual) perception. Note, however, that the 
study of unconscious cognition expands to other domains, such as 
language, emotion, attention or memory (see Mudrik and Deouell, 
2022, for a review). Within memory research, for example, the 
processing of implicit memories ab Cheesman out behavior or even 
the activation of memories without their expression (an aspect 
equivalent to how encoded information affects behavior without 
conscious access) has been demonstrated (Delorenzi et al., 2014). A 
substantial body of research has examined how implicit 
information—particularly emotional stimuli—can affect decision-
making processes without entering conscious awareness ( Bernal 
et al., 2022; Morris et al., 1998). The field of implicit learning is also 
a fruitful area of research within experimental psychology (see 
Shanks, 2005, for a review).
This struggle is evident in the shifting methodologies over time. 
Early studies, for instance, relied on introspective reports as a valid 
scientific approach to studying mental states. Under this approach, an 
introspective report of ‘no awareness’ combined with above-chance 
performance on an objective (e.g., stimulus discrimination) task was 
taken as evidence for unconscious perception (the so-called blindsight 
phenomenon). Throughout the first half of the 20th century, 
researchers in both visual and auditory domains contrasted subjective 
and objective tasks to dissociate awareness and performance (Baker, 
1938; Miller, 1939; Stevens, 1935; Stevens et al., 1937; Williams, 1938; 
see Adams, 1957, for a review).
The approach shifted following Eriksen’s (1960) methodological 
critique. He strongly rejected introspection as a valid measure of 
awareness, arguing that subjective reports might primarily reflect a 
participant’s response criterion rather than subjective experience, 
while being highly susceptibility to response biases ( Eriksen, 1960; 
Jimenez et al., 2020; Kouider and Dehaene, 2007). Eriksen’s critique 
highlighted the importance of valid measures of (un)awareness. This 
led to the development of the classic dissociation paradigm 
(Reingold and Merikle, 1988 ; Schmidt and Biafora, 2024 ), which 
aimed to demonstrate unconscious perception by comparing 
performance, typically in terms of priming or facilitation effects 
(indirect measure), and an awareness measure on the same stimuli 
(direct measures). Y et this new approach also raised several 
methodological concerns ( Holender, 1986; Kouider and Dehaene, 
2007; Jimenez et al., 2023 ). Perhaps one of the most relevant raised 
doubts about whether a subset of ‘conscious’ participants was 
influencing the observed perfomance effect. ( Harris et  al., 2011 ; 
Jimenez et  al., 2017 ; Muscarella et  al., 2013 ; Shanks, 2017 ). 
Furthermore, this procedure rests on the acceptance of the null 
hypotheses with regard to zero awareness, which is problematic for 
statistical reasons (Schmidt, 2007).
Different solutions to the dissociation paradigm have been 
proposed over the years (e.g., Snodgrass et al., 2004; Reingold, 2004). 
One solution is to look for double dissociations in terms of qualitatively 
different effects of an experimental manipulation on direct and indirect 
measures, for instance a manipulation produces an increase of the 
direct measures, but a decrease of the indirect measure ( Schmidt, 
2007). In addition, the development of different new experimental 
techniques, such as regression-based methods (Greenwald et al., 1995; 
Goldstein et al., 2022) or Jacoby’s process dissociation procedure (PDP) 
(Jacoby, 1991) tried to overcome some of these problems.2 However, 
proving the existence of perception without awareness has proved 
more challenging than anticipated. In the following sections, we will 
discuss the main obstacles researchers have faced to prove perception 
in the absence of awareness, as we  present some interesting new 
methodological approaches that may advance research within the field.
2 Different measures of awareness 
produce different thresholds of 
awareness
Evaluating unconscious processing requires a reliable measure of 
conscious perception. Y et the two most used methods −subjective 
reports and objective forced-choice stimulus detection/
discrimination−do not always agree, as observers can sometimes 
discriminate stimuli they rated invisible. It is a long-held view that 
subjective and objective measures of awareness seem to reflect 
different thresholds of awareness (for a critical discussion, see Kiefer 
and Kammer, 2024).
Awareness thresholds refer to the minimum stimulus conditions 
required for conscious perception (Merikle et al., 2001). When using 
a subjective measure of visual awareness −such as asking participants 
to report their visual experience− a subjective threshold is established, 
whereby a participant is considered unaware if they report having ‘no 
perception’ of the stimulus (Timmermans and Cleeremans, 2015). In 
contrast, objective measures define unawareness based on the inability 
to discriminate between stimuli (e.g., chance performance) in an 
objective task. The distinction between objective and subjective 
thresholds has commonly led to the differentiation of different stages 
in visual processing: a participant may be objectively unconscious of a 
stimulus when their discrimination performance is at chance level, 
subjectively unconscious if they report ‘no perception’ of a stimulus, 
with either chance or above-chance discrimination performance, and 
(partially or fully) conscious, which would imply both above-chance 
discrimination and subjective ‘seen’ reports (e.g., both above objective 
and subjective thresholds; Lamme, 2020).
Under this classical approach, the objective threshold is often 
considered a more conservative estimate of awareness (Merikle et al., 
2001) and consciousness development is considered as linear, from 
2 Jacoby’s Process Dissociation Procedure (PDP) ( Jacoby, 1991) aims to 
separate and quantify conscious and unconscious influences on performance. 
The rationale behind the procedure is that unconscious processes are 
influenced by a briefly shown priming word. In an ‘inclusion task’, both 
unconscious and conscious processes contribute to reporting the target word. 
In contrast, in an ‘exclusion task’, unconscious processes lead to reporting the 
primed word, while conscious processes work to avoid it. By comparing 
performance across the two tasks, the relative contributions of conscious and 
unconscious processes can be assessed. The PDP has been criticized for being 
most useful for certain types of tasks (e.g., memory vs. perception; Visser and 
Merikle, 1999) and on the assumption that implicit and explicit processes 
operating independently (Curran and Hintzman, 1995). The exhaustiveness of 
the PDP has been also questioned, as knowledge revealed in the exclusion 
task (which is assumed to be unconscious) may be reported as being weakly 
conscious in subjective tests.

objectively unconscious to subjectively unconscious and ultimately 
conscious states. This long-held view, however, may be oversimplified 
and inconsistent with recent findings. For example, Kiefer et al. (2023a, 
2023b) found that the thresholds for objective and subjective measures 
of awareness converge, a pattern also noted by others (Jimenez et al., 
2023; Schmidt and Biafora, 2024). Furthermore, Kiefer and Kammer 
(2024) argue that the relationship between subjective and objective 
measures is complex, with subjective thresholds sometimes preceding 
objective ones. These authors propose three possible scenarios for the 
relationship between subjective and objective awareness thresholds. In 
the first scenario, subjective thresholds lag behind objective ones. 
Here, early objective performance might reflect fast unconscious 
processing, while subjective measures require more time for visual 
consolidation and a specific conscious experience. Alternatively, only 
subjective measures could depend on meta-cognitive evaluations, 
adding an extra processing step. In the second scenario, objective 
measures lag behind subjective ones, as subjective measures capture a 
broader range of sensory experiences. In the third scenario, subjective 
and objective thresholds converge (see Kiefer and Kammer, 2024, for 
a discussion). In fact, there is empirical support for all three scenarios. 
Among these lines, Prieto et al. (2025) recently introduced a novel 
paradigm where both objective and subjective awareness of the prime 
was gathered on a trial-by-trial basis. Their results showed that, when 
converted to a common sensitivity measure ( d’), objective and 
subjective awareness measures collected during both the priming and 
visibility blocks showed comparable values within the same block, 
strong correlations both within and across blocks, and, crucially, were 
responsive to variations in prime visibility linked to attentional 
differences arising from distinct task demands (Prieto et al., 2025). As 
discussed, this new evidence suggests that when converted to a 
common sensitivity measure (d’), objective and subjective awareness 
measures might provide a comparable index of observers’ awareness.
In sum, the observed variability might arise from methodological 
differences across studies, where objective measures may be influenced 
by unconscious response tendencies depending on the task. Y et for the 
research of unconscious perception to advance, the specific relation 
between subjective and objective thresholds of awareness needs to 
be fully understood.
3 Testing unconscious perception: 
two alternative approaches
The debate on demonstrating perception without awareness seems 
to rest largely on differing assumptions about how to establish 
evidence for unconscious perception. Using an objective threshold to 
measure awareness assumes that any d’ > 0 (i.e., above-chance 
stimulus discrimination) indicates conscious awareness of the stimuli. 
In contrast, a subjective threshold—based on participants’ self-reported 
lack of awareness—interprets any d’ > 0 as evidence of unconscious 
perception, provided it coincides with a “no awareness” report.
As discussed above, early attempts in the field leaned on the 
implementation of subjective thresholds to demonstrate subliminal 
perception (Pierce and Jastrow, 1884; Sidis, 1898). A classic example 
is the work by Pierce and Jastrow (1884) , who had participants 
compare finger pressures and rate their subjective experience on a 0 
to 3 scale. Despite reporting no awareness, participants performed 
above chance in distinguishing the stimuli, suggesting non-conscious 
influences on behavior. Similarly, Sidis (1898) found that participants 
who reported seeing only a faint blur of alphanumeric characters 
could still identify them better than chance, reinforcing the idea of 
unconscious perception. This approach quickly became popular and 
several studies on the visual and auditory domains followed during 
the first half of the 20th century (Baker, 1938; Miller, 1939; Stevens, 
1935; Stevens et  al., 1937; Williams, 1938; see Adams, 1957, for a 
review). A longstanding concern has been that the subjective measures 
used by Peirce, Jastrow, and later researchers to assess awareness are 
invalid (Eriksen, 1960). While some researchers (e.g., Marcel, 1983) 
later claimed to employ an objective measure of awareness to 
demonstrate unconscious cognition (e.g., semantic priming), this 
turned out not to be  the case. In addition, this study considered 
performance below 60% accuracy as indicative of unawareness, 
despite chance level being 50%. When awareness was assessed using 
stricter criteria, Cheesman and Merikle (1985)  failed to replicate 
Marcel’s findings (see also Kouider and Dehaene, 2007). Accordingly, 
some views challenge the existence of unconscious perception 
(Persuh, 2018; Phillips, 2021), proposing that a conscious-perception-
only model should be treated as the default or null hypothesis.
After Eriksen (1960) , participants’ introspection was no longer 
accepted as a valid measure of awareness. This led to the 
development and adoption of a more rigorous framework, which 
would operationalize the absence of awareness through an 
objective awareness threshold ( Reingold and Merikle, 1988 ; 
Schmidt and Biafora, 2024 ). Under this new approach, any above-
chance stimulus discrimination (i.e., d’ > 0) would indicate 
conscious awareness of the stimuli, and was mainly implemented 
through a dissociation paradigm, where observers completed a 
discrimination task on a probe stimulus (performance measure) 
first and subsequently assessed their awareness of the primes 
(awareness measure). If prime discrimination is at chance but 
those same invisible primes facilitate (or interfere with) probe 
responses (e.g., priming effects are found), it suggests the visual 
system processes information without conscious awareness. 
Several problems with this new framework were quickly brought 
forward. According to the retrospective assessment  or immediacy 
problem, the awareness measures may not capture information 
processed unconsciously due to memory decay ( Shanks and John, 
1994; Newell and Shanks, 2014 ). The information relevance 
criterion  stresses that awareness measures must assess information 
directly related to task performance; and the sensitivity criterion  
requires performance and awareness measures to be  equally 
responsive to relevant stimuli. One of the main issues is that group 
visibility is often not at strict chance level, which has led to post-
hoc data selection , where only participants below a certain 
awareness threshold are analyzed ( Rothkirch et al., 2022 ; Shanks, 
2017). This produces statistical artefacts such as regression to the 
mean (RttM). 3 Lastly, the absence of significant awareness effects 
3 Post-hoc data selection has been commonly used in unconscious 
perception studies when the overall group’s visibility is not at strict chance-
level, making it impossible to infer a lack of awareness of the prime. In such 
cases, data from participants whose awareness scores fall below a specific 
threshold (usually chance-level in the prime visibility task) are analyzed 
separately. For this “unaware” group, their average performance score is then

was often misinterpreted as evidence of unconscious processing, 
because it rests on the problematic acceptance of the statistical null 
hypothesis as outlined above ( Reingold and Merikle, 1988 ; 
Schmidt and Vorberg, 2006 ; Shanks, 2017 ; see Jimenez et al., 2025 , 
for a review). Beyond these methodological issues, a deeper 
concern lies in the assumption underlying the use of objective 
thresholds of awareness: while any d ′ > 0 (i.e., above-chance 
stimulus discrimination) is typically interpreted as evidence of 
conscious awareness of the stimuli, it cannot be ruled out that such 
above-chance performance may instead reflect the very 
unconscious influences it aims to demonstrate, rather than 
conscious perception per se ( Merikle et al., 2001 ). As clearly put 
by Micher et  al. (2024) , the key debate lies on whether the 
discrepancy between objective and subjective thresholds reflects a 
contamination of subjective reports by conscious perception or 
whether forced-choice discrimination performance is influenced 
by unconscious processing. It’s important to recognize that 
questioning whether forced-choice discrimination is affected by 
unconscious processing presupposes the existence of unconscious 
processing (for a discussion, see Koivisto and Neuvonen, 2020 ). 
As discussed above, modern psychology has gone through 
recurring cycles of excitement about unconscious perception, 
followed by waves of skepticism and criticism ( Holender, 1986 ; 
Overgaard and Timmermans, 2010 ; Irvine, 2012 ; Michel, 2019 ). 
Some views challenge the existence of unconscious perception 
(Persuh, 2018 ; Phillips, 2021 ), proposing that a conscious-
perception-only model should be treated as the default or null 
hypothesis. According to this, it is reasonable to begin with 
skepticism toward claims of unconscious perception, and it is 
therefore up to those who support the existence of unconscious 
perception to present strong and convincing evidence to support 
their position ( Phillips, 2021 ).
4 Breaking the stalemate: new 
methodological approaches to 
subliminal perception
To overcome some of the issues with the dissociation paradigm, 
several studies implemented subjective awareness reports within the 
‘performance measure’ itself (e.g., Kiefer et al., 2023a; Sabary et al., 
2020; Van den Bussche et  al., 2013 ). This allows for participants’ 
awareness reports being gathered on a trial-by-trial basis within the 
priming task, addressing the immediacy problem by collecting both 
performance and awareness measures simultaneously. Subjective 
measures, unlike objective ones, are more directly tied to conscious 
calculated. If significant priming effects are observed in this subset, unconscious 
perception is concluded. However, this method is controversial and strongly 
discouraged (Rothkirch et al., 2022; Shanks, 2017; though see Sklar et al., 2021 
for an alternative perspective), as it can lead to regression to the mean (RttM). 
This statistical issue arises because selecting participants based on their 
awareness scores and then using those same scores to calculate mean 
awareness introduces a bias, essentially “double-dipping” and distorting the 
analysis due to non-random sampling of measurement errors ( Rothkirch 
et al., 2022).
perception (Dehaene and Naccache, 2001; Merikle et al., 2001; Persuh, 
2018). However, using subjective measures in masked priming has 
methodological drawbacks, including susceptibility to response biases 
(Eriksen, 1960 ; Merikle et  al., 2001 ) and criterion confounds 
(Bachmann, 2015; Kahneman, 1968). Shifts in response criteria can 
bias awareness reports, even within the same experiment (Jimenez 
et al., 2020, 2023). Moreover, incorporating online subjective reports 
introduces a dual-task paradigm, potentially slowing probe latencies 
(Jimenez et al., 2023; Kiefer et al., 2023a), weakening prime-probe 
links (e.g., Ansorge et al., 2011) and even abolishing priming effects 
(Kiefer et al., 2023a ; Wentura et al., 2025). This can also induce a 
conservative awareness criterion (‘c’ in SDT; Macmillan and Creelman, 
2004), likely due to the high cognitive load and difficulty in attending 
to both prime and probe stimuli.
Overall, the methodological challenges highlighted above stress 
the ongoing need for better approaches to uncover unconscious 
stimulus processing. Several new techniques have recently emerged, 
some refining the classic dissociation paradigm ( Goldstein et  al., 
2022), particularly requesting double dissociations (Schmidt, 2007), 
and others implementing new methodologies to assess visual stimulus 
discrimination without awareness based on participants’ self-reported 
lack of awareness (e.g., subjective thresholds; Pournaghdali et  al., 
2023). For example, Goldstein et  al. (2022)  proposed a Bayesian 
generative model to estimate the intercept in a regression model while 
accounting for error in awareness and effect measurements. This 
model builds on Greenwald et al.'s (1995) regression method, which 
addresses a common pitfall within the field (e.g., post-hoc data 
selection; Y aron et al., 2024) and helps model unconscious priming 
effects by adjusting prime awareness values. However, previous studies 
have shown that the Greenwald regression often overestimates the 
unconscious effect (Dosher, 1998; Klauer et al., 1998). To resolve this, 
Goldstein et al. ’s Bayesian model corrects for measurement errors in 
both awareness and effect measurements, offering a more accurate 
estimate of the unconscious priming effect (Jimenez et al., 2023; Prieto 
et al., 2025).
A novel method by Pournaghdali et  al. (2023)  reinterprets 
sensitivity measures (d’) to reflect performance in the prime visibility 
task rather than degree of awareness. In this work, participants 
discriminated emotional expressions in masked faces, with online 
subjective awareness measures collected. Using General Recognition 
Theory (GRT), the authors created sensitivity vs. awareness (SvA) 
curves, which linked sensitivity ( d’) for emotional expression 
discrimination to the relative likelihood of no awareness (RLNA). A 
d’ > 0 with high RLNA indicated unconscious processing, leading 
Pournaghdali et al. (2023) to conclude that unconscious processing of 
facial emotion occurred, evidenced by sensitivity above chance levels 
in areas with low awareness probability.
Micher et al. (2024) revisited a dissociation in masked response 
priming from the liminal-prime paradigm (Avneon and Lamy, 2018; 
Kimchi et al., 2018; Lamy et al., 2019; Micher and Lamy, 2023), where 
invisible primes affect only fast responses (50% of fastest trials; 
RTs ≈ 550 ms), while visible primes influence both fast and slow 
responses (50% of slowest trials; RTs ≈ 700 ms). Their results 
replicated this pattern: consciously perceived primes produced 
priming across all response times, whereas “invisible” primes did so 
only in fast trials. Notably, discrimination of “invisible” primes was 
above chance, suggesting that forced-choice responses may reflect 
unconscious processing rather than true awareness.
Jimenez et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1626223
Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org
Note that the different approaches presented to this point may 
still face persistent methodological limitations. Goldstein et  al. 
(2022) acknowledge that their framework, while modeling 
measurement error, might still misattribute effects to non-conscious 
processing if a few conscious trials—especially in the so-called 
“subliminal” phase—influence the results. In their simulations, they 
argue it is unlikely but concede it’s possible. In addition, Goldstein’s 
method hinges on the accuracy of the awareness task. If this task is 
too insensitive (e.g., due to being overly difficult or relying on poor 
constructs), participants may appear unaware when they actually 
have some awareness. That can mislead the framework into 
labelling effects as unconscious.
Pournaghdali et  al.'s (2023)  Sensitivity vs. Awareness (SvA) 
framework also faces some limitations. In Experiment 1, the authors 
themselves note that the low number of “aware” trials may constrain 
the robustness of their GRT model fit and subsequent SvA curve 
estimation. When key regions in the awareness continuum are under-
sampled, the model’s inferences—especially about nonconscious 
sensitivity—may be unstable or overfit. In addition, this approach 
involves fitting multiple GRT variants and selecting the best via AIC, 
but with high fit percentages (~98–99%) and many parameters, there’s 
a risk the model is capturing noise or idiosyncrasies rather than 
genuine underlying processes. Overfitting could lead to spurious 
sensitivity in low-awareness regions. In addition, the SvA curve relies 
on the “optimal observer” criterion to demarcate low vs. high 
likelihood of awareness, a boundary that depends on assumptions 
about noise distributions and observer optimality. If those assumptions 
are incorrect—as could happen across individuals or conditions—the 
demarcation becomes somewhat arbitrary, affecting what is considered 
“unconscious” processing.
Results by Micher et al. (2024) could be alternatively interpreted, 
as the primes rated as “invisible” could have been processed in manner 
that generated a weaker signal (due to variations in the level of 
attention from trial to trial, for example), showing effects only on fast 
trials. In addition, the content of consciousness may have differed in 
those trials, resulting in “invisible” categorization—a possibility that 
relates back to criterion confounds associated with subjective 
measures of awareness.
The confidence forced-choice paradigm or two-interval forced 
choice (2IFC) paradigm has been recently proposed as a bias-
resistant method for studying confidence, where participants make 
two perceptual judgments and select the one they believe is more 
accurate ( Barthelmé and Mamassian, 2010 ; Mamassian, 2016 , 
2020; Peters and Lau, 2015 ; de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2014 ). 
Using this novel approach, Peters and Lau (2015)  found no 
indication of unconscious processing, as indexed by above-chance 
accurate responding for stimuli rated as subjectively unaware; 
whenever subjects discriminated the stimuli above chance, they 
were subjectively aware of the stimuli. Note that some questions 
have been raised about this method (see Phillips, 2021 , for a 
discussion). While considered largely free from response biases 
(Mamassian, 2020 ; Michel, 2023 ; see Jimenez et al., 2025 , for a 
review), it has been criticized for the “criterion content fallacy”—
mistakenly assuming that conscious awareness of any stimulus 
aspect implies awareness of task-relevant features ( Michel, 2023 ; 
Rajananda et  al., 2020 ). This issue extends to retrospective 
awareness reports like the perceptual awareness scale (PAS), where 
minimal visibility ratings (e.g., “brief glimpse”) are often treated 
as conscious perception, even though unconscious processing of 
task-relevant features remains possible ( Bergström and Eriksson, 
2014; King et al., 2016 ; Soto et al., 2011 ; Trübutschek et al., 2019 ). 
To address this issue, an enhanced version of the 2IFC paradigm 
has been developed ( Amerio et  al., 2023 ; Elosegi et  al., 2024 ; 
Rajananda et al., 2020 ), in which both intervals contain stimuli but 
only one includes the task-relevant feature. If participants 
discriminate above chance despite reporting equal visibility across 
intervals, this is taken as evidence of unconscious perception 
(Amerio et al., 2023 ).
5 Neural correlates of unconscious 
perception: the need for brain-based 
evidence
A comprehensive understanding of perception without awareness 
should take advantage of recent developments in neuroimaging 
techniques. Ideally, we  could aim to identify the neural correlates 
associated to different unconscious states: the neural correlates for 
fully unconscious stimuli, those associated with objectively 
unconscious stimuli, and the neural correlates for subjectively 
unconscious stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI), Stein et  al. (2021)  have linked subjective and objective 
awareness states to distinct neural patterns. The findings suggest that 
while both objectively and subjectively invisible stimuli are represented 
in the visual cortex, the extent of unconscious processing depends on 
the measurement method. For subjectively invisible stimuli, a 
posterior-to-anterior gradient is observed in the visual cortex, with 
stronger category information in the ventrotemporal cortex than in 
early visual cortex. In contrast, for objectively invisible stimuli, 
category information remains nearly the same from early visual areas 
to object- and category-selective regions. However, as mask contrast 
was much higher for the objectively invisible than for the subjectively 
invisible condition, the interpretation of these results in terms of a 
dissociation of the neural substrate of subjective vs. objective 
invisibility is compromised. While more research is needed on brain 
activity linked to unconscious states, these findings may refine current 
neural theories of consciousness.
The use of machine learning (ML) models in neuroimaging 
analysis has opened new avenues for studying consciousness (Haynes, 
2009). These models are not only advancing research on conscious 
experience but are also being applied to unconscious processing. A 
recent proposal suggests that brain-based measures may be used to 
pinpoint the presence of unconscious knowledge associated with null 
perceptual sensitivity ( Soto et  al., 2019 ). This method isolates 
unconscious representations by analyzing brain activity patterns when 
behavioral measures show no sensitivity. Techniques include transfer 
learning—where models trained on conscious items identify 
unconscious knowledge—and computational comparisons of 
conscious and unconscious representations. Supporting this, Mei et al. 
(2022) decoded unconscious image categories (living vs. non-living) 
from distributed multi-voxel patterns in the ventral visual pathway 
and parieto-frontal regions.
A complementary research line investigates dissociations between 
subjective and objective measures of visual awareness based on their

neural foundations (Di Gregorio et al., 2022; Di Luzio et al., 2022 ; 
Trajkovic et al., 2023; Mazor et al., 2022). Using decoding analyses on 
functional brain imaging data, Mazor et  al. (2022)  found that 
prefrontal representations of subjective visibility are influenced by 
decision confidence, emphasizing the need to control for confidence 
in awareness studies. Novel methods integrating electrophysiology 
(EEG) and rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have 
further revealed a double dissociation in alpha activity, linking 
frequency to spatiotemporal sampling and amplitude to subjective 
sensory interpretation ( Di Gregorio et  al., 2022 ). These advances 
underscore the potential of brain-based approaches in shaping future 
research on consciousness.
6 The role of individual differences in 
consciousness research
A largely overlooked topic in unconscious perception research 
concerns the extent to which unconscious effects vary across 
individuals. Although variability in unconscious effects is 
frequently observed, it is not always systematically reported in the 
literature ( Y aron et al., 2025 ). A notable exception comes from 
studies that use regression methods to estimate unconscious 
priming effects (see Greenwald et al., 1995 ; Goldstein et al., 2022 , 
for reviews of regression-based approaches), which often provide 
individual-level data. Inspection of regression plots from these 
studies shows substantial variability in priming effects among 
participants with near-zero awareness scores. Some individuals 
display strong priming in the expected direction, while others 
show no effect—or even effects in the opposite direction ( Draine 
and Greenwald, 1998 ; Greenwald et al., 1995 , 1996; Klauer et al., 
2007).4 Recently, genetic dispositions such as the BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphism and personality traits have been found to be related 
to the magnitude of unconscious semantic priming effects 
(Sanwald et al., 2020 ).
This variability may stem from at least two sources: (1) low 
reliability and high measurement error in awareness estimates (Vadillo 
4 Note that another source of variability in (un)consciousness research arises 
from the use of subjective awareness measures (Jimenez et al., 2025; Persuh, 
2018), as discussed earlier, which rely on participants’ self-reports of conscious 
experience, typically on dichotomous or graded scales. These measures are 
influenced by two types of variability: a desired one, reflecting genuine 
differences in awareness thresholds across or within individuals, and an 
undesired one, stemming from variability in participants’ response criteria 
(Jimenez et al., 2025 ; Michel, 2023; Newell and Shanks, 2014 ). The latter 
undermines the validity of these measures, as it reflects decision biases rather 
than actual experience. This issue is particularly problematic when researchers 
select “unaware” trials post hoc, a common but flawed practice (Sabary et al., 
2020; see Schmidt et al., 2024; Shanks, 2017 for critiques). To address this, 
Maniscalco and Lau (2012 , 2014) proposed a method grounded in Signal 
Detection Theory that distinguishes between sensitivity and response bias in 
type 2 tasks—those involving confidence judgments. Their meta- d’ metric 
quantifies how much information from the primary task reaches conscious 
awareness, enabling researchers to isolate genuine individual differences in 
conscious processing from mere variations in reporting criteria.
et al., 2022), and (2) genuine individual differences in unconscious or 
subliminal processing. Even studies that apply improved measurement 
and correction methods continue to report high intersubject 
variability among participants deemed unaware (Jimenez et al., 2023; 
Prieto et al., 2025; Sanwald et al., 2020). Thus, while measurement 
error contributes to the noise, true individual differences in 
unconscious processing likely play a significant role and should not 
be ignored. It is worth noting that some differences may also arise 
from subjects’ memories, knowledge, heuristics, and/or beliefs 
(Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 2011 ; Parasuraman and Jiang, 2012 ). 
Beyond the physiological or genetic differences that may explain 
differences in processing in general, cognitive processes may vary 
interindividually as a consequence of the functionality of the cognitive 
system such as working memory capacity, leading to interindividual 
differences in the magnitude of cognitive processing ( Kiefer et al., 
2005; Megías et al., 2021).
Some research has explored the neural correlates of these 
individual differences, including electrophysiological activity, brain 
oscillations, neurotransmitter levels, and grey matter density ( Boy 
et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2009; Martens et al., 2006; van Gaal et al., 
2011). A key consequence of such variability is the difficulty in 
interpreting null results: it becomes unclear whether they reflect a 
genuine lack of effect at the individual level or the averaging of 
opposing effects across participants.
To address this ambiguity, researchers have begun using statistical 
methods that are robust to variability in effect direction. For example, 
Y aron et  al. (2025)  used 26 prior datasets and applied several 
non-directional statistical approaches that avoid assumptions about 
effect consistency across individuals: (1) the prevalence global null 
test, (2) the qualitative individual differences approach, and (3) the 
omnibus ANOV A. They also introduced two new non-directional, 
non-parametric methods: the Sign Consistency test and the Absolute 
Effect Size test. While only 3 of the 26 datasets showed no detectable 
effects, their findings highlight the potential of these methods for 
more nuanced interpretations of null results in unconscious 
processing research.
7 Predictive coding and the active 
inference framework as a model for 
(un)consciousness
Although its roots trace back to Helmholtz’s idea of unconscious 
inference, predictive coding is a relatively recent framework based on 
a Bayesian account of brain function. The theory posits that the brain 
acts as a hypothesis-testing machine, continuously working to 
minimize the error between its predictions and the sensory input it 
receives from the environment (Hohwy, 2013; Parr et al., 2019). To 
achieve this, the brain uses a hierarchical internal generative model of 
the environment (i.e., hidden causes) to predict incoming sensory data 
and to update this model when its predictions fail (Friston and Kiebel, 
2009). Within this view, perception is conceived as an active process 
of hypothesis testing (active inference), in which actions function as 
“experiments” that gather evidence to resolve uncertainty among 
competing models of the world ( Friston et  al., 2015). The brain’s 
primary goal is to infer the most likely causes of sensory signals—the 
Bayesian posterior—based on prior beliefs ( priors) and sensory 
evidence (likelihood) (Mudrik et al., 2025).
Jimenez et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1626223
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org
Although predictive coding and the Active Inference Framework 
were not originally designed as theories of consciousness, they offer a 
promising foundation for making testable predictions about aspects 
of (un)conscious processing (Hohwy and Seth, 2020). The central idea 
emerging from this research is that perceptual contents are generated 
by the brain’s model of the causes of its sensory inputs, and that the 
phenomenological quality of experience is determined by the nature 
of the predictions involved. Changes in conscious experience thus 
reflect changes in the inferred state of the body, brain, or external 
world (Hohwy and Seth, 2020; Mudrik et al., 2025). According to this 
view, conscious mental states are associated predictions about the 
causes of sensory input, and the contents of consciousness correspond 
to the outcome of these predictions—not the inferential process itself, 
which is unconscious by nature (Seth and Bayne, 2022). In contrast, 
unconscious contents are those in which the inferences do not reach 
the level of precision or integration necessary for conscious access.5
Predictive coding and active inference hold significant potential 
to unify experimental findings across conscious and unconscious 
perception, thanks to their computational and modeling strengths. 
Nonetheless, further research is needed to establish prediction error 
minimization as a core feature of brain function and to clarify its 
relationship to the properties of conscious experience ( Mudrik 
et al., 2025).
8 Conclusion
Since the early experimental studies of the late 19th century, 
research on unconscious perception has been shaped by persistent 
methodological challenges and evolving experimental approaches 
aimed at demonstrating perception without awareness. In this review, 
we discussed some of the most relevant challenges researchers have 
faced in demonstrating unconscious perception, and examined how 
different measures of awareness (e.g., objective vs. subjective) may 
sometimes yield different awareness thresholds. To overcome these 
limitations, alternative approaches demonstrating unconscious 
perception have been developed. We further examined how emerging 
methodologies are shaping the study of unconscious perception. These 
approaches, while diverse in their implementation, share a common 
goal of disentangling perceptual sensitivity from conscious awareness, 
and we discuss their respective contributions as well as the conceptual 
and methodological limitations they entail. Finally, we emphasized the 
5 Within this framework, attention plays a crucial—though distinct—role in 
enabling conscious access. Attention is conceptualized as the optimization of 
the expected precision of sensory signals, which fluctuates over time. It 
modulates the flow of information through the processing hierarchy, amplifying 
signals expected to be more reliable and down weighting those deemed less 
precise. As such, effort is allocated to sensory channels where low prediction 
errors are anticipated, resulting in a dynamic pattern shaped by the noise 
characteristics of incoming signals (Friston, 2009; Hohwy, 2013).
need for brain-based approaches to unconscious perception and 
discussed some promising studies in this area, while also highlighting 
the prominent role of individual differences and alternative 
frameworks such as predictive coding and active inference views in 
future research. Overall, the new approaches and methodologies 
discussed here will advance the field by addressing the challenges 
inherent in demonstrating cognition in the absence of awareness.
