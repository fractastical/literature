The neutrino fluxes obtainable in 1973 at the high 
energy accelerators around the world are estimated and 
compared with those expected at NAL. The accelerators 
included in this study are those at NAL operating at 
200 GeV, 100 GeV and 30 GeV, Serpukhov-70 GeV, BNL-30 GeV, 
CERN-25 GeV, SLAC-18 GeV and the ANL-12 GeV. 
In Table I are given for each accelerator the para-
meters of the neutrino beam and detector used in the calcula-
tions. The primary beam intensities assumed for the accelera-
tors in 1973 were scaled from the present intensities by 
considering the improvement program plans at each accelerator. 
The neutrino beam parameters for each accelerator were chosen 
to optimize the total flux at each accelerator. The muon 
shield thickness was chosen for each accelerator to range 
out the highest energy muon possible from the primary proton 
or electron beam.

In Figure 1 the neutrino flux distributions for perfect 
focusing are presented for each of the accelerators. The 
neutrino flux for each accelerator is averaged over a detector 
of 1.8 meter radius. The pion and kaon yields, momentum 
distributions and angular distributions used to calculate 
the neutrino fluxes were determined from the Hagedorn-Ranft 1 
model if the primary proton energy is 70 GeV or higher, from 
the Sanford-Wang formula 2 if the primary proton energy is below 
70 GeV and from the experimental data 3 for the SLAC electron 
accelerator. 
In Figure 2 the total neutrino event rate expected on 
hydrogen at each accelerator is presented as a function of 
neutrino energy. The detectors assumed are the largest 
bubble chambers that could possibly exist at the accelerators 
by mid 1973. Serpukhov and CERN will probably use heavy 
liquid bubble chambers which operate with propane (C3H8 ). 
However, in the comparison in Figure 2, only the event rate 
on free protons is considered. The 14' bubble chamber was 
assumed to exist at NAL, however, the rate in the 25' bubble 
chamber is given for comparison. The total neutrino interaction 
cross-section of 
a = 0.6 E x l0- 38 cm2/v-proton v 
where E is the neutrino energy in GeV was used even though v 
this could saturate somewhere above 10 GeV neutrino energy. 
The neutrino event rates were calculated using the neutrino 
fluxes for perfect focusing, a focusing efficiency of 70% 
and a target efficiency of 70%. The values of the fiducial 
volumes of the bubble chambers and the beam intensities of

the various accelerators are somewhat a matter of personal 
subjective judgment and will, therefore, be a point of 
discussion for some readers. To the first order the reader 
can modify any of the curves on Figure 2 by scaling linearity 
with the product of the primary beam intensity and the 
fiducial volume. 
From Figure 2 we can observe that: 
1. Excluding NAL, Serpukhov has a superior neutrino event 
rate over the other accelerators for Ev > 3.0 GeV. 
2. The advantage in event rate of NAL over BNL with both 
operating at 30 GeV comes only from the relative proton 
intensities and relative detector volumes at the two 
accelerators. 
3. At 4 GeV the NAL event rate in the 100 GeV beam is about 
eight times higher than the Serpukhov event rate. 
4. The ratio of event rates in the 200 GeV beam of the 
25-foot bubble chamber to the 14-foot bubble chamber is 
about two. 
5. The ratio of event rates in the 30 GeV beam of the 25-
foot bubble chamber to the 14-foot bubble chamber is 
about 2. 
In comparing the neutrino event rates of the 25-foot 
and 14-foot bubble chambers it should be remembered that 
track sensitive internal targets would be used for many 
experiments 415 • For experiments using such internal targets, 
the ratio of usable events from the two bubble chambers 
would be substantially different 6 from what is indicated 
on Figure 2 because of the enhanced detection ef ftcienty 
of the larger bubble chamber.
