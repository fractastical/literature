I present a provisional model and promising evidence, pending robust
longitudinal validation, for the possibility of prodromal dreams: dreams that
predict onset of illness before overt symptoms appear. Interoceptive signals
are compressed and summated/integrated within brain networks that are most
highly active during REM sleep. If there is a bodily problem an error signal is
generated and the brain then attempts to infer a cause or explanation for the
distortions in the bodily image. It is this picture or updated model of the body
(which attempts to depict or explain the distortions or errors in bodily senses)
which I suggest then gets depicted in dreams. Prediction error can be remedied
either via active inference leading to corrective action, or by model updating—
generating models that explain away the error. I suggest that the depiction of the
cause of the predictive error (bodily distortions) emerges in dreams (typically with
picture language or metaphor) and thus can be interpreted to help diagnose
emerging illnesses. The active inference portion of the model updating process
on the other hand will depict potential solutions to the predictive error and if this
information emerges in dreams these dreams might plausibly contain
information to ameliorate/treat the causes of the bodily distortions.

Introduction
In medicine, a prodrome can be deﬁned as early sign(s) and/or symptom(s) that may
indicate the onset of a disease before more diagnostically speciﬁc signs and symptoms
emerge. Prodromal dreams are dreams that contain cognitive content (images, scenes,
narratives etc.) that signiﬁcantly predict onset of illnessbefore any other overt symptoms of
that illness manifest. The questions I seek to answer are: What neural mechanisms cause
such dreams? Can they truly be deemed prodromal? Does the content of these dreams truly
contain medically valuable information, or information that might assist in either diagnosis
or treatment? After answering these questions, I then suggest new directions for research
that can build upon what is currently known about prodromal dreams in order to
deﬁnitively assess their value for psychology and clinical medicine. This essay is not
meant to serve as a comprehensive review nor an exhaustive cataloging of all recent work.
Rather, I aim to provide the reader with a sampling of representative new researchﬁndings
on prodromal dreams in hope of ascertaining their potential value in treating mental and
physical illnesses. Nor am I systematically assessing the empirical evidence for prodromal
dream content. I am merely pointing out that people have for thousands of years reported

and recorded such dreams, and I am asking if there are neural
mechanisms that could plausibly support the occurrence of such
dreams. If there are such mechanisms, then the case for their
systematic investigation becomes more plausible.
Prodromal dreams
As mentioned above prodromal dreams are dreams that contain
content that signiﬁcantly predicts illness before any other overt
symptoms manifest . Dreams become candidates for prodromal
status if the individual (or observer) notices that a change in
content of their dreams are theﬁrst and earliest manifestation in
consciousness of any threat of illness and then that illness emerges.
Physicians in the ancient world took dream content seriously and
used it to predict illness onset, diagnosis of illness and sometimes to
develop prescriptions to treat the illness (see for example reviews
in 1) The Russian psychiatrist Vasily Kasatkin collected dreams,
including longitudinal series of dreams over a couple of decades
from at least 247 patients suffering from a variety of illnesses— some
with neurologic/brain damage . While Kasatkin published his
ﬁndings in a book “The theory of the dream ” published in
Russian in 1967, as far as I am able to ascertain that book has not
been fully translated into English. I obtained a partial translation (2)
which reports analysis on dream contents derived from 1642
dreams collected from 247 patients. Only 54 of those dreams
reported any feeling of physical pain, but almost all of these
dreams, according to Kasatkin contained overt or symbolic/
analogical references to or depictions of an impending or existing
illness. Dream content furthermore tracked the progression and
course of the illness with dream content anticipating features of the
illness and afterwards depicting scenes of wellness when recovery
occurred. The Kasatkin studies will require further investigation to
establish their methodological controls. According to Garﬁeld (3)
and van de Castle (4) prodromal dreams have been documented for
gastrointestinal, pulmonary, gynecologic and obstetric, dental, and
arthritic illness. Shafton (5) reviewed the literature on prodromal
dreams available in 1995. He noted that there were an abundance of
examples of bodily symptoms appearing in dreams in the
psychoanalytical literature. Freud in his The Interpretation of
Dreams (1900) (in a footnote added in 1911) referred to the work
of the German philosopher Karl Albert Scherner whose“Life of the
dream” argued that internal somatic stimuli provided the raw
material for dream content such that one could deduce the health
of particular organs from dream images. A“blazing furnace” could
be interpreted as infected lungs in a person coming down with
respiratory illness and so on. Shafton (5) provided many examples
of dream content heralding illness onset from the extant literature at
the time of his review such as persons with dreams of wounds in the
left arm or shoulder or jaw or neck predicting later heart attack and
so on. For example, Smith (6) found that the number of dream
references to death and separation correlated with the severity of
cardiac dysfunction, as measured by the ejection fraction, which is a
sensitive parameter of disease severity. More recently, Burk (7)
reported that warning dreams preceded a breast cancer diagnosis
with the women reporting that the dreams they experienced were
more vivid, real or intense than ordinary in 83% of reports. A
number of quantitative studies of prodromal properties of dreams
have tended to suggest that such dreams generally contain higher
themes of the dreamer experiencing a variety of threats and
aggressions and attempting to respond to them. For example,
dreams that precede migraines contain more anger, misfortune,
apprehension, and aggressive interactions than do dreams not
preceding migraines ( 8). Building upon several cross-sectional
ﬁndings of prodromal dreams with high aggressive content
predicting onset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Otaiku (9) used
data obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative
cohort study. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at the 60-
month follow-up, with validated clinical scales. Otaiku used the
REM Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDSQ) item 2, which
inquires whether patients frequently experience aggression in their
dreams as the measure of dream content. Results revealed that
aggressive dreams predicted a faster increase in motor severity
scores (b = 4.64, p = 0.007) and (b = −1.49, p = 0.001).
Furthermore, experiencing consistent aggressive dream content
prior to overt onset of PD conferred a 6 fold and 2-fold risk for
progressing to more severe motoric PD and more severe cognitive
impairment within 60 months.Otaiku (10) later followed up the
study on PD patients with a study on healthy middle-aged adults
who were followed for many years. Risk of cognitive decline was
evaluated in 605 middle-aged adults (mean age = 50 years) from the
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study who were cognitively
normal at baseline and were followed-up for a maximum of 13
years. Cognitive decline was deﬁned as having an annual rate of
decline in global cognitive function (measured usingﬁve cognitive
tests) ≥ 1 standard deviation faster than the mean decline rate from
baseline to follow-up. In additi on, risk of incident all-cause
dementia was evaluated in 2600 older adults (mean age = 83
years) pooled from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study
(MrOS) and the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), who were
dementia-free at baseline, and were followed-up for up a maximum
of 7 years. Incident dementia was based on doctor-diagnosis.
Frequency of distressing dreams was assessed in all cohorts at
baseline (January 2002 –March 2012) using an item on dream
content of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire.
Results revealed that compared with middle-aged adults who
reported having no distressing dreams at baseline, those who
reported having weekly distressing dreams had a 4-fold risk of
experiencing cognitive decline and amongst older adults, the
difference in dementia risk was 2-fold greater for those reporting
distressing dreams. Nightmares and disturbing dreams may also
precede onset of the autoimmune disorder (SLE) and ﬂare-ups
within SLE (11). In a qualitative interview study Sloan et al. (12)
reported that several SLE patients reported that theirﬂare-ups were
consistently preceded by disturbing dreams/nightmares which
involved being attacked, trapped, crushed, or falling. Prodromal
dreams also occur in neuropsychiatric disorders. Basquin et al. (13)
found that 43.9% of the 41 patients with bipolar disorder (BPD)
they surveyed had experienced prodromal dreaming changes a
median of 5 months before the onset of a manic or depressive

episode. These dream content changes included nightmares
(followed by awakening), bad dreams (not followed by
awakening), epic dreaming (feeling of excessive dreaming),
dreams involving suicidal scenarios, sleep talking, sleepwalking,
and hypnagogic (while falling asleep) and hypnopompic (while
awakening) hallucinations. Geoffrey et al ( 14) investigated the
sequence and evolution of dream content changes before a
suicidal crisis in depressed patients admitted to a psychiatric
emergency department after a suicide attempt or due to suicidal
thoughts with immediate intent. Three different alterations were
identiﬁed: bad dreams (dysphoric dreams without awakening),
nightmares (dysphoric dreams with awakening), and suicidal
scenarios in dreams. The study found that 80% of individuals had
altered dreams in the months leading up to a suicidal crisis.
Furthermore, a timeline and progression of these dream content
changes were noted: bad dreams began appearing 4 months before a
crisis, followed by nightmares 3 months prior to the crisis, and
suicidal scenarios in dreams 1.5 months before an attempt.

imminent. S ̌ ć epanovic ́ et al. ( 15) utilized a deep-learning
algorithm that extracted mentions of medical conditions from
text and applied it to two datasets collected during the recent
COVID pandemic: 2,888 dream reports (dreaming life
experiences) and 57 million tweets (waking life experiences)
mentioning the pandemic. Analyses of these datasets revealed that
health expressions common to both sets were phrases concerned
with or depicting typical COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., cough, fever,
and anxiety). Expressions in waking life, however, described
symptoms in realistic or common-sensical ways (e.g., nasal pain,
SARS, H1N1), while those from dreams appeared to be more
metaphorical and uncommon (e.g., maggots, deformities, snake
bites) or conditions of surreal nature (e.g., teeth falling out, body
crumbling into sand). The dream-related accounts of the COVID
experience often appear before onset of COVID diagnosis and then
continue during the illness period. The dream content appears to be
exploring the outer edges or dif ﬁcult-to-deﬁne margins of the
experience. In short, dreams both predicted and captured/
described a larger part of the COVID experience than discursive
waking reﬂections on the experience.
The above summary of recent r epresentative studies of
prodromal dreams provides a prima facie case that such dreams
may exist, though it certainly does not establish that they in fact exist.
My purpose here was simply to highlight that existing evidence
suggests some potentially interesting content in dreams that may be
related to a variety of bodily illnesses. That content, furthermore, in
some cases signiﬁcantly predicts illness before overt illness emerges,
and so may be non-trivially related to the course of the illness itself.
There is also no single type of content that appears to be prodromal in
nature. No single dream image or item seems to consistently signal
impending illness, though of course these preliminary conclusions are
just that— preliminary. My conclusion is that this cursory look at
representative studies suggests that such dreams may repay further
investigation. If potential neural mechanisms to support such
associations between dream content and impending illness exist
then the study of such dreams might be made more rational.
I begin my examination of these dreams byﬁrst asking what
kinds of brain mechanisms may produce such dreams as even
provisional identiﬁcation of the mechanisms involved may help to
clarify how such dreams might provide useful information on
health and illness.
Sleep, dreams and health
The average adult human enters sleep through non-REM
(NREM or N1, N2 and N3) sleep phase N1 and then descends
into deep slow wave sleep (SWS). There are 3 NREM phases N1,
N2, and N3 or slow wave sleep (SWS). After about an hour of
NREM sleep, we leave deep SWS as sleep lightens and we brieﬂy
pass back up through stages N2 and N1; and the
electroencephalographic or EEG wave form gets faster and faster,
almost resembling waking activity. The slow, rolling eye
movements, characteristic of N3, begin to show periodic spikes
with the eyes darting back and forth under the closed eyelids (rapid
eye movements or REM). Muscle tone is lost and we are unable to
move. These dramatic changes signal the onset of theﬁrst episode of
REM sleep of the night. Once we enter thisﬁrst REM episode we
will have undergone one full NREM to REM cycle. While thisﬁrst
REM period will last about only ten to twenty minutes, by the time
morning comes these REM episodes will last about thirty to forty
minutes. The last long REM period which occurs towards morning
is the period when most dreams are recalled.
Most recalled dreams tend to be highly visual and emotional
narratives and likely come from REM sleep (16). REM sleep is a
state characterized by occurrence of rapid eye movements (REM),
electroencephalographic act ivation comparable to waking
consciousness, muscle atonia, hippocampal theta oscillations, and
ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves, which areﬁeld potentials
that are similar to“orienting reactions” generated after a challenge/
threat/surprise. They are generated from the cholinergic brain stem
and pons, lateral geniculate nucleus, and striate/extrastriate cortex,
and vivid dreaming. 5HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors and
GABA-ergic (g-aminobutyric acid-ergic) neurons localized in the
ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) function to modulate
REM-on neurons. In addition, tract tracing studies in monkeys have
demonstrated that VENs (Von Economo Neurons) project to the
PAG and parabrachial nucleus (PBN), indicating a role for von
Economo neurons or VENs in regulation of PAG-related and sleep
related functions (17). Thus, PAG and likely 5HT2A receptors are
key neural systems implicated in REM onset, maintenance and
intensity (18, 19). During REM dreaming external sensory input is
reduced, cholinergic and dopaminergic activity levels are high,
while serotoninergic and noradrenergic levels are low or absent,
thus enhancing brain plasticity and pushing the brain-mind into a
visually and emotionally driven, hyper-associative state (20–23).
fMRI and rCBF scanning with simultaneous EEG scalp recordings
of healthy participants asleep in the scanner demonstrate selective
activation of the pontine tegmentum, thalamic nuclei, several limbic
elements including the amygdala and the hippocampus, anterior
cingulate cortex, insula, mediobasal prefrontal lobes, temporal-

Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org03
parietal-occipital (TPO) junction and extrastriate cortex (24–26). In
contrast, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is downregulated in REM
sleep (16, 27, 28 In non-REM phases of sleep there is a functional
uncoupling of the default mode network or DMN’s anterior and
posterior nodes (particularly the MPFC and PCC) which are then re-
coupled with the onset of REM (29). In summary, REM appears to
promote intense visual simulations of socio-emotional associative
processing largely in the absence of reﬂective thought.
Prodromal dreams would likely not be possible if sleep states
were not signi ﬁcantly involved in maintaining health of the
individual. Sleep states likely maintain health and promote
recovery from illness when illn ess occurs. The sleep-related
contribution to health may extend to dreams. If prodromal
dreams occur then an additional way in which sleep states
facilitate health is to help prepare the individual for an impending
illness. I will therefore now summarize just a few salient facts
concerning the inﬂuence of sleep states on key health parameters.
Two major sleep states (N3 and REM) appear to be homeostatically
regulated. By homeostatically regulated we mean that the amount
and intensity of sleep an individual experiences is controlled by a
kind of internal thermostat. If you get too little sleep you cumulate a
sleep debt that needs to eventually be paid back or made up. To
make up for lost sleep time you sleep a bit longer and a bit more
intensely on subsequent nights. In short, you sleep in proportion to
wake time. The longer the wake time (or the greater the amount of
sleep deprivation), the greater the subsequent sleep time and
intensity. Homeostatic regulation indicates that sleep is a physical
need and very likely fundamental to health or else it would not be an
obligate physiologic process. We do not know if dreams themselves
are homeostatically regulated though there are some facts consistent
with such a claim. Individuals who are on medications that suppress
REM sleep for long periods of time tend to report less dreaming
during that time and then abundant dreaming (suggesting dream
rebound) when the medications are discontinued. For example, in
his review of medications that have signiﬁcant secondary inhibitory
effects on REM, Naiman (30) identiﬁes the benzodiazepines, the
anti-depressants (particularl y the tricyclics and the older
monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and the anticholinergics as major
culprits in an epidemic of REM/dream loss. The anti-cholinergic in
particular strongly suppress the activity of acetylcholine, the
primary neurotransmitter responsible for initiating REM. These
anti-cholinergic medications are widely used to treat a very wide
variety of illnesses from gastrointestinal disorders to everyday
allergies. The likelihood of using anticholinergic drugs increases
with age as does the anticholinergic burden— a measure of the
serious cumulative side effects associated with increased use.
Discontinuing use of any of these anti-cholinergics is always
accompanied by reports of increased and vivid dreaming.
Similarly, when we experience sleep deprivation over a period of
a few days, we normally experience, not only sleep rebound but very
vivid and abundant dreams (dream rebound) when we are allowed
to sleep again. Sleep also plays a crucial role in the regulation of the
immune system, acting as a fundamental process for maintaining
immune homeostasis and enhancing the body ’s defense
mechanisms (31). During slow-wave sleep (SWS) the production
and release of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), increase. Sleep also facilitates the
proliferation of T cells, a type of white blood cell that is critical
for identifying and eliminating pathogens. Sleep, furthermore,
inﬂuences the balance between pro-in ﬂammatory and anti-
inﬂ
ammatory responses, which is vital for preventing chronic
inﬂammation and autoimmune conditions. Sleep deprivation, for
example, decreases antioxidant levels thus leading to oxidative
stress. Both NREM SWS and REM are associated with changes in
levels of circulating neurohormones such as growth hormone,
oxytocin, vasopressin and the glucocorticoids with all kinds of
consequences for mood regulation and related health issues (32).
Both REM and NREM sleep states also bidirectionally interact with
the gut microbiome particularly affecting the delicate balance of the
gut microbiota (33). Sleep is known to be essential to the glymphatic
clearance system. Because the brain is a highly metabolically active
organ it generates substantial waste products that require efﬁcient
clearance mechanisms. It does so via the glymphatic system among
other systems. The glymphatic system relies on the active
participation of glial cells, particularly astrocytes, to facilitate the
efﬁcient removal of waste products and maintain the brain ’s
homeostasis. A crucial component of this system is the water
channel protein Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), predominantly expressed
on astrocytic endfeet surrounding blood vessels. These endfeet
create a structural framework enabling the convective ﬂow of
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) into the brain parenchyma, allowing for
the exchange of water and solutes between the CSF and interstitial
ﬂuid. The glymphatic clearance system is activated during NREM
and may even depend on the rolling waves associated with slow
wave sleep. The expansion of the interstitial space during sleep
enhances the convective ﬂow of CSF, facilitating the ef ﬁcient
removal of waste products.
Now that we have established that sleep and dreams appear to be
required for health, we next inquire intohow prodromal dreams
might occur. To see that weﬁrst need to lay out the case for the fact
that REM sleep neurobiology (the neurobiology most strongly
associated with vivid detailed dreams) is associated with a brain
network or circuit that specializes in threat detection— both external
threat detection and internal (interoception) threat detection. After
all, if prodromal dreams constitute early warning signals that illness is
imminent, then presumably they are communicating/displaying/
depicting information picked-up by an internal threat detection
system sensitive to interoceptive signaling systems.
REM sleep and the threat detection
and response systems
According to Wen et al. (34) consensus among experts studying
this issue is that there is a threat circuit that is composed of the
amygdala, periaqueductal gray, hippocampus, medial prefrontal
cortex, and insular cortex. This consensus is consistent with the
early proposal for a threat detection circuit by Whalen (35) who
proposed a threat activated vigilance system centered on the
extended amygdala and related structures such as the nucleus
McNamara 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1625811
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org04
basalis of Meynert. But Wen et al. also present new data which
suggests an extended threat detection circuit that includes these
amygdala related networks but also involving higher order cognitive
systems as well. Consistent with Wen et al., some investigators (36, 37)
have argued that an‘innate alarm system’(IAS), is constituted by a
network of interconnected brain regions including the brainstem,
amygdala, pulvinar, but also the higher-order frontal-temporal cortex.
Like other threat detection schemes, this IAS is centered on the
amygdala and while the amygdala communicates threat information
to the prefrontal cortex, it also communicates with subcortical sites
such as the locus coeruleus (LC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG),
where both of these structures work together to elicit‘ﬁght-or-ﬂight’
responses to threat. Interestingly, the cerebello-limbic-thalamo-
cortical network, is also suggested to play a role in the‘innate alarm
system’ where it is in constant communication with midbrain
structures and is thought important for processing rapid responses
to threat. Barrett and Simmons (38) proposed an interoceptive threat
detection system consisting of paralimbic sites like the amygdala,
medial and anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, the posterior orbitofrontal cortex, and the anterior
insular cortex (AIC). This interoceptive threat detection system
transmits information through connections in the amygdala,
hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and periaqueductal gray to the
spinal cord that detects autonomic, hormonal, and immunologic
(etc.) problems.
Clearly, threat detection brain processes tend to center on the
operations of the amygdala and related paralimbic networks. The
amygdala is known to process aversive information from multiple
internal and external sensory modalities. Lesioning the amygdala
attenuates normal responses to dangerous stimuli, and humans
with bilateral damage to the amygdala exhibit reduced or no fear
responses to most external threats. The amygdala is densely
interconnected with the hippo campus, insula (including the
anterior insular cortex or AIC), and medial prefrontal cortex or
PFC and the temporal parietal occipital junction (TPO)— all sites
important in REM sleep. Indeed, TPO lesions are associated with
both loss of dream recall and intense bodily distortions (39, 40). In
summary, the neural networks most often proposed to function as
threat detection circuits are differentially activated during REM
relative to waking state activation patterns.
Brain sites activated during REM sleep
Although dreaming occurs throughout sleep awakenings from
REM sleep show greater frequency of dream recall and result in
longer, more vivid dream reports (16). Neuroimaging studies have
identiﬁed a distinct midline anterior paralimbic area that becomes
selectively activated during REM sleep, often to levels similar to or
exceeding waking (25, 27, 28, 41–45). Solms (39) and Doricchi and
Violani (40) report that parietal lobe involvement differentiates
patients with and without global cessation of dreaming (GCD) with
42% of GCD patients exhibiting parietal lesions, in particular near
or in the region of the temporal parietal occipital junction (TPO)
area. At the neuroanatomical level, the temporoparietal junction
plays a critical role in interoception and multisensory integration,
thus mediating the sense of a bodily image/self (39, 46, 47).
If REM sleep brain activation patterns overlap or clearly involve
some of the same networks as the proposed structures frequently
cited as threat detection networks, then it may be that REM
processing systems could be involved in internal threat detection
as well as interoception more broadly. We therefore need to next
discuss interoception and its relation to sleep and dreams.
Interoception
Interoception refers to a set of processes by which internal
bodily stimuli (and perhaps skin/touch) are detected, interpreted,
and integrated by the brain into an overall picture of the of the body
(48). Garﬁnkel et al. (49) suggested 3 measures of interoception:
interoceptive accuracy, sensibility, and overall awareness. These
measures can evidence abnormality in mental and physical
disorders. If abnormal values on these measures persist over time
one may develop the enduring sense that something is off, and one’s
sense of self may be associated with chronic distress and anxiety.
Indeed, distorted interoceptive signals may lead to disturbances in
the sense of body ownership or agency (50). Over time, the constant
sense of uncertainty around the cause of bodily sensations may lead
to a generalized sense of anxiety and distress as well as might be
called a shaky sense of self. Interoceptive disturbances will also lead
to REM sleep and dream disturbances as well.
REM sleep and interoception
In the normal situation with onset of REM sleep, there is a
generalized reduction of homeostatic regulation of autonomic
reﬂexes (respiratory, cardiovascular, thermal) during REM (51).
This suspension of normal interoceptive functioning suggests that
interoceptive integration and updating processes take place during
REM . Ongoing interoception is brie ﬂys u s p e n d e ds ot h a t
interoceptive integration can proceed unimpeded. Note that
ongoing interoception is different from interoceptive integration. I
emphasize that what I am arguing is that interoceptive integration
rather than ongoing interoceptive signaling takes place in REM and
this is what makes prodromal co ntent possible. The existing
neurobiological evidence su mmarized below shows that
multidimensional sensory information is compressed into highly
processed unidimensional information in the structures (such as the
amygdala and the insula) that are highly activated during REM.
Dreams appear to reﬂect the fact that non-compressed sensory
information is not normally processed in dreams given that the
sensory composition of dreams generally lacks signals from
interoceptive systems and is strongly weighted toward
hallucination of the exteroceptive visual sense (16, 52). Instead
what IS processed in REM-related dreams is information that is
highly compressed into summative information about the integrity of
bodily systems.The relatively common experience of movement and
conversation/thinking in dreams suggests thatﬁctive proprioceptive
McNamara 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1625811
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org05
and sensorimotor sensations are also operative and generated (53).
The reason dreams do not represent primary interoceptive stimuli
very frequently, at least in the healthy state, is likely due to the fact
that interoception integrati on involves considerable data
compression during REM. Multidimensional physiologic signals
become progressively more unidimensional as they undergo
compression and integration into cortical synthesis networks
(amygdala, AIC, vmPFC and TPO) that are activated during
REM (on interoceptive data compression see54). In compression,
some sense data are retained, whereas other sense data are
permanently discarded. In integration, sense data from different
pathways and even modalities are combined to form lower-
dimensional summary representations. Interestingly brain areas
which handle compression and integration tend to be agranular
(without layer IV thalamic relay) (38). These are precisely the limbic
and paralimbic regions activated during REM. These include
anterior temporal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior insula, and posterior medial
orbitofrontal cortex. Many of these regions are also known as
‘heteromodal association regions’, and are capable of representing
low-dimensional (i.e., compressed) and multimodal (i.e.,
integrated) representations that are abstracted from primary high-
dimensional sense data.
Now once interoceptive si gnals are compressed and
summated/integrated the organism gets a snapshot picture of
the overall health of the body. If there is a problem an error
signal is generated and the brain then attempts to infer a cause or
explanation for the distortions in the bodily image.It is this picture
or updated model of the body (which attempts to depict or explain
the distortions or errors in bodily senses) which I suggest then gets
depicted in dreams.Note however that I am not suggesting that a
particular dream content is exclusively or primarily derived from
this bodily signal. It is unlikelythat any single dream content or
dream image can be tied to any single bodily signal. Instead,
dream content is very likely over-determined by multiple sources.
N e v e r t h e l e s s ,t h ef a c tt h a ti n t e roceptive signaling is plausibly
registered in REM dreams suggests that this information might
be recoverable, at least to some extent, from dream content. In
short, it is possible that the dream, at least in part, portrays the
read-out, so to speak, of the explanation for the error signals
coming from interoceptive senses.
Within the predictive processing framework (PPF) that read-
out is known as predictive error. The brain aims to minimize the
discrepancy between the model-based predicted and actual sensory
input (prediction error). If prediction error is small, there is no need
to revise the model, but if the prediction error is large enough, then
the model fails to accurately represent the causes of sensory
experience and should be updated in order to depict or explain
the causes of the bodily distortions (55). Prediction error can be
remedied either via active inference leading to corrective action, or
by model updating— generating models that explain away the error.
I suggest that the depiction of the cause of the predictive error
(bodily distortions) emerges in dreams (typically with picture
language or metaphor) and th us can be interpreted to help
diagnose emerging illnesses. The active inference portion of the
model updating process on the other hand will depict potential
solutions to the predictive error and if this information emerges in
dreams these dreams might plausibly contain information to
ameliorate/treat the causes of the bodily distortions. However, it
should be noted here that none of these reﬂections should be taken
as recommendations that an individual should look to their dreams
for potential medical treatments. My aim here is merely to point to
the possibility that some dreams may contain content that depicts
potential “treatments” for impending illness. This would have been
adaptive in the ancestral state. For example, if ancestral humans
faced an infectious disease outbreak, persons who had dreams that
nudged them into a pattern of social distancing (for example
experiencing other people as hostile and threatening) would have
been more likely to survive that outbreak than individuals who had
no such dreams. In today
’s world if individuals began to recall
dream content that similarly nudged them into distancing
themselves socially from others, it might conceivably portend
some sort of infectious outbreak. Of course, this suggestion is
entirely speculative and would need to be tested rigorously with
large-scale dream content and longitudinal associations of that
content with illness patterns before it could be taken seriously.
Nevertheless, it seems worth considering given the sleep and dream
physiologies we have reviewed here.
The extent to which brain areas are granulated and laminated
seem to be of particular importance for active inference. More
granular and more highly laminated brain tissue likely support
largely unimodal, high-dimensional representations that unfold
with a quicker rate of change. A good example of brain regions
activated during REM and tha t exemplify these cellular
computational and functional patterns according to Feldman
et al. ( 54)i st h ei n s u l a( s e ea l s o56 for a review of insula
functions). The human insula contains a dorsal posterior-to-
ventral anterior laminar gradient, wherein predictions (depicting
solutions to errors) emanate from ventral anterior regions and
prediction error (depicting state of the organism) from dorsal
posterior regions. Interocepti v es e n s ed a t ai st h u st h o u g h tt o
become increasingly compressed and integrated as it moves from
posterior to mid- to anterior insula. Within the insula itself,
interoceptive sense data is progressively compressed and
integrated into lower-dimensional representations as information
propagates from the dorsal posterior to the ventral anterior of the
structure The insula transitions from granular cortical tissue with
four layers in its most posterior extent, to dysgranular cortex (with a
rudimentary layer IV) in its middle extent, to agranular cortical
tissue with three layers in its most ventral and anterior extent.
According to the Embodied Predictive Interoceptive Coding (EPIC)
model (38, 54), dorsal and posterior insula receive predictions from
agranular and dysgranular visceromotor control regions of the
brain, including ventral anterior insula, mid-cingulate cortex and
anterior cingulate cortex, posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
and orbitofrontal cortex. Interestingly, the anterior insula is
distinguished by a unique cellular component, the von Economo
neurons (VENs) 57). VENs are characterized by large spindle-
shaped cell bodies with a single basal dendrite. They are high
conduction velocity, long range projection and specialized

neurons that are often called the “empathy cells” because their
degeneration is associated with diminished empathy for others, self-
awareness, social cognition, moral reasoning, and emotional
intelligence ( 58). Within the context of prodromal dreams I
suggest these brain regions with the insula at its hub are
generating active inference predictive models which respond to
prediction errors and thus potentially contain information on how
to correct bodily problems in case of illness.
Dream content and dream theories
relevant to prodromal dreams
Take for example, the dreams associated with episodes of sleep
paralysis. Sleep paralysis (SP) is a transient experience of conscious
paralysis when transitioning into sleep or out of sleep ( 59).
Normally REM sleep is associated with atonia or paralysis that
lasts the entire REM episode but occasionally the paralysis persists
into the waking state so the person is conscious but cannot move. A
recent meta-analysis (60) involving 76 studies from 25 countries
with 167,133 participants estimated the global prevalence of SP at
30%. Subjective phenomena associated with SP involve dreams,
hallucinations or perceptions of“intruders” that are in the room of
the dreamer and intend the dreamer harm. Occasionally a“succubi”
is dreamed as sitting on the chest of the victim and assaulting the
victim. Presumably the mind is trying to explain why the body
suddenly cannot move. Its REM-associated threat detection system
is activated given that the brain remains in REM. One possible
neural explanation of what is occurring is that a prediction error is
generated ultimately in the area of the posterior insula resulting in
depiction of the sleep paralysis problem as“there is an intruder in
the room and then on the chest and that intends the dreamer
harm”. Model updating ultimately emerges in the anterior insula
which sends sensorimotor information to move, shout, fully wake
up etc. Campillo-Ferrer et al. (61) provide a fuller explanatory
account of sleep paralysis and related phenomena taking into
account roles of the insula and the TPO. But the basic trigger for
model updating processes which produce dramatic changes in
dream content and then waking consciousness itself is the threat
detection system with REM and embodied in the brain networks
that are activated during REM including the insula and its
connections with the TPO and amygdala-hippocampal networks.
Threat simulation theory
Indeed many dreams contain simulations of threats (62). That is
not surprising if REM neurobiology involves activation of a threat
detection circuit. The threat simulation theory of dreams and the
social simulation theory (62, 63) posit that dreams are biased to
simulate threatening and social situations. This threat simulation
mechanism is thought to consist of two parts: (1) threat recognition
simulation which serves to recognize threats faster over time and (2)
threat avoidance simulation which serves to implicitly rehearse the
appropriate response to that threat (62). In the scheme presented in
this paper theﬁrst part involves computations of prediction error and
the second part involves active inference model updating. While
some studies provide support for threat simulation theory or TST
(e.g., 64, 65), others do not (e.g.,66). It seems clear however that at
least one of the functions of dreams involve threat detection/
simulation and generation of simulations on how to avoid the
threat in the future. If that is correct and if some of the threat
simulations involve interceptive signaling then some dreams should
contain information that is valuable for diagnosis of
emerging illnesses.
Sentinel theory
Another theory concerning REM sleep and dreams that is
relevant for prodromal dreams is so-called sentinel theory (67).
The basic idea is that REM evolved to counteract the deep
quiescence of the organism associated with NREM slow wave
sleep as that deep sleep made the organism vulnerable to
predators. Snyder proposed that periodic awakenings associated
with shifts between NREM and REM sleep served the purpose of
detecting threats if any existed. Sentinel-like behaviour could also be
achieved through variation in sleep timing, periodic awakenings,
and periods of time spent in lighter stages of sleep, from which
arousals would be more likely in the context of external threatening
stimuli. Vertes (68) later developed the sentinel theory further
adding the point that the highly activated nature of the brain
during REM sleep and dreams may indeed function to counteract
the unresponsiveness of slow wave non-REM sleep. Indeed the
brain is not completely shut off from the environment during REM
sleep but continues to process external stimuli (e.g.69).
In short, we have initial theoretical frameworks, threat
simulation theory and sentinel theory that are consistent with the
idea that some REM sleep dreams could act as windows or tools in
the detection of both interoceptive and exteroceptive threats and if
that is the case then they may contain valuable diagnostic
information on bodily integrity and health.
Methodological issues and
recommendations for future research
I have argued that prodromal dreams are real in the sense that
changes in dream content signiﬁcantly predict emergence of an
illness typically soon after those changes in dream content and
sometimes years before signi ﬁcant illness occurs. I have also
discussed how prodromal dreams are consistent with current
theory of the threat simulation functions of both REM sleep brain
activation patterns and of dream content. I have discussed links
between interoceptive signals and their registration in dream
content. I believe that these facts provide an initial rationale that
justiﬁes further investigation into prodromal dreams. It seems
possible that such dreams can provide non-trivial information
into detection of emerging illnesses, their properties and even,
possibly ways to treat them. But is the effort to capture such
McNamara 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1625811
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org07
information from dreams worth it? And just as importantly is the
effort methodologically feasible?
In the last section of the paper I will attempt to provide initial
answers to these questions and suggest directions for
future research.
Methodological issues
A potential source of systematic error in the study of prodromal
dreams lies in thepost hocselection of dream images that appear to
match the illness (selection bias). To guard against arbitrary
identiﬁcation of content as prodromal, future empirical studies
must adopt both blinded manual coding procedures, and
automated identiﬁcation of potential prodromal content along
with conﬁdence ratings on that content as well as pre-registered
study designs and robust statistical controls to ensure reliable
predictive ﬁndings.
Develop baseline norms about dream
content in association with various
illnesses and develop a reliable indicator or
code regarding how the dream represents
threat
To estimate the clinical seriousness of a bodily danger signal we
need to know how far that signal deviates from norms. We therefore
need to develop dream content norms around associations between
various content indices and va rious types of illnesses. When
applying baseline dream-content norms, these also need to be
statistical adjustments for individual factors. For example, a
ﬁreﬁghter may naturally dream more frequently about burning
buildings (without having a lung disease) than the average dreamer.
In addition, we would need to take into account differing types and
courses of illness. An impending infection is a very different type of
illness from mood dysfunction and suicidal ideation. The predictive
processing framework distinguishes a hierarchy of predictive model
systems with cognitive systems near the top and interoceptive
models lower in the hierarchy. Therefore in principle errors
signals emanating from interoceptive vs cognitive models may be
distinguishable in dream content and thus there may be a signal in
dream content that distinguishes these differing types of illnesses. In
addition, chronic illnesses that have a course over several years
would be expected to be handled differently than acute illness.
If we had reliable information on how the dream codes bodily
threat in particular then we couldﬂag such dreams as red ﬂags
potentially indicating trouble ahead. But that code would have to take
into account baseline frequencies of the threat code. One candidate
for such a threat code I suggest is the presence of strangers in dreams
and their inferred intentions toward the dreamer. In a study of 320
dream reports from 33 adults, Kahn et al. (70)r e p o r t e dt h a t4 8
percent of characters in dreams were known to the dreamer. The
average report length was 237 words and contained an average of 3.7
characters. According to the Hall/Van de Castle norms, only about
half of the characters in dreams are familiar to the dreamer. In the
background of most REM dreams there lurks unidentiﬁed characters,
people that the dreamer cannot identify. Nevertheless, the dreamer
could often tell that the strangers or unidentiﬁed people in the dream
were vaguely threatening and usually males. In some dream series, up
to 80 percent of characters are unknown males who are threatening to
the dreamer. Strauch and Meir (71) reported that in about every third
dream the dreamer encountered only strangers! In an early study of
more than 1,000 thousand dreams, Hall (72) reported (1) that
strangers in dreams were most often male; (2) that aggressive
encounters were more likely to occur in interactions with an
unknown male than with an unknown female or a familiar male or
female; and (3) that unknown males appeared more frequently in
dreams of males than of females. Domhoff (73) has shown that when
male strangers appear in the dream, the likelihood that physical
aggression against the dreamer will occur in that dream far exceeds
what would be expected on the basis of chance. I suggest that when
the percent of unknown characters in a dream exceed baseline
frequency (which according to the Hall van de Castle norms is
about 50%) then the dream b ecomes a candidate for
prodromal status.
In the effort to develop validated scoring methods or potential
prodromal content we should use objective methods like AI,
machine learning and classiﬁcation algorithms, natural language
processing and related methodologies to add an objective,
automatable, and reproducible solution for a coding system for
prodromal dreams.
Another easy to implement strategy to assess the prospects for
prodromal dreams is to update the Dream Threat Scale (DTS;74)t o
insure that it captures interoceptive signals and then use it in studies
that attempt to associate dream content with illness symptomology.
The DTS is a content analysis method developed for identifying and
categorizing threatening events in dream reports. It captures the
Nature of the Threatening Event, the Target of the Threat, the
Severity of the Threatening Event for the Self, the Possibility of
Actively Participating and Reacting to the Threat, the Participation
of the Dream Self in the Event, the Nature of the Reaction of the Self
to the Threatening Event, the Resolution of the Threat, and the Realistic
Nature of the Threatening Event. But unfortunately it does not currently
speciﬁcally query interoceptive stimuli. There are now several self-report
instruments (75)t h a ts p e c iﬁcally assess the multidimensional nature of
interoceptive stimuli such as the Multidimensional Assessment of
Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA;76, 77).
Conduct longitudinal and other controlled
studies on the relation of dream content
changes to emerging illnesses
Retrospective dream studies, which entail the collection of
material only after the onset of the disease, are susceptible to
conﬁrmation bias. Therefore longitudinal studies will be necessary
to quantitatively assess strength of association and causal directions
of changes in dream content to changes in physical and mental
health. In addition, traditional case–control type studies should
McNamara 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1625811
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org08
occur such as using a control group design where a sample of
individuals without a diagnosed condition recall and provide dream
reports, and these are compared to a target group who end-up
having an illness. The control group without illness should not be
dreaming content comparable to the target group.
Look at prodromal content in Ultra High
Risk populations
A reviewer of an earlier version of this paper suggested: A potential
area for future research could be the examination of Ultra High Risk
(UHR) populations for psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on
psychosis. These individuals, who have already been identiﬁed using
validated clinical criteria to be at high risk for a future illness, represent
an ideal target population for mid-term longitudinal studies. This is
since they have a high risk of conversion and can be followed in an
ethical and controlled manner. Prodromal content could be related to
conversion rates and odds ratios for conversion to psychotic episodes.
Some of the dream content that would be worth assessing for
prediction of psychotic onset would be bizarre elements in dreams,
aggressive strangers in dreams, perceptual distortions, and general
threat level in dreams (perhaps assessed with DTS or sentiment
analyses using natural language processing and machine learning
tools). that occur before the onset of disease.
A second reviewer of an earlier version of this paper suggested
looking at another population: individuals with chronic
gynaecological conditions. Due t o the cyclical nature of their
symptoms and the high recurrence of disease one could
repeatedly assess associations of prodromal content with onset
and severity of illness in each cycle. Where a woman is in her
cycle can also be objectively veri ﬁed in relation to potential
prodromal dreams and symptom experience.
Ally with humanities scholars who have
studied ancient interpretative practices
associated with prodromal dreams
There is now a wealth of material on the ways in which ancient
physicians from all over the world used dreams to diagnose and treat
illnesses. Beginning in 1945 with the extraordinary work of the
Edelsteins (78) and more recently that of Renberg (79)o nt h e
Asclepeian traditions of the ancient Hellenic world, it has become
clear that not all of those ancient Hellenic dream-medical practices
were useless or mere placebo effects. After all, those ancient medical-
dream traditions lasted for over a thousand years, involved many tens
of thousands patients who sought help at the dozens of dream
incubation centers spread all over the ancient Roman empire.
There is in addition material records and testimonials of the
dreams incubated at these sites and the suggested cures contained
in the dreams. There are hundreds of material artifacts in the forms of
stone monuments, stelae, iamata and other sources that claim cures
from these dreams. In the classical period many cities and towns had
sanctuaries dedicated to Asklepios, the main Greek god of healing.
There were, however, some Asklepiad sanctuaries which had a
prominence greater than others. The temples of healing, the
Asklepieia, at the sites of Epidauros, Kos, and Pergamon, achieved
status as Panhellenic sanctuaries. The full cycle of Asklepiad ritual
was abstinence, ritual bathing, payment of a fee, sacriﬁce of an animal
or food offering, dream incubation, dream interpretation and medical
prescription for healing, and thanksgiving when cured by Asklepios.
At Corinth patients left behind votive offerings in the form of stone
carving or pictures of that part of the body which the god had cured.
Assess whether dream incubation
techniques and networks of
dream incubation centers would
produce prodromal dreams
and improvement in health
Given the ancient testimony and recent scientiﬁc work on
prodromal dreams I suggest that it is worth considering whether
modern dream incubation techniques might help in the study of the
effectiveness of prodromal dreaming in moving a person toward better
mental and physical health. Techniques for incubation of dreams is
undergoing a renaissance of study (see for example,80–84)H a a r
Horowitz et al. (85) have actually developed a digital tool to assist in
dream incubation. Zhang (86) notes that just as was the case in ancient
Mesopotamia and in the Greaco-Roman world, dream incubation
rituals had been widely practiced throughout Chinese history. Once
again the main aim was to treat illness. In all these ancient cultures
there was the use of dream manuals explaining how to properly
incubate informative dreams as well as expert dream interpreters
assisting in decoding those dreams. Zhang presents the example of the
Secret Book of Praying for Dreams(SPBD; qi-meng mishu), edited by
Shi Shilun (1659–1722). In the Graeco-Roman world virtually all
ancient physicians had to become expert at dream interpretation.
From Hippocrates to Galen, ancient physicians testify to the
usefulness of dreams in their diagnostic and prescriptive practices.
However, as mentioned above dream content had to be interpreted
soberly and judiciously as dreams often presented riddles or puns and
these linguistic metaphors and puns were believed to contain clues to
cures. Ancient physicians also asserted that there was a lot of nonsense
and superstition surrounding ancient dream interaction beliefs. But
sometimes dream content needed no or little interpretation. For
Artemidorus of Daldis, a near contemporary of Galen the valuable
medical information in dreams was very often presented clearly and
without riddles. Often incubated dream content appeared to reﬂect
familiar ancient medical practices, including routine dietary advice,
surgical interventions, bathing rituals, and the administration of
certain herbal concoctions and drugs. But it is important to note
that these medical regimens apparently developed over hundreds of
years of experience at these dream incubation sites and across
thousands of patients treated at these sites. Much of this cumulative
healing knowledge was archived at the Asklepian incubation centers
and presumably had to be acquired by the priests at these sites. At
most temples dedicated to Asclepius patients puriﬁed themselves via
abstinence practices and bathing rituals and then summoned by
McNamara 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1625811
Frontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org09
priests to theabaton where they would sleep and hope for a dream.
Interestingly, if the patient had a dream that involved the“laying on of
hands” b yt h eG o dA s c l e p i u so ro n eo fh i sa s s i s t a n t st h i sw a st a k e na s
very auspicious for a cure. As the temple priests/dream interpreters
came to possess a better understanding of human physiology, and
greater cumulative knowledge of what treatments worked or did not
work dream content began to reﬂect updated medical knowledge as it
progressed through the centuries.
Investigate the role of NREM sleep states
with regard to potential prodromal content
The role of the NREM sleep states in interoception and
prodromal content more generally is not known. My proposed
theoretical account of prodromal content focuses only on REM
contributions. In addition, some evidence suggests that as we age
the NREM sleep states (especially slow wave sleep) declines in
power in the EEG record. REM states however do not show as steep
a decline as NREM states. The compressed interoceptive
information might even become more salient as we age. But again
there are not enough studies on this issue to make any
deﬁnitive statements.
Explore links between prodromal dreams
and other forms of dreaming such as lucid
dreaming and hypnogogic dreaming to
interrogate interoceptive signals
I have focused on REM-associated dreaming in this essay but
there are many other forms of dreams that may be equally potent in
indicating emerging illnesses or creative solutions to mental and
physical problems. Take for example, dreams that occur when
transitioning into or out of stage N1 sleep known as hypnagogic/
hypnopompic states (87). In these transitional states the brain tends
to forge unusual out of the box semantic connections between
otherwise semantically disparate concepts. Lucid dreams ( 88)
represent another opportunity where prodromal information might
be present. In lucid dreaming there appears to occur an increased
prominence of interoceptive signals. And given that the dreamer is
actually conscious he or she may further amplify those signals thus
gaining unique information about diseased areas of the body perhaps
and so on. In anesthesia-induced dreams Hack et al. (89) showed that
these types of dreams may contribute to extremely effective fear
extinction. Such cases suggest that anesthetic-induced intra-operative
dreaming may be therapeutic in both recent onset and long-standing
trauma disorders and have a rapid and durable effect.
Conclusion
In conclusion, I have presented evidence which suggests that
prodromal dreams are possibly worth investigating in the sense that
changes in dream content signiﬁcantly predict emergence of an
illness typically soon after those changes in dream content and
sometimes years before signi ﬁcant illness occurs. I have also
discussed how prodromal dreams are consistent with current
theory of the threat simulation functions of both REM sleep brain
activation patterns and of dream content. I have discussed links
between interoceptive signals and their registration in dream
content. I believe that these facts provide an initial rationale that
justiﬁes further investigation into prodromal dreams.
