Psychedelics are recognised for their potential to re-orient beliefs. We propose a model of how
psychedelics can, in some cases, lead to false insights and thus false beliefs. Weﬁrst review
experimental work on laboratory-based false insights and false memories. We then connect this to
insights and belief formation under psychedelics using the active inference framework. We propose
that subjective and brain-based alterations caused by psychedelics increases the quantity and
subjective intensity of insights and thence beliefs, including false ones. We offer directions for future
research in minimising the risk of false and potentially harmful beliefs arising from psychedelics.
Ultimately, knowing how psychedelics may facilitate false insights and beliefs is crucial if we are to
optimally leverage their therapeutic potential.
When an idea or problem solution appears, it can produce a distinct and
powerful phenomenology— a feeling of profound understanding and truth
known as aninsight moment1–3. This largely ineffable experience appears to
play a pivotal role in the development and adjustment of beliefs and
although often associated with veriﬁably correct discoveries and adaptive
personal growth4,5, insight phenomenology can be triggered by unrelated or
misleading information6,7 and for objectively incorrect problem solutions8.
Insight moments are also a deﬁning feature of psychedelic experiences9,10,
and could underlie the profound belief changes seen during and after psy-
chedelic drug use
11,12. Thus, psychedelics are increasingly recognised for
their potential to restructure maladaptive beliefs underlying mental
illness13–15. However, given the fallibility of insight moments, how can we
ensure that psychedelic insights align with desired outcomes, or simply with
reality itself? Here, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks of insight,
belief change, and the neuropharmacology of psychedelics and present an
integrated model for how psychedelics can engender false or maladaptive
insights, which have not yet been addressed in the literature— which we
term False Insights and Beliefs Under Psychedelics (FIBUS).
Insight and the psychedelic experience
Insight, deﬁned as the sudden appearance of a problem solution in con-
sciousness, has a long history in psychological research1,16–21. Insight
moments— also known as“Aha!” moments— are a special type of problem-
solving process where a problem-solver achieves a sudden and complete
mental restructuring of a problem1–3 accompanied by a distinct rush of
satisfaction, surprise, and conﬁdence22–26. A substantial literature suggests
that insights are often associated withcorrect solutions to problems, at least
when using constrained and artiﬁcial stimuli27–30. Insight experiences have
been observed in several recent studies on recreational psychedelic use and
psychedelic assisted therapy31–34, suggesting that subjective experiences of
insight play a key role psychedelic assisted therapy9,35,36.T h e s eﬁndings have
garnered excitement in theﬁeld of psychedelic research, as insight moments
have a long tradition of research and have generally been found to predict
accuracy in problem-solving experiments
22,29. Indeed, psychedelic assisted
therapy trials have reported many instances of insight moments during
psychedelic experiences precipitating positive changes to mind and beha-
viour such as smoking cessation
9,31,37–40, potentially making them a crucial
lever for clinical improvement32,41,42
The eureka heuristic
This varied body of evidence, therefore, generally supports a link between
insight moments and what we deem to be“true”, either in the narrow sense
of objectively correct problem solutions or broader, idiosyncratic changes in
perspective and beliefs that are“veriﬁed” by their connection to positive
outcomes, relative to one’s goals or values. However, recent research has
shown that this link may be explained as a metacognitive process wherein
insight phenomenology guides the selection of ideas— the “truth” of which

colleagues5 (2023) propose The Eureka Heuristic— the theory that feelings
of insight play a heuristic role in guiding epistemic decision-making about
which ideas to trust by imbuing themwith a sense of obviousness. Usually,
this sense aligns with reality, as other heuristics are often grounded in
statistical norms, making them a generally sensible shortcut. However, as
with other heuristics, The Eureka Heuristic can fail under conditions that
violate these statistical norms.
False insights and metacognitive illusions
Indeed, while often correct, a proportion of insight moments are false22,43 and
false insights can be experimentally induced8. For example, Grimmer et al8.
had participants read a series of words with high semantic similarity (e.g.,
Remember, Signiﬁcant, Honour, Tribute, Memorial), before solving ana-
grams that were visually similar to another word sharing the same semantic
space to the studied list, (e.g., MEMUNOMT tends to be incorrectly solved as
MONUMENT instead of MOMENTUM). Participants had more false
insights for the anagrams that were visually similar (to a primed associate)
compared to a range of controls. The accuracy of insight moments can thus
partly depend on the relevance of one’s prior information, the ease (or
ﬂuency) with which it is processed, andwhether the available information to
the problem-solver encourages accurate or inaccurate associations.
Another downfall of using feelings of insight as a guide for truth can be
seen when insight phenomenology can be misattributed, making irrelevant
facts and worldviews feel true
6,7. Across several studies, Laukkonen and
colleagues6,7, presented participants with propositions (e.g.,“there is no such
thing as free will”) or factual statements (e.g.,“lobsters can be trained to
understand verbal commands”) containing anagrams (e.g. the word“lob-
sters” was scrambled). When participantssolved the anagram via an insight
moment, the irrelevant insight was temporally associated with a worldview,
and participants’belief in the worldviews and statements were stronger than
when no insight moment was reported. Insight phenomenology thus
appears to contaminate participants’judgements during claim evaluation.
In the episodic memory literature, there is a similar concept of mis-
attribution that can produce memory distortions44. Like insight feelings,
ﬂuency driven by semantic activation or repetition enhances feelings of
familiarity that can be misattributed to novel stimuli, resulting in false
memories
45–48. A parallel between the episodic memory literature and psy-
chedelic literature is that the feeling of knowing from familiarity49 has been
referred to as“noetic consciousness,” and the undeniable sense of knowl-
edge produced by psychedelics has been referred to as the“noetic quality”36.
The noetic quality has also been linked to the experiences of acquiring
knowledge in a seemingly unmediated fashion during spiritual or religious
experiences
50,51. Lastly, the noetic quality is closely linked to feelings of
‘truthiness’as described above, or‘obviousness’as it is often called in insight
research.
However, the impact of insights goes beyond the moment of their
occurrence — they may also recursively reinforce certain beliefs. For
example, an individual may‘do their own research’a b o u tw h a tc a u s e dt h e
twin-towers to collapse. An insight moment at an early stage of research that
makes an unfounded claim appear true could lead an individual down
unproductive research pathways, and recursively induce further misleading
insights. Along similar lines, false insights can also become entrenched via
unfounded plausibility
8,52,53. Again, parallels can be found in the episodic
memory literature. Emotionally positive memories tend to engage more
associative and semantic processes 54,55 that can result in memory
distortions56,57, and negative valence can attenuateﬂuency-driven false
memories46. Intriguingly, the noetic quality tends to occur with positive
affect during psychedelic-induced mystical-like states58.
Although the interaction between positive valence and false beliefs is
thought to be evolutionarily adaptive59,60, Laukkonen et al5. proposed these
related processes may mutually reinforce each other. When a false insight
occurs, the positive affect accompanying the insight afﬁrms the other beliefs
the individual has— a process through which an agent can form a model
increasingly out of touch with reality61. The strong link between insight
phenomenology, belief, and accuracy, may hold particular importance in
the context of psychedelic use, as many users cite a desire for knowledge and
understanding in their motivation for taking psychedelics. As interest in
psychedelics has grown, the mechanisms behind these phenomena have
been mapped within the now dominant computational paradigm known as
active inference or predictive processing, a framework that unpacks
potential mechanisms of the power of insights in determining belief for-
mation over time. Below, we discuss the broad principles of predictive
processing and outline a related theory of how psychedelics change beliefs
via this process, before synthesising these perspectives into a novel model of
how psychedelics can induce (false) insights and (false) beliefs– which we
have termed FIBUS.
Active inference: a neurocomputational understanding
of insight, ideas and beliefs
An increasingly popular view conceives of the brain as an inference
machine62–64 that infers the most likely cause of sensory data so that it can
optimally infer their hidden causes (i.e., what“out there” is causing these
electrical signals?) These predictions(i.e., guesses about the cause of sense
data) are compared to likelihoods (i.e., clarity or precision of sense data and
its weighting) to arrive at posteriors(i.e., the updated prediction about the
cause of sense data following the comparison between priors and like-
lihoods). If sense data refute priors, this solicits a prediction error– as i g n a l
informing the brain it must update its prior with respect to the stimulus at
hand, or to look elsewhere for conﬁrmatory data (i.e., active inference63). In
this way, the brain seeks to continually minimise prediction error64,65(see
refs. 64,65 for conceptual overview).
For example, if agent A thinks that the only red fruit is an apple, they
will expect that the red fruit in their hand is an apple. In other words, their
prior (i.e., existing expectation) is that the red fruit-like objects are most likely
to be apples. If they were given another red fruit to hold (e.g., a tomato),’A’
may notice textural differences and be told that this is another type of red
fruit. This departure between A’s prior that the only red fruits are apple, and
the sensory data at hand (i.e., likelihood) that tells them they are holding
another type of red fruit, would solicit this prediction error signal. This
prediction error signal would thus inform‘A’s internal model of the world
that the initial prior was incorrect, allowing A to change the model such that
‘red fruit’can include apples and tomatoes. Via this process, beliefs evolve in
a continuous trade-off between priors, likelihoods, and posteriors (which
then inform priors). Beliefs can thus be conceived as the priors carried into
each sensory encounter and are equivalent to probability distributions of
possible sensory encounters,evolving alongside the agent’si n t e r a c t i o n sw i t h
t h ew o r l d .T h i si st h ed eﬁnition of belief we adopt hereafter.
Predictive processing assumes the process of prediction error mini-
mization occurs along a hierarchical neural architecture
66. Hierarchically
higher cortical regions encode complex concepts pertaining to longer
timescales and higher abstraction66–70. In contrast, lower-level sensory regions
(e.g., visual cortex; see refs.67,71–73) typically encode more domain-speciﬁc,
concrete information pertaining to shorter timescales66,74.P r e d i c t i o n sa r e
carried down the hierarchy from higher-level cortices (e.g., associative areas
such as frontal cortex) to lower-level cortices (i.e., early columns of the visual
system such as V1) to narrow the range of explanations for sense data67.I n
contrast, prediction errors propagate up the hierarchy such that if a pre-
diction error cannot be explained bythe next level, where more complex
abstractions are encoded, it is carried to the next level64,67. This process
repeats until the prediction error reaches a level where it can be sufﬁciently
explained, and the brain updates its predictions to maintain an accurate
(generative) world model. This scheme allows the brain to continually reﬁne
its model of self and world for adaptive actions that aid survival
66,70,75.
Precision
Underwriting much of the trade-off between priors, likelihoods and poster-
iors is precision, an index of how narrow each probability distribution is76.
Higher precision distributions are narrower, representing increased con-
ﬁdence or clarity. The precision of priors and likelihoods is traded off to arrive
at a posterior distribution that appropriately weighs them
77,78.T oi l l u s t r a t e ,
https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00120-6 Perspective

imagine Agent X carries a strong but false prediction (i.e., high precision) that
t h er e db a l lt h e ya r eh o l d i n gi nt h e i rh a n di sat o m a t o .I nt h i ss c e n a r i o ,i ti sa
cold night and X is wearing gloves. Therefore, the grainy, low-precision
sensory data is incapable of updating the strong expectation that“this is a
tomato,” leaving the prior intact that the red ball in X’s hand is a tomato. In
another scenario, X carries a lower-precision, weaker expectation about the
identity of the red ball that is met with strong sensory evidence because now it
is daytime, and the gloves are off. This high precision evidence (or likelihood)
suggests the red ball is an apple– making it more likely X will revise their
weak prior and arrive at the posterior that the red ball is instead an apple.
Here, we are referring to the fact that this process allows the agent to arrive a
precise posterior distribution over models, allowing the agent to optimally
navigate its sensory landscape and thus their environment.
With respect to the brain, more generalized and coarse-grained
representations (based on many observations) are thought to be encoded in
domain-general cortex
70. During perception, predictions cascade down to
sensory regions of cortex which encode more speciﬁed and faster-updating
predictions. Prediction errors ascend this cortico-perceptual hierarchy until
the error can be explained by the level above. In the event the error cannot be
explained at the next level, it ascends all the way up to the most coarse-
grained level such that the agent’sm o d e li su p d a t e dt oa c c o u n tf o rt h i sn e w
contingency
67,79. In the example above, if we assume the agent has observed
many times that red circular shapes are tomatoes, they will have a relatively
stronger prediction that the red ball is a tomato and be less susceptible to
updating this belief when the sensory data was unclear (assuming they do
not actuallyﬁn do u tt h a tt h er e db a l li sn o tat o m a t o ) .
Greater (environmental) statistical regularities often accompany
increased prior precision and should therefore be accompanied by strong
contradictory empirical data to be refuted and updated. For example, a black
sky almost always means it is night, and only strong evidence, such as
knowledge of a solar eclipse occurring, enables one to suspend the belief that
the black sky they are observing is not evidence of it being night time. The
difference in outcomes to which these scenarios underscore is a process called
precision weighting, the relative weighting of priors and likelihoods during the
perceptual process, given the context and prior learning. The clarity of sen-
sory data and the relative conﬁdence in expectations thus play a crucial role in
how beliefs evolve. Reliance on sensedata or likelihoods, based on their
precision, is crucial for determining which beliefs are ultimately reached, with
the higher-precision distribution typically being more inﬂuential.
Insight, beliefs, and active inference
Friston et al.63 posited an account of insight experiences nested in the active
inference and predictive processing frameworks. Under this view, reﬁne-
ment or modiﬁcation of one’s generative model (i.e., world model) need not
rely on new information— a process deemedfact-free learning.F a c t - f r e e
learning occurs via a process of Bayesian model reduction, wherein the brain
arrives at models providing more parsimony of sense data already accrued,
rather than continued sampling. Fact-free learning is said to be meta-
phorically similar to the way that a“sculpture is revealed by the artful
removal of stone”63.
Such learning is proposed to occur implicitly via simpliﬁcation of one’s
model, in states where people are not actively taking in sensory information,
such as in sleep
80, or states of interoceptive reﬂection81. The key point is that
via Bayesian model reduction, no further sensory sampling is necessary for
reﬁning and updating beliefs about the matter at hand.
An extension to Friston et al‘s63 model of insight has been proposed that
considers the experiential quality ofi n s i g h ta n di t se f f e c t sh i g h e ri nt h e
cortical hierarchy5. According to the‘Eureka Heuristic’, we experience feelings
of insight because they help‘highlight’which ideas we should trust in light of
past learning. In other words, insight moments play a role in heuristically
selecting ideas from the stream of consciousness by capturing attention,
inducing conﬁdence, and boosting drive to act on them. In an uncertain
world where time is limited, ideas cannot always be evaluated analytically.
The feeling of insight plays a key role in permitting quick and efﬁcient action
on novel ideas (e.g., when running from a lion on the savannah).
This view is consistent with work suggesting that insight moments
increase conﬁdence
25,26, can be misattributed6,7, lead to beliefs that are dif-
ﬁcult to forget82, and are resistant to revision28. In some ways, insights can be
considered a fast-track to semantic memory, bypassing the slow training
process between the hippocampus and cortex that typically give rise to
semantic memories imbued with noetic consciousness. The Eureka Heur-
istic also includes computational mechanisms that extend the Bayesian
reduction account above, and helps us understand the recursive, reinforcing
role that insights may play during a psychedelic experience. We summarise
the model below.
The Eureka Heuristic proposes that when the implicit process of
Bayesian reduction results in a novel (i.e., updated) model, it necessarily
solicits a prediction error at a higher-order conscious level of abstraction,
under the hypothesis that precisely held beliefs enter consciousness. This
p r e d i c t i o ne r r o ri nt u r nc a nc h a n g eo n e’s model at a conscious level, making
it possible to have a reportable insight (and meta-awareness of an insight
having occurred). In other words, while Bayesian reduction inherently
reduces global prediction errors across the system, a certain amount of time
is required to share this information via ascending prediction errors.
Crucially, since many ideas can appear in the mind, it is only the ideas
that have high expected precision (i.e., subjective conﬁdence in the ideas)—
thus feeling insightful— which are selected and meaningfully impact beliefs.
This is analogous to the way that an organism must infer both the action
policy and (dopaminergic) conﬁdence in it
63,83. Similarly, organisms infer
both the content of ideas as well as their (dopaminergic) insightfulness.
Prediction errors ascending the cortical hierarchy can be ascribed
higher or lower precision weighting, as can predictions that descend the
cortical hierarchy (although it is worth noting that this may not always be
the case, as lower level prediction errors may not invariably propagate to
higher levels if the loss of accuracy is accompanied by complexity reduc-
tion). Notably, insight experiences have all the neural characteristics of a
higher-order prediction error (e.g., restructuring and insight is associated
with the event related potential component N320
84–86. More precise pre-
diction errors (i.e., very sharp departures from predictions with strong
evidence) are thought to enact a larger inﬂuence in (Bayesian) belief
updating, such that they bear increased weighting compared to the agent’s
priors. Increasing the precision weighting of prediction errors is thought to
be instantiated by higher synaptic gain(i.e., the inhibitory or excitatory
strength of connections between neurons)
5,87,88. One way synaptic gain is
instantiated is the up-regulation of dopamine, through which belief updates
and thus conﬁdence in belief updates are thought to occur87–90.
Like the construct of precision, the feeling of insight is thought to be
implemented through dopamine and has been linked to the reward
system
91,92. Just like precision, insight experiences are associated with
attentional capture30,93,h i g h e rc o nﬁdence and (phenomenological)
pleasure22,25, and seem to map onto the dopaminergic reward system91,92.
Moreover, in contrast to norepinephrine, which is thought to retain the
dependency of episodic memories on the hippocampus, dopamine is
thought to facilitate the integration of episodic memories into cortical
semantic networks
94. Precision also drives model selection, just like insight
drives the selection of new ideas5,12. Thus, what we call‘insight experiences’
map extraordinarily well to the computational construct of a precise pre-
diction error at an abstract level. Put simply, insights are a surprising inner
event (prediction error) imbued withnoeticism given what one knows (high
expected precision), thus permitting idea selection and action.
We note that dual process theories provide a framework for under-
standing cognition as a binary of‘conscious, deliberate, effortful’ and
‘unconscious, rapid, and largely involuntary’ thought
95. However, more
recent work has expanded uponthis concept and empiricalﬁndings (such as
the phenomenology of insight occurring in traditionally analytic problems96)
and identiﬁed the need for a more comprehensive view of cognition as
occurring as a hierarchy, with“system 1” and “system 2” effectively existing
on opposite ends of a continuum encompassing all of conscious thought,
unconscious judgement and decision-making, as well as even‘lower-order
processes’ such as perception and emotion”
4. Indeed, insight can occur
https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00120-6 Perspective

across both types of thinking25,26,81,97,98. One of the key deviations that PP
takes from these earlier theories is it emphasises these lower-level processes
as occurring mostly prior to (outside of) conscious awareness. This is also a
key component of our argument, as predictive processing can be applied to
phenomena that have until now been thought of as completely“conscious”
such as belief, insight, and even cognitive dissonance theory.
Psychedelics and belief change: two possible
pathways
We have thus far covered the notion of insight and the key role that it can
play in updating beliefs via predictive processing. Similarly, predictive
processing has been suggested to explainbelief change under psychedelics in
an inﬂuential theory known as Relaxed Beliefs Under psychedelics or
REBUS
99. We discuss how REBUS effects from psychedelics can result in
belief changes. Following the description of REBUS and how it can drive
belief change, we then describe an alternative pathway to psychedelic-
facilitated belief change that does not rely on the assumptions of REBUS.
After introducing these relevant theories, we will then present our inte-
grative account for how belief change under psychedelics can engender false
beliefs drawing upon components of each.
REBUS and belief change
Psychedelic substances, such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT, primarily act as
agonists at the brain’s5 - H T
2A serotonin receptors, which are widely dis-
tributed throughout the brain, particularly in regions associated with high-
level cognition, such as the prefrontal cortex, and sensory processing, like the
visual cortex
100. When psychedelics bind to 5-HT2A receptors, they cause
increased excitation of neurons, leading to altered patterns of neural activity
and communication. This heightened excitation is thought to contribute to
the profound perceptual, cognitive, and emotional effects of psychedelics101.
In addition to their actions on 5-HT2A receptors, psychedelics can also
inﬂuence other neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine and glutamate,
which further modulate neural activity and contribute to their complex
effects102. Neuroimaging studies have shown that psychedelics induce
changes in brain connectivity, reducing the connectivity of the default mode
network (DMN), a group of brain regions involved in self-referential pro-
cessing and inner thought
103,104. This disruption of the DMN is hypothesized
to underlie the“ego dissolution” and sense of unity often reported during
psychedelic experiences103,105. Simultaneously, psychedelics enhance con-
nectivity between other brain networks, potentially facilitating novel asso-
ciations, insights, and perspectives. The combination of receptor-level
effects, neurotransmitter modulation, and large-scale network changes
induced by psychedelics is thought to create a unique brain state that sup-
ports profound alterations in consciousness, perception, and cognition99,101.
Below, Fig.1 provides an overview of the neuropharmacology of halluci-
nogenic substances mode of action.
REBUS proposes that psychedelics facilitate belief change via a two-
step process99 (Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019). First, psychedelics dis-
proportionately diminish the precision weighting of high-level priors (e.g.,
reducing conﬁdence in‘beliefs’in the colloquial sense, formalised as higher
variance probability distributions) that otherwise constrain lower levels
(e.g., perception). This assumption of disproportionate higher-level effects is
due to the densest distribution of 5-HT
2A receptors found in certain asso-
ciation cortices, including parts of the default mode network (DMN),
proposed to be the top of the brain’s hierarchy (note, however, that 5-HT2A
receptors are also densely distributed in visual and auditory cortices106). By
relaxing the DMN’s constraints on the rest of the brain, the brain’sh i e r a r c h y
of information processing is thought to be“ﬂattened” or less controlled and
constrained by higher-order abstraction and‘freer’to change according to
new input (note that by higher order, and in a more technical sense, we are
referring to beliefs about plausibility’so fas e to fm o d e l st h a ta r eu p d a t e d ) .A
secondary consequence of the system being unable to rely on prior
assumptions is the relatively increased precision weighting of sensory data,
resulting in novel input becoming more likely to impinge on high-level
beliefs. An agent under psychedelics may therefore consider any number of
alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensory data, perhaps rapidly, and
revise higher-order beliefs that were held in a sober state. Particularly under
high doses, psychedelics can producea collapse of complex assumptions
such as one’s sense of self, one’s membership to a group, and typical
knowledge about the world, coinciding with the DMN’sr o l ei ns e l f -
referential processing
107, social processing108, and semantic memory109.
The REBUS hypothesis is supported by neuronal, behavioural, and
clinical data. Evidence suggests that psychedelics reduce top-down con-
nectivity and dampen the power of backward travelling waves (i.e., signature
of neural activity traveling across cortex, suggesting a decreased activity
between higher and lower levels in the brain)
110,111, both suggested
mechanisms for the inﬂuence of priors on brain activity112. After the acute
psychedelic experience, there are documented changes to metaphysical
beliefs, particularly away from a physicalist worldview (we note this does not
provide evidence exclusively for REBUS- but just that psychedelics can
seemingly change beliefs)
113–115. Finally, qualitative studies from clinical
trials suggest that revision of self-related beliefs (arising from REBUS

include the densest expression of 5-HT2A receptors,

rupted functioning of the DMN. We note this is a

effects may be beneﬁcial as a metaphorical‘reset’if one holds an array of
maladaptive beliefs, there is no guarantee that relaxing one’s hard-earned
abstract understanding results in positive change.
Alternate pathways to belief revision under psychedelics
Outside of the active inference or computational frameworks, psychedelics
may impact beliefs via effects onﬂuency and relative weighting of hippo-
campal and cortically dependent memories. This pathway to belief revision,
which we will term a‘memory systems account’does not preclude REBUS
effects, but we highlight this account since there may be differing predictions
on the speciﬁc brain-based substrates to belief changes.
Feelings of insight and familiarity can come fromﬂuency manipula-
tions such as semantic priming (e.g., seeing the word whisker could activate
the category of cat)
8,45, which can be enhanced by psilocybin117.M o r e o v e r ,
although psychedelics impair the formation of hippocampally-dependent
recollection memories (e.g., remembering/recollecting where or when an
event took place), they spare or evenenhance formation of cortically
dependent memories that solicit feelings of familiarity (e.g., knowing a face,
without who the individual was or where they met them118).
Typically, hippocampal recollection may constrain the interpretation
of noetic feelings driven byﬂuency/familiarity. If one can explicitly recall
semantically relevant words or the multiple repetitions of a stimulus’pre-
sentation, they may be better able to understand the source of their noeti-
cism and not misattribute it to irrelevant stimuli. For example, a person
might continually observe they are in a friend’s house one evening and can
thus attribute this fact to explaining why they keep remembering the pre-
sence of their friend, instead of mistakenly attributing this feeling to the fact
they saw their friendship bracelet that reminded them of their friend. In
contrast, non-drug studies have found that when recollection fails and
familiarity is high,presque vu(illusory feelings of insight) can emerge
119,a s
well as other phenomena sometimes reported under psychedelics such as

120 and premonition121.
In models of memory systems, the hippocampus is thought to“train”
the cortex over time such that greater statistical regularities between episodic
memories are what eventually becomesemi-permanent semantic memories
(e.g., one may no longer have memory for every instance they had pizza or
even theﬁrst time they had pizza, but they have learned what a pizza is)122.
The hippocampus may even constrain what the cortex can learn by pro-
viding contextual information that biases cortical processing

suggests that conditions in which hippocampal activity is relatively dis-
connected from the cortex such asduring rapid eye movement sleep is
important to the instantiation of new cortical information
124.H i g h - l e v e l
beliefs can be thought of as semantic memories not necessarily shared by
others (e.g.,“I am a bad person”), as they are typically slowly learned over
time, difﬁcult to revise (it would be hard to forget what a pizza is) and
represented by association cortices including the DMN but especially the
anterior temporal lobe
125. In fact, the anterior temporal lobe is an important
site for insight learning93,126,127, familiarity128–130, semantic priming131,t h e
illusory truth effect132, and the formation of beliefs such as prejudice133.
By reducing the constraints of recent hippocampal memory (i.e.,
impairments of forming recollections) via inhibitory 5-HT2A receptors in
entorhinal cortex (i.e., the input tothe hippocampus) and the hippocampus
itself134–137 and facilitating cortical processing (i.e.,ﬂuency) via excitatory
5-HT2A receptors in the cortex, psychedelics may be able to revise semantic
stores supporting high-level beliefs.Less constraints may provide greater
exploration of a conceptual search space allowing one to reach veridical
insights. However, noetic feelings arising from aberrant semantic activation
could also be misattributed to unrelated or bizarre ideas produced by psy-
chedelics, resulting in false insights.
REBUS proposes that the hippocampus is one of the regions that
becomes less constrained by the cortex under psychedelics and thus should
increase its inﬂuence on the cortex, especially the DMN
99. In contrast, this
memory systems account predicts thattypically the cortex is constrained by
the hippocampus and that under psychedelics, the cortex becomes free of
such constraints. It has been found that psilocybin attenuates hippocampal-
DMN coupling138 and hippocampal glutamate, which is predictive offeelings
of insight, but not necessarily veridical insights139. Nonetheless, all accounts
converge on the general notion that psychedelics change beliefs, even if
mechanisms are debated. We now turn our attention back to insight.
Crucially, we suggest that it may play a key role in entrenchment of new
beliefs following psychedelics.
Psychedelic-induced insights: a possible pathway to
false beliefs
Considering the theories of insight and belief change under psychedelics
discussed thus far, we now turn to the pressing issue identiﬁed at the outset
— the possibility that psychedelics could engender false beliefs. Although
psychedelics show promise as tools for engendering insight and therapeutic
belief change, the neurocomputational perspective on insight and belief
change in general suggests that psychedelics could also elicit false beliefs
under some circumstances. For instance, psychedelics could merely increase
the frequency of belief changes, orthogonal to accuracy, with the utility of
these belief changes depending on the accuracy of one’s prior information at
the time of restructuring. Give the evidence that insight moments can often
be wrong or misleading due to cognitive or environmental factors
4,8,52,53,140,a
higher frequency of insights (both true and false) could also increase the
probability of psychedelic-induced maladaptive, or potentially false,
insights
11. We now sketch a candidate framework for how psychedelics
engender belief changesvia soliciting insight moments.

make sense of sensory data, leadingto an increased number of insight
moments and noetic feelings. Following the experience, the person may be
left with a lack of detailed memory, but an increased noetic conﬁdence in the
insight moments encountered during the experience. Crucially, the
increased quantity of insights and acute malleability may leave one vul-
nerable to empirically false, misleading, or maladaptive insights, alongside
the prospect of obtaining valuable new perspectives.
Note that our focus on false beliefs is not because we believe that
psychedelics only solicit incorrect ideas, but because the potential for false
beliefs under psychedelics have been somewhat overlooked
11.S e c o n d l y ,i f
psychedelics do hold potential to change deeply held beliefs— as they are
believed to99— and some proportion of these are likely to be false but feel
profoundly true and motivating, there are major consequences to consider.
Given the renaissance that is currently underway, mass adoption of psy-
chedelic use both clinically and beyond have an important epistemic task to
address: how do we improve the likelihood that the insights and subsequent
belief changes engendered by psychedelics result in beliefs that move one
closer to reality? Below, Box1 provides a summary of the similarities and
differences between these models, including our proposed model.
False insights and beliefs under psychedelics (FIBUS):
towards a theoretical account
Based on our prior discussion of precision, model reduction, and fact-free
learning, we propose a process for how insight-derived belief changes under
psychedelics may reorganise belief structures– w h i c hw eh a v ec o i n e d
F I B U S .W ed on o tj u s ta c c o u n tf o rt h em e c h a n i s mo fi n s i g h ta n db e l i e f
change under psychedelics, but also articulate how insights can be true or
false, with clear implications for future studies (see below) involving psy-
chedelics. We propose this process approximates four steps as follows,
drawing on all the research thus-far reviewed.
Figure 2 illustrates the process by which psychedelic induced insights
may engender false beliefs. First, increased agonism of serotonin 5-HT
2A
receptors results in decreased precision weighting of priors, such that priors
now no longer characteristically constrain perception and cognition
(See
141–143 for in-depth discussion on serotonin, dopamine, and precision).
Second, this collapse in the perceptual-belief landscape results in novel
thoughts and perceptions that then increase the incidence of prediction
errors (e.g., through new sensory input or via‘fact-free learning’). These
predictions errors facilitate new ways of interpreting sensory data and
https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00120-6 Perspective

generate new ideas and perspectives. Third, the decreased precision
weighting of prior beliefs affords increased precision to the novel input
passed to higher levels (i.e.,everything feels more insightfulbecause it is not
constrained by prior belief). This increased precision weighting is thought to
be implemented via dopaminergic release (note this is a secondary release
not directly facilitated by drug effects; see
5,87,88,91,92,144), affording higher
precision to the insights encountered in step two. Fourth, this increased
precision weighting given to the insights makes them more likely to feature
in model selection (i.e., the feeling ofinsight has an unusually strong effect
on belief updating).
This process, we suggest, can describe how beliefs arising from psy-
chedelic insights can become entrenched in working models thereafter.
Such entrenchment may be especially true for psychedelics that also activate
dopamine receptors such as LSD, which tends to have more lingering effects
on perception
145. Critically, we suggest that while this process can impart
adaptive, meaningful, and lasting belief changes, it can also facilitatefalse
insights (and hence false beliefs). Below, we discuss implications for this
model, with a particular eye toward how practitioners and researchers alike
may consider, test, and optimally reﬁne these dynamics to ensure optimal
treatment protocol.
A model of psychedelic insight and belief change, and
its implications
We suggest that psychedelics can provide a genesis for false beliefs as follows.
First, REBUS effects (or other mechanisms of decreased precision weight-
ing) may induce belief relaxation, including those that are true, and increase
precision weighting of novel dopaminergically modulated insights. The
insights afforded by increased precision subsequently bear disproportionate
weighting on model building. In some instances,‘fact-free’learning may
therefore be occurring primarily with respect to erroneous or embellished
sensory data. Moreover, the insights may then play a recursive role of
preferencing and entrenching ideas consistent with the new beliefs. Con-
currently, the impairment of hippocampally modulated recollection may
lead to a decreased ability to remember veridical details of the experience,
while cortically facilitated memory encoding leads to increased semantic
aberrance and noeticism. In the experience, one encounters 1) an impaired
apparatus to make sense of incomingsensory data, 2) increased insight
moments, and 3) increased feelings of familiarity irrespective of accuracy.
After the experience, one is left with a lack of detail of memory, but an
enhanced noetic sense about the insight moments of the experience. Psy-
chedelics may thus facilitate insights and increase theperceived novelty in
new ideas and original thoughts
11,139. However, nowhere does this experi-
ence preference accuracy, or a necessary nudge toward more adaptive beliefs
characteristic of improved mental health, leading us to describe this process
as one of False Insights and Beliefs Under psychedelics (FIBUS). Below, we
outline considerations that accompany this empirically derived model and
proposal. We divide our considerations between the acute and post-acute
phases.
Acute effects
A potential downside of (higher order) belief relaxation is that some
adaptive priors that typically constrain perceptual inferences may also be
relaxed in the process leading to false insights and hence false beliefs. This
ampliﬁes the oft-cited importance of set and setting, which are crucial
predictors of the psychedelic experience
146. With respect to setting, mis-
leading contextual information could serve to increase the possibility of false
insights. Psychedelics may serve as ampliﬁers of environmental inﬂuence
rather than pushing someone toward one set of views over another147.A
recent study found that changes in metaphysical beliefs following a psy-
chedelic experience were mediated by a range of factors (i.e., age, personality

(increased) results in a heightened number of insight moments during the
acute psychedelic experience, increasing dopamine. The insights and
predictions errors are afforded higher precision due in part to the fact that
priors are now diminished which in turn makes insights more likely to
inﬂuence subsequent beliefs. Concurrently, increasedﬂuency, and
weighting of hippocampal and cortically dependent memories under
psychedelics result in diminished constraint of the hippocampus,
enabling increasedﬂexibility to the cortex (see section on the Eureka
Heuristic, and Alternate Pathways to Belief Revision Under Psychedelics
for detail).

but just the feelings of accuracy. This leaves the system vulnerable to
misleading contextual information wherein one can feasibly feel conﬁdent
in beliefs and insights arrived at under misleading contextual
circumstances or cognitions.

traits, suggestibility) reinforcing thenotion that non-pharmacological fac-
tors play an important role in adopting novel beliefs11,115.
Aspects typically emphasised in the clinical setting, such as safety and
control, may additionally provide patients overly precise priors of felt safety
or control in a non-clinical setting, where psychedelic consumption may not
be safe nor well controlled. If psychedelics do acutely enhanceﬂuency (ease

effect in which patients become more attached to those they are interacting
with whilst under psychedelics. There might also be aspects of the clinical
setting conferring discomfort or distrust of clinicians, making future care
more difﬁcult. Of course, this could simply mean that any aspect of the
experience that is out of step with day-to-day life could be overweighted, and
thus garner outsized inﬂuence following the acute phase– consistent with
the neutral ampliﬁer of set and setting discussed above. Out of the psy-
chedelic context, insights and beliefs arrived at may no longer carry their
adaptive zeal. This ampliﬁes the importance of an epistemically congruent
(i.e., with the goals of the patients who ingests the psychedelic) set and
setting – given that beliefs become more malleable during the acute phase,
contextual factors in the post-acute phases (in which‘integration’therapy
occurs) need to optimally encourage and support positive and adaptive
insights.
We also note there may exist theoretical shortcomings to the REBUS
model, which can paint an incomplete picture of belief change, and thus
constrain our FIBUS model given we derive our predictions partly from the
REBUS model. Some psychedelic studiesﬁnd larger effect sizes outside of
associative cortex, including in sensory areas with lower 5-HT
2A
distribution102,104,149,150. Another outstanding question on REBUS effects is
the presence of hallucinations during the acute phase. People often report
reliving scenes from one’s past and immersive hallucinations of beings or
‘entities’, often considered high level-hallucinations. If the sense of self
collapses under psychedelics, then it is unclear how one could have hallu-
cinations that assume a sense of self (e.g., I am having a memory of some-
thing I have experienced before). Given our FIBUS model partially derives
from and assumes REBUS effects, these shortcomings should be noted.
Another consideration with respect to our FIBUS model is the sug-
gestion that hallucinations are due to ov e r l ys t r o n gp r i o r s-s u c ha si na c u t e
episodes of psychosis
151. If complex hallucinations are occasioned by strong
priors, then we might expectless complex hallucinations at higher doses.
Indeed, complex hallucinations aretypically only occasioned with high
doses and sensory deprivation (for example, in the case of Charles Bonnet
syndrome
151,152). One explanatory model for hallucinations from dis-
sociative hallucinogens (i.e., NMDAantagonists such as ketamine), which
share some subjective, clinical, and neural effects as psychedelics, proposes
t h eo p p o s i t eo fR E B U S
153. That is, hallucinations come from an over-
weighting of priors (e.g.,“Ia ms e e i n gm ym o t h e r”) and an underweighting
of sensory information (e.g., external input that would otherwise lead one to
reject the idea that their mother ispresent). Indeed, the intensity and
complexity of the hallucination (e.g., whether it is just geometric shapes, or
reliving complex past experiences) could be highly dependent on dose, as
well as effects on other cortical regions.
Recent work suggests that the degree of belief changes rests on how
strong the prior initially was
154,155. As such, weaker priors may be further
weakened (e.g., psychedelics shifting a slightly differing opinion closer to the
social norm156), and stronger priors may become stronger due to the
sociocultural and local environment tipping cognitive systems toward one
belief (e.g., political liberalism) or another (e.g., political conservatism)
during and after the acute phase
157. Indeed, the current evidence seems to
suggest that higher-level beliefs may be susceptible to change, although
environmental noise (e.g., local, and broader sociocultural setting) may act
as mediators of belief change as well
115,155,157. Whilst these concerns do not
preclude the FIBUS proposal here,future work should aim to further
investigate the relationship between hallucinations, mechanisms pertaining
to REBUS, and belief alterations.
Post-acute effects
The dopaminergic surge accompanying insights, combined with the
memory alterations, may result in an undue sense of conﬁdence for insights
accrued. Insights gleaned during psychedelic experiences may therefore
bear increased weighting in model selection (i.e., the set of beliefs that make
up the world model following the acute phase). For example, mystical
experiences encountered during the acute phase, and insights they incur
may be primary mediators of beneﬁcial belief updates
4,9,32,158–160. However, it
must also be noted that the subjective feeling of insight is not the same thing
as a genuine breakthrough, as even mundane ideas engendered by the
experience can seem more meaningful than what they really are
99,139,161,162.
For example, Mason et al139. found that higher decreases in functional
connectivity within the default modenetwork predicted increased feelings
of insightfulness, but decreases in objective originality. The key point is that
consistent with our FIBUS proposal, insights seem to be exaggerated both in
quality (subjectively deﬁned) and in quantity during psychedelics, and they
can deeply impact belief updating(perhaps even personality change
163), and
thus subsequent model selection.
A second-order consequence is that these insights and subsequent
beliefs may be more difﬁcult to revise, particularly when ascribed the
(memory systems modulated) noetic feelings accompanying them. A
potential by-product of the precision (and associated noetic feelings
m o d u l a t e db ym e m o r ys y s t e m s148) afforded to insights is the resulting belief
updates may be less amenable to change5,28. With psychedelic occasioned
insights, participants report a non-speciﬁc feeling of truth associated with
insights164. If it is not clearwhy an insight feels true, it can be difﬁcult to revise
since it is not clear what information could contradict it. For example, if I
have the insight that I am possessed by a negative entity, the prospect of
Fig. 2 | Depiction of REBUS effects and how they
result in insight moments and belief changes
(Figure created with BioRender.com).The red
distributions represent prediction errors, and green
distributions represent predictions. Higher levels
encode more domain general, complex abstractions
(i.e., high-level beliefs). Lower levels, such as the
sensory cortex, encode simpler and domain-speciﬁc
concepts (i.e., low levels, such as edge detectors
172).
High levels send descending predictions, while
prediction errors ascend the hierarchy until they are
explained away by higher levels. Insights (i.e., pre-
diction errors) arrived at during the trip are afforded
higher precision due to decreased precision
weighting of priors, rendering insights and con-
sequent beliefs higher precision thereafter— a
process that we have termed FIBUS.

which is central to some shamanic traditions, it may be extremely difﬁcult to
revise because the very foundation for the idea is simply the feeling. These
insights seem to have lasting behavioural effects, as discussed, such as
reductions in depression symptoms10,41, cessation of smoking and substance
use165,166. This is important in a clinical context if the goal is to increase
psychologicalﬂexibility such that more adaptive beliefs might be considered
and adopted.
A recently developed framework aimed at addressing issues of
psychedelic-induced false insights proposed the fostering of a‘gentle touch’
for revelations occurring during psychedelic therapy sessions. In this fra-
mework (deemed ‘psychedelic apprenticeship’), the relational processes
(e.g., therapeutic interventions performed by a therapist) occurring before,
during, and after the psychedelic session could serve as a scaffold for users’to
hold novel insights lightly11. These relational processes could be seen as a
form of‘thinking through other minds’or ‘cultural affordances’167,w h e r e b y
an experienced facilitator or therapistcan aid in the modulation of the users’
precision weighting of newly acquired insights or beliefs during psychedelic
therapy. With respect to our FIBUS model, the gentle touch framework,
alongside a rubric for making sense of the adaptiveness, veracity, and fal-
siﬁability of psychedelically derived insights (Fig.3), could offer clinicians a
framework for integrating psychedelic insights in a clinically useful way.
Below, we divide discussion of our FIBUS model into research and clinical
implications, offering novel hypotheses and considerations for clinicians
involved in integrating psychedelic insights.
Future directions, insights, and epistemic hygiene
Our FIBUS model lends itself to novel empirical predictions. First, FIBUS
predicts that subjective veracity and perceived number of insights under
psychedelics should linearly increase alongside dopaminergic release during
the acute psychedelic phase. This could be tested by leveraging tools such as
Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
168 or blood sampling in the acute
psychedelic phase. In the post-acute phase, researchers could ask how fre-
quently and strongly participants experienced these insight moments dur-
ing the acute phase. A second prediction here is that psychedelics should
induce more false insights than during ordinary cognition, as psychedelics
can increase the perceived (but not necessarily the objective) novelty or
accuracy of new ideas
4,139,169. To test this, future researchers could have
participants perform tasks whilst under varied doses of psychedelics and see
whether the number insights preceding a solution increase in number, and
whether they are less accurate than during ordinary cognition. To test for
strength of belief accuracy, researchers could administer, for example, a
Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale170 post acutely. Of course, testing for the
number and subjective veracity in these insight moments should themselves
predict the strength of beliefs, without having to test for dopamine. The
i m p l i c a t i o ni st h a tt h e s eb e l i e f ss h o u l db es t r o n g e rb u tl e s sa c c u r a t ew h e n
there was higher dopamine, and more false insights (both true and false),
arising during the psychedelic experience.
A clinically relevant issue requiring elaboration is the relationship
between truth and adaptiveness. As we have alluded to throughout this
paper, determining what counts as a“true” belief or insight is challenging in
complex domains beyond problem solving. We are also not making the
claim that true beliefs and adaptive beliefs are synonymous in all circum-
stances. A related notion here is that of falsiﬁability. Indeed, many meta-
physical beliefs that one may adopt following psychedelics do not easily lend
themselves to testing, at least not at the individual level. For example, if one
adopts panpsychist views (i.e.,“everything in the universe is conscious”)
following the acute phase, this is not a belief system that carries a clear
criterion on which it may be empirically proven or disproven. As such, the
challenge for the clinician may be to determine whether the newly found
panpsychist views are supportive orrefutative of the persons psycho-
pathologies. Put differently, if one does adopt views that are not easy to
amend or dispute, the clinical challenge becomes whether the belief betters
or worsens the patients’ clinical symptoms. It could well be that when
objectivity and falsiﬁability are not able to be established, adaptiveness could
become a more important locus for care. As such, the relative weighing of
these factors may depend on clinical judgement and the speciﬁcc l i n i c a l
goals of the patient.
Optimal integration of psychedelic insights in the clinical setting will be
an important aspect of psychedelic-assisted interventions. However, this is
no easy task given that any one insight can vary along several dimensions
including subjective intensity, emotional valence, as well as veridicality.
Moreover, as touched upon above, the contents of insights may vary along
dimensions including veridicality (i.e., how likely or unlikely an insight or
belief is to be objectively true), adaptiveness (i.e., whether an insight con-
ducive to better or worse clinical outcomes), and falsiﬁability (i.e., whether
the insights and consequent beliefs eas i l ya r eu p d a t a b l eb a s e do ns a m p l i n g
more sensory data). In Fig.3, we provide a tool for thinking about this
potential space of psychedelic insights, which may assist in identifying
relatively more and relatively less desirable insights. This relates to the
notion of‘epistemic hygiene’
171, in essence a directive of ensuring healthy,
appropriate, and (where possible) rigorous evaluation of claims arising from
psychedelic insights. To establish epistemic hygiene, then, is to imbue
thoughtful methods or frameworks for1) demarcating insights and beliefs
according to the norms and values of a speciﬁcs o c i a lo rc u l t u r a lc o n t e x ta n d
2) developing techniques for promotingdesired insights. We therefore offer
a candidate tool or rubric for thinking through the issue of epistemic hygiene
during psychedelic therapy, which may also be highly relevant for any
practices or interventions that increase the incidence of insights. Of course, it
is worth noting that where each insight ultimately falls is debatable, but the
point here is that this veridicality-adaptiveness-falsiﬁability axis could offer a
framework from which psychedelic induced insights can be optimally
integrated in clinical settings. We invite future empirical work to shed light
on these questions, particularly given forthcoming legalisation (for clinical
purposes) of psychedelics in several jurisdictions.
Summary and conclusion
Psychedelics are increasingly considered a viable and effective treatment
option for several psychiatric ailments. As such, understanding the
mechanisms by which psychedelics confer insight and new beliefs is
essential as they become increasingly integrated into clinical settings.
However, extant research and theorising has not sufﬁciently considered the
fact that psychedelics, and the feeling of insight they engender, do not
necessarily prefer accuracy, and are notnecessarily adaptive from a clinical
Fig. 3 | Schemata of possible insights one might arrive at under psychedelics.The
colored circles are illustrative examples only, and all these quantities and qualities
may vary from person to person. Each example insight in the box has a number
which corresponds to a particular insight under the‘Insights’title on the right-hand
side. The green axis refers to the direction which may be the overall ideal therapeutic
direction (i.e., veridical, adaptive, and, where possible, falsiﬁable beliefs) although
there are likely exceptions. Each of these dimensions is explained in the box below
with reference to the examples shown. Notably, some insights may confer a sense of
wellbeing (i.e., adaptiveness), but are inherently difﬁcult to verify. As such, the
challenge for a clinician may be to unpack each insight along the falsiﬁability-
veridicality-adaptiveness axis, making sure that insights are optimally leveraged to
facilitate clinical improvements.

perspective. This leaves open the possibility that rather than purely offering
amelioration, psychedelics may also act as an ampliﬁer for beliefs that
enhance existing pathologies or even create new ones. To this end, we have
offered theﬁrst cohesive account of how psychedelics may confer false
beliefs through insight from a neurocomputational perspective– a process

prises as psychedelic use increases it is important not to overlook the
potential for epistemic harm. We alsohope that our paper encourages future
research on the effects of set, setting, and therapeutic interventions on
facilitating valuable insights and adaptive beliefs.
