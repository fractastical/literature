ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA

Abstract 
 
This study presents a unified neurocomputational account of apraxia within the visuomotor system using the 
active inference framework. In this framework, the brain encodes a generative model of the causes of sensory 
observations and continually reduces the surprise (or, more formally, variational free energy) associated with 
these observations. Our goal is to illustrate how the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional organization of the 
visuomotor system are emergent consequences of this minimization under the appropriate generative model , 
while apraxia arises from incorrect parameterizations of the generative model. Our active inference model of 
the visuomotor pathways provides a unifying perspective on key findings in the neuropsychological literature. 
By virtually simulating impairments in the model, we explain key aspects of five neuropsychological 
syndromes impacting cognitive aspects of motor behaviour. This study, therefore, provides a novel hypothesis 
about the neurocomputational basis of the pathology and offers a formal quantitative approach to aid clinical 
research.

Introduction 
This study aims to provide a unified perspective on the visuomotor system and its deficiencies by examining 
them through neuropsychological, computational, and neuroanatomical lenses. To achieve this, we employ the 
active inference framework. This framework suggests that the brain encodes a generative model  to explain 
sensory observations and continuously strives to minimize the surprise (or more formally, variational free 
energy) associated with these observations. By adopting this framework, we present a computational 
explanation of apraxia that aligns with previous cognitive and neuroanatomical evidence. 
Limb apraxia is a neurological disorder that affects a person's ability to intentionally perform actions, initially 
delineated by Steinthal (1893)  as impairments in planning, action execution, and movement due to brain 
lesions. Crucially, these deficits neither stem from an inability to understand task instructions nor from issues 
within the sensorimotor system, object recognition, or frontal inertia (De Renzi et al., 1986; Heilman & Rothi, 
1993). Additionally, the impairment affects bilateral actions: deficits arise regardless of whether the affected 
or unaffected hand is used (Heilman & Rothi, 2003). The impairments can be categorized as either high-level 
or low-level, depending on the underlying cause and the specific symptoms the individual is experiencing. 
Regarding high and low processes, apraxia is generally considered a high- level cognitive impairment as it is 
often associated with damage to the parietal and frontal lobes of the brain, which are involved in these high-
level cognitive functions. However, according to Goldenberg 2014), high- level apraxia affects the cognitive 
and mental representation of actions, the ability to perform complex actions involving multiple steps, such as 
using tools or performing gestures, planning and coordinating movements. On the other hand, low -level 
apraxia refers to body representation and control and the details related to motion (Goldenberg, 2014). 
Apraxia assessments typically involve several tasks such as imitation, tests of pantomimes, verbal instructions 
and pictures  due to the frequent coexistence of cognitive -motor and language comprehension deficits 
(Goldenberg, 2014; Renzi, 1985). These evaluations requires both meaningful and meaningless actions, with 
the latter often impaired and not stored in long-term memory (Goldenberg et al., 1996; Mengotti et al., 2013; 
Rumiati & Tessari, 2002; Tessari et al., 2007) . Meaningful actions carry recognizable meaning derived from 
representations stored in long-term memory and can be categorized into transitive actions, involving physical 
manipulations (such as tool use or complex action sequences), and intransitive actions, encompassing symbolic 
gestures (such as military salutes or waving goodbye). Conversely, m eaningless actions lack identifiable 
effects on the environment, either material or communicative, and are interpreted solely based on their 
kinematic aspects (Goldenberg, 2014; Proietti et al., 2023).  
The first cognitive model of praxis, proposed by Rothi and colleagues (Rothi et al., 1991) , drew inspiration 
from language production models (Patterson & Shewell, 1987) and has since been further developed by various 
authors (L. J. Buxbaum & Randerath, 2018; Cubelli et al., 2000; Rumiati & Tessari, 2002) . This model 
delineates the cognitive processes involved in diverse motor tasks, including action recognition, imitation, 
pantomiming upon verbal command or visual cues, and potential processing breakdowns at different stages 
due to input-output mechanisms, stimulus types, and modality requirements (Rothi et al., 1991) . In the next 
two Sections , we build upon and extend  this cognitive model of praxis, establishing connections with 
neuroanatomical substrates and computational (active inference) mechanisms, respectively.  
A functional model of visuomotor cognition and its neuroanatomical mapping 
Our proposed functional model of visuomotor cognition encompasses three routes that map visual inputs into 
motor outputs, see Figure 1 . The first  route, a direct sub- lexical route employing a visuomotor conversion 
mechanism, breaks down observed actions into simpler motor components without relying on stored action 
representations. This route primarily reproduces meaningless actions (though it can also engage in reproducing 
meaningful actions) and governs the real -time control of object -directed actions. This aspect is crucial for 
encoding diverse affordances, enabling rapid online processing of visual information during object interaction, 
particularly based on temporary features like its orientation and location (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013).

Figure 1: Illustration of a functional model depicting visuomotor cognition and its neuroanatomical 
correspondence. The top-left portion of the model represents input, comprising visual (and phonological) 
information. This input undergoes parallel processing through three routes, each involving varying 
hierarchical levels of elaboration, spanning from sensorimotor to conceptual representations. The processing 
stages are interconnected via three routes: a direct route (blue), a lexical non -semantic route (red), and a 
lexical semantic route (green). Damage at different processing stages along these routes leads to distinct 
behavioral deficits. On the right, these routes are mapped onto the cortical neuroanatomy, aligning with the 
dorso-dorsal pathway (blue for the direct route), the dorso-ventral pathway (red for the lexical non-semantic 
route), and the ventral pathway (for the lexical semantic route). Adapted from (Tessari, Proietti, et al., 2021). 
 
The second  route, termed the lexical route, is specific to meaningful actions already belonging to an 
individual's repertoire, and it can be further segmented into semantic and non- semantic subroutes. The non-
semantic aspect involves a system for recognizing actions and tools, guiding a motor output (action output 
system) by reproducing well-learned, meaningful actions encoded as action engrams (Tessari & Rumiati, 2002; 
Tessari et al., 2021). This pathway predominantly relies on structure-related components of actions and tools, 
encompassing knowledge about stable features like typical grasping grips and action affordances (Binkofski 
& Buccino, 2018; Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013; Borghi & Riggio, 2015; Cubelli et al., 2000; Pellicano et al., 
2017; Rothi et al., 1991; Tessari & Rumiati, 2004). 
The third route, the semantic route, encompasses more abstract elements, including an action vocabulary 
(action semantics) and higher-level conceptual representations. This pathway facilitates the storage of motor 
programs by using an explicit gesture identification process and semantic representations of tools, emphasizing 
more invariant features like function and stable affordances, relying extensively on object knowledge (Bartolo 
et al., 2001; Buxbaum & Randerath, 2018; Cubelli et al., 2000; Mengotti et al., 2013; Rumiati & Tessari, 2002; 
Sakreida et al., 2016; Tessari et al., 2007) . All pathways converge into a motor working memory buffer that 
temporarily retains both meaningful and meaningless motor plans for execution (Buxbaum & Randerath, 2018; 

ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
5 
Cubelli et al., 2000; Rumiati & Tessari, 2002)  and facilitates learning new actions by enabling bidirectional 
interactions with long-term memory (Ottoboni et al., 2021; Tessari et al., 2006). 
The three routes interact closely and usually play a synergistic role in visuomotor processing, depending on 
the nature of the task and the environment (Buxbaum & Kalénine, 2010; Tessari & Rumiati, 2004). However, 
in cases like brain damage, these routes' distinct impacts on action reproduction become evident. For instance, 
patients may show specific difficulties in imitating either meaningful or meaningless actions, highlighting the 
relative independence between the direct and lexical routes (Bartolo et al., 2001; Cubelli et al., 2006; Mengotti 
et al., 2013; Tessari et al., 2007) . Our simulations in the next Sections  will emphasize how the location of 
impaired processing stages relates to particular cognitive and behavioral deficits (Bartolo et al., 2001; Heilman 
et al., 1982; Sirigu et al., 1995). 
The cognitive model shown in Figure 1 aligns with specific divisions of the brain's visuomotor pathways at a 
neuroanatomical level (Binkofski  & Buxbaum, 2013; Rizzolatti & Matelli, 2003) , building upon the 
foundational work of Goodale & Milner, 1992; Jeannerod et al., 1995; Mishkin et al., 1983. 
The first, dorso-dorsal stream is specialized for online sensorimotor representations of the postural alignment 
of different body parts and converts physical object properties, such as location or size, into appropriate motor 
commands to control reaching and grasping. The second, ventro-dorsal stream contains long-term structural 
representations about skilled actions, known motor programs, the manipulation of known tools and the spatio-
temporal aspects of actions (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013; Dressing et al., 2018; Hoeren et al., 2014; Niessen 
et al., 2014). The third, ventral stream processes the categorical relationships between perceptual and semantic 
elements (Dressing et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2013; Lambon Ralph, 2014; Musso et al., 2015; Patterson et al., 
2007; Rijntjes et al., 2012; Weiller et al., 2011b) , including conceptual, functional and semantic aspects of 
tool-use and gestures and the more symbolic ones (Dressing et al., 2018; Heilman et al., 1982; Niessen et al., 
2014; Ottoboni et al., 2021; Rijntjes et al., 1999; Tessari et al., 2007; Vry et al., 2015) . This stream overlaps 
areas involved in communicative tasks (Finkel et al., 2018) . It represents the “gate” to the action system for 
the phonological input lexicon, which allows one to perform an action on verbal command (Friederici et al., 
2000). 
Anatomically, the dorso-dorsal pathway runs from V3a to V6 to V6a and the medial intraparietal area (MIP) 
in the superior parietal lobule (SPL), and from there, via the superior longitudinal fascicle II, to premotor areas 
(F2vr and F7- non-SEF1) (Dressing et al., 2018; Hoeren et al., 2014; Martin, Beume, et al., 2016; Martin, 
Dressing, et al., 2016; Martin, Nitschke, et al., 2016; Vry et al., 2015) . The ventro-dorsal pathway runs, via 
arcuate and superior longitudinal fascicle III, from medial superior temporal area (MT/MST) to the inferior 
parietal lobule (IPL), and then to the ventral premotor cortex (AIP – F5 and VIP – F4) (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 
2013; Kalénine et al., 2010; Kreher et al., 2008; Vingerhoets, 2014; Vry et al., 2012) . The ventral pathway 
runs through the extreme capsule, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle and the uncinate fasciculus, connecting 
the inferior, middle and superior temporal area and the IPL to anterior IFG on the left side in humans (Catani 
et al., 2002, 2005; Hamzei et al., 2016; Makris & Pandya, 2009; Rijntjes et al., 2012; Saur et al., 2008; Weiller 
et al., 2011b, 2021) . Some authors suggest that the ventral stream should also include the lateral 
occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) (Lingnau & Downing, 2015). Moreover, it is connected with the left posterior 
superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), a region of the language processing network, involved in the perception and 
processing of speech sounds (phonological input lexicon), mapping auditory input to phonological 
representations (Fiebach et al., 2002; Friederici et al., 2000).  
The direct route and the processing of new movements for meaningless gesture imitation have been associated 
with the dorso-dorsal stream (Binkofski & Buxbaum, 2013; Hoeren et al., 2014; Martin, Dressing, et al., 2016; 
Rumiati et al., 2005; Tessari et al., 2007)  while the processing of known gestures and the lexical routes  have 
been related with regions belonging to both the left ventral and the ventro- dorsal streams (Binkofski & 
Buxbaum, 2013; Dressing et al., 2018; Kleineberg et al., 2018; Rijntjes et al., 2012; Rumiati et al., 2005; 
ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
6 
Tessari et al., 2007; Weiller et al., 2009, 2011b; Wurm & Caramazza, 2022) . Specifically, the ventral stream 
might decode the meaning of a movement  at the conceptual level,  with a focus on social  and intransitive 
gestures and non-motor aspects and task-irrelevant object properties (Bracci et al., 2017; Cubelli et al., 2000; 
Petreska et al., 2007; Wurm et al., 2017; Wurm & Caramazza, 2022) and the ventro-dorsal stream the structural 
descriptions of tools and recognition of gestures as meaningful (see also, Dressing, et al., 2018; Tessari et al., 
2021).  
 
An active inference perspective on visuomotor cognition and apraxia 
Here, we characterize visuomotor cognition and its impairments in apraxia, utilizing the active inference 
framework (Parr et al., 2022). Active inference starts from the premise that the brain constructs a generative 
model, a statistical representation of what causes sensory observations. The generative model allows the brain 
to predict the world's state and choose actions that align with expected observations, reducing surprises or 
deviations from predicted observations (more formally, minimizing variational free energy, see later) . The 
specific characterization of the generative model can help us understanding impaired brain functions since any 
neuropsychological disorders entails a set of prior beliefs that would make a patient’s behaviour appear Bayes 
optimal. A patient’s non-adaptive behaviour is explained not by a broken inference process, but it is due to 
damages over the biological substrata that encode priors and parameters of the generative model. The question 
we pose is what kind of prior beliefs are set to generate that optimal behaviour and which neural structure may 
encode those priors (see Parr et al., 2018
 for the notion of Bayes optimal pathology). 
Figure 2 illustrates how the functional model of visuomotor cognition in Figure 1 can be implemented as a 
hierarchical generative model in active inference. The hierarchical model comprises three main levels, for 
action observation (yellow  panels), action understanding (green panels) and action execution  (blue panels). 
The three levels operate on action representations at different hierarchical levels (Grafton & de C. Hamilton, 
2007; Proietti et al., 2023; Wurm & Lingnau, 2015) . The first, action observation level realizes a mapping 
from the kinematic features of the observed movement  to movement segments. Considering the case of a 
person obse rving somebody hammering a nail , this level maps from observed hand configurations to 
representations of movement segments  that involve multiple body parts,  such as the act s of grasping the  
hammer, lifting it and then hitting the nail.  
The second, action understanding level realizes a mapping from specific action sequences to conceptual action 
representations. Continuing the hammering example, this is the mapping between sequences of segments 
recognized at the lower level that achieve a motor goal (e.g., hammering a specific nail by performing a specific 
sequence of segments, like grasping, lifting, hitting) and the conceptual representation of the act of hammering, 
which can be achieved in principle by multiple sequences of segments (e.g., first lift and then hit, or hit twice 
before lifting again, and so on) This is also a mapping from structural to functional aspects of action.  
Finally, the third, action execution level implements motor responses, such as the imitation of the hammering 
action or a verbal report about it. 
From a computational perspective, i mplementing the above visuomotor functions requires defining various 
model variables corresponding to the round nodes in Figure 2. These comprise observations (o), such as visual, 
phonological or proprioceptive sensations at the action observation level ; hidden states (s), such as a single 
movement segment at the action observation level or a sequence of segments at the action understanding level, 
which are not directly observed but need to be inferred by integrating multiple observations; and policies (π), 
which dictate (sequences of) executed actions, such as imitative responses at the a ction execution level (or 
even saccades performed to help infer the observed actions, which are not the focus of this study).  
ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
7 
Furthermore, implementing the above visuomotor functions  requires defining matrices that define mappings 
between hidden states and observations , which correspond to the (A, B, C, D, and E) squares, and the α 
parameter in Figure 2. The A (likelihood) matrices map hidden states and observations. Note that in this 
hierarchical architecture, inferred hidden states at the level below become observations at the level above. The 
B (transition) matrices map hidden states through consecutive time points, providing memory to the system. 
The C matrices are priors over observations, which play the role of a person’s prior preferences and bias action 
selection by influencing the expected free energy G (see later). The D matrices correspond to prior probabilities 
of initial states. The E matrices are priors over the policies that define which courses of action are more likely 
a-priori and correspond to a habitual component of action selection. Finally, the α parameter sets the precision 
on how the policy π is translated in an executed action: the higher the value the more the selected action 
corresponds to the planned action. 
In this study, we do not specify model variables (o, s, π) or matrices (A, B, C, D, and E)  of the generative 
model, since our main goal is illustrating how active inference conceptualizes  visuomotor cognition, not 
implementing it. T he interested readers might consult (Proietti et al., 2023) , which provides a specific 
implementation of visuomotor cognition in the context of perceiving, recognizing and imitating tennis 
movements. Instead, we explain how the model variables and matrices map into the functional scheme for 
visuomotor cognition advanced here. These will be relevant in the subsequent sections, in which we describe 
how “virtual lesions” to model variables and matrices produce specific apraxia impairments.  
As depicted in Figure 2, at the action observation level (in yellow), policies π and likelihood matrices A are 
configured to conduct a kinematic analysis and infer movement segments (on the left), providing an account 
of visual analysis in the cognitive model (on the right). At the action understanding level (in green), a higher 
level in the generative model (on the left) involves prior beliefs about sequences of segments, which are then 
mapped to the phonological input lexicon node in the cognitive model (on the right). A likelihood matrix A is 
employed to recognize sequences of segments, mapped with the action input level (on the right), representing 
a structural level of description. Another likelihood matrix A is used to infer conceptual representation (on the 
left) and is mapped in the cognitive model with semantic memory, representing a functional level of 
description. At the action execution level (in blue), links are propagated from the action observation and 
understanding levels. Here, the prior over policies E (on the left) represents procedural action execution in the 
action output system (on the right), while expected free energy G (on the left) executes actions in a goal -
directed way, representing a visuo-motor conversion mechanism in the cognitive model (on the right).

Figure 2: Generative model for hierarchical action processing and its mapping to  visuomotor cognition. 
The left part of the figure shows a generative model that supports visuomotor tasks in act ive inference. The 
same model i s used in (Proietti et al., 2023)  to simulate the understanding and imitation of actions in the 
context of tennis. It is formalized as a Partially Observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which 
hidden states (s) and observations (o) are discrete probability distributions and A, B. C, D, E matrices specify 
prior values and probabilistic mappings between states and observations , and the α parameter  acts as an  
action precision parameter, see the main text for an explanation of these variables and (Proietti et al., 2023) 
for more details. The right part of the figure shows the mapping between the generative model and the 
functional model illustrated in Figure 1. The generative model is hierarchical and comprises three 
interconnected levels, shown in yellow, green and blue. The action observation level (in yellow) maps observed 
actions from kinematic analysis to movement segments. The action understanding level (in green) maps from 
sequences of movement segments (i.e., a structural level) to conceptual representations of action (i.e., a 
functional level). Finally, the action execution level selects motor responses (e.g., imitative responses). Action 
recognition relies on the reciprocal connections between the action understanding and the action observation 
levels. The action u nderstanding level generates hypotheses about the observed movements and these are 
tested at the action observation level ; in the simulations reported in (Proietti et al., 2023) , this hypothesis 

ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA

testing operates by directing  saccades to the most informative portions of movement . At the same time, 
posterior beliefs about movement segments at the action observation level become observations at the action 
understanding level, therefore creating bidirectional interactions between the two levels. This also implies that 
hidden state transitions at the two levels operate at different time scales: those at the action understanding 
level operate more slowly, since they have to accumulate observations provided by action observation level. 
The Action Execution level proceeds at its own pace, independent of the other levels.  
 
Once all the variables and matrices of the generative model are set, visuomotor tasks such as understanding 
and imitating an observed hammering action can be implemented using the standard equations of active 
inference. Here, we provide a succinct introduction to the fundamental equations that active inference uses to 
steer perception (infer states of the world, such as which action is being performed by a demonstrator ) and 
action (e.g., select and execute imitative responses). We refer to (Da Costa et al., 2020; Parr et al., 2022; Smith 
et al., 2021) for a more detailed explanation. 
In active inference, both perception and action are realized by the single imperative of minimizing the so -
called variational free energy (F), see Equation 1. The variational free energy is defined as a function of two 
things: an auxiliary distribution called the variational distribution (q) that represents the agent’s best (but yet 
approximate, i.e., variational) estimate of hidden states, and current observations (o). The equation comprises 
two terms. The former term assesses the Kullback Leibler (or KL) divergence between beliefs about hidden 
states in the variational distribution q and those that would have obtained were it possible to perform exact (as 
opposed to variational) inference (p(s|o)). The second term is a negative log evidence (or surprise) of 
observations −ln p(o)) , which scores how well the model predicts them. Importantly, from a cognitive 
perspective, minimising divergence and maximising evidence map to two complementary sub -objectives of 
perception and action, respectively. In this perspective, perceptual inference lowers free energy by making the 
approximate posterior Q as close as possible to the true posterior belief p(s|o). Action (despite not appearing 
explicitly in the equation) lowers free energy by changing sensory data to change the log evidence term.

When considering planning, an active inference agent chooses a course of actions or policy (π) that minimizes 
long-term free energy, termed expected free energy (G). The expected free energy is specific to each policy π 
and has two components. The first is risk, assessing the divergence between the observations expected from a 
policy (q(o|π)) and the preferred observations in the agent's model (p(o)). The second is ambiguity, measuring 
the expected uncertainty of the model's likelihood function (p(o|s)). Together, these components enable the 
agent to plan effectively, balancing between exploiting known preferences and exploring for new information. 
Minimizing risk guides the agent towards exploiting preferred observations, determining goal -directed 
behavior by aligning with its preferences. Conversely, minimizing ambiguity drives exploratory behavior, 
seeking information to reduce uncertainty about the world's states.

After calculating the expected free energy (G) for each policy, it is combined with variational free energy (F) 
and a prior belief over policies (E). This combination is transformed into a prior distribution over policies, 
p(π), utilizing a softmax function. 
 
𝜋𝜋0 =  σ(lnE −F −G) 
 
In sum, using t his method , action selection is a function of variational free energy (F),  which takes into 
consideration the current situation but not the future; goal-directed components of action (G), which take into 
consideration future  states and  observations; and of habitual components of actions (E), which take into 
consideration whether in the past a policy was selected in the same context or not.  
 
Virtual lesions of the generative models and apraxia 
Here, we discuss how performing five types of “virtual lesions” of the generative model of Figure 2 permits 
reproducing distinct aspects of apraxia. In our discussion, we assume that the active inference agent plays the 
role of a 'patient' that has to perform four types of tasks in response to requests from a 'clinician,' which are 
used clinically to assess correct or impaired visuomotor processing (Cubelli et al., 2000). 
 
Recognition of familiar actions and pantomime agnosia   
The first task consists in the recognition of familiar actions. Here, the patient has to recognize the meaning of 
a known symbolic gesture performed by the clinician, such as a “goodbye” movement of the arm, see Figure 
3A. In our model, familiar actions are recognized through a series of mappings from the observed kinematics 
to movement segments (at the action observation level), then to sequences of segments and finally conceptual 
representations (at the action understanding level). These mappings are specified by a series of likelihood (A) 
matrices. All these likelihood functions are correctly set in normal conditions  and afford accurate  action 
recognition across all levels.  
However, creating virtual lesions by impairing one or more of these likelihood matrices is possible. Here, we 
illustrate the effects of impairing the likelihood function that encodes the mapping between movement 
segments and their sequences, representing a structural level of action understanding, see the red dotted squares 
in Figure 3B. This impairment can be done by rendering the likelihood mapping highly entropic (or “flat”), so 
that the observation of a certain sequence of movement segments does not translate into a conceptual 
representation of the observed action, see Figure 3C  for a graphical illustration of the difference between a 
correct likelihood function (with low entropy) and an incorrect one (with high entropy). In this case, the patient 
has access to a correct kinematic analysis of movement and movement segments, but loses access to structural 
knowledge or the “meaning” of familiar actions encoded in sequences of segments, hence cannot report them 
(Buxbaum et al., 2000).

Figure 3: Simulation of r ecognition of familiar actions and pantomime agnosia. In Panel A , the task 
executed is recognising familiar actions in which the red dotted lines indicate the associated behavioural 
impairment. In Panel B, the red dotted lines around the node “Action input system” indicate the locus of the 
virtual lesion. Here, the structural level of description is impaired. Panel C shows the difference between a 
correct likelihood function and the incorrect one, used to simulate the lesion. In the matrixes, the stronger the 
tint, the stronger the probabilistic relations. 
 
The simulated patient manifests the clinical profile of gesture and pantomime agnosia. The first clinical report 
of pantomime agnosia was provided by Rothi and colleagues (1986). This deficit is defined as a severe loss of 
semantic knowledge about gesture and tool structure  and is not due to  a deficit in visual acuity, attention, or 
general cognitive ability. This is reflected in our model since the deficit is at the level of action understanding 
(and more specifically, the likelihood function encoding structural knowledge) and not action observations.. 
Interestingly, patients with gesture and pantomime agnosia could imitate pantomimes they could not recognise 
(Rothi et al., 1986). This observation supports the idea that the stored knowledge about gestures and tool 
structure and function supports their recognition and understanding but is not strictly necessary for gesture 
imitation and tool use. Anatomically these functions are supported by the inferior parietal lobule and adjacent 
regions in the temporal-parietal junction (Buxbaum et al., 1997; Lauro-Grotto et al., 1997; Negri et al., 2007). 
Similarly, identifying an object and recognizing object -associated pantomimes can be dissociated from the 
ability to use tools and imitate their pantomime (Negri et al., 2007; Rumiati et al., 2009; Tessari et al., 2007). 
In our model, performing an action that was not previously recognized is possible using the route that permits 
executing unknown actions: the visuo- motor conversion system , illustrated in blue in Figure 3B . In other 
words, in this case, the patient treats the observed gesture as an unknown, meaningless gesture. Finally, in our 
model it is also possible to execute gestures on verbal command (Rothi et al., 1986), because the phonological 
input lexicon can directly access semantic memory, see Figure 3B.

Execution of actions upon verbal command and conceptual apraxia 
The second task involves the execution of actions upon verbal command. Here, the patient has to perform an 
action commanded by the clinician, such as a military salute  (see Figure 4 A). In our model, prompting an 
action via verbal command is achieved by modifying the prior belief for that action in the D vector of the 
sequences of segments. The recognition of this command is facilitated by mapping the conceptual 
representations of action at the action understanding level. This mapping is specified by a likelihood (A) 
matrix. Under normal conditions, after the recognition of the command, the information is passed to the action 
execution level, where the E vector (which encodes priors over policies) is informed and prompted to execute 
the action in a procedural way (see Figure 4B). 
However, in this context, we create a virtual le sion by impairing the likelihood mapping that allows the 
recognition of conceptual representations of actions. The locus of this lesion is the highest level of action and 
tools representation, the semantic memory, where semantic, conceptual, and functional aspects are 
encompassed. As before, this impairment can be achieved by rendering the likelihood mapping “flat.” See 
Figure 4C for a graphical illustration of the difference between a correct likelihood function (with low entropy) 
and an incorrect one (with high entropy). This damage impairs the possibility of executing actions and 
pantomimes of object use based on verbal command (the phonological input lexicon is indeed directly 
connected to semantics).

behavioral impairment. In Panel B, the red dotted lines around the node "Semantic Memory" indicate the locus 
of the virtual lesion. Here, the functional level of description is impaired. Panel C shows the difference between

a correct likelihood function and an incorrect one, used to simulate the lesion. In the matrices, the stronger 
the tint, the stronger the probabilistic relations. 
 
In the simulated patient, imitation is spared (she can imitate using the visuomotor conversion mechanism, in 
the blue route), and there are problems in attributing meaning to gestures (i.e., recognizing) via explicit verbal 
identification. However, visual discrimination of existing (meaningful) actions is intact, as the action input 
system is spared (Ochipa et al., 1992; Heilman et al., 1995). This occurs because the system can still provide 
a structural description of the input supported by the non-conceptual ventro-dorsal pathway, but the multimodal 
and non- motor aspects of action knowledge are impaired, supported in the posterior IPL and the ventral 
occipital temporal cortex (VOTC) (Bi et al., 2016; Leshinskaya & Caramazza, 2014)). This recapitulates the 
ability to disentangle familiar from unfamiliar gestures and to tell apart well- executed from clumsy gestures 
but not to engage in higher-level identifications. This corresponds to the clinical profile of conceptual apraxia, 
also defined as a semantic type of ideational apraxia (Cubelli 2000), where familiar gestures are recognized as 
such (the structural description is spared), but explicit identification is impaired. These deficits occur in the 
absence of ideomotor apraxia and semantic language impairment s (Bayles et al., 1987): while ideomotor 
apraxic patients typically make production errors, such as temporal or spatial errors (Heilman & Rothi, 1985), 
semantic ideational apraxic patients typically make content errors (Ochipa et al., 1989). The loss of knowledge 
concerns the appropriate actions associated with the tool: the patient shows impairment in selecting the proper 
tool for a particular task and understanding and solving mechanical problems based on intuitive physics 
(Ochipa, et al., 1992). This supports the idea that the impairment locus is at a conceptual, functional description 
level and the neural separability of perceptual and conceptual representations (Leshinskaya & Caramazza, 
2016). 
The patient can also execute an action on the visual or the proprioceptive/tactile presentation of an object, as 
the object recognition system (the action input system, in the red route in Figure 4) can bypass the semantic 
memory and connect directly to the action output system. As anticipated, objects, their use, and the associated 
affordances (structural and functional; Buxbaum and Kalénine, 2010) share the encoding of their 
representations with movements and body parts (Maravita & Iriki, 2004). However, in the example shown, the 
simulated patient is not given the possibility to interact with a real object. When this occurs, the patient is 
exposed to a new set of sensory inputs, including proprioceptive sensations and visual and auditory 
consequences of using the tool. Therefore, according to our model predictions, since semantic structures 
consider both movements and objects, the actual use of a tool would lead to an increased temporary recovery 
of the behavioral impairment (see Figure 5). This happens because the cascade of sensory input during object 
manipulation can positively affect impaired functional and structural knowledge. In Bayesian terms, this 
occurs because the posterior belief for action selection is determined by priors (which are all lesione d here) 
but also sensory observations that are much richer during the interaction with an object. This proves that 
semantic memory and the patient's conceptual impairments are diminished, as shown in (Goldenberg & 
Hagmann, 1998; Goldenberg & Spatt, 2009; K leineberg et al., 2018; Rothi et al., 1991). In other words, the 
sensorimotor aspects can partially compensate for semantic damage.

Figure 5 : A  damage over the semantic memory can be partially compensated when actual tool use is 
engaged. In panel A is shown that interactions with tools influences the node “Semantic memory” in Panel B 
by providing, as shown in Panel C, that  several sensory observation s act as evidence for the damaged 
likelihood matrix A 
 
Imitation of a familiar action (pantomime) and procedural apraxia  
In this task, the patient is required to imitate the execution of a familiar action (pantomime), as depicted in 
Figure 6A. This imitation task relies on the connection between the information gathered during action 
understanding and its translation into familiar/procedural action execution—specifically, the link between 
posterior beliefs at the action understanding level and the skilled procedural motor controller, represented by 
the vector E in the action output system (see Figure 6B). 
Here, we can simulate a virtual lesion by severing this connection. By doing so, the prior over policies E is no 
longer informed about which policy should be selected, rendering them all equally probable (refer to Figure 
6C). In other words, the motor program stored in memory becomes disconnected from procedural -skilled 
motor control, which would otherwise drive the execution of the action as a cohesive action program.

the imitation of a familiar action in which the red dotted lines indicate the associated behavioural impairment.

Here, the translation in a procedural action is impaired. Panel C shows the difference between a correct 
procedural policy selection and the incorrect one, used to simulate the lesion. In the matrixes, the stronger the 
tint, the stronger the probabilistic relations. 
 
 
The simulated patient manifests the clinical profile of a procedural type of apraxia where familiar gestures are 
recognized and comprehended (as semantic memory is spared), but their execution is impaired; conversely , 
meaningless gestures are correctly imitated through the direct route (Tessari et al., 2007). The clinical profile 
is supported by the observation that deficits in movement programming, which include wrong action sequences 
and inappropriate use of objects and matching tasks, are dissociable from more action semantics errors 
(Hermsdörfer et al., 2012). The anterior IPL, the posterior middle temporal gyrus, the insula and the extreme 
capsule are associated with the encoding motor knowledge as action engrams (Buxbaum et al., 2005; Heilman 
& Rothi, 2003; Hermsdörfer et al., 2013; Kalénine et al., 2010)  to detect invariant spatiotemporal features of 
skilled movements shaped during motor learning (Hoeren et al., 2014; Vry et al., 2012; Weisberg et al., 2007).  
 
Imitating a novel, meaningless action and conduction apraxia 
In this task, the patient is tasked with imitating the execution of a novel, meaningless action, as illustrated in 
Figure 7A. The success of this imitation task relies on the connection between the information gathered during 
action observation and its translation into goal -directed action execution —specifically, the link between 
posterior beliefs about movement segments and th e goal-directed motor controller G, representing a visuo -
motor conversion mechanism (see Figure 7B).  

ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
16 
Here, we can simulate a "virtual lesion" by severing this connection. By doing so, the expected free energy for 
the goal-directed motor controller G will no longer attempt to move towards a preferred observation (C) since 
all observations will be equally preferred (a flat prior) (Figure 7C). In other words, we disrupt the route that 
translates low-level, sensorimotor representations about the observed action into the motor plan (Pezzulo  et 
al., 2018, Proietti et al., 2023).  
 
Figure 7: Simulation of imitation a meaningless action and conduction apraxia. In panel A, the task executed 
is the imitation of novel, meaningless, action in which the red dotted lines indicate the associated behavioural 
impairment. In panel B the red dotted lines around the node “ Visuomotor conversion mechanism” indicate 
the locus of the virtual lesion. Here, the translation in a goal -directed action is impaired. Panel C shows the 
difference between a correct prior preference mapping and the incorrect one, used to simulate the lesion. In 
the matrixes, the stronger the tint, the stronger the probabilistic relations. 
 
In our anatomic model, the direct route is mapped to the dorso-dorsal stream. The simulated patient manifests 
the clinical profile of conduction apraxia, where the impairment is specific for meaningless actions while 
familiar gesture recognition, comprehension and execution are spared (Ochipa et al., 1994). The performance 
of movement is often clumsy and rigid (Heugten, 1998; Shelton & Knopman, 1991) . More specifically, an 
impaired imitation of meaningless gestures is associated with a dysfunction of the body schema (Buxbaum et 
al., 2000), which encoding is based on the integration of visual and proprioceptive input about the position of 
body parts that support spatial limb representations encoded in the SPL (Hagura et al., 2007; Lacquaniti et al., 
1995; Seelke et al., 2012)  and the visuospatial transformations involved in mapping observed postures into 
‘somatesthetic spatial code’ performed by the IPS ( Buxbaum, 2001; Creem-Regehr et al., 2007; Watson et al., 
1986). Our generative model recapitulates this as the disruption is localized in the representations of the 
kinematics analysis and movement segment s. Numerous clinical cases of patients able to correctly execute 
tools pantomime and symbolic gestures but unable to imitate meaningless actions have been reported, and 
some of them also reported double dissociations between imitation of meaningful and mean ingless actions 
(Bartolo et al., 2001; Goldenberg & Hagmann, 1997; Ochipa et al., 1994; Tessari et al., 2007) . These studies 

ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
17 
support that imitating meaningless gestures relies on a low -level sensorimotor pathway that rapidly maps 
perception to action execution independently from semantic memory. Most impairments have been observed 
after left brain damage, specifically in the inf erior parietal cortex, which is more commonly associated with 
apraxia (Bartolo & Ham, 2016; De Renzi et al., 1980; Goldenberg, 1995; Goldenberg & Hagmann, 1997; 
Heilman & Rothi, 1993; Tessari et al., 2007) . Indeed, meaningless hand gesture processing predominantly 
comprises brain areas involved in action planning. The network includes the temporo- occipital junction (BA 
19/37), the inferior and superior parietal cortex (BA 40and BA 5/7), with a critical role of the inferior parietal 
lobe for mapping perception to action (Dressing et al., 2018; Martin, Beume, et al., 2016; Martin, Dressing, et 
al., 2016; Martin, Nitschke, et al., 2016).  
 
Simulation of all tasks and action working memory apraxia 
In this scenario, the patient performs all the previously mentioned tasks, and we induce a virtual lesion by 
assigning a low value to the precision parameter (α) (Figure 8). This parameter acts as a system translating the 
policy (action planning) into a sequence of actions (action execution), resulting in high randomness in selecting 
the latter. This parameter, analogous to a memory buffer for actions, holds the motor plan r eady for 
implementation (Rumiati & Tessari, 2002). The higher its value, the more pr ecisely the planned actions are 
implemented. Conversely, lower values can be viewed as an inability to retain the current plan and translate it 
into actions. When this mechanism is impaired, all motor responses (related to both known and new actions 
and in each presentation modality) are affected, as the motor buffer plays a role in all aspects of action 
execution (Figure 8C). 
 
Figure 8: Simulation of all tasks and action working memory apraxia. In panel A, all the tasks are executed. 
Here, the red dotted lines indicated the ones behaviorally impair ed. In panel B , the red dotted lines around 
the node motor responses indicate the locus of the virtual lesion. Here, the translation from plan to movement 
is impaired. Panel C shows the difference between a high value of α and a low one, used to simulate the lesion 
in a memory buffer. 
 

ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
18 
 
The simulated patient exhibits impairments in executing gestures, whether on verbal command or in imitation 
tasks (both meaningful and meaningless actions). The working memory subsystem dedicated to processing 
motor information is distinct, not associated with verbal or visuospatial working memory, and specifically 
designed for encoding, retaining, and recalling goal -directed actions and body configurations (Rumiati & 
Tessari, 2002; Smyth et al., 1988; Galvez-Pol et al., 2020) . The existence of a working memory component 
for actions is supported by several behavioral studies (Rumiati & Tessari, 2002; Smyth et al., 1988; Smyth & 
Pendleton, 1990; Wood, 2007). These studies have observed a decreased memory span in primary motor tasks 
executed concurrently with a secondary motor task, compared to verbal or spatial secondary tasks, indicating 
the specificity of motor working memory. A recent study has also reported neuropsychological evidence for a 
distinct motor working memory subsystem: left hemisphere stroke patients with apraxia demonstrated a more 
pronounced deficit in motor working memory tasks (involving pictures of oriented objects, meaningless and 
meaningful actions) compared to left hemisphere patients without apraxia and controls (Bardakan et al., 2022). 
At the neuroanatomical level, the maintenance of this motor information seems to be associated with the 
frontoparietal praxis network. Increased functional connectivity and activation in the frontoparietal network 
during a greater memory load of motor information have been reported (Cai et al., 2018). Furthermore, the left 
middle and right inferior frontal gyri and the superior and inferior parietal lobule of the left hemisphere have 
been implicated in the maintenance of biological motion (Lu et al., 2016). In the context of tool use, activations 
in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left ventral premotor cortex have been observed during the maintenance 
of manipulable tools compared to non-manipulable ones (Mecklinger et al., 2002). In our model, the lower the 
action precision parameter (the α parameter), the less precisely the planned actions are implemented, whether 
they are meaningful or meaningless actions, or object use and pantomimes. This aligns with the 
neuropsychological evidence provided by Bardakan and colleagues (2022), who demonstrated that the overall 
performance in motor working memory tasks predicted the severity of apraxic deficits in clinical tests of 
gesture imitation. 
 
Discussion 
In this study, we proposed a computational account of apraxia within the active inference framework. This 
account aims to offer a novel conceptualization of apraxia and address certain issues in its definition. For 
instance, Petreska and colleagues (Petreska et al., 2007)  suggested a lack of systematicity in apraxia 
assessments, leading to contradictory and inconsistent results, ambiguous terminology use, and a high 
dimensionality in models' parameters, complicating statistical approaches. 
In active inference, understanding brain function and dysfunction revolves around defining an appropriate 
generative model for the task (Parr et al., 2020; Parr & Friston, 2018) . Here, we adopt a generative model of 
visuomotor cognition that aligns with a prior characterization of hierarchical action processing (Proietti et al., 
2023). This model incorporates crucial neuroanatomical evidence, such as the existence of three routes for 
action processing, extensively discussed in both language processing Coltheart et al., 1983; Coslett, 1991; Law 
et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2002)  and the neuropsychological literature (Dressing et al., 2018; Martin, Beume, et 
al., 2016; Martin, Nitschke, et al., 2016) 
The proposed generative model is hierarchical, emphasizing the significance of hierarchical processing not 
only for action understanding but also for various cognitive abilities (Grafton & de C. Hamilton, 2007; Hasson 
et al., 2015; Kiebel et al., 2008; Lee & Mumford, 2003; Murray et al., 2014; Pacherie, 2008; Pezzulo et al., 
2018; Vidaurre et al., 2017). This hierarchical model consists of three levels, illustrated in Figure 2. The action 
observation level maps kinematic movement features (elementary motor engrams and body parts relations) to 
movement segments, capturing relationships between body parts. The action understanding level provides a 
ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
19 
semantic interpretation by encoding structural descriptions (sequences of movement segments) and functional-
conceptual descriptions. Here, identification occurs as representations generalize at a conceptual level, 
becoming less constrained by motor aspects. The action execution level replicates the motor response structure, 
enabling the reproduction of observed or instructed actions. 
The action observation and action understanding levels engage in reciprocal interaction during action 
observations. At the action understanding level, hypotheses about observed actions form at a slower time scale 
and are tested by engaging saccades at the action observation level, at a faster time scale. Simultaneously, 
posterior beliefs regarding postures at the action observation level ascend as messages, becoming 
observationsat the action understanding level (Proietti et al., 2023) . This reciprocal exchange implies that 
action processing across different levels can mutually influence each other (Friston et al., 2017; Kiebel et al., 
2008, 2009). 
Crucially, our research demonstrates that 'virtual lesions' of the model yield deficits associated with five 
distinct types of limb apraxia: pantomime agnosia, involving the loss of structural knowledge about actions 
and tools; conceptual apraxia, characterized by the loss of high- level functional representation knowledge; 
procedural apraxia, indicating the inability to translate perceived movements into pre -existing motor 
programs; conduction apraxia, where the failure in movement translation affects lower -level sensorimotor 
capabilities; and action working memory apraxia, resulting from a reduced memory span in motor tasks. These 
deficits emerge automatically by lesioning various parameters within the same generative model, impacting 
different stages of action processing. This underscores the broad applicability of our ap proach. Our 
neuropsychological characterization is inspired by the concept of Bayes optimal pathology (Parr et al., 2018), 
explaining a patient's non-adaptive behaviour in terms of damage to the biological substrates encoding model 
priors and parameters, rather than an incorrect inference process. 
Another important feature of our generative model is its demonstration of degeneracy in action recognition 
and execution. In biological systems, degeneracy denotes the capacity to employ alternative structures for the 
same task (Edelman & Gally, 2001; Tononi et al., 1994, 1999) . In the brain, this implies that a cognitive 
function can be supported by multiple neural systems (Friston & Price, 2003; Noppeney et al., 2004; Price & 
Friston, 2002; Sajid et al., 2020) . This holds significant relevance in neuropsychology, where identical 
behavioral outcomes can arise from different strategies or pathways. In our model, degeneracy manifests as 
action execution being driven by the posterior belief of three factors: the sequence of movement segments, the 
structural description, and the functional-conceptual description. Although these factors typically combine, the 
execution of actions remains functional even if one is absent. This degeneracy contributes to robust action 
execution and offers insights into how various pathways may facilitate functional recovery following brain 
damage. 
While this study focused on conceptually describing the generative model and its disruptions in apraxia, a 
crucial avenue for future research involves leveraging this model to aid data analyses in clinical settings. 
Establishing generative models capable o f replicating specific deficits enables quantitative computational 
phenotyping of patients (Schwartenbeck & Friston, 2016) , aligning brain computations with measurable 
behaviors (Krakauer & Shadmehr, 2007; Mirza et al., 2016; Testolin & Zorzi, 2016). This direction forms part 
of our intended focus for future studies. 
Another significant avenue for future research involves elucidating the neural foundations of the proposed 
model. Despite the seemingly abstract nature of active inference's optimization processes, they can be linked 
to alterations in neural activity and c onnectivity across multiple levels (Bastos et al., 2012; Da Costa et al., 
2021; Friston, FitzGerald, et al., 2017; Friston & Kiebel, 2009; Parr et al., 2022). For instance, processes such 
as perceptual inference correspond to changes of synaptic activity, while learning and optimizing the 
generative model relate to modifications in synaptic connections and their effectiveness. Attention and 
precision signal opti mization are associated with fine -tuning post-synaptic gains, and behaviors and motor 
ACTIVE INFERENCE AND LIMB APRAXIA 
20 
control involve refining proprioceptive prediction errors. These mechanisms collectively work toward 
minimizing free energy or, equivalently, maximizing evidence for the organism's generative model. Notably, 
lesions within our model align with the concept of disconnection syndrome (Catani & Ffytche, 2005) . 
Disconnection syndrome may stem from disruptions in the likelihood mapping between two neural 
populations, represented in our model's Dirichlet (a) parameters of A matrices. At the neural level, these 
parameters correspond to synaptic connection strengths, where incorrect Hebbian neural plasticity might 
contribute to such disconnection. Moreover, a disconnection can occur when the propagation of posteriors 
between different hierarchical levels is disrupted, resembling interruptions in axonal connections. Further 
development and empirical testing of these concepts stand as crucial objectives for the future.
