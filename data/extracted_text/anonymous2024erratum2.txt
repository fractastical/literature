Due to a production error, the conﬂict of interest statement was erroneously omitted.
The statement reads as follows:
KF and RP were employed by the VERSES AI Research Lab.
The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of
any commercial or ﬁnancial relationship that could be construed as a potential conﬂict
of interest. The author(s) declare that they were members of the editorial board of
Frontiers, at the time of submission. This had no impact on the peer review process or
the ﬁnal decision.
The publisher apologizes for this mistake. The original article has been updated.
