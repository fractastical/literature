Computational theories have fundamentally changed the scientific understanding of how 
the mind works for both healthy and pathological experiences and behaviours. In this 
context, the active inference framework has gained considerable attention within the 
scientific community (Heins et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022). As a process theory, it 
integrates complex phenomena, such as perception, learning, and action under a unified 
theory of Bayesian inference (Da Costa et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2017). Active inference 
has proven useful in modelling data from heterogeneous fields ranging from cognitive 
neuroscience to biology and general psychology (e.g., Friston et al., 2016, 2017). Its com­
putational tractability and biological plausibility have also made it increasingly relevant 
to clinical psychology in recent years (e.g., Smith, Badcock, et al., 2021).
In active inference and related, Bayesian neurocomputational theories, it is assumed 
that individuals do not have direct access to the circumstances in their surroundings. 
Instead, they have to infer the (probabilistic) properties of their environment through 
action and perception by integrating prior information about their environment with 
ambiguous sensory input in a rational (i.e., Bayes-optimal) manner (Friston et al., 2016; 
Hohwy et al., 2008). The resulting “internal model of the world” (i.e., the agent’s beliefs 
about how certain sensory information relates to environmental conditions) shapes 
future perception (Friston, 2010) and enables agents to leverage the past to predict 
the future in an ever-changing environment (Badcock et al., 2017). In accordance with 
this perspective, perception, action, and learning are all subject to inferential process­

es on different timescales (Smith et al., 2022). Individuals thus take an active role in 
constructing their experiences, which they can further alter by actively changing their 
environment.
Whereas accurate internal models provide good predictions about which action se­
quences lead to preferred sensory observations, distorted internal models can lead to 
aberrant experiences and behaviours that may hinder the organism from achieving its 
goals (Badcock et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2015). There is evidence that the 
internal models of individuals with mental disorders show substantial deviations from 
each other and from the models of healthy individuals. For example, recent accounts 
of depression have conceptualised patients' tendency to reappraise or disregard posi­
tive information in terms of highly precise and hence tenacious negative prior beliefs 
(Kube et al., 2020). This computational perspective has inspired novel ideas for the treat­
ment of depression (e.g., Chekroud, 2015). Similar reconceptualisations with relevance 
for psychological treatments have been suggested for numerous mental disorders and 
health conditions, including psychosis (Sterzer et al., 2018), persistent somatic symptoms 
(Paulus et al., 2019), and eating disorders (Barca & Pezzulo, 2020).
In this context, the active inference framework offers the opportunity to formalise 
deviations in a person’s internal models, thus enabling a detailed description and op­
erationalisation of relevant experiential and behavioural distortions (e.g., Montague et 
al., 2012). From our point of view, this could improve clinical research, diagnostics, 
and the treatment of mental disorders in several ways. Clinical research may benefit 
from a finely grained formalisation of deviant experiences and behaviours within the 
active inference framework because it opens up a possibility for studying aetiological 
mechanisms from a computational perspective (Stephan, Binder, et al., 2016). Because 
of their generative structure, computational theories enable the derivation of well-opera­
tionalised hypotheses about pathological processes in mental disorders and the computer 
simulation of aberrant experience and behaviour. In comparison with empirical data, 
researchers could thus rigorously formalise, simulate, and compare different mechanis­
tic models of patients’ experiential and behavioural symptoms. Moreover, the active 
inference perspective could inform the diagnostics of mental disorders (or rather the 
diagnostics of patients’ implicit belief systems) by providing practitioners with individual 
estimates of their patients’ internal model parameters in disorder-relevant situations 
(Stephan, Bach, et al., 2016). For example, using probabilistic gambling tasks that dis­
tinguish between goal-directed information seeking and random exploration behaviour 
could provide clinicians with individual parameter diagnostics regarding the relationship 
between information seeking, reward sensitivity, and psychopathology in substance 
abusers (Smith, Schwartenbeck, et al., 2021). Such applications could not only strengthen 
a more transdiagnostic perspective on mental disorders, but also have tangible implica­
tions for treatment development and treatment selection. If we assume that therapeutic 
interventions may have different effects on patients' model parameters, finely grained

operationalisation in the context of active inference could contribute to tailored interven­
tions that target specifically these parameters. From the practitioner's perspective, it 
would be particularly important to investigate which tasks are likely to diagnose internal 
models that inform treatment selection and guide psychotherapy.
The active inference approach affords an improved mechanistic understanding of 
pathological processes in mental disorders. As a unifying process theory of brain and 
mind function, it brings together perception, learning, action, and decision making un­
der the umbrella of a Bayesian principle, which predestines it for clinical application. 
Because of its high degree of formalisation and its flexibility, we believe that the active 
inference approach is well suited to functionally link heterogeneous clinical phenomena 
to patients’ internal belief systems. This will enable researchers to better differentiate 
and operationalise underlying mechanisms and tailor the diagnosis, aetiology, and treat­
ment of mental disorders.
