Abstract 
Distributed processing that gives rise to pain experience is anchored by a multidimensional self-model. I show how the phenomenon 
of pain asymbolia and other atypical pain-related conditions (Insensitivity to Pain, Chronic Pain, ‘Social’ Pain, Insensitivity to Pain, 
Chronic Pain, ‘Social’ Pain, empathy for pain and suffering) can be explained by this idea. It also explains the patterns of association 
and dissociation among neural correlates without importing strong modular assumptions. It treats pain processing as a species of 
allostatic active inference in which the mind co-ordinates its processing resources to optimize basic bodily functioning at different 
time scales. The self is inferred to be source and target of regulation in this process. The self-modelling account reconciles conflicting 
deaffectualization and depersonalization accounts of pain asymbolia by showing how depersonalization and pain asymbolia arise at 
different levels of hierarchical self modelling.

Introduction
Intuitively pain is an experience of bodily damage that is felt to 
be unpleasant and aversively motivating. A property of pain that 
has interested philosophers is its intimate connection with self-
awareness. As Wittgenstein said ‘I can only believe that someone 
else is in pain, but I know [immediately and non-inferentially] if 
I am’. On this view pain is a condition which is essentially felt to 
me ‘mine’.
An integrative theory of pain explains how neurocomputa-
tional processes give rise to the characteristic phenomenology. 
Such theories draw on neuroscience, neuropsychology, clinical 
practice, and the psychology of pain management. Philosophers 
have recently incorporated this type of evidence to refine philo-
sophical theories of pain. Of particular interest is a disorder 
called pain asymbolia that raises questions about the relationship 
between nociception (transduction of sensory signals of damage 
or threat to bodily integrity), pain sensation, affect, and motiva-
tion. Patients with pain asymbolia consequent on damage to the 
posterior insula cortex say that they are in (often intense) pain but 
they are not distressed by that pain and they are not motivated to 
avoid the noxious stimulus. It is therefore an empirical challenge 
to the intuitive conception of pain. The challenge is increased by 
reports of pain asymbolia in which subjects report that it feels as 
if the pain does not belong to them. On some interpretations sub-
jects with pain asymbolia have lost the sense of ‘mineness’ for 
pain. ‘Mineness’ is a philosophical term of art that refers to the 
feeling that experiences belong to the subject (Billon 2016, 2023).
In the remainder of this paper I use the related concepts of 
allostatic active inference and self modelling to develop a neuro-
computational account of pain asymbolia. Pain processing turns 
out to be a particular instance of the general phenomenon of allo-
static active inference anchored by a self model. An advantage 
of this account is its ability to explain the intuitive conception of 
pain as well as various disorders in which typical features of pain 
episodes dissociate.
I first describe pain asymbolia and a variety of conditions 
which pain sensation, distress, aversive motivation, and ‘mine-
ness’ dissociate. I describe how the neuroscience of pain process-
ing accommodates this complexity by treating pain processing in 
terms of either a modular or a matrix architecture. In the mod-
ular conception, pain processing has discrete, dissociable, com-
ponents responsible for nociception (detection transduction and 
transmission of signals of threat to bodily integrity) and affective 
processing. This leads to an elegant ‘deaffectualization’ explana-
tion of pain asymbolia in which affective processing is impaired 
but nociceptive processing is intact. So the patient still feels the 
nociceptive aspect of pain but is not distressed by it and con-
sequently not motivated to avoid it. However, dissociations at 
either the level of neurocircuitry or phenomenology are not as 
clean as predicted by a ‘strictly’ modular componential process-
ing architecture for pain. And, once we examine a broader range of 
pain-related phenomena such as chronic pain, congenital insen-
sitivity to pain, distress, and empathy in different conditions, the 
modular theory of pain processing that underlies the affective 
2 Gerrans
theory of pain asymbolia breaks down. So insofar as the deaffec-
tualization theory relies on a modular processing architecture it 
requires revision.
Problems with a philosophical version of the deaffectualization 
theory (Grahek 2011 ) led Colin Klein (2015) to propose a revised 
account. He proposed that that instead of thinking of asymbo-
lia as a phenomenon of deaffectualization we should think of it 
as a species of ‘depersonalization for pain’. This fits with reports 
of depersonalization that resemble reports of asymbolia, like the 
following.
When a part of my body hurts, I feel so detached from the pain 
that it feels as if it were somebody else’s pain (Sierra 2009).
I endorse the conceptual revision advocated by Klein’s deperson-
alization interpretation but it faces related problems. The most 
persuasive accounts of depersonalization are (i) modular deaffec-
tualization accounts that (ii) explain deaffectualization in terms 
of hypoactivity in the ‘anterior’ insula cortex, hypothesized to be 
a neural correlate of distress. But the neural correlate of pain 
asymbolia is impaired functioning in the ‘posterior’ insula cortex.
I propose a solution that (i) explains the patterns of associ-
ation and dissociation between pain, motivation, and affect in 
pain asymbolia and other pain disorders; (ii) explains the rela-
tionship between basic bodily (such as nociceptive) and affective 
experience; and (iii) explains the roles of neural substrates of 
pain asymbolia (posterior insula) and depersonalization (anterior 
insula [AI]) and their relationship.
There are two components to the explanation. The first is the 
idea that pain phenomenology is an emergent result of process-
ing across distributed circuitry baptized the ‘pain matrix’. This 
matrix is configured in different ways under different conditions, 
giving rise to the different disorders of pain processing. The idea 
that pain processing depends on activity in a distributed neuro-
matrix is fairly standard but its implications for understanding 
disorders of pain processing are not fully worked out. This paper 
is a contribution to that project.
The second is the idea that pain processing is a form of allo-
static active inference. The concept of allostasis extends the con-
cept of homeostasis to encompass diverse forms of regulatory 
activity integrated to optimize organismic functioning ( Barrett 
et al. 2016, Corcoran and Hohwy 2017 , Kleckner et al. 2017). The 
concept of active inference is a corollary of allostasis. Active infer-
ence treats the mind as [solving] ‘biological regulation problems 
by learning internal (generative) models of their bodily and inte-
roceptive processes’ (Tschantz et al. 2022, 108266). In the case of 
pain this means that the brain infers that the self is the thing 
that senses damage, initiates appropriate internal (regulatory) and 
external (avoidance) responses, and feels the consequences. To 
act adaptively in the case of pain many disparate processes rang-
ing from opoid release and cytokine cascade (low-level dynamical 
processes) to the evaluation of nociceptive signals (an emotional 
process that gives rise to the distressing aspect of pain) to consult-
ing a Harley St specialist or tiktok influencer must be co-ordinated. 
The brain solves this problem by attributing signals arising in dif-
ferent modalities to the same unified persisting entity: the self 
(Moutoussis et al. 2014). This allows a complex system to be reg-
ulated as a single entity. When the circuitry that implements this 
‘self model’ is identified and its role described, some of the puz-
zling aspects of pain phenomenology are clarified. This self model 
is implemented by a pattern of neural activity that integrates bod-
ily emotional/affective and narrative/conceptual processing. Key 
circuits that sustain this pattern are the posterior insula and AI 
cortices. The posterior insula is a hub of processing that integrates 
basic bodily signals including nociception to produce the feeling of 
embodied selfhood (‘material me’ as Seth (2013) calls it). Activity 
in the AI links activity in the posterior insula to activity in circuitry 
that implements emotional and cognitive processes. The resultant 
interaction between bodily, emotional, and cognitive processing 
allows ‘raw’ bodily signals to be transcribed into affective signals 
that inform the subject not just that her body is in a particular 
state but the significance of that state for ‘her’. For example, an 
interoceptive signal of bodily arousal can be experienced as exhil-
aration, anxiety, arousal, or part of an episode of anger depending 
on the context. I now apply these ideas to explain pain asymbolia.
Pain asymbolia. Sensation and affect
Pain asymbolia is a rare condition in which patients report a sense 
of detachment from their experience of pain.
‘In the absence of primary sensory deficits’, these six patients 
showed a lack of withdrawal behaviours and absence of emo-
tional reactions (or inappropriate emotional responses) to 
painful stimuli applied to the whole body, as well as to threaten-
ing gestures. Five patients also did not react to verbal threats. 
The ‘patients did not appear concerned about the defect and 
seemed incapable of learning appropriate escape or protective 
behaviors’ (Berthier et al. 1988).
The experience is not of insensitivity to bodily damage but rather 
the feeling that the sensation of bodily damage does not matter 
to the patient. Sometimes it is described as feeling pain without 
caring about it or being motivated to avoid it. It has also been com-
pared to feelings of dissociation or anaesthesia. This is consistent 
with the classic case reported by Schilder and Stengel.
The patient displays a striking behaviour in the presence of 
pain. She reacts either not at all or insufficiently to being 
pricked, struck with hard objects, and pinched. She never pulls 
her arm back energetically or with strength. She never turns the 
torso away or withdraws with the body as a whole. She never 
attempts to avoid the investigator (Schilder and Stengel 1931).
Classic neuropsychological accounts (sensorimotor-limbic discon-
nection accounts as they are known) treated pain asymbolia as 
evidence for the idea that pain processing has a modular archi-
tecture with a ‘sensory’ and an ‘affective’ component ( Mesulam 
2000). This wave of theorizing about pain asymbolia is anchored 
in neuroscientific explanation of pain, particularly conditions like 
chronic pain, placebo analgesia, congenital insensitivity for pain, 
and empathy for pain. Each of these phenomena has been ele-
gantly explained on the assumption that ‘sensory’ pain and ‘affec-
tive’ or ‘emotional’ pain are produced by distinct components of a 
specialized pain processing system. On one version of this modu-
lar view, pain asymbolia is the result of loss of affective response 
to noxious stimuli. This would explain why asymbolic subjects do 
not react aversively to pain or experience it as distressing, even 
though they continue to sense damage to their body.
The syndrome of asymbolia to pain appears to be a 
somatosensory-limbic disconnection syndrome. Pain asymbo-
lia can be conceptualized as a somatosensory analogue of 
visual ‘hypoemotionality’ (Sierra et al. 2002).
Pain suffering and the self.  3
This modular explanation of pain processing and pain asymbolia 
accommodates a consensus about its neural substrates. Nocicep-
tive input is processed via distinct (but not discrete) neuroanatom-
ical pathways. A sensorimotor pathway conveys nociceptive infor-
mation to the somatosensory cortex and insula. Another projects 
to the insula, the paralimbic and limbic systems, and ultimately 
prefrontal cortex. At the same time, activity in these pathways 
can be influenced by descending modulatory systems that target 
different aspects of the system at different time scales. A circuit 
linking the AI and rostral anterior cingulate cortex plays a crucial 
role in sustaining the feeling of distress and linking it to higher 
level (narrative and conceptual) forms of self-awareness. Thus, 
there is preliminary evidence that the distress (‘souffrance’) of 
pain and the sensation of bodily damage (‘douleur’) are potentially 
dissociable because their substrates, although they communicate 
in the construction of the pain experience, are distinct ( Berthier 
et al. 1988, Danziger 2006, Starr et al. 2009, Klein 2015, Gerrans 
2020
).
Evidence for dissociations
In support of the idea of distinct and dissociable pathways for 
sensorimotor and affective processing, the modular theorist can 
point to conditions such as chronic pain. Chronic pain is explained 
as a form of neuroplastic change in which circuitry involved 
in affective processing ‘takes over’. Such cases are described as 
‘nociplastic’ rather than nociceptive.
According to a recent meta-analysis, the experimental induc-
tion of acute pain (e.g. with painful versus non-painful thermal 
stimuli) is generally associated with activations of both sen-
sory (e.g. thalamus, secondary somatosensory cortices (SII), 
dorsal posterior insula) and affective (e.g. dorsal anterior cin-
gulate cortex [ACC], AI) brain regions in healthy adults and pain 
patients (
Xu 2020).
In contrast, nociplastic pain conditions, such as nonspecific 
chronic low back pain (cLBP), are associated with altered neural 
activation patterns in ‘affective brain regions only’, particularly 
the rostral ACC, mPFC, and amygdala (Gu et al. 2013).
This is consistent with the classic modular conception in which 
the primary substrate for suffering is a circuit centred on the 
AI and anterior cingulate cortices. Indeed, a last ditch treat-
ment for chronic pain is lobotomy that disconnects this circuit 
from prefrontal regions. Patients treated by lobotomy reported 
that the intensity and nature of the pain had not changed and 
their automatic responses to a noxious stimulus were ‘intact and 
often exaggerated’. However, they are untroubled by pain or the 
prospect thereof. As Danziger (2006) puts it ‘[E]motional impact of 
chronic pain is dramatically reduced’.
Cases such as this form part of
a wealth of evidence suggesting that patients with chronic 
pain may have anatomical alterations within regions involved 
in cognitive and emotional modulation of pain, such as the 
dorsolateral and medial PFC, the ACC, and the insula (Barrett 
2017
).
Another consideration that supports this is the action of 
morphine analgesia. In low doses, the primary target of
morphine is
activations in the amygdala, AI, and cingulate cortices, ‘which 
are regions implicated in the affective aspects of pain’, are max-
imally suppressed at the lowest opioid dose (Lee et al. 2014 , 
Rütgen et al. 2015).
This is consistent with the idea that the AI-ACC circuit is impli-
cated in personal distress. This form of suffering can be produced 
and regulated relatively independently of low-level nociception 
and reflexive behavioural responses like flinching and withdrawal.
These studies suggest that pain processing occurs along dif-
ferent dimensions with sensorimotor responses occurring earlier 
and outside the scope of deliberate control. A primary hub of this 
processing is the ‘posterior insula’, consistent with its role in inte-
grating low-level bodily signals crucial in maintaining organismic 
viability. Threats to bodily integrity detected in nociception are 
processed by the posterior insula since they are vital to homeo-
static regulation ( Gu et al. 2013, Frot et al. 2014). It is crucial to 
emphasize this point because the posterior insula is ‘not’ hypoth-
esized to be the substrate of the experience of distress but of an 
earlier stage of pain processing that integrates the nociceptive sig-
nal with other bodily signals as part of a system of basic bodily 
regulation.
The feelings of suffering and distress that are part of the pain 
experience are produced at a higher level or later stage of process-
ing that involves the AI, modulated by prefrontal cortical struc-
tures that represent personal and social information and explicit 
narrative and conceptual self-knowledge. If this is correct, then 
one can see the appeal of the modular account. On the assump-
tion that the mechanisms that support these distinct aspects of 
processing are relatively specialized and can be selectively acti-
vated or damaged, one can see why it makes sense to partition 
pain processing into sensori-motor and affective-personal com-
ponents. However, such an account needs to explain why pain 
asymbolia is associated with damage to the posterior rather than 
AI. After all, on the modular account, it is the activity in an AI that 
produces feelings of distress. So one might predict that pain asym-
bolia would be the result of damage/dysfunction in anterior rather 
than posterior insular regions. I return to this question below.
Empathy and chronic pain
The modular deaffectualization account can point to further evi-
dence that the AI is the substrate of distressing experience. Some 
of the most dramatic evidence comes from studies of patients who 
are congenitally insensitive to pain and patients with congenital 
agenesis of body parts. Such patients clearly lack early sensory 
processing of bodily damage, either because they lack activity in 
the necessary sensorimotor processing circuitry or lack the body 
part itself. Nonetheless, when viewing images of bodily damage, 
the patients experience distress. This can be described as a form of 
empathy where empathy is taken to mean the ability to experience 
affective states while observing, but not actually experiencing, 
sensory elicitation of those states. i.e. seeing or imaging someone 
else (or oneself) in pain or distress.
Viewing body parts in pain corresponding to the missing limb 
induces a significant activation ‘only in brain regions devoted 
to emotional empathy, such as the anterior insula’ (Betti and 
Aglioti 2016).
Interestingly, however, in the absence of a somatic representation, 
i.e. perception of the body part, ‘the understanding of another’s 
pain relies on inferential mechanisms rather than affective reso-
nance mapping’ (Betti and Aglioti 2016, 195). The idea behind this 
4 Gerrans
enigmatic sentence is that empathetic distress in the absence of 
nociception can be driven by higher level cognition, for example 
by thinking about others’ painful experiences.
The authors of this review conclude that both perception of 
other’s pain and experience of pain are typically initially processed 
by sensorimotor structures and subsequently processed by an 
affective system that evaluates the significance of bodily damage 
for the subject. However, in the absence of initiating sensorimotor 
processing, the affective system remains able to produce a feeling 
of distress for a perceived or inferred injury ‘to self or other’.
Tania Singer and collaborators asked female members of cou-
ples to observe their partners experiencing a mild electrical shock 
to the wrist. They were not explicitly instructed to empathize, only 
to observe. Patterns of neural activation were compared to a condi-
tion in which they received a shock themselves. The key difference 
reported was that
only part of the network mediating pain experience is shared 
when empathizing with pain in others. Empathizing with some-
one else’s pain elicited activity principally in left and right AI, 
ACC, lateral cerebellum, and brainstem (Singer et al. 2004).
The main contrast with the ‘self’ pain condition was that
pain-related activation in contralateral SI, SII/posterior insula, 
and caudal ACC are specific to self-experienced pain, as 
opposed to perceived pain in others.
Their conclusion is a very clear statement of the view that 
pain processing has dissociable sensorimotor/discriminative and 
affective components and it is the latter that are involved in
empathy.
(Zhou et al. 2020) Rostral ACC and AI appear to reflect the emo-
tional experience that evokes our re-actions to pain and consti-
tutes the neural basis for our understanding of the feelings of 
others and ourselves. (Singer et al. 2004 1161, my italics).
that connectivity between mPFC and regions of the salience 
network (SN), including the insula and ACC, were found to be 
increased among patients with nociplastic pain compared to 
controls (Yarns et al. 2022 104558).
(Wang et al. 2020) The idea that an ACC-AI circuit is the sub-
strate for feelings of distress is also part of the explanation of 
chronic pain (Simons 2014). For example, a meta-analysis of stud-
ies comparing patients with and without chronic pain reported a 
consistent role of the AI consistent with its ‘complex role in pro-
cesses directly or indirectly related to the acute and chronic pain 
experience, including pain empathy ( Fallon et al. 2020; Xu 2020; 
Zhou et al. 2020 ), interoception and salience processing (Li et al. 
2020
; Yao et al. 2018) as well as emotional experience (Gogolla 
2017; Ferraro et al. 2022). Another study of emotional regulation 
and pain processing found (Duquette et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2018).
As a consequence, the most effective interventions for chronic 
pain do not target nociceptive processing pathways or posterior 
insula where they converge and are integrated with other basic 
forms of bodily signalling. Rather, the most effective treatments 
are aimed at processes of emotional regulation and reappraisal 
that modulate activity in the AI-ACC.
Thus, a modular view of pain processing can point to evidence 
of selective activation and independent regulation of sensorimo-
tor and affective components of a pain processing system. The 
substrates of these systems are circuits involving posterior insula 
and AI, respectively. On this view, Pain Asymbolia and Chronic 
Neuroplastic Pain represent a form of double dissociation. Asym-
bolia is evidence of preserved sensory processing and absent 
affective processing, and Chronic Neuroplastic Pain is evidence 
of reduced sensory processing and intact or exaggerated affective 
processing.
Affective states are typically thought of as ‘intrinsically’ moti-
vational. We avoid distressing situations and approach pleasant 
ones. This would explain why patients with pain asymbolia, who 
are not distressed by pain sensations, lack aversive motivation. 
However, as Klein (2015) among others points out, if affect is 
intrinsically motivating, lobotomized patients who have flattened 
affective responses should lose their aversive reaction to noxious 
stimuli. However, their reflexive aversive responses are intact or 
exaggerated (Danziger 2006; Duquette et al. 2007). So, ‘there is no 
necessary connection between affective experience and aversive 
behaviour’.
Similarly, patients with chronic insensitivity to pain have intact 
affective circuitry but they have no motivation to avoid painful 
stimuli, typically with disastrous results. ‘ She reported numerous 
burns and cuts without pain (Supplementary Fig. S1), often smelling 
her burning flesh before noticing any injury ’, Br J Anaesth. 2019 Aug; 
123(2): e249–e253.
Against the modular theory of pain 
asymbolia
Cases like these suggest that processing of the nociceptive signal 
represents the brain’s response to the significance of the stim-
ulus in that context, with sensory, affective, behavioural, and 
cognitive processes all contributing. However, in non-standard 
contexts, elements of this processing system can dissociate in 
different ways. But this does not license the modular hypoth-
esis of discrete dissociable components of a specialized pain 
processing system. When we turn to a wider range of evi-
dence about pain processing, we see ‘interdependence rather 
than independence’ of sensorimotor and affective aspects of pain
processing.
One illustration of this coupling is provided by empathetic 
response in different conditions. Recall that Singer’s experi-
ments used couples observing a partner receiving a low-intensity 
painful stimulus. In that condition, the circuitry activated by 
both observation and personal experience was the AI/rostral ACC, 
the hypothesized basis of distress. However, in other conditions 
in which subjects view severe injuries or wounded body parts, 
somatosensory aspects of the pain processing system are also 
activated (Betti and Aglioti 2016 ). This is consistent with some 
somatosensory resonance or contagion conceptions of empathy 
that emphasize that third person observation and first person 
experience of body state can activate the same sensory processing 
systems (Singer and Lamm 2009).
The case of ‘social pain’ evoked by ostracism or criticism makes 
a similar point. It is natural to conceive of it in terms of affec-
tive processing: the distress evoked by rejection. As such, on 
a strictly modular view, one might predict activity in the AI-
ACC associated with affective experience, and this is confirmed. 
However, social pain can also activate the sensorimotor system, 
suggesting that ‘high level personal representations can entrain 
sensory processing in the absence of eliciting noxious stimulus’ 
(Eisenberger 2012 ). These cases suggest a complex, continuous 
structure to pain processing whose elements can be co-ordinated 
in a context-sensitive way.
Pain suffering and the self.  5
We can add to this that most of the processing of pain signals 
is not performed by circuits specialized for responding to noxious 
stimuli. Aversive responses to pain are sensori and viscero-motor. 
Attentional and inhibitory processes are amodal. For example, 
dorsolateral prefrontal structures have an essential role to play 
in pain modulation shown by the fact inhibition of activity in 
these circuits removes the placebo response. These structures 
do not work in isolation but in co-operation with ventrolateral 
and orbitofrontal structures involved in cognitive reappraisal and 
modulation of affective response and sensorimotor responses. 
‘The descending modulatory systems involve brain regions that 
are important not only for pain but also for cognitive and emo-
tional functioning in general’(Bushnell et al. 2013). In other words, 
the regulatory role for dorsolateral circuitry is not restricted to 
pain modulation.
Similarly, empathetic responses, both affective and sensori-
motor, depend on activity in systems that one might think of 
as, strictly speaking, not dedicated to processing noxious stimuli. 
Empathy is strongly modulated by attachment and by the inter-
pretation of others mental states and attitudes, which in them-
selves have nothing to do with nociception. This is why the science 
of pain has moved away from explaining pain experience as the 
result of processing in a system specialized for pain processing 
with discrete sensory and affective components.
The pain matrix
The concept of a pain matrix was introduced by Melzack (1990) in 
the context of explaining the persistence of phantom limb pain 
and its resistance to anaesthesia. He explained the persistence 
of painful experience in the absence of body parts in terms of 
a distributed ‘neuromatrix’ that extends ‘through selective areas 
of the whole brain including the somatic, visual and limbic sys-
tem’. The activation of elements of the matrix in the absence 
of sensory input can lead to exaggerated pain experience, not 
least because there is no possibility of relieving a precipitating 
bodily injury through movement or anaesthesia. Melzack argued 
that the structure of the matrix is partly genetically specified (the 
‘pain connectome’) but its final architecture is sensitive to devel-
opmental influences. The result is that the matrix can be activated 
via a variety of pathways depending on idiosyncratic patterns of 
connectivity and conductivity. Chronic pain and ‘social’ pain for 
example are evoked by different sources and sustained by a dif-
ferent pattern of activity across the matrix to pain directly evoked 
by injury. The main point is that different types of pain experience 
should be thought of as resulting from different ‘patterns of activ-
ity across the whole network’ rather than as evidence of a modular 
architecture for pain (Melzack 1990). In particular, a strict double 
dissociation between sensorimotor and affective processing is not 
supported by the evidence.
The matrix conception also undermines a strict bottom up or 
feedforward model of pain processing in favour of one in which 
pain experience is the emergent produce of recurrent processing 
across the matrix. ‘Social’ pain occasioned by ostracism or criti-
cism is an example. It is typically associated with activity in the 
AI circuitry which suggests an ‘affective’ interpretation: the sub-
ject is feeling personal distress. However, there are also cases in 
which social pain activates posterior systems involved in sensory 
processing (Eisenberger 2012). One explanation is
the role of the dACC and AI in responding to socially painful 
experience; these regions may be crucial for ‘translating’ expe-
riences of social disconnection into downstream physiological 
responses, which have implications for health. Indeed, the 
dACC and AI may have a mediating role in the links between 
social rejection and both inflammatory activity and depression 
(Eisenberger 2012).
This interpretation treats the AI as an integrative hub that func-
tions as a relay station between bodily regulation, emotional 
appraisal, and conceptual and narrative forms of self represen-
tation. Eisenberger is suggesting that this intermediary role for 
the AI goes both ways. Not only does the AI transcribe intero-
ceptive and nociceptive experience to integrate bodily regulation 
adaptively with higher level processing, it also transcribes high-
level personal and social and personal information (for example 
about ostracism or rejection) into formats that allow for adaptive 
low-level bodily responses. On one way of reading Eisenberger, the 
nociceptive signal can be processed bottom up from sensorimotor 
to conceptual-social levels or top down from conceptual-social to 
sensorimotor. In both cases, the AI is an intermediate hub or relay 
station.
The matrix conception suggests that pain processing activates 
distributed circuitry across an essentially amodal matrix whose 
elements include hubs of bodily/interoceptive, social emotional, 
and conceptual and executive processing. Activity across this 
matrix can be driven from any starting point. Anxious rumination 
for example can make people prey to a range of distressing bodily 
and emotional experiences, including the amplification of innocu-
ous nociceptive signals (Terasawa et al. 2013 ). Or, in prototypical 
cases of pain, it can be driven by perception noxious stimuli such 
as a burn or broken bone. In either case, the ultimate experience 
‘reflects the pattern of activity across the matrix’.
Nociceptive cortical processing is initiated in parallel in sen-
sory, motor, and limbic areas; it progresses rapidly to the 
recruitment of AI and fronto-parietal networks, and finally 
to the activation of perigenual, posterior cingulate and hip-
pocampal structures. Functional connectivity between sensory 
and high-level networks increases during the first second post-
stimulus, which may be determinant for access to conscious-
ness (Garcia-Larrea and Bastuji 2018).
The fact that there is a typical sequential pattern across the 
matrix from peripheral (nociceptive) to more central processes 
encourages the idea of an hierarchical modular structure to pain 
processing if we concentrate on standard cases and neuropsy-
chological deficits. However, the matrix explains these cases in 
terms of the role of hubs of cortical and subcortical processing 
whose activity can be initiated and maintained in different ways 
in different contexts. The posterior insula is an integrative hub 
for basic bodily regulation of which nociceptive signals form an 
important class. The role of the AI here is as a crucial integra-
tive relay station that allows bodily changes to be evaluated for 
personal significance and social/personal information to entrain 
appropriate bodily responses. In order to play that role, the AI 
communicates with hubs of circuits such as amygdala and ven-
tromedial prefrontal cortex that orchestrate emotional appraisal. 
As a recent review put it the insula is not an isolated ‘island’ but 
rather an integral brain hub connecting different functional sys-
tems underlying sensory, emotional, motivational and cognitive 
processing (Gogolla 2017 585).
Activity across the insula reflect different ‘levels’ of integra-
tion with posterior insula a convergence zone for basic bodily 
signals and the AI a relay station between posterior insula and 
systems that determine the significance of those signals per-
sonal/social goals. Partitioning of the insula is not sharp but
continuous.

The activation associated with both pain-related (posterior 
insula) activation and that associated with prediction error 
(PE)-related (AI) activation correspond well with connectivity 
gradients observed along the posterior–anterior axis ( Horing 
et al. 2022).
This matrix conception also helps explain how it is that the 
Default Mode Network (DMN) can play a crucial role in modulat-
ing the nociceptive signal. The DMN is a hub of autobiographical 
representation and crucial substrate of the narrative self ( Davey 
et al. 2016). As such, within a broadly modular framework, one 
might regard its functioning as independent of sensory processing. 
But, in fact, it plays an important role in pain regulation largely 
through its interactions with attentional and modulatory systems.
Activation in the salience network was found when attention 
spontaneously focused on pain (20). In contrast, the DMN was 
engaged when attention was focused away from pain (20). ‘Indi-
viduals’ intrinsic attention to pain’ (defined by the test–retest 
reproducibility of an individual’s tendency to attend away from 
pain) was related to their structural and functional connec-
tivity between DMN and the descending pain control system 
(and the PAG in particular) (18). Also, alterations in the inter-
play between the salience network, DMN, and descending pain 
control network have been related to heightened attention to 
pain in chronic pain patients (Wiech and Tracey 2013).
The ‘pain’ matrix and the role of self 
modelling
When Melzack introduced the idea of a matrix, he treated it as the 
basis of a bodily sense of self. On his view, the matrix explains the 
fact that
experience of the body has a unitary, integrated quality that 
includes the quality of the ‘self’, the feeling that all the parts of 
the body are uniquely one’s own (Melzack 1990).
Melzack was explaining why a person with a phantom limb 
still experiences that limb ‘as hers’. In order to act to avoid or 
reduce damage, the brain needs to treat experience produced by 
the matrix as a property of a unified persisting entity: the source 
of bodily experience and target of regulation (Metzinger 2003; Ger-
rans 2014; Menon and Uddin 201 ; Limanowski and Blankenburg 
2013; Hohwy and Michael 2017; Seth and Tsakiris 2018). In the 
case of phantom limb, the model fails to update after amputation.
The matrix idea fits with the view that the basic process-
ing properties of the brain depend on the synchronized activity 
of large-scale networks ( Pessoa 2017). These networks comprise 
(at least) the salience network (allocation of cognitive resources 
whose top level is the AI-ACC circuit) the default mode network 
(explicit episodic self-referential processing) and an executive net-
work (high-level cognitive control) ( Menon and Uddin 2010; Ger-
rans 2014). Each of these networks has a proprietary network 
architecture (Betti and Aglioti 2016 ). When we apply this idea to 
the processing of pain, the idea that there is a ‘sensorimotor cir-
cuit’ for initial processing of processing noxious stimuli and a 
discrete ‘affective circuit’ centred on the AI-ACC dissolves. Instead, 
the insula functions as a relay station between the salience sys-
tem, sensorimotor processing, and the default mode network to 
help configure activity in the matrix. This is consistent with the 
polymodal involvement of the insula in
response selection, interoception, attention, response conflict, 
autonomic arousal. Tellingly, functions non-specifically linked 
to pain are also carried out by the AI, which is implicated in 
cognitive, affective, and regulatory functions, including intero-
ceptive awareness, affective response, empathic processes, and 
uncertainty (Betti and Aglioti 2016, 198).
Activity in the AI provides a constant ‘locus of concern’ ensuring 
that activity across the brain is integrated for the organism’s ben-
efit. This does not mean that the AI is a ‘self module’, just that the 
feeling of being a unified self is an emergent property of the inte-
gration of distributed activity to serve the goals of the organism 
and that integration represents the system as a unified entity. This 
view is more consistent with the allostatic active inference view of 
cognition which treats the mind as actively engaged in finding a 
pattern of neural activity that optimizes functioning of the organ-
ism. The self is inferred by the mind to be ‘the entity who benefits’ 
when predictions are realized. When the AI is not active, sensation 
and cognition are not impaired but activity across the matrix is not 
integrated to serve the goals of the subject. The resultant experi-
ence is reported with a sense of detachment or depersonalization. 
Allostatic active inference has lost its centre of gravity.
Asymbolia as depersonalization
This framework supports the argument of Colin Klein against 
deaffectualization theories of pain asymbolia. He suggested that 
asymbolia is a species of ‘depersonalization for pain’. As he says
They recognise it as pain, but in some important sense it has 
ceased to be something worth caring about. It thus has the feel 
of a sensation which they can no longer identify with as their own
(Klein 2015).
In this respect, his account recalls the explanation of classic deper-
sonalization (DPD) experience by (Michal et al. 2014) as ‘difficulties 
of DPD patients to integrate their visceral and bodily perceptions 
into a sense of their selves.’ In DPD, the inability to model experience 
as belonging to the self is global so that patients will report feeling 
detached from ‘all’ experiences including pain. In pain asymbolia 
that detachment is reported as applying specifically to pain. So the 
‘bodily perception’ not integrated into a sense of self is the noci-
ceptive signal. This is why Klein (2015) argues that asymbolia is a 
form of depersonalization restricted to pain. As he puts it:
the phenomenology of asymbolia might resemble a kind 
of depersonalization syndrome. … The asymbolic, and the 
depersonalized more generally, feel sensations that they are 
estranged from—that they do not take to be theirs in the sense 
that we normally do. … (Klein 2015).
This view, while attractive, is initially hard to square with neu-
ropsychiatric theories of depersonalization that treat it as a form 
of ‘dissociative deaffectualization’. For these theories, deperson-
alization results from involuntary inhibition of the AI as a disso-
ciative response to intractable adversity such as trauma or abuse 
(Sierra 2008, 2009, Medford and Critchley 2010, Medford et al. 
2016). In other words, depersonalization theorists tend to endorse 
a version of the modular theory of affective processing and treat 
depersonalization as a loss of affect resulting from hypoactivity 
in the AI. This strategy exploits the brain’s natural opioid sys-
tem (Sierra 2008). Morphine analgesia has the same dissociative 
effect and seems to initially exploit the brain’s distress regulation 
systems (Lee et al. 2014, Rütgen et al. 2015)
Pain suffering and the self.  7
by initially targeting the AI. The functional magnestic reso-
nance imaging (FMRI) data suggest that opioid analgesics can 
directly influence emotional responses at low doses that do not 
alter sensory aspects of pain (Lee et al. 2014).
In general, depersonalized patients who are deaffectualized have 
intact basic bodily awareness and regulation. A reasonable infer-
ence is that their posterior insula functioning is unimpaired but 
they feel depersonalized in virtue of hypoactivity in the AI. That is 
the deaffectualization theory of depersonalization in a nutshell. 
Recall however that Klein proposed the depersonalization theory 
of asymbolia as an ‘alternative’ to the idea that it is a form of deaf-
fectualization for pain. We should also recall that asymbolia is 
agreed on all sides to be the result of damage to posterior insula, 
hypothesized to be an integrative hub for basic bodily regulation 
not affected.
Reconciliation. The self model
These facts are hard to reconcile prima facie . However, the role 
of the insula in self modelling explains them. The posterior 
insula cortex integrates values of basic bodily variables like blood 
pressure and hydration as well as nociception (bodily damage) 
to co-ordinate basic regulatory functions. The posterior insula 
is thus the primary substrate of interoceptive experience and 
hence of what Anil Seth called ‘material me’, the feeling of being 
an embodied self. The AI cortex integrates interoceptive signals 
from the posterior insula with information from other channels. 
This enables bodily signals (such as nociception) to be contex-
tualized and managed adaptively by entraining the full range 
of regulatory capacities. The result is that we do not just feel 
like the subject of bodily states but of emotional states that 
reflect our goals. In a dangerous episode, we do not just feel 
adaptive bodily responses but we feel them as fearful because 
those bodily responses are produced as ways of realizing a goal 
of avoiding danger.This is why the concept of allostatic active 
inference helps explain why the pain matrix, though essentially 
amodal, can give rise to such various phenomenology. Allostatic 
active inference is a process of recruiting and co-ordinating a 
suite of systems to maintain systemic integrity. In the case of 
pain this means detecting, avoiding, responding to, and repair-
ing damage using relevant resources. This requires integrating 
relevant systems. At the most basic level, managed by the poste-
rior insula, this integration is felt as intero/nociceptive experience 
and embodied selfhood. The AI relays the interoceptive signal 
to other systems that help interpret and manage it adaptively. 
This transcribes the interoceptive signal allowing it to be expe-
rienced as an affect. For example, an abdominal cramp will be 
felt quite differently if it is experienced transiently in the gym 
doing sit-ups or if it is experienced by someone who is fearing a
miscarriage.
Thus, it is not surprising to see that contemporary affective 
neuroscience treats experience produced by activation of the AI as 
a form of higher order bodily representation that represents the 
integrated functioning of the organism ‘evaluated against emo-
tionally salient goals creating a sense of self in the process’. As 
Bud Craig (2009) puts it,
the integration successively includes homeostatic, environ-
mental, hedonic, motivational, social, and cognitive activity to 
produce a ‘global emotional moment’, ‘which represents the 
sentient self at one moment of time’ (Craig 2009).
One difference between Craig’s account and mine is that Craig’s 
account almost treats the AI as a discrete ‘self module’. My 
view is the more modest one that the AI is an integrative hub 
whose activity transcribes the interoceptive signal into one that 
signals emotional salience. The emergent result of this integra-
tive process is the experience of being the subject of salient
experience.
To return to the case of pain asymbolia, in pain asymbolia, dys-
function of posterior insula leads to failure to model nociceptive 
signals as belonging to the bodily self. This produces the experi-
ence of sensations of bodily damage (or other forms of threat to 
bodily integrity) that do not belong to ‘me’. This failure to incorpo-
rate nociceptive signals at the level of bodily self-modelling means 
that they do not entrain regulatory responses, including higher 
levels of active inference that depend on AI activity. If the sig-
nals are not sensed as belonging to me at the most basic level 
of selfhood, there is no need to establish their emotional salience. 
Consequently, they are not affectively transcribed. So, they do not 
lead to the feelings of personal distress and attempts to reduce 
them. The narrative I report is the sensation of nociceptive expe-
rience that is not felt to matter to the self. Pain aysmbolia is thus a 
case of processing nociceptive signals ‘outside’ the self-modelling 
hierarchy. That is to say without those signals being attributed to 
the self whose goal structure determines the regulatory response 
to sensory experience. This explains why, as Klein (2015) puts it, 
asymbolia is a kind of ‘[I]ndifference. One’s body becomes, as it 
were, just another object in the world’.
