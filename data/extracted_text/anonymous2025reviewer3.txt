This work describes an inference technique for extracting information about relative
contributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive onto single neurons in neural
networks. The electrophysiological techniques and results are of high quality, and the
analytical work is novel and potentially powerful, yet with several untested
assumptions underlying the approach. This is nevertheless solid work that will be
valuable to neuroscience labs interested in exploring alternative approaches to
studies of integrated synaptic connectivity.

Abstract
Unraveling synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within
rhythmic neural circuits, such as central pattern generation (CPG) circuits for rhythmic motor
behaviors, is critical for deciphering circuit interactions and functional architecture, which is
a major problem for understanding how neural circuits operate. Here we present a general
method for extracting and separating patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic
conductances at high temporal resolution from single neuronal intracellular recordings in
rhythmically active networks. These post-synaptic conductances reflect the combined
synaptic inputs from the key interacting neuronal populations and can reveal the functional
connectome of the active circuits. To illustrate the applicability of our analytic technique, we
employ our method to infer the synaptic conductance profiles in identified rhythmically
active interneurons within key microcircuits of the mammalian (mature rat) brainstem
respiratory CPG and provide a perspective on how our approach can resolve the functional
interactions and circuit organization of these interneuron populations. We demonstrate the
versatility of our approach, which can be applied to any other rhythmic circuits where
conditions allow for neuronal intracellular recordings.

Introduction
Rhythmic neural circuits, which are ubiquitous in nervous systems (Buzsáki, 2006     ), generate
spatiotemporal patterns of activity by synaptic interactions between neuronal populations, and
unraveling the synaptic inputs to circuit neurons at high temporal resolution in the active
networks is a major experimental problem in neurobiology for understanding circuit functional
dynamics and architecture. Solving this problem ultimately requires electrophysiological methods
to extract dynamic patterns of synaptic conductances in post-synaptic neurons from intracellular
recordings during network activity. These patterns often involve temporally complex excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and thus methods to extract these inputs must be able to delineate
the excitatory and inhibitory components, which can be superimposed during circuit activity,
complicating the problem. This study presents a robust and versatile method to extract and
separate inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductance patterns from intracellular recordings.
The technique is applicable to any periodically active network where the oscillation period much
exceeds the interspike intervals and membrane time constant of individual neurons. A synaptic
conductance pattern refers to its temporal profile within a single network oscillation cycle. We
designed our method to be compatible with various experimental setups, including current-clamp
and voltage-clamp protocols, by focusing on the fundamental principles of electrophysiology and
network dynamics. Our technique ensures high-resolution temporal profiling of synaptic inputs,
making it adaptable to a wide range of rhythmically active neuronal circuits such as vertebrate
and invertebrate motor pattern generation (CPG) networks (e.g., (Calabrese & Marder, 2024     )),
and cortical circuit rhythms (Yuste et al., 2005     ). This generalizability highlights the potential of
our approach to provide new insights into the functional organization and dynamics of diverse
rhythmic neural circuits. Our approach extends previously proposed methods for extracting
dynamic patterns of input synaptic conductances from intracellular recordings from neurons in a
variety of circuits (Borg-Graham et al., 1998     ; Anderson et al., 2000     ; Shu et al., 2003     ; Berg et
al., 2007     ; Endo & Kiehn, 2008     ; Wright & Calabrese, 2011     ) by providing nearly continuous,
high-resolution readouts of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that are essential for
deciphering circuit functional interactions.
To illustrate the utility of our technique, we applied this to circuits in the mammalian brainstem
respiratory CPG, which is the fundamental rhythmic neural system that generates and controls
breathing movements that are critical for homeostatic regulation of oxygen, carbon dioxide and
pH in the brain and body (Feldman & Smith, 1995; Richter & Smith, 2014     ). These circuits are
continuously active in various experimental preparations and the experimental accessibility of
these circuits provides the opportunity to apply our methods to investigate cellular and network
electrophysiological processes underlying rhythmic motor pattern generation in a physiologically
important mammalian system (Richter & Spyer, 2001     ; Smith et al., 2013     ). The rhythmic
patterns of alternating inspiratory and expiratory phase neuronal activities that coordinate
activity of spinal and cranial motoneurons during breathing originate within interacting pontine-
medullary excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the brainstem (Cohen, 1979     ; Bianchi et al.,
1995     ; Feldman & Smith, 1995; Richter, 1996     ; Smith et al., 2013     ). We have targeted specific
respiratory microcircuits in the medulla of mature rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations in situ
containing a variety of neuronal phenotypes and synaptic interactions that are key to the
operation of the respiratory CPG. This allowed us to perform single neuron intracellular
recordings from various neuronal types in different microcircuits, test different recording
protocols to assess the robustness of our approach, and provides examples of how our technique
can extract complex patterns of synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution in different
types of rhythmic neurons. We illustrate how the synaptic conductance profiles throughout the
respiratory cycle imply a “functional connectome” of respiratory circuit interactions,
demonstrating the efficacy of our technique to provide novel information on circuit dynamic
organization and operation.

Results
The general theoretical aspects of our approach for analyzing neuronal excitatory and inhibitory
conductances from intracellular recordings in rhythmic circuits, and their specific application to
the rhythmically active respiratory circuits, are delineated below. Our objective was to extract
synaptic conductance dependence on the phase of the network activity cycle (hereinafter referred
to as synaptic conductance profiles) representing nearly continuous readouts of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic inputs from the neuronal recordings throughout a cycle of periodic neural
activity— the respiratory cycle in our illustration. Any periodic activity can be analyzed in the
same way that we describe in this illustration below.
Reconstruction of synaptic inputs from intracellular recordings
The reconstruction of synaptic conductance profiles is based on the current balance equation:
where C is the membrane capacitance, Vm is the membrane potential, gleak and Eleak are the
conductance and the reversal potential of the leak current respectively, gi(t) and ge(t) are
inhibitory and excitatory conductances (subject to retrieval), Ei and Ee are reversal potentials of
inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents, and Iinj(t) is the injected current. We assume that the
membrane potential of the cell is in instantaneous equilibrium (dVm/dt =0), which implies that the
membrane time constant C/gleakis much shorter than the time scale of the synaptic conductance
variations. This assumption defines the time resolution of our method. For example, gleak /C ratio
in the respiratory interneurons was found to be in the range of 80 to 120 pS/pF (Koizumi & Smith,
2008     ) corresponding to the membrane time constant values of about 10 ms. Synaptic inputs
originate from the periodically active network. The respiratory cycle period in our in situ rat
brainstem-spinal cord preparation typically spans approximately 3–4 seconds (Figures 1      and
2     ), yielding a time resolution of roughly 1/300 of the period. This approach to determining time
resolution can be similarly applied to other systems.
Another important assumption is that Equation (1) does not include voltage-dependent currents.
This means that the equation is simplified to only consider the passive properties of the
membrane, such as resistance and capacitance. To ensure that voltage-dependent currents are
minimized during the recording, a hyperpolarizing current injection protocol is employed. This
involves injecting a negative current into the neuron, which drives the membrane potential to a
more negative value. In our test recordings the membrane potential typically held between -100
and -60 mV, and we primarily analyzed the data for these hyperpolarized voltages. At this
hyperpolarized state, most voltage-gated ion channels are closed and do not significantly
contribute to the neuronal current-voltage (I-V) relationships and affect interpretations of our
conductance analyses. We note that there may be hyperpolarization-activated currents in the
neurons studied, and in current-clamp recordings, non-linearity from such currents such as h-
currents could introduce voltage-dependent changes in total conductance unrelated to synaptic
inputs, potentially skewing the reconstruction. However, our data as detailed below consistently
demonstrate linear I-V relationships across the voltage range tested for the set of neurons
analyzed, indicating a minimal influence from such voltage-dependent currents.
The phase of the respiratory cycle was defined as a piece-wise linear function of time in the
following way: φ(t) =(t − tk)/(tk+1 − tk), for times t between the time moments of two consecutive
inspiratory phase onsets tk and tk+1. Our approach was based on the idea that in a network
exhibiting periodic dynamics, the synaptic conductances depend on the cycle phase, so that gi,e(t)
=gi,e(φ(t)). That is, for a periodic system, specifying that synaptic conductance depends on phase is

(upper boundary) and zero inhibition (lower boundary) lines, respectively (see Eqs. (13) and (14)). The slopes of the lines

synaptic conductance is shown in red, and the inhibitory conductance is shown in blue.

mathematically equivalent to saying that the conductance depends on time in a periodic manner,
and thus, a phase-based representation—where conductances are expressed as functions of the
cycle’s phase—is a justified and effective approach for capturing their behavior. The respiratory
cycle was divided into 100 bins of phase values, and for each bin the time moments {tik: φ(tki) ∈ 
[φi, φi+1]} that correspond to phases in the bin were collected. For each phase bin ii of the
respiratory cycle, the relationship between the injected current Iinj(tik) and the membrane
potential Vm(tik), where tk are the times that correspond to the phase bin, appears fairly linear (see
Figure 1B      and Figure 1 Supplemental Figure 1     ). Therefore, by linear regression we can find
the slope and V-intercept of this dependence in the form:
where φφ =(φi + φi+1)/2 is the center of the bin. The slope R(φ) represents the total resistance, the
intercept V0(φ) is the effective resting potential for the phase of the cycle φ, and δVm(tk) are
random fluctuations of the membrane voltage. Total conductance G(φ) was calculated as the
reciprocal of the total resistance, G(φ) =1/R(φ). The total conductance has static (phase-
independent) and dynamic (phase-dependent) components. The latter is assumed to be a sum of
dynamic components of the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances. Synaptic
conductances can also have static components whose combination cannot be distinguished from a
static conductance of any other nature. Accordingly, we can think of the total conductance as a
superposition of inhibitory and excitatory conductances whose static components form a static
component of the total conductance, and their dynamic components underlie dynamic changes in
the total conductance. Hence, the total current can be thought as a combination of the inhibitory
and excitatory currents:
where Gi (φ) and Ge(φ) are inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances, and Ei and Ee are
corresponding reversal potentials. This equation must be fulfilled for any Vm, therefore
Solving this system of equations for the synaptic conductances yields
To find the dynamic components of the synaptic conductances ΔGi(φ) and ΔGe(φφ) we subtract
their minimal values over the respiratory cycle:
Finally, we can use the sum of the minimal values found as an estimate for the leak conductance:

range of voltage values. The exception is the interval of phase values near the transition from inspiration to expiration (0.2–
0.25 for this particular recording) which reflects some cycle-to-cycle variability of the inspiratory phase durations. Less perfect
linear fits near the transitions between respiratory phases manifest as bumps in the error estimates shown by black lines in

Reversal potential estimation
It is possible that during a certain part of the cycle, a neuron receives only one type of synaptic
input, inhibitory or excitatory. Below is how this fact can be exploited for obtaining the estimates
of reversal potentials for inhibition or excitation. For inhibition, after introducing
in (5) and combining (4) and (5) we get:
Since the total excitatory synaptic conductance Ge(φ) is greater or equal to its static component
, from (12) it follows that a straight line on the (G, I0)-plane described by
serves as an upper boundary of the reconstructed trajectory {G(φ), I0(φ), φ ∈  [0,1]}. If we suppose
that the neuron receives only phase-dependent inhibition in a certain range of phase, i.e., the
excitatory synaptic conductance is equal to its static component in this range,
 , then the
trajectory moves strictly along the line described by (13) which can be referred to as a zero
excitation line. By identifying the upper portion of the trajectory with nearly linear behavior we
can perform linear regression of this portion to find its slope −Ei, and thus estimate the reversal
potential for inhibition (see Figure 1C     ). Similarly, for the phases of the cycle where only
excitatory input is present, we can derive:
where
  is a static component of the inhibitory conductance and call it the zero inhibition
line. The latter obviously serves as a lower boundary of the trajectory. Together the zero excitation
and zero inhibition lines form a wedge that bounds the trajectory, so hereinafter we refer to such
plots as wedge diagrams (Figure 1C     ).
Interestingly, the linear upper boundary of the trajectory was seen in almost all recordings
processed implying that, first, during certain phase(s) of the respiratory cycle the interneurons
indeed receive only inhibitory input, and second, we could use the identified parameters of the
zero-excitation line to measure the inhibitory reversal potential. The same approach might be
applied for the determination of the reversal potential for excitation if there was a certain range of
phases when a cell received the excitatory input only. Since Ee is expected to be close to 0 mV, this
would be clearly identifiable by the presence of a nearly horizontal part of the curve serving as a
lower boundary of the same. This kind of behavior was not found in most of the recordings, so, as
commonly accepted, Ee was set to -10 mV in those cases. However, as we demonstrate below,
variation of reversal potentials over a wide range of possible values does not affect the shape of
synaptic conductance profiles qualitatively.
Firing patterns, synaptic input conductances, and inferred
functional connectome of respiratory interneurons: an illustration
For our illustration of extracting synaptic conductances with the above approach, we targeted
neurons in key interacting respiratory circuits located in discrete bilateral regions of the
ventrolateral medulla, specifically in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) region, which contains
local excitatory and inhibitory circuit neurons critical for generating rhythmic inspiratory activity,
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 8 of 39
and the adjacent more rostral Bötzinger complex (BötC) region (refer to Figure 2 Supplemental
Figure 1     ), containing neurons generating rhythmic expiratory activity that interact with
preBötC circuits, including by inhibitory circuit connections (e.g., (Lindsey et al., 2012     ; Smith et
al., 2013     ; Molkov et al., 2017     ; Ausborn et al., 2018     ).
Thus, targeting these regional microcircuits allowed us to test our methods for extracting various
patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in two functionally distinct microcircuits.
Also, there are various electrophysiological phenotypes of respiratory neurons with different
patterns of neuronal spiking activity during the respiratory cycle in these regions, thus providing a
diversity of rhythmic neuronal types to correlate with synaptic input patterns from our analysis,
which is useful for illustrating the utility of our techniques for delineating various functional
synaptic interactions. We have used sharp microelectrode intracellular recordings in mature rat
brainstem-spinal cord preparations in situ (see Materials and methods) for our analysis since this
approach allowed us to readily record deep in the brainstem in these targeted regions from
multiple neurons under current- and voltage-clamp with a single electrode. This provides
complementary information to test the robustness of our approach, which should be insensitive to
the mode of intracellular recording. Although our techniques can be applied to any type of
rhythmic neuron, we specifically targeted and analyzed interneurons, verified by
immunochemistry (as described below and in Material and methods), which are the most
technically challenging to record from due to small neuronal sizes and potential recording
instability, but are functionally critical for analyzing synaptic mechanisms of neural activity
pattern generation. Thus, we could test how our technique performs for important neuronal
populations under recording conditions that would likely be encountered for many rhythmic
interneuronal circuits in nervous systems.
Firing patterns of respiratory interneurons
Under normal physiological conditions the neuronal activity during the respiratory cycle consists
of three main activity phases [inspiratory (I), post-inspiratory (post-I), and stage 2 or late
expiratory (E2)] that are well documented in the literature (e.g., (Lindsey et al., 2012     ; Richter &
Smith, 2014     ). Previously described respiratory populations based on their specific firing
patterns in relation to these different phases of the cycle (see Figure 2     ) include pre-
inspiratory/inspiratory (pre-I/I), ramping inspiratory (ramp-I), early-inspiratory (early-I), late
inspiratory (late-I), post-inspiratory (post-I) and augmenting expiratory (aug-E, active during E2)
neurons. We have recorded neurons from all these populations (Figure 2     ) and have analyzed
and presented representative synaptic input patterns (Figure 3     ) for each electrophysiological
phenotype. In some cases, as an informative addition to our electrophysiological analyses, we
labeled the recorded neurons by intracellular injection of biocytin contained in the electrode
recording solution (see Materials and methods) for subsequent histological verification (Figure 2
Supplemental Figure 1     ) of the recording location, interneuron identification, and in some cases
neurotransmitter phenotype by immunohistochemistry (n=34 neurons total labeled). The latter
enabled us to identify inhibitory neurons (glycinergic or GABAergic) (e.g., see Figure 2
Supplemental Figure 2     ) for five of the neuron types (pre-I/I, ramp-I, early-I, post-I, aug-E) as
described below, which aids in circuit analysis and the corroboration of inhibitory inputs from
neurons with particular firing patterns.
Synaptic conductances and functional
connectome of respiratory interneurons
Figure 3      shows the synaptic conductance profiles of the major interneuronal
electrophysiological phenotypes whose firing patterns are illustrated in Figure 2     . Within one
population of the same electrophysiological phenotype, patterns of synaptic inputs were
qualitatively similar, although there was neuron-to-neuron variability in calculated conductance
values and details of the conductance profiles could vary (Figure 3     ) among multiple examples
of each type of recorded neurons. From these temporal patterns of synaptic conductances, as

The traces are current clamp intracellular recordings from different types of respiratory neurons distinguished by their action
potential firing patterns and activity during different respiratory cycle phases [inspiratory (I), post-I, or late-expiratory/E2
phase]. Extracellular recordings of the phrenic nerve activity (PNA) and central vagus nerve activity (cVNA) are shown below
as reference. The nerve recordings were obtained simultaneously with the pre-I/I neuron recording. All other neuron
recordings were obtained from different experimental preparations and were composited and aligned according to phases of
the cycle as indicated at the top. This was done by deleting segments (as indicated) of the membrane potentials during the
expiratory phases, since the expiratory intervals largely determine the discharge frequencies which are variable between the
in situ preparations, while the inspiratory phase durations are very similar. All neurons included in our study exhibited
rhythmic firing patterns consistent with the three-phase organization of the cycle and can be arranged in this format for
purposes of illustration. Regions of the ventrolateral medulla (preBötC or BötC) where these example recordings were
obtained, as verified histologically (Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 1     ), are indicated.

with neurobiotin by iontophoresis at the end of recording and fluorescently stained (see Methods), and in some cases further
processed for immuno-identification of neurotransmitter phenotype (see Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 2     ). The

explained below we infer functional connectomes or circuit motifs for each electrophysiological
phenotype as illustrated in Figure 4     , which is an important outcome of our analyses. In general,
these circuit connections motifs are constructed by considering that the different components of
the synaptic conductance profiles are formed by convergent inputs from neuronal populations of
specific firing phenotypes and, therefore, can be interpreted as reflecting activity patterns of these
pre-synaptic populations. By matching these activity patterns with patterns of synaptic
conductances in the recorded post-synaptic neurons, we can suggest functional connections
between neuronal populations. The information on inhibitory transmitter phenotype for neurons
with different firing patterns was also collected and indeed corroborates that subsets of the
presynaptic neurons are inhibitory as inferred from the conductance profiles, which gives
additional confidence in the correlation between pre-synaptic firing patterns and likely post-
synaptic interactions.
To illustrate in more detail how we have reconstructed the circuit connection motifs in Figure
4     , we describe how we interpret and translate the synaptic conductance profiles for each
electrophysiological phenotype.
Pre-I/I cells (n=25 neurons recorded in the preBötC) in all cases received decrementing expiratory
inhibition, and augmenting excitation during late expiration as well as strong ramping inspiratory
excitation (Figure 3A1-5     ). As shown In Figure 4A1     , a straight-forward interpretation of this
pattern of conductances is that the pre-I/I population receives inhibitory inputs from post-I spiking
neurons and excitatory inputs from aug-E and ramp-I populations. Alternatively, since a
combination of aug-E and ramp-I excitatory inputs is qualitatively similar to an input from the
pre-I/I population itself, it is also possible that excitatory pre-I/I neurons are recurrently
interconnected within this population (Figure 4A2     ). These possibilities are not mutually
exclusive, and both connectivity patterns could be expressed in the respiratory circuits. We
labeled 13 of these pre-I/I neurons during recording, two of which were identified as inhibitory
neurons by neurotransmitter immuno-labeling for glycine or GABA (1 glycinergic and 1 GABAergic
neuron identified), which is incorporated in Figure 4F1     .
Neurons with the ramp-I spiking patterns (n=24 recorded in preBötC) also received ramping
inspiratory phase excitation, but unlike some pre-I/I cells, they generally showed strong synaptic
inhibition throughout the post-inspiratory and late-expiratory (E2) phases (Figure 3B1-5     ). Some
of these neurons also received excitatory input during the E2 expiratory/pre-inspiratory phase.
Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that ramp-I neurons receive inhibitory inputs from post-I and
aug-E populations as well as an excitatory input from pre-I/I neurons (Figure 4B1     ). Another
possibility is that the excitatory ramp-I neurons not receiving excitation during the pre-inspiratory
phase have recurrent excitation within their population (Figure 4B2     ). Four out of 7 of these
neurons were labeled in the preBötC and identified as inhibitory (glycinergic) neurons
(incorporated in Figures 4D1&4E1     ).
All early-I spiking neurons (n=6 in preBötC) showed decrementing expiratory phase inhibition
(Figure 3C1-5     ). Most of these cells also received pre-inspiratory/late expiratory and inspiratory
excitation (Figure 3C1, 3-5     ), while some of them did not (Figure 3C2     ), which we interpret as
shown in Figures 4C1 and 4C2     , respectively. The excitatory pre-I/I input can also be a
combination of aug-E and ramp-I excitation as in Figure 4A1     . One of the three labeled early-I
neurons was identified as an inhibitory (GABAergic) neuron (Figure2 Supplemental Figure 2     ),
corroborating the early-I inhibitory inputs inferred from conductance profiles shown in Figures 4
D1&2, 4E1&E2, 4F1&F2     .
Synaptic inputs to late-I cells (n=6 in preBötC) were similar to ramp-I neurons (Figure 3D1-5     )
plus concurrent, inspiratory phase inhibition. So, in addition to inhibitory inputs from post-I and
aug-E neurons and pre-I/I (in some cases) and ramp-I excitation, they likely receive inhibitory
inputs from early-I spiking neurons (Figure 4D1     ). Some of these cells showed neither inhibition

Figure 4.
Inferred connections between different respiratory interneuronal populations.
By matching the firing phenotype of the receiver neuron and its synaptic inputs we infer possible motifs of interactions
between the functional populations of the active network. In this representation, we assume that the functional connection
between populations is present, if a post-synaptic neuron of a particular firing phenotype has a dynamic component of the
synaptic conductance statistically significantly different from zero (see Materials and methods: Statistical significance) in the
phase range corresponding to the activity pattern of the pre-synaptic population. Here we show two examples of such
inferences for each phenotype representing the most straightforward interpretation of synaptic inputs (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and
F1) as well as interactions involving the least number of populations (A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 and F2), reflecting the cell-to-cell
variability in conductance profiles with some neurons within a given electrophysiological phenotype exhibiting the smaller set
of synaptic inputs. Possible inhibitory/excitatory connections are shown by blue/red lines ending with blue circles/red arrows
originating from presynaptic neurons and terminating at the post-synaptic neurons. Inhibitory sources are shown in blue,
and the excitatory sources are shown in red. These circuit motifs are consistent with the patterns of synaptic inputs to the
various neurons, as described in the text for each electrophysiological phenotype, and account for our immuno-histochemical
identification of inhibitory neurons as subpopulations of most of the electrophysiological types as indicated in the text.

Combinatorial circuit schematic.
A. Comprehensive summary of the inferred connectome of the functional respiratory network, implied by the collection of
circuit motifs shown in Figure 4     , incorporating information about proposed synaptic inputs and neurotransmission
between various neuronal populations classified according to their distinct firing pattern phenotypes. This schematic
incorporates all of the possibilities inferred from our conductance analyses, and includes sets of mutual inhibitory
interactions between inhibitory populations (post-I and aug-E; early-I and post-I, early-I and aug-E populations), inhibitory
inputs to excitatory populations (post-I to pre-I/I and ramp-I; aug-E to ramp-I), and the pre-I/I and ramp-I excitatory synaptic
drives. B. A functionally minimal circuit schematic previously suggested by Smith et al. (2007) and shown from model
simulation studies to generate a realistic three-phase rhythmic pattern of neuronal population activity. Similarities of the
circuit interactions depicted in these two schematics include the inhibitory connectome with post-I and aug-E inhibition
distributed throughout the network, the sets of mutual inhibitory interactions, and the strong pre-I/I excitatory inspiratory
drive, while there are clearly additional features in our more elaborate circuit connectome in the new combinatorial
schematic (A), including the inhibitory and excitatory neuronal counterparts and associated circuit interactions for post-I,
aug-E, pre-I/I, and ramp-I neuron populations that were not included in the previous models. This connectivity suggests the
idea that the excitatory subpopulations could drive the activity during their respective cycle phases and could synchronize
activity of their inhibitory counterparts, whereas the inhibitory subpopulations appear to be important participants in
orchestrating phase transitions and maintaining inhibition to other circuit populations during the active phases driven by the
excitatory subpopulations.

nor excitation at the end of expiration (Figure 3D2     ), so they might receive no aug-E inhibition
and ramp-I rather than pre-I/I excitation (Figure 4D2     ). These neurons were infrequently
recorded, and none were successfully labeled for neurotransmitter type identification.
Post-I spiking neurons (n=40: 25 in preBötC, 15 in BötC), that always exhibit a decrementing firing
pattern during expiration, received strong decrementing inhibition during inspiration, and
incrementing inhibition during late expiration (Figure 3E1-5     ). They also showed a relatively
weak excitation during post-inspiration, usually accompanied by comparable in magnitude
ramping excitation during inspiration. The corresponding circuit elements representing inputs to
the post-I neurons are shown in Figure 4E1     . Since post-I neurons receive post-I excitation, it is
possible that excitatory post-I cells form a population with recurrent excitatory interconnections.
Besides, some of these neurons did not have any significant excitatory input during inspiration
(Figure 3E3     ). The latter possibilities are shown in Figure 4E2     . Eight of the 20 post-I neurons
labeled (5 in preBötC and 3 BötC neurons) were identified as glycinergic (Figure 2 Supplemental
Figure 2     ), consistent with a previous study (Ezure et al., 2003     ), and corroborating the post-I
inhibitory inputs shown in Figures 4A1&2, 4B1&2, 4C1&2, 4D1&2, 4F1&2     .
Finally, all the aug-E spiking neurons (n=19 recorded: 9 neurons in preBötC, 10 in BötC) received
decrementing inhibitory inputs during expiratory and inspiratory phases as well as an excitatory
input that started in the middle of expiration and incremented towards the end of expiration
(Figure 3F1-5     ). Some of these neurons received pre-inspiratory inhibition. We interpret this as
the aug-E population receiving inputs from early-I, post-I and pre-I/I inhibitory populations and
the excitatory input from aug-E neurons (Figure 4F1     ). Similar to other interpretations, it is also
possible that the excitatory aug-E neurons form a population with recurrent excitation with an
augmenting pattern that matches their activity profile, while some of these neurons do not receive
pre-I inhibition (Figure 4F2     ). Three out of 6 of these neurons labeled were identified as
glycinergic neurons (1 preBötC neuron and 2 BötC neurons) (Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 2     ),
as inferred from the synaptic conductance profiles in Figures 4B1&2, 4C1, 4D1, 4E1     .
Validating reliability of inferred synaptic conductance profiles
Synaptic conductance profiles from current- and voltage-clamp recordings
The traditional way to measure transmembrane currents is by voltage-clamp intracellular
recordings. Using this experimental protocol, the membrane potential of the neuron is held at a
constant level thus maintaining all voltage-dependent membrane currents at their steady states.
Therefore, in voltage-clamp conditions any total current variations result exclusively from time-
varying synaptic inputs, while in the current-clamp protocol variations of the voltage can
potentially be contaminated by transient dynamics of the voltage-gated channels. However, the
implementation of the voltage-clamp protocol is technically far more challenging with sharp high-
impedance microelectrodes than injecting a constant current. By design, our technique is
indifferent to what strategy is used for the injected current variations, so we performed both
current- and voltage-clamp recordings from select neurons (n=10) where the voltage-clamp could
be satisfactorily established following the current-clamp recording in each of these neurons and
compared the results of the synaptic input interferences as a test of the reliability of our methods.
Figure 5      shows the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance profiles extracted from
current-(left) and voltage-clamp (right) segments of the intracellular recordings for 3 different
types of representative neurons. It is evident that the shapes of the conductance profiles as well as
the relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory conductances extracted are very similar.
Quantitative variations in the amplitude of the synaptic inputs are similar to those observed when
using different epochs of the same current-clamp recordings (see below). Thus, we conclude that
our synaptic conductance inferences obtained by current clamp recordings favorably match the
conductance profiles obtained from direct recordings of synaptic currents during voltage clamp.

aug-E, middle; ramp-I, bottom panels) with inspiratory phases highlighted by gray bars. Calculated synaptic conductances are
normalized by the estimates of the leak conductance. While the absolute conductance values may vary, the shapes of the
synaptic conductance profiles as well as the relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory conductances are consistent
across these recording protocols.

Uncertainties concerned with estimates of synaptic reversal potentials
As noted, it was not always possible to identify linear portions of GI-contours suitable for reliable
estimation of the reversal potentials. In addition, the procedure described does not imply an
unequivocal way for finding the errors for the reversal potential estimates. Accordingly, for the
synaptic input classification purposes, we varied the reversal potentials in the predefined ranges
when using Eqs. (6) and (7) to calculate the synaptic conductances. We used the following ranges:
[-20, 0] mV and [-110, -90] mV for the reversal potentials for excitation and inhibition, respectively.
Figure 6      illustrates that although the absolute values of the conductances vary to some extent as
we vary the reversal potentials, the shape of their reconstructed profiles remains consistent.
Evaluating the effects of non-stationarity of the intracellular recordings
Our approach implicitly assumes that the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons do not
change (much) throughout the epoch used for the calculations. To verify the plausibility of this
hypothesis, whenever possible we used two different epochs from the same recordings satisfying
the criteria formulated in the Preprocessing section of the Methods for the complete analysis. We
found that differences between the results for different epochs in most cases were comparable to
those observed in the recordings obtained by current- and voltage-clamp protocols from the same
neuron. Figure 7      shows the results for two adjacent non-overlapping epochs for three different
neurons.
In summary, our evaluation of the major assumptions and potential sources of error with our
procedures for extracting temporal patterns of synaptic conductances, including recording
procedures, and cycle phase-dependent linearity of current-voltage relations (Figure 1
Supplemental Figure 1     ), indicate that the temporal profiles of conductances obtained by our
method are reliable for functional circuit reconstruction as we elaborate further below.
Discussion
In our analyses of synaptic conductance profiles in rhythmically active neurons from neuronal
intracellular recordings, we propose that these profiles represent the convergent synaptic inputs
from many neurons, and therefore represent the synaptic interactions of key functional
populations operating in the active networks, which provides a basis for functional network
reconstruction. Accordingly, a main objective of this study was to establish the utility and
reliability of our technique, based on theoretical analyses and experimental validation, for
extracting and separating profiles of inhibitory and excitatory conductances at high temporal
resolution from intracellular recording data. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our
technique by applying our analyses to infer synaptic inputs to rhythmically active respiratory
neurons comprising key microcircuits within the medullary preBötC and BötC regions of the
brainstem respiratory CPG, which provided a diversity of neuronal electrophysiological
phenotypes in various rhythmic microcircuits to test the performance of our technique. Our
approach extends previously proposed methods for extracting dynamic patterns of synaptic
conductances in post-synaptic neurons in various other neural circuits (Borg-Graham et al.,
1998     ; Anderson et al., 2000     ; Shu et al., 2003     ; Berg et al., 2007     ; Endo & Kiehn, 2008     ;
Wright & Calabrese, 2011     ), by providing higher temporal resolution with nearly continuous
readouts of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances, in our illustration throughout the
respiratory cycle for different respiratory interneuron types. We have obtained previously
unavailable synaptic conductance profiles for the different neuron populations, and illustrate how
this analysis can be used to infer functional interactions and circuit configurations of interneuron

The effect of reversal potential variation on the synaptic input reconstruction results.
We used the recording of the ramp-I neuron shown in Fig. 3B5 and recalculated its synaptic conductances for different
combinations of the inhibitory and excitatory reversal potential values as indicated in each plot. Synaptic conductances are
normalized by the estimates of the leak conductance. While the absolute conductance values vary with the reversal
potentials, the shapes of the synaptic profiles as well as the relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory conductances
are consistent across different values of the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials used.

populations, which demonstrates the utility of our technique. Below we further address technical
issues affecting the robustness of our approach, and then discuss the general applicability to
rhythmically active circuits.
Estimation of reversal potentials
and errors in conductance analysis
We have noted above and evaluated uncertainties concerned with synaptic reversal potentials and
assumptions about stability of the cellular properties and recordings on the inferred synaptic
conductance profiles, but it is important to elaborate certain points. We have used an
experimental preparation and setup that provides optimal stability for sharp electrode
intracellular recordings. We used strict criteria for assessing and accepting the quality and
stability of the recordings. For the most part, our analysis results for a given neuron that meets our
criteria were reproducible for different recording epochs and conditions. We also generated
continuous error estimates for each example shown and confirmed the statistical significance of
conductance values. Regarding stationarity, our results suggest that any differences between the
inferred conductance profiles for different recording epochs and conditions in most cases were
comparable to those between recordings obtained by current- and voltage-clamp protocols.
Most neurons that we have analyzed receive inhibition only during certain parts of respiratory
cycle regardless of whether they are inspiratory or expiratory neuron types. This allowed
retrieving their reversal potentials for inhibition using the approach described in Materials and
methods. Interestingly, the inhibitory synaptic reversal potentials retrieved turned out to vary
significantly among cells between -62 mv and -116 mV. The reversal potential estimates were in
good correspondence with actual reversals of inhibitory events when a cell was hyperpolarized
below the reversal potential. Therefore, regarding the analysis, the results were reliable.
Nevertheless, on average, reversal potentials were much more negative than what would have
been expected. It is well known that in intracellular recordings, the length constant of the neuron
and the distance of the microelectrode from the synaptic inputs determine the measured reversal
potential (Calvin, 1969     ; Spruston et al., 1993     ; Wehr & Zador, 2003     ). For the precise
extraction of inhibitory and excitatory conductances from the total conductance, reversal
potential values may be critical. The variability of the inhibitory reversal potential emphasizes the
need to determine the reversal potential for each neuron separately. Otherwise, a wrong
inhibitory reversible potential value used for the reconstruction may lead to incorrect
conductance profiles. For example, a large positive bias in the inhibitory reversal potential will
have the effect that a part of the inhibitory conductance may be mislabeled as excitatory
conductance and therefore show a pattern of concurrent inhibition and excitation. Our method
for the estimation of inhibitory reversible potential appeared very reliable when compared to the
experimental estimates of the inhibitory reversal potential and essentially excluded the
occurrence of this excitatory conductance artifact.
The absolute values of inhibitory and excitatory conductance calculated by the analysis are
contaminated with an error depending on the length constant of the neuron and the distance of
the microelectrode from the synaptic inputs (Calvin, 1969     ; Wehr & Zador, 2003     ). Importantly,
Wehr and Zador (2003)      show that the estimate of timing of synaptic conductances is reliable and
not influenced by the length constant of the neuron. Therefore, the conductance profiles extracted
with our analysis are qualitatively reliable and the overall time course of inhibitory and excitatory
conductances reflect the overall inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the different
electrophysiological classes of active neurons analyzed.

Implications of reconstructed synaptic conductance
profiles for respiratory functional circuit architecture
Our analysis revealed different sets of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances that are
characteristic for the different populations of respiratory neurons. Indeed, our results suggest that
phasic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that result from network interactions of these
respiratory neuron populations shape membrane potential trajectories and spiking patterns of the
neurons throughout the respiratory cycle. What can we learn from these results about the
organization and operation of the underlying pattern generation networks?
We have suggested circuit motifs that are consistent with the patterns of synaptic inputs to the
various neurons, and which also account for our immuno-histochemical identification of
inhibitory neurons as subpopulations of most of the electrophysiological types. However, these
circuit elements do not explain the overall dynamical operation of the circuits, particularly how
the rhythm and the orderly generation of the multiple activity phases occurs. A more
comprehensive synthesis of circuit interactions as illustrated below, and ultimately computational
simulation studies (e.g., (Lindsey et al., 2012     ; Molkov et al., 2017     ), are required. In Figure 4
Supplemental Figure 1      we illustrate the construction of a combinatorial circuit schematic of
the functional connectivity from the neuronal population interactions suggested by our collection
of circuit motifs.
Previously, computational models for core circuits of the respiratory CPG including interacting
microcircuits in the preBötC and BötC regions have proposed a network organization with
respiratory neuron population interactions that are capable from simulation studies with models
incorporating circuit architectures (e.g., Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1B     ) and neuronal and
synaptic biophysical properties to generate a realistic respiratory rhythm and the three-phase
rhythmic pattern of neuron and neuronal population activity (Lindsey et al., 2012     ; Molkov et al.,
2017     ; Rubin, Shevtsova, Ermentrout, Smith, & Rybak, 2009; Rybak et al., 2007). These include the
model proposed by Smith, Abdala, Koizumi, Rybak, and Paton (2007) based on regional circuit
mapping and electrophysiological studies with the mature rat in situ experimental preparation
used in the present studies. Despite its plausibility, this and other models remain speculative
because the experimental evidence for functional connectivity is mostly indirect.
Our cellular-based analysis provides a way of untangling functional connections within the
respiratory CPG and testing computational models. By assuming the origin of these inputs
according to the phase in which they occur, we can draw conclusions on the functional
connections between the key respiratory neuron populations recorded here. Our synaptic
conductance profiles are consistent with multiple features of the network architecture and
interactions proposed by Smith et al. (2007) as illustrated in Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1B     ,
which was suggested to be a minimal and sufficient circuit configuration to explain how the three-
phase rhythmic respiratory pattern, including activity patterns of key interneuron populations in
the medulla, can be generated. As reconstructed from our synaptic conductance profiles and
collection of circuit motifs, there are new features in our more elaborate circuit connectome in the
new combinatorial circuit schematic in Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1A      as noted in the
supplemental figure legend. There are likely additional connectivity features that remain to be
uncovered as the catalogue of intracellular recording data and inferred functional interactions is
expanded from further studies. We note that the profiles of neuronal synaptic interactions that we
consider are specific for the in situ reduced rat brainstem-spinal cord system, which has proven to
be an important model system for understanding the operation of core CPG respiratory circuits in
the medulla and pontine reticular formation that are operational in our experimental set-up
(Paton et al., 2022     ), but cannot account for the supra-brainstem and peripheral circuit inputs in
the nervous system in vivo (e.g., Lindsey et al., 2012     ; Smith et al., 2013     ; Paton et al., 2022     ).
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 23 of 39
Our objective here was to illustrate how our techniques can delineate the functional circuit
interactions in an established core set of circuits in the respiratory CPG as an example of the utility
of our approach that can be generally applied to rhythmic neural circuits as discussed below.
Applicability to other rhythmically active networks
Our method for extracting and separating phasic patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic
conductances from single neuronal intracellular recordings is broadly applicable to rhythmic
circuits which are ubiquitous in nervous systems. Our approach involves phase-based analysis,
where the network activity cycle is divided into activity phases to capture dynamic changes of
synaptic input conductances throughout the activity cycle. This approach is relevant for any
circuits with repetitive activity cycles, such as rhythmic CPG motor networks (e.g., (Calabrese &
Marder, 2024     )) and circuits generating cortical rhythms (Yuste et al., 2005     ). The method is
based on the general mathematical framework presented, involving current balance equations
and linear regression to separate excitatory and inhibitory conductances, and therefore is
applicable to different rhythmic neuron types and circuits and is suitable for diverse experimental
setups. By providing high-resolution temporal profiles of synaptic inputs and outputs (below,
based on neuronal spiking patterns), this method enables researchers to infer the functional
connectivity and dynamic interactions within any rhythmically active network.
Applying this method, as we have illustrated for respiratory circuits, to other rhythmic networks
such as locomotor or cortical circuits including sensory processing networks, follows a similar
process for extracting neuronal excitatory and inhibitory inputs during different oscillatory
phases of endogenous or sensory-driven periodic activity. This allows for the inference of
functional synaptic input connections for any targeted neuron populations based on the timing
and strength of the extracted synaptic inputs. In this context, functional populations are defined as
groups of neurons with similar firing patterns with respect to the cycle phase. If the synaptic
conductance profile of a recorded neuron contains a component that mirrors the firing pattern of
a specific population, it can be inferred that there is a functional connection from that population
to the recorded neuron. Similarly, in sensory processing networks, it can reveal how sensory
inputs are synaptically integrated in neurons by examining synaptic conductance patterns in
response, for example, to repetitive stimuli.
The approach that we have described is versatile since it is compatible with various recording
protocols, such as current-clamp and voltage-clamp and different modes of intracellular recording
(sharp electrode or whole-cell patch clamp). We note that our approach to defining functional
connectivity does not provide information on locations of the sources of the synaptic inputs,
although we can infer spiking patterns of the source neurons from the temporal features of the
synaptic conductance profiles. These profiles represent the total synaptic inputs that can arise
from many neurons possibly with short and long-range axonal projections to a given neuron. The
capability of our approach to readout the total synaptic conductance and separate the excitatory
and inhibitory components from all sources at high temporal resolution is a strength of our
approach. These inferred neuronal population connections from the electrophysiological analyses
provided by our technique can be further mapped and corroborated with other functional and
anatomical approaches.
In summary, the versatility of our technique lies in its foundation on basic electrophysiological
principles and adaptability to different rhythmic activities making it a powerful tool for
investigating a wide range of rhythmically active neuronal networks and potentially offering
insights into their functional organization and dynamic operations.

Materials and methods
Animal procedures
All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (Animal Study Proposal #1154-21).
In situ perfused rat brainstem-spinal cord preparation
Experiments were performed using the in situ arterially perfused brainstem-spinal cord
preparations from mature (3–4 weeks old) rats (Paton, 1996     ; Paton et al., 2022     ) following
experimental procedures described in detail in Smith et al. 2007 and modified as described below
to provide optimal conditions for intracellular recording. Briefly, preheparinzed (1,000 units, given
intraperitoneally) rats (Sprague-Dawley, 45-70g; male) were anaesthetized deeply with 5%
isoflurane and the portion of the body caudal to the diaphragm was removed. The head and
thorax were immersed in ice-chilled carbogenated Ringer solution and the brain was decerebrated
at a precollicular level. The descending aorta, phrenic nerve, central vagus and hypoglossal nerves
were surgically isolated. The dorsal brainstem was exposed by craniotomy and cerebellectomy. To
achieve the mechanical stability necessary for intracellular recordings, the great veins and heart
were removed. The preparation was transferred to a recording chamber and the descending aorta
cannulated with a double lumen catheter for perfusion and recording of perfusion pressure with a
pressure transducer. A hydraulic damping Windkessel chamber was used in the perfusion circuit
immediately downstream from the output of the roller pump (Watson-Marlow, Wilmington, MA)
to eliminate peristaltic flow pulsations that affect stability of the sharp electrode intracellular
recordings.
Solutions and pharmacological agents
The perfusate contained the following in distilled water: magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 -1.25 mM),
potassium phosphate (KH2PO4 - 1.25 mM), potassium chloride (KCl - 5.0 mM), sodium bicarbonate
(NaHCO3 - 25 mM), sodium chloride (NaCl -125 mM), calcium chloride (CaCl2 - 2.5 mM), dextrose
(10 mM) and polyethylene glycol (0.1785 mM). Vecuronium bromide was added to the perfusate to
block neuromuscular transmission (4 µg/ml; SUN pharmaceutical industries, Bryan, USA). The
perfusate was gassed with 95%O2-5%CO2 and maintained at 31°C. Vasopressin (200–400 pM as
required; APP pharmaceuticals, East Schaumburg, USA) was added to the perfusate to raise and
maintain perfusion pressure at 70–80 mmHg. Unless stated, all chemicals were from Sigma.
Electrophysiological recordings and neuron labeling
Efferent activity of the phrenic (PN) and central vagus (VN) nerves were recorded simultaneously
with glass suction electrodes and their activities were amplified, filtered (0.3–6.0 KHz), rectified
and integrated (50 ms time constant). Sharp microelectrode somatic intracellular recordings were
made in the preBötC and BötC regions. The brainstem was mapped by recording population
activity of neurons in the medulla oblongata with an extracellular electrode (5–10 MOhm) prior to
intracellular recording. The position of the electrode was monitored by software that kept track of
the micromanipulator mechanical coordinates. Once the region of the preBötC or BötC was
identified by rhythmic inspiratory/expiratory population activity, coordinates were saved and in
some cases the brainstem surface was marked with pontamine sky blue dye. Intracellular
recordings were made with fine tipped glass microelectrodes (45 to 70 MOhm) pulled from
borosilicate glass capillaries. The microelectrodes for intracellular recording were driven into the
recording site by a combination DC motor driven micromanipulator with an integrated
piezotranslator (PM10-1, Marzhauser Wetzlar, Germany), allowing high stepping speeds for cell
penetration. A dual current clamp-voltage clamp amplifier (SEC-05X, NPI, Tamm, Germany) was
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 25 of 39
used to amplify the signals in bridge and discontinuous current clamp (DCC) recording modes.
Discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp (SEVC) recordings were obtained by exploiting the
high switching frequencies and electrode capacity compensation of the SEC-05X system, allowing
high fidelity SEVC recordings with the high resistance sharp microelectrodes used. The
microelectrodes were filled with a solution of 2 M potassium acetate (KAc) and 0.1 M potassium
chloride (KCl) and 4% neurobiotin. During recordings some neurons were labeled by ionophoresis
of neurobiotin into the cell. All recordings were digitized via a CED 1401-plus multi-channel
interface and acquired (6–12 kHz digitization rates) using CED Spike 2 software.
Histological analysis
Transected brain stem was fixed in 4% buffered (0.1 M phosphate buffer) paraformaldehyde for 24
h at 4°C, cryoprotected at 4°C in 30% sucrose, and subsequently coronally sectioned (30 µm thick)
on a freezing microtome. All the floating sections were preincubated for 1 h with 10% donkey
serum in PBS and subsequently incubated for 48-72h at room temperature with primary
antibodies: Rabbit anti-Glycine antibody (1:5000; Immunosolution), rabbit anti-GABA antibody
(1:1000; Millipore-Sigma), and goat anti-ChAT antibody (1:500; Chemicon). Labeling for neuronal
ChAT expression was used to label motoneurons of nucleus ambiguous to verify the region where
the neurons were recorded and to confirm that the recordings were obtained from non-
motoneurons. Floating sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a mixture of
donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy5 and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:500;
Jackson ImmunoResearch). For fluorescence labeling of neurons filled with neurobiotin during
electrophysiological recording, slices were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-Avidin D (1:500,
Invitrogen). Tissue was mounted on slides and covered with antifading medium.
Confocal images were obtained with a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss). Alexa
Fluor 488, Cy3, and Texas Red or Cy5 were detected at 488, 543, and 633 nm emission wavelengths,
respectively.
Images were acquired and processed with a Zeiss Zen software and presented as single optical
sections selected from serial optical sections (Z-stacks).
Reconstruction of synaptic inputs from intracellular recordings
Preprocessing
Inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs to respiratory neurons were reconstructed from
intracellular recordings using a general approach similar to that described by Berg et al. (2007)     
and others (Borg-Graham et al., 1998     ; Anderson et al., 2000     ; Shu et al., 2003     ; Endo & Kiehn,
2008     ).
During intracellular recordings for conductance measurement and subsequent decomposition of
inhibitory and excitatory inputs, depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current was injected into the
cell in a stepwise manner (Figure 1A     ), and data at hyperpolarized voltages (−100 mV to -60 mV)
was used for the analyses. The period of time from the onset of the phrenic burst to the beginning
of the next phrenic burst was used as reference cycle. The beginning of a phrenic burst was
determined as 10% of phrenic amplitude in the rectified and low pass filtered (time constant =
0.05s) extracellular recording. We only analyzed recordings from respiratory neurons that fulfilled
the following criteria: (1) The coefficient of variation of the respiratory cycle period was <10%; (2)
At least three steps of current injections were made during intracellular recording that were kept
constant for at least 5 respiratory cycles each.
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 26 of 39
Neurons with obvious recording instability such as significant changes in membrane leakage
current with a baseline membrane potential drift were not analyzed. The intracellularly recorded
membrane potential Vm(t) was sampled down from 12.5 kHz to 100 Hz. To eliminate spikes
without affecting slow membrane potential fluctuations the voltage trace Vm(t) was processed
using median filtration.
Error estimation
After performing linear regression (2) for each phase bin we have standard errors δR(φ) and
δV0(φ) of the total resistance R(φ) and the resting potential V0(φ) respectively which are defined by
voltage fluctuations and by the number of respiratory cycles in the epoch used for reconstruction.
Based on this we can approximately calculate the standard error for the total conductance δG(φ)
=δR(φ)/R2(φ), which can be used as an overestimate for the errors of both excitatory and inhibitory
conductances since the total conductance is a sum of the two. Calculation of the dynamic
components involves subtraction of the minimal values of the calculated synaptic conductances.
Therefore, the dynamic components’ standard errors can be estimated as
 ,
where φm is the phase where the corresponding conductance (excitatory or inhibitory) attains its
minimum.
Statistical significance
Considering the relatively large sample sizes (for each cell analyzed we had 50-200 respiratory
cycles long recordings), we used a one-tailed z-test to confirm statistical significance of the
reconstructed synaptic inputs by testing a null hypothesis that the dynamical component of the
synaptic conductance is zero (no different from its minimal value). Specifically, at each phase of
the respiratory cycle φ for the dynamic components of inhibitory and excitatory conductances we
calculated their z-scores zi,e(φ) =ΔGi,e(φ)/δΔGi,e(φ), and corresponding p-values. We used p-value <
0.05 criterion to accept the alternative hypothesis that the calculated dynamic component of the
synaptic conductance at a particular phase is statistically significantly greater than zero. In the
latter case, we concluded that the recorded cell received the corresponding type of synaptic input
(excitatory or inhibitory) during the corresponding part of the respiratory cycle (inspiration, post-
inspiration, or late-expiration/pre-inspiration).

Reviewer #2 (Public review):
Summary:
By measuring intracellular changes in membrane voltage from a single neuron of the
medulla the authors attempted to develop a method for determining the balance of excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic drive onto a single neuron.
Strengths:
This data-driven approach to explore neural circuits is described well in this study and could
be valuable in identifying microcircuits that generate rhythms. Importantly, perhaps, this
inference method could enable microcircuits to be studied without the need for time-
consuming anatomical tracing or other more involved electrophysiological techniques.
Therefore, I can see the value in developing an approach of this type.
Weaknesses:
The implications of several assumptions associated with this inference technique have been
considered by the authors.
Most importantly, it is my understanding that this approach assumes a linear I-V when
extracting information about the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (see
equations 6 and 7). In Figure 6, the authors explore the impact of varying the reversal
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 31 of 39
potential for the extraction of information about synaptic drive, but this still assumes that the
underlying conductance is linear. However, open rectification will be a feature of any
conductance generated by asymmetric distributions of ions (see the GHK current equation)
and will therefore be a particular issue for the inhibition resulting from asymmetrical Cl- ion
gradients across GABA-A receptors as well as the K+ conductance indirectly activated by
GABA-B receptor activation. The mixed cation conductance that underlies most synaptic
excitation will also generate a non-linear I-V relationship due to the inward rectification
associated with polyamine block of AMPA receptors. The authors present evidence that the I-
V relationship is linear over most of the voltage range examined, and this is a helpful
addition. The authors have discussed the absence of active conductances contributing to the
I-V, but I still wonder how the extraction of information concerning the excitatory and
inhibitory conductances relies on the assumption of a linear I-V for these conductances.
This approach has similarities to earlier studies undertaken in the visual cortex that
estimated the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance changes that contributed to
membrane voltage changes during receptive field stimulation. However, these approaches
also involved the recording of transmembrane current changes during visual stimulation that
were undertaken in voltage-clamp at various command voltages to estimate the underlying
conductance changes. Molkov et al have attempted to essentially deconvolve the underlying
conductance changes without this information and I am concerned that this simply may not
be possible. However, I appreciate the efforts taken by the authors to address this issue.
The current balance equation (1) cited in this study is based upon the parallel conductance
model developed by Hodgkin & Huxley. One key element of the HH equations is the inclusion
of an estimate of the capacitive current generated due to the change in voltage across the
membrane capacitance. While the present study considers the impact of membrane
capacitance, a deeper discussion on how variations in capacitance across different neuron
types might affect inference accuracy would be useful. Differences in capacitance could
introduce variability in inferred conductances, potentially influencing model predictions.
Studies using acute slicing preparations to examine circuit effects have often been limited to
the study of small microcircuits, especially feedforward and feedback interneuron circuits. It
is widely accepted that any information gained from this approach will always be
compromised by the absence of patterned afferent input from outside the brain region being
studied. In this study, descending control from the Pons and the neocortex will not be
contributing much to the synaptic drive and ascending information from respiratory muscles
will also be absent completely. This may not have been such a major concern if this study had
been limited to demonstrating the feasibility of a methodological approach. However, this
limitation does need to be considered when using an approach of this type to speculate on the
prevalence of specific circuit motifs within the medulla (Figure 4). Therefore, I would argue
that some discussion of this limitation should be included in this manuscript.

Thank you.
I still believe the case for the method is not as convincing as it would have been if the
method had been validated first on oscillations produced by a known CPG model. Why
would the inference of synaptic types from the model CPG voltage oscillations be
predetermined? Such inverse problems are quite complicated and their solution is often
not unique or sufficiently constrained. Recovering synaptic weights (or CPG parameters)
from limited observations of a highly nonlinear system is not warranted (Gutenkunst et
al., Universally sloppy parameter sensitivities in systems biology models, PLoS Comp. Biol.
2007; www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030189) especially when using surrogate
biological models like Hodgkin-Huxley models.
The model of the CPG is irrelevant for such a test of validity because what we reconstruct are
postsynaptic conductances of an individual neuron. The network creates a periodic input to
this neuron and thus forms a periodic pattern of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The
nature of this input, whether autonomously generated or created artificially (say by periodic
optogenetic stimulation), is generally not important. To illustrate this, we used a one-
compartment conductance-based (Hodgkin-Huxley style) model neuron incorporating a
certain common set of channels (fast sodium (INaF), potassium delayed rectifier (IKdr),
persistent sodium (INaP), calcium-dependent potassium (IKCa), and cationic non-specific
current (ICAN)), as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic channels whose conductances
were implemented as predefined periodic functions. The test suggested by the reviewer
would be to implement a current-step protocol similar to the experiments and apply our
technique to see if the reconstructed conductance profiles match those predefined functions.
Below we show the reconstruction steps for the following arbitrarily chosen pattern:
𝑔 𝐸 𝑋 𝐶 ( 𝑡 ) / 𝑔 𝐿 𝐸 𝐴 𝐾  = 0.1(1 + sin(π 𝑡 )) and 𝑔 𝐼 𝑁 𝐻 ( 𝑡 )/ 𝑔 𝐿 𝐸 𝐴 𝐾  = 0.1 (1 + cos(π 𝑡 )). Author response image 1
below shows the baseline activity of this model neuron in the absence of the injected current.

Then we applied a current-step protocol with four steps producing different levels of
hyperpolarization and applied our method by calculating the total conductance using linear
regression (see the current-voltage plots below) and then decomposing it into the excitatory
and inhibitory components.

As one can see, the reconstructed conductances in Author response image 3 below are nearly
identical to their theoretical profiles. This is not surprising because all voltage-dependent
currents in the model neuron were inactive in the range of voltages matching our
experimental conditions. Therefore, the model could be reduced to just the leak current,
synaptic currents and the injected current, which matches precisely the model we used in
our manuscript.

In p.2, the edited section refers to the interspike interval being much smaller than the
period of the network. More important is to mention the relationship between the decay
time of inhibitory synapses and the period of the network.
This interpretation misunderstands the focus of our method. The edited sections (including in
the theory section of Results) highlight the conditions under which the capacitive current
becomes negligible, emphasizing that the membrane time constant must be much smaller
than the network oscillation period. This separation of time scales ensures that the
membrane potential adjusts quickly to changes in postsynaptic conductance, rendering the
capacitive current insignificant over the network’s rhythm. In contrast, the synaptic decay
time governs how presynaptic inputs are transduced into postsynaptic conductances—a
process relevant to understanding synaptic dynamics but not directly tied to our method’s
core objective. Our approach reconstructs postsynaptic conductances from intracellular
recordings, not presynaptic spike trains. While interpreting these conductance profiles in
terms of specific synaptic connections would indeed involve synaptic decay dynamics, such
an analysis exceeds the scope of our paper. Thus, the condition emphasized in the edited
sections—concerning the membrane time constant and network period—is the critical one
for our method’s applicability, and the synaptic decay time, while relevant to broader
synaptic modeling, does not undermine our conclusions.
We have added the requirement for a much smaller membrane time constant in the
Introduction on page 2. The Results theory section already incorporates an extensive
discussion of this requirement.

Comments from the editors:
We apologize for the delay in coming to this decision, but there was quite a bit of post-
review discussion that needed to be resolved. There are two issues that the reviewers
agree should be addressed. They remain unconvinced that the simplifying assumptions
of the approach are valid. 1) The main issue with the phase argument is that the
biological synaptic conductance depends on time and not on the phase of the respiratory
cycle as mentioned in the first round of reviews. The approximation g(t)=g(phase) seems
to be far too simple to be biologically realistic.
As we elaborate below, time and phase are fundamentally and mathematically equivalent
representations of the same underlying dynamics in a periodic system, and thus, a phase-
based representation—where conductances are expressed as functions of the cycle’s phase—
is a justified and effective approach for capturing their behavior. We have added this
explanation to the theory section of Results. Below are the bases for our assertion.
In a periodic system, such as the respiratory CPG, the system’s behavior repeats at regular
intervals, defined by a period T. For the respiratory cycle in our experimental preparation,
this period is approximately 3–4 seconds, encompassing phases like inspiration, post-
inspiration, and expiration. In such systems:
Time (t) is a continuous variable that progresses linearly.
Phase (φ) represents the position within one cycle, typically normalized between 0 and 1 (or 0
to 2π in some contexts). It can be mathematically related to time via: φ(t) = (t mod T)/T, where
(t mod T) is the time elapsed within the current cycle.
Because the system is periodic, any variable that repeats with period T—such as synaptic
conductance in a rhythmically active network—can be expressed as a function of either time
or phase. Specifically, if g(t) is periodic with period T, then g(t) = g(t+T). This periodicity allows
us to redefine g(t) in terms of phase: g(t) = g(φ(t)), where φ(t) maps time onto a repeating
cycle. Thus, in a periodic system, time and phase are fundamentally equivalent
representations of the same underlying dynamics. Saying that synaptic conductance depends
on phase is mathematically equivalent to saying it depends on time in a periodic manner.
In a rhythmically active network like the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG), the
synaptic conductances, regardless of the specific mechanisms by which they are formed,
exhibit periodicity that matches the network’s oscillatory cycle. This occurs because the
conductances are driven by the repetitive activity of presynaptic neurons, which are
synchronized to the network’s overall rhythm. As a result, the synaptic conductances vary
with the same period as the network, making a phase-based representation—where
conductances are expressed as functions of the cycle’s phase—a justified and effective
approach for capturing their behavior. In our study, we utilized the in situ arterially perfused
brainstem-spinal cord preparation from mature rats, which is known to produce a highly
periodic respiratory rhythm. To ensure the consistency of this periodicity, we carefully
selected recordings where the coefficient of variation of the respiratory cycle period was less
than 10%, as outlined in our methods. This strict selection criterion confirms the stability and
regularity of the rhythm, supporting the validity of using a phase representation to analyze
the synaptic conductances.
(2) Figure S1 is problematic. First, the currents injected appear to be infinitesimally small.
There was a typo in the current units, which should be nA and not pA, as evident from the
injected current–membrane potential plots in Figure 1B. Figure S1 has been corrected.
Yaroslav I Molkov et al., 2025 eLife. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101959.3 36 of 39
Second, the input resistance is completely independent of voltage, as though there was
little or no contribution from hyperpolarization activated currents, which would be
surprising.
While hyperpolarization-activated currents are indeed present in many neuronal types and
could theoretically affect input resistance, our data consistently show linear I-V relationships
across the voltage range tested (-60 to -100 mV) for the neurons analyzed (see Figure S1 and
Author response image 4-9 below). This linearity suggests that, under our experimental
conditions, the contribution of voltage-dependent currents, such as h-currents, is negligible
within this range.
Additionally, we now indicate in the manuscript in the theory section of Results how the
presence of significant hyperpolarization-activated h-currents would impact our synaptic
conductance reconstruction method. In current-clamp recordings, non-linearity from h-
currents could introduce voltage-dependent changes in total conductance unrelated to
synaptic inputs, potentially skewing the reconstruction. However, this concern does not apply
to voltage-clamp recordings, where the membrane potential is held constant, eliminating
contributions from voltage-dependent intrinsic currents. As strong evidence of the minimal
influence of h-currents, we directly compared synaptic conductance reconstructions using
both current-clamp and voltage-clamp protocols in a subset of neurons. The results from
these two approaches were highly consistent, indicating that h-currents do not significantly
affect our findings. This robustness across experimental methods reinforces the reliability of
our conclusions.
Together, the linear I-V relationships and the agreement between current- and voltage-clamp
reconstructions provide compelling evidence that our method accurately captures synaptic
conductances without interference from h-currents.
Typical examples of I-V relationships for each respiratory neuron firing phenotype:
