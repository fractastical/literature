Introduction 
Atypical social cognition and functioning constitute a significant 
proportion of the symptoms found in many psychiatric and neu- 
r ode v elopmental conditions (Derntl & Habel, 2011 ; Rokita et al., 
2018 ), such as autistic spectrum disorder (Cerullo et al., 2021 ), 
sc hizophr enia (Gr een et al., 2015 ), and social anxiety disorder (Alvi 
et al., 2022 ; Sohail & Zhang, 2024 ). Given that social coordination 
has existing associations with mental health (Macpherson et al., 
2020 ; Dean et al., 2021 ; Macpherson & Miles, 2023 ) and a k e y role in 
e v eryday functioning, v ariation in coordination ability and str at- 
egy is a rich area of study for understanding these differences. 
Within this, m uc h r esearc h has focused on inter personal syn- 
c hr on y, the coordination and matching of behaviours and actions 
betw een tw o or more people (Yoze vitc h et al., 2023 ). Tr aditionall y, 
ho w e v er, attempts to study inter personal sync hr on y hav e focused 
on analysing individuals rather than the complete dyad and the 
corr esponding inter action (see Delaherc he et al., 2012 and Fuc hs et 
al., 2017 for details of measures). This can lead to missing crucial 
nuances in a dyad’s dynamic, such as initial communication mis- 
match or deficits from one individual eliciting exaggerated com- 
pensatory behaviour in the other member, which masks the initial 
indi vidual’s un usual comm unication (Olar e waju et al., 2023 ). 
The emerging fields of interpersonal neuroscience and inter- 
personal psychiatry focus instead on analysing this interaction 
(Redcay & Sc hilbac h, 2019 ; Dumas, 2022 ), and so access novel 
and ar guabl y fundamental aspects of social coordination. This 
paradigmatic shift in focus facilitates, perha ps e v en necessitates, 
mor e natur alistic settings and tasks, in turn improving the general 
ecological validity of the field. 
A r ecent perspectiv e pa per by P an et al. ( 2023a ) combined the 
principles of interpersonal psychiatry with computational psychi- 
atry. Computational psychiatry aims to produce formal models of 
cognitive and neural processes and applies them to psychopathol- 
ogy to identify mechanisms of dysfunction (Friston et al., 2014 ; 
Huys et al., 2016 ; Zhang, 2023 ). The main contribution of their pa- 
per was a formal and population-general model of interpersonal 
dynamics in an isoc hr onous finger ta pping task, wher ein two par- 
ticipants tap their fingers and need to ac hie v e sync hr on y by lis- 
tening to each other’s tapping (Heggli et al., 2019 ). Isochronous fin- 
ger tapping tasks are common in interpersonal research and are 
used fr equentl y in clinical populations (e .g. K on valinka et al., 2010 ; 
Kawasaki et al. , 2017 ; W ilquin et al. , 2018 ). P an and collea gues then 
applied this interpersonal computational model to the symptoms 
of sc hizophr enia and discussed potential outcomes. 
Pan et al.’s ( 2023a ) model in question has four core latent pa- 
r ameterized pr ocesses: the belief that the a gent’s rhythm and/or 
the interaction partner’s rhythm is accurate; the desire to be ob- 
jectiv el y accur ate; the desir e to hav e the same rhythm as the part- 
ner; and willingness to change to the partner’s rhythm. These la- 
tent processes are structured in two stages (Fig. 1 ). The first stage 
recruits a dynamical systems model, the Kuramoto model, which 
estimates the weighting of within-agent and between-agent pro- 
cesses (Acebrón et al., 2005 ). This stage generates the initial pa- 
rameters for the second stage . T he second stage is based in an 
activ e infer ence fr ame work and oper ates acr oss the task’s dur a- 
tion. At Timepoint 1, updating of beliefs, it estimates the confi- 
dence that the agent and the interaction partner r espectiv el y ar e 
corr ect, whic h determines the perceived accuracy of the agent 
and the consistency with the partner’s rhythm. These beliefs im- 
pact the desire and decision to change to the partner’s rhythm at 
Timepoint 2, action selection. The beliefs then continually update 
o ver time . With this m ulti-sta ge and m ulti-component model, the 
authors highlight that their paper could inspire potential devel- 
opments in interpersonal computational psychiatry and that it 
might impr ov e car e for sc hizophr enia thr ough impr oving subtyp- 
ing for treatment and aiding drug development. 
This current research highlight will discuss wider directions for 
their interpersonal computational model, beginning with other ar- 
eas of sc hizophr enia r esearc h, befor e considering its a pplication 
to different conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and dis- 
sociation and how a ppl ying the same model acr oss m ultiple clin- 
ical contexts can facilitate direct comparison of disorders . T his 
piece aims to illustrate the utility of the model and of an interper- 
sonal computational a ppr oac h.

Figur e 1: T he inter personal computational model of inter personal sync hr on y during a coordinated ta pping task. Ada pted fr om P an et al. ( 2023a ). The 
figur e illustr ates the k e y pr ocesses suggested in the pr oposed inter personal computational model. The first sta ge involv es a Kur amoto model to 
establish weighting of within-agent and between-agent processes . T he second stage invokes active inference to show how the confidence that the 
agent and/or the interaction partner are correct at Timepoint 1 determines the perceived accuracy of self and the self–other consistency, which then 
impacts the urge and finally decision to k ee p one’s own pattern or switch to the partner’s pattern at Timepoint 2. The letters in green boxes r epr esent 
the four latent parameterized processes of the model: ( A ) desire for self–other consistency; ( B ) desire to be objectively accurate; ( C ) belief that one’s 
own rhythm and/or their partner’s is correct; and ( D ) willingness to change to the partner’s rhythm. 
W ithin sc hizophrenia 
The interpersonal computational model could test and refine 
theories of sc hizophr enia and/or psyc hosis . For example , the 
model is well suited to exploring the double bind theory of 
sc hizophr enia. 
The double bind theory of sc hizophr enia posits a link between 
unusual ways of processing information and communicating with 
others, commonly associated with schizophrenia, and experienc- 
ing double bind inter actions, particularl y between a parent and 
child in early life (Bateson et al., 1956 ; Moskowitz & Montirosso, 
2018 ). A double bind situation r equir es: m ultiple people, includ- 
ing the person in the bind; r epeated inter action (if leading to 
psyc hosis); a thr eatening e v ent fr om whic h the individual learns 
behavioural rules; a second threatening event conflicting with 
the rules learnt; and being unable to acknowledge the contra- 
diction. For example, a parent chastises their child for being 
clingy, but when the c hild withdr a ws , they get punished for ig- 
noring their parent and their protests are dismissed. This situ- 
ation may result in difficulty interpreting others’ intentions and 
one’s own thoughts, causing typically inappropriate reactions and 
disor ganized/confusing speec h (Bateson et al., 1956 ; Mosk owitz & 
Montirosso, 2018 ). 
In computational terms, double binds may lead to people in- 
corr ectl y inferring and weighting information from themselves 
and others . T he model proposed by Pan et al. ( 2023a ) could r e v eal 
potential cognitive changes occurring over a double bind situa- 
tion. Monitoring participants’ latent model parameters in a coor- 
dinated finger tapping task before and after a double bind ma- 
nipulation might r e v eal social coordination c hanges associated 
with experiencing this bind. We expect changes would be most 
noticeable in the amount of noise when weighting beliefs about 
self and other accuracy and in the desire to conform to the part- 
ner’s tapping rhythm (parameters C and D in Fig. 1 ), the direction 
of which would probably depend on the c hr onicity of the double 
binds and the dyad’s dynamic. This could further be combined 
with comparing estimated parameters from participants with and 
without psychosis to examine if double bind situations shift peo- 
ple to w ar ds a typicall y sc hizophr enic/psyc hotic manner of social 
coor dination. This w ould both test the validity of the double bind 
theory and indicate whether and how social coordination strate- 
gies can be manipulated. 
Interpersonal computational modelling of social synchrony | 3 
Other curr entl y pr ominent theories of psyc hosis may not be as 
dir ectl y testable by this model. For example, Freeman et al.’s ( 2002 ) 
cognitiv e–behaviour al model of persecutory delusions suggests 
that these delusions originate from the interaction between prior 
beliefs, personality and emotional tr aits, envir onmental factors, 
and specific cognitive biases such that unusual but significant ex- 
periences ar e inter pr eted as indicators of thr eat. These ar e then 
maintained by processes that reinforce the perception of threat: 
such as worry and the use of counter-pr oductiv e safety-seeking 
behaviours (Fr eeman, 2016 ). Giv en this cognitiv e–behaviour al 
model takes a holistic person-centred approach, rather than fo- 
cusing on specific parameters of interpersonal interactions, the 
potential for communication between the models is scant. There- 
fore, it is unlikely the computational model could provide a signif- 
icant contribution to this biopsychosocial cognitive–behavioural 
account of persecutory delusions. 
Similarly, in the case of a pr edictiv e coding model of psychosis 
(Sterzer et al., 2018 ), the model’s pr edictions ar e too abstr act to 
be potentially falsified by results from this interpersonal compu- 
tational model. Ho w e v er, the inter personal model may be a ppli- 
cable to the pr edictiv e coding account as a tool for exploring the 
computations underl ying pr edictiv e coding during inter personal 
interactions. 
Autism spectrum disorder 
While initially discussed in the context of schizophrenia, the inter- 
personal computational model can be applied to studying other 
disor ders. Autism spectrum disor der is commonly associated with 
abnormal social coordination (Cerullo et al., 2021 ), and so its re- 
search might benefit from using the model. 
As suggested by Pan et al. ( 2023a ), the model is designed to 
elucidate mechanistic differences in social coordination strate- 
gies, meaning it has the potential to better our understanding of 
the content of alterations in social coordination associated with 
autism. 
The model might also offer insight into the dynamics underly- 
ing why people often show a pr efer ence to w ar ds interacting with 
others of the same neurotype (Chen et al., 2021 ) by, for exam- 
ple, corr elating the str ength and dir ection of pr efer ence with the 
model’s latent parameters and comparing the parameters across 
interactions within and between neurotypes. 
Looking across conditions, we can use the interpersonal com- 
putational model to identify ov erla p (or lac k ther eof) in in- 
ter personal sync hr on y str ategies and pr ocessing acr oss men- 
tal health conditions and neur ode v elopmental disorders, whic h 
might in turn clarify the relation between conditions. For example, 
there is currently debate whether autism spectrum disorder and 
sc hizophr enia ar e diametricall y opposed, particularl y in the so- 
cial domains (Crespi & Badcock, 2008 ), overlap significantly (King 
& Lord, 2011 ), or ar e r elated in other ways (Chisholm et al., 2015 ). 
One might inform this debate by comparing the model’s param- 
eters in participants with autism and sc hizophr enia, whic h could 
indicate how m uc h social cognition in these disorders ov erla p and 
differ, and identify specific processes of dis/similarity, such as dif- 
ferent sensitivities to external input if they differ in their desire 
for self-other consistency (parameter A in Fig. 1 ). 
These a ppr oac hes could be combined with concurrent 
neur oima ging tec hniques suc h as hyperscanning with func- 
tional near-infr ar ed spectr oscopy (fNIRS), electr oencephalog- 
r a phy (EEG), or ma gnetoencephalogr a phy (MEG), to test if the 
br ain-to-br ain neur al activity and connectivity underlying the 
model’s latent processes (e.g. Pan et al., 2023b ) is disorder-specific 
or a ppears domain-gener al. This tightl y r eflects tr ansdia gnostic 
a ppr oac hes, suc h as the Research Domain Criteria (Insel et al., 
2010 ) and The Hier arc hical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (Kotov 
et al., 2017 ), whic h look at neur ocognitiv e computational con- 
structs that underlie a range of diagnostic presentations beyond 
categorical diagnoses. 
Dissociation 
Dissociation is mentioned briefly by Pan et al. ( 2023a ), where they 
define it as a possible consequence of imprecise priors and over- 
weighted sensory evidence causing the false inference that some- 
thing is absent. This definition does not lend dissociation and 
dissociative disorders to being studied with the proposed model. 
Ho w e v er, if we define dissociation as ’a disruption of and/or dis- 
continuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, 
identity, emotion, perception, body r epr esentation, motor con- 
trol, and behavior’ (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 , p. 291) 
(this quote refers originally to the core features of dissociative dis- 
orders), there is more scope for the model. 
People experiencing dissociation may report that they do not 
feel in full control of their actions or that others around them 
feel unreal, though they understand that these feelings are untrue 
(Pienkos & Sass, 2022 ). As the interpersonal computational model 
is designed to estimate the confidence in self and others and the 
weighting of internal and external influences on decisions, it may 
be able to indicate whether these reports translate into actual be- 
haviour. It is also well suited for further exploring the pr e vious 
finding that low confidence in one’s abilities , self-efficacy, ma y 
be instrumental in de v eloping and maintaining dissociation (Ma- 
honey & Benight, 2019 ; ˇCernis et al., 2022 ). 
Double bind situations may be r ele v ant for de v eloping disso- 
ciation also, not just psychosis (Moskowitz & Montirosso, 2018 ), 
and so could bring insights similar to those discussed in the 
sc hizophr enia section. 
Despite the theoretical relevance, there is currently very lim- 
ited r esearc h on dissociation and social coordination, though ini- 
tial work has indicated dissociation is associated with impaired 
inter personal sync hr on y (Nie v es , 2020 ). T his means ther e is m uc h 
room for studies on social coordination in dissociation gener all y, 
and that the interpersonal computational model could become a 
core part of the field. 
Finally, dissociation is a widespread transdiagnostic experience 
(Lyssenko et al., 2018 ) and is found fr equentl y in disorders associ- 
ated with atypical social coordination such as autism spectrum 
disorder (Cerullo et al., 2021 ; Reuben & Parish, 2022 ), attention- 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Endo et al., 2006 ; Matsumoto & 
Imam ur a, 2007 ; Gvirts Pr oblovski et al., 2021 ), and sc hizophr enia 
(O’Driscoll et al., 2014 ; Dean et al., 2021 ). Ther efor e, understanding 
the relation between social coordination and dissociation in isola- 
tion and in other disorders might tease apart contributions to an 
individual’s ov er all pr esentation and pr esent specific tar gets for 
ther a peutic interv ention. 
The interactions between social coordination, dissociation, and 
psychosis may be particularly useful to study given the histori- 
cal (and current) confusion between dissociative and psychotic 
experiences and disorders (Middleton et al., 2018 ; Moskowitz & 
Heim, 2018 ) and given their significant ov erla p in risk factors (Ir- 
win, 1999 ; Kelleher et al., 2013 ; Ter oc k et al., 2016 ; Mosk owitz & 
Montirosso, 2018 ; Stanton et al., 2020 ).

Conclusion 
Attention to interpersonal psychiatry and computational psychi- 
atry is gr owing. P an et al. ( 2023a ) added to this by integrating the 
fields to produce an interpersonal computational model of social 
coordination and a ppl ying it to sc hizophr enia. 
The present Research Highlight built on Pan et al. ( 2023a ) by sum- 
marizing their model, before discussing its applications to other 
ar eas within sc hizophr enia, focusing on the double bind theory. 
Next, it considered how the model could contribute to r esearc h on 
autism spectrum disorder and the debate around the relation be- 
tween autism and sc hizophr enia. The pa per then finished with a 
suggestion of how interpersonal computational psychiatry could 
de v elop our understanding of dissociation and its tr ansdia gnostic 
status. 
Though it only discussed three groups of experiences/disorders, 
the model could be applied to many other issues in psychiatry. Of 
particular r ele v ance ar e other conditions typicall y associated with 
atypical social functioning, such as social anxiety (Alvi et al., 2022 ), 
conduct disor der (Fair child et al., 2019 ), and borderline personal- 
ity disorder (Roe pk e et al., 2013 ). Futur e work should empiricall y 
test this task and model across various clinical conditions to be- 
gin establishing symptom- or disorder-specific parameter profiles. 
These profiles might ultimately be useable in predicting an indi- 
vidual’s disorder and/or subtype (Pan et al., 2023a ). 
While the model is best suited for furthering basic understand- 
ing of a disorder or trait, further work may establish how the 
model can be used in de v eloping ther a peutic or pharmacologi- 
cal interventions. For example, changes in model parameters over 
the course of treatment may be used as a proxy for real-world be- 
havioural impacts and so be a useful and computationally mean- 
ingful outcome measure. In order to be incorporated into clin- 
ical practice, ho w ever, substantial empirical w ork w ould be re- 
quired to demonstrate the model’s reliability in predicting disor- 
ders and/or subtypes and to streamline the implementation of the 
model for use in clinical settings. 
By discussing a handful of potential applications of the pro- 
posed model, this r esearc h highlight aimed to explore the impact 
of Pan et al.’s ( 2023a ) paper and to advocate the combination of in- 
terpersonal and computational approaches for studying neurode- 
velopmental and psychiatric experiences. It suggests the model 
and wider a ppr oac h ar e indeed useful in a range of contexts, but 
that the model is not suited to all issues in psychiatry and further 
work is r equir ed particularl y to pr epar e the model for clinical ap- 
plication.
