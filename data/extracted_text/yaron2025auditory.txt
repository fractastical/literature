Abstract 
Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals 
a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a 
negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that spe-
cific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive 
prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, 
what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This 
information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we 
record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm 
where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We iden-
tify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with 
evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key character-
istics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these 
neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing 
an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit 
model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively 
reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lat-
eral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across 
receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.
Introduction
Predictive coding, a theoretical framework that explains how the brain processes 
sensory information, posits that the brain generates predictions based on prior 
experiences and compares them with actual sensory inputs [1–5]. The discrepancy

between the predicted and actual input, known as the prediction error, is used to 
update the brain’s internal models. This process is thought to occur through canoni-
cal circuits, hierarchically organized neural networks where top–down predictions and 
bottom–up prediction errors create a feedback loop that allows the brain to refine its 
models.
Recent work suggested that positive prediction errors, occurring when the actual 
input exceeds the predicted input, and negative prediction errors, occurring when the 
actual input is less than the predicted input, are calculated in separate populations of 
neurons within these canonical circuits [6–9]. While extensive research has investi-
gated positive prediction errors using the oddball paradigm and its variations [10–18] 
these studies face significant limitations. Specifically, oddball responses consist of 
more than just positive prediction errors. First, they also contain sensory signals, 
which are often hard to disentangle. Additionally, a deviant stimulus also represents 
the omission of the standard stimulus, thereby generating a negative prediction 
error, which further complicates the interpretation. In contrast, responses to omitted 
expected stimuli do not contain sensory input and could directly represent nega-
tive error signals, potentially offering a crucial step in elucidating the computation of 
prediction errors. Omission responses have been observed in human studies [19–24] 
and more recently in single neurons within the visual and auditory cortices [7,9,25–28]. 
However, omission responses could arise from processes other than predictive coding 
and may not necessarily represent negative prediction errors. Therefore, it is crucial 
to characterize the information encoded in these responses to confirm their functional 
role and investigate how they might arise from the interactions between prediction and 
sensory signals, an area that remains largely unexplored.
To address this, we investigated how neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond to 
the omission of expected auditory stimuli while manipulating their predictability. We 
use high-resolution extracellular recordings to simultaneously record activity from 
a large population of neurons across multiple cortical layers, while presenting tone 
sequences where the probability of tone presentations was systematically varied. We 
identified a subset of auditory neurons that exhibit two key characteristics of negative 
prediction-error encoding. First, the neurons displayed omission responses whose 
intensity was directly correlated with the statistical likelihood of specific omitted tones, 
demonstrating a quantitative representation of the prediction error. Second, these 
neurons exhibited omission responses that built up from trial to trial, reflecting pre-
dictions established by the accumulation of evidence through repeated exposure to 
the stimuli. These neurons, which we named “Probability Encoding Omission Neu-
rons” (PEONs), were primarily found in the granular and supragranular layers of the 
auditory cortex and were distributed across different auditory fields including primary 
auditory cortex (A1), ventral auditory field (VAF), and anterior auditory field (AAF), 
with a significantly higher proportion observed in A1.
Interestingly, while PEONs showed selective responses to omissions, they 
responded broadly to tones, highlighting an asymmetry between the processing of 
top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory signals. To explain these dynamics, 
we propose a novel circuit model that includes separate negative and positive error 
which permits unrestricted use, distribution, 
and reproduction in any medium, provided the

calculations within narrowly tuned auditory streams, with prediction error neurons laterally interconnected between adja-
cent streams. This architecture not only accounts for the observed asymmetry and probability encoding in sensory pro-
cessing but also demonstrates how lateral connections can enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction-encoding, a 
concept supported by the free energy principle [1,3]. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of negative 
prediction error neurons in the auditory cortex and propose a circuit-level hypothesis for how these errors might be com-
puted and integrated within cortical microcircuits.
Results
Neuronal responses during auditory omission paradigm
In this study, we focused on the right auditory cortex of Urethane-anesthetized rats, utilizing extracellular recordings to 
monitor responses to auditory stimuli. Across 18 electrode penetrations involving 10 rats, we successfully captured the 
activity of 990 single units. For each rat, we first used a surface microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) 
(Fig 1A) to map the various parts of the auditory cortex (Fig 1B) [29–31]. We then used a Neuropixels electrode array to 
record different layers of the chosen area for each penetration (Fig 1C).
To explore the neural response to auditory stimuli and their omission, we devised eight experimental conditions 
(Fig 1D). Each condition featured an oddball sequence of two tones with distinct probabilities, along with a consistent

occurrence of tone omissions at a rate of 5%. To create varied prediction contents while maintaining a fixed omission rate, 
we utilized two tones and controlled their relative predictability. We selected two distinct pure tones (denoted as Tones 
A and B), one octave apart, that consistently elicited responses from most neurons for each penetration (see details in 
“Methods”). The sequences were systematically designed but presented in a random order. Each sequence comprised 
1,000 stimulus items, including omissions, and featured Tones A and B at varying probabilities to achieve distinct levels of 
predictability. The specific ratios of Tones A and B were carefully controlled as follows: 95% Tone A and 0% Tone B (exclu-
sively Tone A), 90% and 5%, 85% and 10%, and 75% and 20%. This pattern continued, adjusting further to 20% and 75%, 
10% and 85%, 5% and 90%, until reaching 0% and 95% (exclusively Tone B).
We observed diverse patterns of neural responses to omissions. Fig 1E and 1F illustrate responses from three exem-
plary neurons to tone omissions during two distinct tone sequences: one with 95% Tone A and 5% omissions, and the 
other with 95% Tone B and 5% omissions. Some neurons exhibited strong responses when either tone was presented but 
did not respond to their omission (Fig 1E), and some neurons displayed selective responses to the absence of specific 
tones, with the intensity and nature of these responses varying depending on which tone was omitted (Fig 1F).
Omission responses encode tone probability
To determine whether omission responses encode negative prediction errors, we investigated how neurons’ responses 
to omissions were modulated by the predictability of the omitted stimuli. For neurons encoding negative prediction errors, 
their response should correlate with the content of the prediction. In our experimental design, the content is determined by 
the probabilities of the two tones, which is equivalent to the probability of one tone, since their total is fixed at 95%. There-
fore, we first evaluated which neurons’ omission response correlated with the probability of tone presentation. The omis-
sion response was defined as the neuron’s mean firing rate during a 5–120 ms window after the omission, with a local 
baseline subtracted on a per-trial basis. This baseline was calculated as the mean firing rate from –24 to 5 ms relative to 
the expected tone onset, capturing the neuron’s state just before the tone was omitted [32]. We then computed the Spear-
man’s correlation between each neuron’s average omission response under each condition and the corresponding proba-
bility of tone presentation (either Tone A or B). For each neuron, the tone whose omission response increased with higher 
probability was designated the “omission preferred” (OP) tone, while the other was termed the “omission non- preferred” 
(ONP) tone. Under this definition, the correlation coefficients measured against the OP tone were all positive, unlike those 
measured against the ONP tone, which would be negative.
Next, we examined whether distinct groups exist based on how strongly each neuron’s omission response correlated 
with predictability of the OP tone. To achieve this, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients and 
used an unbiased elbow analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (see details in “Methods”). The elbow 
analysis revealed that it is optimal to cluster the data into two distinct neuronal subpopulations (see the elbow analysis in 
S1 Fig): one comprising 771 neurons with little or no modulation of omission responses by tone probability (mean Spear-
man’s ρ = 0.048), and a second comprising 219 neurons exhibiting a robust positive correlation (mean ρ = 0.18) (Fig 2A).
Fig 2B illustrates the omission responses of two example neurons across eight different conditions. These range from 
scenarios with 0% OP tone (95% ONP and 5% omission) to scenarios with 95% OP tone (0% ONP and 5% omission). The 
peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), aligned to the expected onset of the omitted tone, have been baseline-subtracted 
to isolate the omission response. Neuron 1 (from Cluster 1 in Fig 2A) exhibited only a weak correlation (Spearman’s 
ρ = 0.12), while Neuron 2 (from Cluster 2) showed a pronounced increase in omission response as the probability of the 
OP tone increased (rho = 0.36).
To further examine these PEONs without introducing double-dipping biases, we conducted a split-data analysis by 
dividing trials into two independent subsets (odd and even trials, denoted as ODD and EVEN trials) to ensure the robust-
ness of our analyses. All PEONs were identified using only one half (e.g., ODD) and subsequently tested on the com-
plementary half (e.g., EVEN), ensuring that selection and evaluation were fully independent. Using the ODD trials, we

correlation. (D) Box plot summarizing omission responses for PEONODD, tested on EVEN trials. The x-axis represents the OP tone probability (0%–95%),

identified 123 PEONs according to two criteria: (1) a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between their omission responses 
and the probability of the corresponding OP tone, as verified by Spearman’s correlation test; and (2) a significant omission 
response (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign‐rank test) to this OP tone in the four conditions where it was presented as standard 
(75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), when the OP tone is most predictable and omission responses should be greatest (see 
details in “Methods”). We refer to these PEONs as PEONODD. To confirm the reliability of our selection criteria and ensure 
that the identified neurons were not specific to one trial subset, we applied the same classification procedure to the EVEN 
trials, identifying a separate group of PEONs referred to as PEONEVEN. For additional comparison, maximizing statistical 
power and evaluating probability encoding without trial-based data splitting, we identified PEONALL, a group classified 
using all available trials.
Out of a total of 990 neurons, we identified 123 (13%) PEONODD, 60 neurons (6%) showed correlation with probability 
but no omission response, and 807 neurons (82%) showed no correlation (Fig 2C, top). On the other hand, when using 
the EVEN trials, 145 neurons were classified as PEONEVEN, 69 showed correlation but no response, and 776 showed no 
correlation. Although the precise numbers varied slightly between subsets, the classification proportions were broadly 
similar, supporting the robustness of the procedure. To assess consistency more directly, we quantified the overlap 
between the two independently identified PEON subsets. A total of 61 neurons were classified as PEONs in both ODD 
and EVEN trial sets, significantly exceeding the overlap expected by chance (expected: 18 neurons; hypergeometric test, 
p << 0.001). This result supports the stability of the classification approach, even when applied to trial-split subsets with 
reduced statistical power. For comparison, when using all trials without splitting, 200 neurons were classified as PEON-
ALL, 70 showed correlation but no response, and 720 showed no correlation. Pie charts for both PEONEVEN and PEONALL 
classifications are shown in S2 Fig.
Fig 2D presents a box plot that aggregates the omission response of all PEONODD on EVEN trials. To quantify the rela-
tionship between omission response and OP tone probability, we performed a direct Spearman’s correlation analysis using 
all individual neuron data points, which revealed a significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ρ = 0.34, p = 1.6 × 10−27, 
n = 984, representing 123 neurons × 8 probability conditions). The strength of this relationship indicates that neural 
responses systematically increase as the probability of the OP tone increases, providing strong evidence that these neu-
rons encode stimulus probability.
This significant relationship confirmed the robustness of the probability-encoding property, which is likewise replicated 
in the analysis of PEONEVEN on ODD trials and PEONALL using all trials (see S2 Fig). From here onward, we present the 
results from the PEONODD group. Equivalent analyses for PEONEVEN and PEONALL are provided in the S2–S5 Figs to fur-
ther support the robustness and generalizability of our findings.
Spatial distribution of PEONs in auditory cortex
To investigate the anatomical basis of predictive coding in the auditory system, we analyzed the laminar and areal distri-
bution of PEONODD. We used current source density (CSD) analysis of local field potential (LFP) responses to determine 
cortical layer depths and categorized neurons into layers based on established criteria (see “Methods”). Fig 2E illustrates 
are shown as overlaid dots, with means at each probability level marked by red diamonds connected by a dashed line. The text annotation shows the 
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rho) and associated p-value, quantifying the strength and statistical significance of the monotonic relationship 
between probability and neural response. Underlying data are provided in S1 Data. (E) Laminar distribution of the recorded population (gray bars) and 
the neurons classified as PEONODD (blue bars), shown as a function of cortical depth (y‐axis). Horizontal dashed lines indicate the approximate bound-
aries between supragranular (0–600 μm), granular (600–900 μm), and infragranular (900–1,400 μm) layers, based on current source density analysis. 
(F) Distribution of PEONs across auditory cortical fields. Three pie charts illustrate the proportion of PEONs (blue slice) vs. other recorded neurons (gray

the total number of neurons recorded in that specific field (indicated in the title of each chart). The p-value shown below reflects the result of a bootstrap 
analysis comparing the observed PEON count in each area to a simulated null distribution; the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05).

the distribution of these neurons across cortical depths, demonstrating that PEONODD are distributed across all cortical lay-
ers, with a higher proportion found in the supragranular (16.2%) and granular (13.4%) layers compared to the infragranu-
lar layers (9.8%). A similar distribution was also discovered from PEONEVEN and PEONALL (see S3 Fig).
To assess whether these distributions differed significantly from a random distribution, we performed a two-sided 
bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. The analysis revealed a marginal trend in the supragranular layer (p = 0.058) 
and a significant difference in the infragranular layer (p = 0.029), whereas the granular layer did not show a significant 
deviation (p = 0.62). Further examination of these results indicated that PEONs were present at a lower-than-expected 
rate in the infragranular layer. We similarly examined neuron distribution across different auditory fields, summarized in 
Fig 2F, using bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. This analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of PEONs 
in A1 (p = 0.0036), whereas VAF (p = 0.9442) and AAF (p = 0.9926) did not show significant deviations from the distribution 
expected under the null hypothesis. Further examination suggested that PEONs were present at a higher-than-expected 
rate specifically in A1 relative to the other auditory fields.
Omission responses build up throughout the trials
To confirm that PEONs encode negative prediction errors, it is essential to show that their responses to omissions 
increase over time as predictions are gradually formed, reflecting a growing discrepancy between the predicted and actual 
outcomes. We analyzed PEONODD from EVEN trials and focused on omissions of the OP tone in sequences where it was 
the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), and therefore expected to evoke the largest omission responses. We grouped 
these responses by their sequence position and computed the mean firing rate (±standard error) for each bin. This group-
ing tests whether the omission response increases as more tones precede the omission, which is the expected pattern if 
these neurons are indeed signaling a negative prediction error that strengthens with increasing prediction.
Our analysis revealed a notable pattern: the magnitude of the PEONs response to these omissions progressively 
increased throughout the sequence, achieving a steady state or plateau after approximately 400 standards were pre-
sented (Fig 3A). The dynamics of the trial-by-trial omission response were fitted by a logistic growth curve, expressed as:
 FR(n)= 4.95
1+e–0.012∗(n–223.28) 
where FR(n) represents the firing rate as a function of n, and n is the bin center corresponding to the sequence position 
of the omissions (i.e., the number of tones presented preceding each omission). The logistic function depicts a saturating 
increase in response magnitude. Here, an R2 value of 0.51 indicates the model’s moderate success in capturing the vari-
ability in responses. To demonstrate that the observed increase in omission response was not caused by gradual changes 
in network activation over time, we also examined how PEONs responded to standard tones over the first 50 trials (Fig 
3B). The results indicated a rapid decline in response intensity over successive trials. This decay was fitted using an expo-
nential decay model:
 FR(n)= 2 .91 + 396.36 ∗ e–2.25∗n
 
where FR(n) is the firing rate at trial n. An R2 value of 0.75, indicating a substantial fit to the data. As expected, this encap-
sulates the phenomenon of stimulus-specific adaptation or a decrease in positive prediction error, where the response to 
an expected stimulus diminishes rapidly. These trends were consistent also for PEONEVEN during ODD trials and PEONALL 
over all trials (see S4 Fig).
PEONs selectively respond to omissions while broadly reacting to tones
Finally, we investigated whether PEONs are exclusively responsive to omissions or if they also react to tone stimuli. The 
population responses of PEONODD from EVEN trials revealed a pronounced asymmetry in omission and tone responses

(Fig 4A, top). Omission responses showed tone selectivity based on probability: as described before for PEONODD, the 
response strength systematically increased with the probability of the OP tone. In contrast, tone-evoked responses for 
both OP and ONP tones exhibited an inverse relationship with probability. Specifically, the response to the OP tone (blue 
line) decreased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = –0.19, p = 2.1 × 10−8, n = 861, representing 123 
neurons × 7 probability conditions), showing adaptation to the increasingly standard OP tone (Fig 4A, bottom). Similarly, 
the response to the ONP tone (orange line) increased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = 0.20, 
p = 6.7 × 10−9, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), which means it also shows an inverse rela-
tionship with probability, but with respect to the ONP tone’s own decreasing probability, reflecting deviant detection of the 
increasingly rare ONP tone. In essence, PEONs selectively signal negative prediction errors only for OP tone omissions, 
while their responses to both tones exhibit symmetrical adaptation to the standard tone and deviant detection of the devi-
ant tone, without tone-specific selectivity in the direction of probability modulation.
When examining individual neurons, we found that, as expected from the definition of PEONs, their omission 
responses were highly selective. A substantial proportion of PEONs detected the absence of one tone while responding 
to both. This is illustrated in Fig 4B, which shows the responses on EVEN trials of an example PEONODD. This neuron’s 
omission response (left column) increased with OP probability, exhibiting robust firing at high probabilities (90%–95%). 
Despite its selective omission response, it showed significant responses to both OP tone (center column) and ONP tone 
(right column), especially when the tone probabilities were low (5%–10%).
To ensure that the selectivity observed in omission responses is not merely due to residual effects from the previous tri-
al’s tone responses—such as lingering activity or altered baseline activity—we verified that omission selectivity is indepen-
dent of tone selectivity. To do this, we measured the omission selectivity index (OSI) and the tone selectivity index (TSI) 
for each PEON (see details in “Methods”). The results showed no significant correlation between OSI and TSI across the

PEON population (Spearman’s ρ = –0.03, p = 0.78, n = 123 neurons). This lack of correlation indicates that a PEON’s pref-
erence for a specific tone (e.g., Tone A over Tone B) does not predict its preference for the omission of that tone. There-
fore, omission selectivity was not a residual effect from the previous trials.
To quantify this selectivity across the population, we examined how many PEONs exhibited significant omission 
responses under different conditions. Out of 123 PEONODD, 90 demonstrated significant OP-omission responses in EVEN 
trials (with an additional 5 showing significant responses only to ONP omissions). Of these 90 neurons with OP omission 
responses, 59 (66%) were selective for OP omissions, whereas 31 (34%) were non-selective, exhibiting significant omis-
sion responses for both tones (Fig 4C, left). To further characterize the omission-selective group, we examined their

into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant 
omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone 
responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither.

responses to tone presentations to determine whether they responded exclusively to one tone or to both (Fig 4C, right), 
41 (or 69%) exhibited significant responses to both the OP and ONP tones across experimental conditions (see details in 
“Methods”). Additionally, 3 PEONs responded exclusively to the OP tone, 9 solely to the ONP tone, and 6 did not signifi-
cantly respond to either tone.
Similar trends in tone responses were observed when validating PEONEVEN validated on ODD trials and in PEONALL 
(see S5 Fig). In both cases, most omission-selective neurons responded to both tones, while smaller subsets responded 
exclusively to one tone or to neither. This consistency across datasets further supports the robustness of the omission 
response selectivity and its relationship to tone-evoked activity. In summary, these characteristic responses—observed in 
a considerable subpopulation of individual PEONs, which are selective for omissions but broadly responsive to tones—
mirror the population responses and indicate an intriguing functional asymmetry. This raises the question of how computa-
tional principles and circuitry give rise to this phenomenon.
Neural circuit model for asymmetric predictive-coding processing
To further understand how PEONs, which we presume to be negative prediction-error neurons, can display this observed 
asymmetry in top–down and bottom–up processing, we developed a neural circuit model consisting of multiple streams 
within a “predictive-coding module” (Fig 5A). This model was based on the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic- 
Flogel, which describes a circuit module that integrates negative prediction error computation [6].
Each predictive-coding module includes six leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons divided into two streams: one stream 
calculates the positive prediction error and upregulates the prediction, while the other stream calculates the negative 
prediction error and downregulates the prediction. A sensory neuron (denoted as I) receives the sensory signal and 
propagates the information in a bottom–up manner. In contrast, a prediction neuron (P) receives the prediction signal and 
propagates the information in a top–down manner. A positive prediction-error neuron (PE+) receives excitatory synaptic 
input from the sensory neuron and is suppressed by the prediction neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I+). Conversely, 
a negative prediction-error neuron (PE–) receives excitatory synaptic input from the prediction neuron and is suppressed 
by the sensory neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I–). All synaptic connections are static synapses that include three 
variables: synaptic weight, time constant, and synaptic delay (see details in “Methods”). The activity of PE+ enhances the 
prediction signal through excitatory analog feedback, while the activity of PE– suppresses the prediction signal via inhibi-
tory analog feedback.
In our simulation, the sensory signal was designed to replicate the experiment, featuring an analog pulse stimulus with 
an intensity of S_strength (ranging between 0 and 1) and a duration of 20 ms, delivered with a stimulus onset asynchrony 
(SOA) of 150 ms (see Fig 5B, top). Conversely, the prediction signal was modeled as a similar analog pulse as the sen-
sory signal, but varied in intensity (P_strength), which could be enhanced by excitatory feedback from PE+ or diminished 
by inhibitory feedback from PE– (Fig 5B, bottom). It is important to recognize that our model assumes the temporal profile 
of the prediction signal is learned through a separate mechanism, while the predictive-coding module adjusts only the 
signal’s magnitude based on prediction error.
Predictive coding modules from different streams, each processing a specific frequency according to a tonotopic 
organization, are interconnected through lateral excitatory synaptic connections. These connections run from PE+ of one 
module to PE– of another (as illustrated between streams A and B in Fig 5C). Intuitively, this setup enables PEONs, repre-
sented as PE–, in one stream to respond to stimuli in another stream, endowing them with a broader bottom–up receptive 
field. Moreover, this configuration allows an unexpected stimulus in one stream to inhibit the predictive signal in other 
streams. For example, as shown in Fig 5C, if the sensory signal in Stream B is unexpected, PE+ in Stream B will activate, 
causing PE– in Stream A to also activate through the lateral connection. This activation will then suppress the predictive 
signal in Stream A. Thus, when an unexpected Tone B is detected, indicating that Tone A (or other tones) is unlikely, the 
prediction for Tone A (or other tones) is consequently reduced. Conversely, since the absence of an expected Tone B does

not necessarily suggest the presence of Tone A (or other tones), our model does not include lateral connections running 
from PE– to PE+.
Our comprehensive model includes five streams: Stream 2 is tuned to detect the OP tone (Tone A), while Stream 4 
detects the ONP tone (Tone B) (see Fig 5D). The model incorporates a simple receptive field structure for sensory signals. 
Specifically, Stream 2 receives Tone A at full strength (S_strength = 1), whereas the adjacent Streams 1 and 3 receive 
Tone A at half strength (S_strength = 0.5). Similarly, Stream 4 receives Tone B at full strength, and the adjacent Streams 3 
and 5 receive Tone B at half strength. Additionally, the model features lateral excitatory connections between streams that 
are distance-specific (Fig 5E). The synaptic delay between any two streams is proportional to their spatial separation, and 
the synaptic weight decreases with the inverse square of their distance (see more details in “Methods”).

Asymmetric activities in modelled PEON
We conducted multiple simulations using the model, each featuring unique probability combinations of tones A and B, 
along with a consistent 5% omission rate, mirroring the conditions of our rodent experiments. Each simulation included 
500 stimuli—either tone A, B, or an omission (O)—across a total of 75 s. Importantly, every simulation began with no initial 
predictions across all streams (P_strength = 0).
Here, we demonstrate the model’s responses using the example where the sensory inputs consist of 90% A, 5% B, and 
5% O, randomly ordered as shown in Fig 6A. The spiking activities of Neurons I, P, PE+, and PE− across the five streams 
are illustrated in Fig 6B. Notably, Neuron P began firing after a few seconds, particularly in Streams 1–3, which are 
responsive to Tone A. This activity indicated that the prediction for Tone A was beginning to be established. Consequently,

the positive prediction error, reflected by PE+’s spiking activity, began to diminish. Additionally, the spiking activity of PE−, 
primarily associated with the omission of Tone A, was also observed in Streams 4 and 5. This was largely due to lateral 
connections from PE+ in Streams 1–3. The prediction signals across the five streams, detailed in Fig 6C, show that P_
strength increased and plateaued in Streams 1–3, caused by PE+’s firing, with Stream 2 displaying the highest value.
To explore asymmetric predictive-coding processing, we focused on the PEON in Stream 2, the target neuron for mod-
eling our experimental results. Our goal was to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetry: selective responses to 
omissions of the preferred tone, but broad responses to both tones. The raster plots of this PEON, presented in Fig 6D for 
a simulation containing 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, characterize responses to different stimuli: Tones A, B, and omissions O. 
The PSTH reveals that while the PEON consistently responded to omissions, it did not respond to Tone A (in later trials), 
which was anticipated. Importantly, the PEON did respond to Tone B, a response enabled by lateral connections. In Fig 
6E, we present raster plots from a different simulation with 5% A, 90% B, and 5% O. Similar to the previous simulation, the 
PEON in Stream 2 responded to Tone B via lateral connections. It also reacted to Tone A, facilitated by the lateral con-
nections from nearby Streams 1 and 3, where PE+ was activated by the deviant Tone A. Notably, there was no response 
to omissions, as the prediction in Stream A was not effectively established due to the minimal occurrence of only 5% A. In 
conclusion, the PEON in Stream 2 demonstrated the asymmetry of receptive fields in bottom–up sensory and top–down 
predictive processing, reflecting the findings in the rodent experiment.
Note that this asymmetry requires that the weights of the lateral excitatory connections from nearby neurons (as shown 
in Fig 5E) exceed the inhibitory weights within the module (see S1 Table). This setup ensures that sensory inputs from 
the neighboring streams can overcome inhibition to elicit a response on PEONs. When the number of lateral neighbor 
neurons increases (there are only two in our model), reduced excitatory weights can remain effective. Furthermore, we 
believe these lateral connections could be activity-dependent (e.g., via spike-timing-dependent plasticity) and further 
refined through self-organization. However, this lies beyond the scope of our current study.
Alternative models and evaluation
To assess the validity of the proposed model with lateral connections (the model labeled “Lateral PE+ to PE–”), we eval-
uated two alternative models and compared their predictions against the experimental data. The alternatives included: 
a model with lateral connections from Neuron I to PE– across different streams (termed “Lateral I to PE–”, depicted in 
Fig 7A), and a model with no lateral connections at all (referred to as “No lateral”). For each model, we measured the 
responses of the PEON in Stream 2 to Tones A, B, and omission O under different probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)): from 
0% (95% B and 5%O) to 95% (0% B and 5%O). The results are shown in Fig 7B, together with the correlation between 
the firing rate and Prob(A).
In our proposed model, the PEON’s response to omission significantly correlated with Prob(A) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.79, 
p = 2.1 × 10−108, n = 500 trials; see “Methods” for further details), indicating that the PEON did encode the probability of 
the stimulus within its stream. For Tone A, the PEON exhibited reduced responses as Prob(A) increased, demonstrating 
a significant negative correlation between firing rate and Prob(A) (r = –0.73, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). This occurred 
because PE+ in nearby Streams 1 and 3 detected less surprise at higher Prob(A) values, leading to less activation of the 
PEON in Stream 2 through lateral connections (as also noted in Fig 5E). Conversely, for Tone B, the PEON’s response 
positively correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-250, n = 4,750 trials). At higher Prob(A) values, Tone B emerged as the 
deviant tone. This led to an enhanced detection of surprise by PE+ near Stream 4 for Tone B, which subsequently acti-
vated the PEON in Stream 2 more strongly through lateral connections.
In the alternative “Lateral I to PE–” model, the PEON’s response to omission was also correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.82, 
p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 500 trials). For Tone A, unlike the proposed model, the PEON in Stream 2 did not exhibit decreased 
responses at high Prob(A) values. This occurred because the PEON directly received sensory input from Neuron I, which 
remained unchanged across different Prob(A) settings. Despite this, a positive correlation between the firing rate and 

PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242 June 18, 2025 14 / 30
Prob(A) was observed (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 4,750 trials). This was due to slightly increased responses from Neuron 
I in nearby Streams 1 and 3, which were caused by an elevated membrane potential resulting from frequent stimulation by 
Tone A. Conversely, for Tone B, the opposite effect occurred: Neuron I near Stream 4 showed an increase in membrane 
potential due to frequent stimulation of Tone B at low Prob(A) levels. Therefore, despite only minor changes in firing rate 
across different Prob(A) values, a negative correlation was observed (r = –0.42, p = 3.5 × 10−204, n = 4,750 trials).
In the alternative “No lateral” model, the PEON’s response to omission correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.38, p = 9.2e−19, 
n = 500 trials), as this encoding occurs within the stream without the need for lateral connections. For Tone A, the PEON 
displayed no responses, which was anticipated since it could only react to an omission in the absence of lateral connec-
tions. For Tone B, the PEON exhibited similar responses as to omissions, since in Stream 2, any stimulation differing 
from Tone A was treated as an omission. Consequently, a similar positive correlation was observed (r = 0.58, p < 1 × 10−250, 
n = 4,750 trials).
To validate these models, each demonstrating unique encoding characteristics, we compared them to data from our 
rodent experiment. In our analysis, Tones A and B corresponded to the OP and ONP Tones, respectively. The correlation 
patterns we observed in our experimental data (see Fig 4A) align closely with the predictions of our proposed model. 
The positive correlation for omission responses, negative correlation for responses to OP tone, and positive correlation 
for responses to ONP tone are all successfully captured by the model with lateral PE+ to PE− connections. These results 
support the proposed model with its lateral connections facilitating positive prediction errors, distinguishing it from the 
alternative models.
The models discussed so far have not taken into account that the strength of sensory signals could diminish due to 
frequent exposure to a specific stimulus. To address this, we analyzed responses from neurons in the thalamus (n = 130 
neurons) across various probabilities of the OP Tone (see S6A Fig and “Methods” for details). Accordingly, we modeled the 
sensory signal strength, S_strength, as a function of Prob(A) (S6B Fig) and conducted simulations. By simulating various

levels of sensory adaptation (see “Methods”), our results reaffirmed that only the proposed model successfully replicated 
the probability encoding characteristics observed in the rodent data (S6C Fig).
Computational benefits of lateral connections
Our next step was to explore the potential computational benefits of the proposed lateral connections, particularly in terms 
of enhancing prediction encoding. How do these connections influence prediction signals? Without lateral connections, not 
only would Stream 2 predict Tone A, but also the neighboring streams (e.g., Stream 1), due to their broad sensory recep-
tive fields receiving half-strength sensory signals. However, with lateral connections, these predictions are reduced not 
only by the omission of Tone A but also by the presence of Tone B. Particularly, we theorized that this additional reduction 
would suppress the already low prediction signals in the neighboring streams. This leads to a scenario where the predic-
tion signal is predominantly strong in Stream 2, thus resulting in a more precise encoding of Prob(A) across streams.
To test this, we first assessed the steady value of P_strength after the prediction signal stabilized across various stimu-
lation sequences (as in Fig 6C). These sequences varied Prob(A) from 0% to 95%, with increments of 1%. In Fig 8A, we 
plotted the time courses of P_strength for each 75-s simulation under different Prob(A) settings, focusing on Stream 2, 
where our target PEON was situated, and the adjacent Stream 1. For comparison, the time courses for Streams 1 and 2 in 
the model without lateral connections (“No lateral”) are shown in Fig 8B. The steady value of P_strength was determined

by averaging values over the last 50 s (from 25 to 75 s). It was plotted as a function of Prob(A) for both models, with 
and without lateral connections, across Streams 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig 8C). In both streams, P_strength increased 
as Prob(A) rose. However, the increase was less pronounced in the model with lateral connections, especially at lower 
Prob(A) values. We further analyzed the contrast in P_strength between Streams 1 and 2 by calculating the decibel value 
(logarithmic ratio of P_strength in Stream 2 to that in Stream 1). This contrast was significantly greater in the model with 
lateral connections compared to the model without, particularly when Prob(A) was less than 0.5 (Fig 8D). This suggested 
that the lateral connections enhance the contrast of prediction signals across streams.
We also hypothesized that the additional suppression of prediction signals facilitated by lateral connections could 
enhance prediction encoding efficiency. This is supported by the observation that P_strength was generally lower with lat-
eral connections (as shown in Fig 8C). To investigate this further, we measured P_strength across Prob(A) for all streams 
in both models (Fig 8E) and then calculated the average P_strength across streams for each Prob(A) setting (Fig 8F). The 
findings suggest that with lateral connections, the network requires less “energy” or smaller prediction signals to effectively 
encode sequences, particularly in less predictable scenarios where the occurrences of Tones A and B are equal, such as 
Prob(A) = 0.5. This demonstrates a more efficient encoding strategy. Conversely, without lateral connections, the network 
expends more energy to manage more unpredictable sequences.
Discussion
This study aimed to understand how negative prediction-error neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond. We combined 
electrophysiological recordings with computational modeling to demonstrate an asymmetry in prediction-error signaling, 
which we attribute to “lateral prediction suppression” where positive and negative prediction errors interact through lateral 
connections to enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding.
Auditory omission responses as correlates of negative prediction error
Omission paradigms are a powerful tool for isolating negative prediction-error signals, as they eliminate the confound -
ing influence of sensory input present in positive prediction error paradigms (e.g., oddball sequences). In human stud -
ies using EEG and MEG, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to unexpected omissions in tone sequences have 
been reported, which are interpreted as evidence for predictive coding mechanisms [ 17,20,22–24,33]. More recently, 
single-neuron recordings in animals have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying these auditory predic -
tion errors. Studies have reported omission-responsive neurons in the auditory cortex of both awake and anesthetized 
rodents. One study found that 35.6% of neurons in awake animals and 19.5% of neurons in anesthetized rats and mice 
exhibited significant responses to the omission of expected tones [ 34,35]. Another study, using more complex stimuli 
involving the omission of expected gaps within auditory sequences, also demonstrated robust omission responses in 
unanesthetized rats [25]. Alongside these auditory findings, multiple studies in mouse visual cortex have documented 
sensorimotor prediction-error signals, specifically negative prediction errors, in response to unexpected reductions in 
expected sensory input [7,36,37]. These studies demonstrate that neurons in V1 exhibit negative mismatch responses 
when expected visual flow is weakened or omitted during locomotion. A molecularly distinct population of neurons in 
V1 has been identified that selectively responds to unexpected omissions of predicted visual stimuli [ 9] Extending this 
sensorimotor framework to the auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the auditory cortex responded to 
unexpected reductions in movement-contingent sound within a virtual reality environment, signaling a negative prediction 
error [28]. Building upon this foundation, our study’s conceptual advance stems from our paradigm design that systemati -
cally varies tone probabilities while maintaining consistent omission rates, allowing us to characterize negative prediction 
error as a continuous, probability-encoding mechanism rather than simply a binary deviance detector. This approach 
also reveals the dynamic nature of these prediction signals, which develop gradually through repeated exposure to sta -
tistical patterns in the environment. The subsequent sections will explore how these findings, along with our observations

of asymmetry in predictive processing, led us to develop a circuit-level model that offers a new perspective on informa -
tion flow in predictive coding networks.
Top–down “predictive field”
Our model builds upon the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes predictive coding as a canon-
ical cortical computation [6]. Their model emphasizes hierarchical processing with distinct neuron populations computing 
positive and negative prediction errors. Consistent with this framework, our findings provide evidence for both types of 
prediction error in the rat auditory cortex. While we focused on characterizing negative prediction errors in PEONs, we 
also observed oddball responses in the broader population of non-PEON neurons (S7 Fig), with enhanced responses to 
unexpected tones. Since such responses have been interpreted as positive prediction-error signals in previous studies, 
we infer that at least some of these neurons encode positive prediction error [16,18,38–41]. More importantly, our model 
additionally describes how predictive coding modules, which process bidirectional information, interact both vertically and 
horizontally across sensory streams. This provides a means for prediction errors to integrate across bottom–up recep-
tive fields. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is also a receptive field for top–down signaling. Traditionally, a neuron’s 
receptive field is defined by the range of external stimuli that can directly evoke its activity, a concept rooted in bottom–up 
sensory processing. However, neurons like PEONs are influenced not only by bottom–up sensory input but also by predic-
tion signals generated in other brain areas. Therefore, their effective response properties – what we might term their “pre-
dictive field” – are shaped also by the specificity of the prediction. We believe that the asymmetry between the bottom–up 
receptive field and the top–down predictive field provides a means to integrate predictions and prediction errors, and that 
it could be inverted (i.e., a larger predictive field than receptive field) at other hierarchical levels.
Lateral connections in predictive coding networks
Our circuit model proposes that unexpected stimuli in one frequency stream inhibit predictive signals in adjacent streams 
via lateral prediction suppression. This enhances the contrast between the predicted frequency and others, sharpen-
ing the prediction signal and facilitating more efficient updates to the internal model, conceptually analogous to lateral 
 inhibition in sensory systems, which serves to enhance the contrast of bottom–up sensory input [42]. That is, the lateral 
prediction suppression we propose for the top–down predictive field is functionally analogous to lateral inhibition in the 
bottom–up receptive field.
Biological evidence strongly supports the existence of excitatory lateral connections between adjacent frequency channels 
in A1. These connections play a crucial role in spectral integration and the processing of complex auditory stimuli [43–45]. 
Anatomical studies have revealed that pyramidal neurons in A1 exhibit long-range horizontal collaterals that form connec-
tions across different frequency representations, often aligning with isofrequency bands [46,47]. Physiological investiga-
tions have demonstrated that these intracortical pathways contribute significantly to the breadth of subthreshold frequency 
receptive fields, which can span up to five octaves [48,49]. The strength and probability of these connections are distance- 
dependent, with stronger and more probable connections between neurons tuned to close frequencies, weakening as the 
frequency distance increases [50,51]. This organized network of lateral connections facilitates the integration of spectral 
information across different frequency channels, supporting complex auditory processing and cortical plasticity in A1.
Similar patterns of lateral connectivity have been observed in other sensory modalities, such as orientation-specific 
connections in visual cortex [52] and whisker-related connections in somatosensory barrel cortex [53], suggesting a com-
mon organizational principle across different sensory areas. The development of these lateral connections might involve 
both innate and learned components. While the basic framework of these connections may be genetically predetermined, 
their refinement occurs during early postnatal development through experience-dependent plasticity [54]. This devel-
opmental process allows for the fine-tuning of these connections based on sensory experience, optimizing the auditory 
cortex for processing the specific acoustic environment encountered during critical periods of development.

In our model, the one-way excitation from PE+ to PE− neurons allows for rapid recalibration of expectations across 
streams. This asymmetry enables efficient updating of predictions based on positive surprises while avoiding false alarms 
from mere absences. Integration across frequency channels enables complex interactions, with sequences of tones pro-
viding predictive information about subsequent tones. Naturalistic sounds like tone clouds can activate multiple streams 
simultaneously, leveraging the network’s capacity for sophisticated auditory processing [55].
Lateral prediction suppression and the free energy principle
Building upon these anatomical and functional observations of lateral connectivity, we can consider how our proposed 
circuit model might be interpreted through theoretical principles. The free energy principle [1,56] potentially offers an ele-
gant explanatory framework for understanding why these lateral connections may have evolved. Could the lateral predic-
tion suppression we observed be more than just a convenient circuit mechanism? When viewed through the lens of free 
energy minimization, these connections might represent an optimal solution for efficient predictive processing. In S1 Text, 
we provide a mathematical treatment that suggests when a simplified form of the free energy principle is applied to a two-
tone paradigm similar to our experimental design, lateral interactions between prediction errors across different streams 
emerge naturally from the formalism.
In our mathematical exploration, we considered a simplified generative model where auditory tones at different fre-
quencies are represented as hidden variables with linear relationships to sensory inputs. By deriving the update rules for 
prediction signals under free energy minimization, we found that the resulting equations comprise three key components: 
updates based on prediction errors within the same frequency stream, lateral interactions of prediction errors across 
different frequency streams, and a temporal decay term. Notably, the lateral interaction term emerges from the correlation 
structure of sensory inputs across different frequencies—a statistical regularity well-documented in natural auditory envi-
ronments [57]. These theoretical derivations align remarkably well with our proposed circuit model, where lateral connec-
tions between PE+ and PE− neurons across different frequency streams play a crucial role in shaping prediction signals.
This theoretical perspective raises intriguing possibilities about why the brain might implement the asymmetric recep-
tive fields we observed. The efficient coding strategy—where unexpected stimuli in one frequency channel not only signal 
prediction errors within that channel but also laterally modulate predictions in neighboring channels—could represent an 
evolutionarily advantageous solution for minimizing computational costs while maximizing predictive accuracy. Such a the-
oretical framing might also explain the directionality of lateral connections we proposed, flowing primarily from positive to 
negative prediction error neurons rather than bidirectionally. While experimental validation of these theoretical predictions 
remains a challenge for future work, the mathematical alignment between our empirical findings and free energy principles 
suggests that lateral prediction suppression could be a fundamental computational motif in predictive processing, poten-
tially extending beyond the auditory system to other sensory modalities.
Layer and area specificity of PEONs
Our finding that PEONs are more prevalent in granular and supragranular layers aligns with current views on the laminar 
organization of predictive coding circuits [4]. These layers are thought to be primary sites for prediction error computation 
and integration of top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory input. The relative scarcity of PEONs in infragranular 
layers suggests these neurons may be less involved in generating feedback predictions to earlier processing stages. 
Regarding their distribution across different auditory fields (A1, VAF, AAF), while PEONs were present in all areas exam-
ined, they showed a significantly higher proportion in A1 compared to VAF and AAF (based on bootstrap analysis). This 
potential enrichment in A1 might suggest functional specializations within primary auditory cortex related to negative 
prediction error signals, although the presence of PEONs across fields still supports the idea that predictive coding is a 
widespread cortical computation [6]. However, this raises questions about potential functional specializations not captured 
by our current paradigm.

Dynamics of omission responses
A notable feature of the PEON omission responses is their shape; rather than exhibiting a sharp, transient peak as seen in 
typical tone responses, they often display a more gradual onset and prolonged duration [27,32,34] compared to both typ-
ical auditory evoked responses and the idealized, instantaneous prediction-error signals assumed in simplified predictive 
coding models, including our own. While our model effectively captures the probability encoding and asymmetry of PEON 
responses, it does not explicitly model the detailed temporal dynamics. Functionally, a more gradual negative prediction- 
error signal might help prevent drastic responses to slightly delayed expected input—contrasting with the rapid responses 
needed for unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, the negative prediction-error signal could reflect a prediction not only about the 
content (i.e., the tone) but also about its timing. In other words, the prediction signal could be gradually ramped up according 
to a hazard function, modeling how the brain adjusts its anticipation of an event as time passes [58–61], and the negative 
prediction- error signal could follow a similar pattern. We suspect that this ramp-up response involves a recurrent cortical 
circuit normally inhibited by sensory input; when the input is omitted and disinhibition occurs, the negative prediction-error 
signal gradually increases. Future computational modeling that explicitly incorporates recurrent connectivity and temporal 
integration mechanisms will be crucial for elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this observed latency.
Establishment of prediction signals
A notable limitation of our study is the absence of explicit “prediction neurons” in both our experimental findings and com-
putational model. While we identified neurons responding to prediction errors, we did not find neurons directly represent-
ing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Predictive signals might be generated in higher-order auditory areas, non-auditory 
regions providing top–down input, or encoded in a distributed manner across neuronal populations. Further computa-
tional modeling of distributed prediction encoding could help guide future experiments by suggesting specific patterns or 
 population-level dynamics to look for in neural data.
It is important to consider whether the observed omission responses might themselves be a prediction signal, rather 
than solely a prediction error. However, several aspects of the PEON activity argue against this interpretation. First, a pre-
diction signal should precede the expected time of the stimulus, while PEON omission responses occur after the expected 
tone onset. Second, prediction signals should appear consistently across all trials, regardless of whether the stimulus is 
presented or omitted. Instead, we observe that PEONs exhibit markedly different activity patterns between presentation 
and omission trials—in some cases showing smaller responses when tones are presented compared to when they are 
omitted. Thus, the PEON activity pattern is more consistent with a negative prediction-error signal, reflecting the mismatch 
between expectation and reality, rather than just the expectation itself.
Future research should address the limitations of our study, such as the potential effects of anesthesia on neural 
responses, by comparing findings with those from awake and behaving animals. Additionally, employing more complex stim-
uli and varying spectral distances between tones could further probe the limits of the proposed lateral prediction suppression 
mechanism. Another important direction is identifying the specific neuronal populations involved in prediction-error signaling. 
While our study focused on firing rate dynamics, different neuronal subtypes may play distinct roles in encoding positive and 
negative prediction errors. Techniques such as optogenetic tagging, juxtacellular recording, or genetic labeling could help 
determine whether PEONs correspond primarily to excitatory pyramidal neurons or specific subtypes of inhibitory interneu-
rons, providing critical insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying predictive processing in the auditory cortex.
Methods
All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Japanese 
Physiological Society for the care and use of animals in physiological studies. The experimental protocol was approved 
by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the 
University of Tokyo (JA21-9).

Animals
The study involved 10 male Wistar rats, aged 11–12 weeks, and weighing between 250 and 350 gms. The animals were 
housed in a carefully controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle, ensuring optimal conditions for their well-being. 
Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study. To minimize animal suffering, all surgical procedures were 
conducted under appropriate anesthesia. Upon completion of the experiments, the animals were humanely euthanized 
using an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (160 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), following established guidelines 
for the humane termination of animal studies.
Surgical procedures
The rats were anesthetized using urethane, with an initial dose of 1.5 g/kg administered intraperitoneally and supplemen-
tary doses of 0.5 g/kg provided as needed to ensure stable and deep anesthesia. This depth of anesthesia was confirmed 
by the absence of corneal and pedal reflexes. The animals were secured using a custom-made head-holding apparatus. 
Atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the onset of the procedure to reduce bronchial secretion 
viscosity. Local anesthetic xylocaine (0.3–0.5 ml) was applied at the incision site before making the skin incision. A needle 
electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the right forepaw to serve as ground. A small craniotomy was performed near 
the bregma landmark to place a reference electrode, ensuring electrical contact with the dura. A larger craniotomy was 
performed over the right auditory cortex (4.0 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to bregma), and the right temporal muscle, 
cranium, and dura covering the auditory cortex were surgically removed. The exposed cortical surface was kept moist with 
saline to prevent drying. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid drainage was conducted to minimize cerebral edema. Throughout 
the experiment, an adequate and stable level of anesthesia was ensured by monitoring the animals’ respiratory rate, heart 
rate, and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes.
Electrophysiological recordings
Neuronal activity was recorded using both a custom-designed surface microelectrode array [62] and a Neuropixels 1.0 
electrode array (IMEC, Belgium) [63].
Mapping auditory cortex using the surface array
To record neuronal activity epipially over the auditory cortex, a surface array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) compris-
ing 64 platinum electrodes was employed. Each electrode had a diameter of 100 μm and a center-to-center distance of 
500 μm, covering an area of 4.5 × 3.0 mm. The array featured 0.3-mm diameter holes between the electrodes to allow the 
insertion of a Neuropixels array. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded using amplifiers with a gain of 1,000, a 
digital filter bandpass of 0.3–500 Hz, and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, employing the Cerebus Data Acquisition System 
(Blackrock Microsystems LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).
We mapped the click-evoked responses to pinpoint the location of the auditory cortex (AC). A click was defined as a 
monophasic positive wave lasting 20 ms. 60 clicks were administered at a rate of 1 Hz, and LFPs were recorded. The 
peak amplitude of the middle-latency auditory-evoked potential (P1) within the first 50 ms following the stimulus onset was 
measured from the grand averaged LFP. To identify three subfields within the AC—A1, AAF, and VAF—we analyzed the 
spatial distribution of the P1 response.
Neuropixels recordings
For recording neuronal activity across different cortical layers, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array [63]. The array 
features 384 active recording sites (out of 960 sites total) located at the bottom approximately 4 mm of an approximately 
10 mm shank (70 µm wide, 24 µm thick, 20 µm electrode spacing), with the reference and ground, shorted together. The 

PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242 June 18, 2025 21 / 30
probe’s ground and reference pads were soldered to a pin, which was then connected to a skull screw on the animal. 
Recordings were made in internal reference mode.
Data acquisition for the Neuropixels arrays was performed using Neuropixels version 1.0 acquisition hardware, spe-
cifically the National Instruments PXIe-1071 chassis and PXI-6133 I/O module for recording analog and digital inputs 
(Neuropixels version 1.0, IMEC, Belgium). The signal was collected from the most distal 384 recording sites (bank 0) at 
a 30 kHz sampling rate. Raw voltage traces from the Neuropixels arrays were filtered, amplified, multiplexed, and digi-
tized on-probe. Data acquisition and initial processing were managed using Open Ephys software (www.open-ephys.org). 
Spike sorting was conducted using Kilosort 3 [64], and further manual curation was performed with Phy software (https://
phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This process involved removing artifacts, merging duplicate clusters, and discarding units 
with insufficient refractory periods, intermingled waveforms, or unstable firing patterns. Only well-isolated neurons meeting 
strict inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. The cortical depth of the recording site, estimated via CSD analysis, had 
to be within 0 µm to +1,800 µm from the pial surface. The lower bound of 1,800 µm was chosen to confine recordings to 
the auditory cortex, preventing the inclusion of neurons from subcortical areas or unintended regions. Additionally, neu-
rons had to fire at least 200 spikes per session to ensure sufficient statistical power, while those exhibiting strong drift in 
firing rate or waveform shape were excluded to maintain stationarity.
Characterization of the frequency response area
To assess the frequency-tuning properties of all recorded neurons, we measured the frequency response area (FRA) 
at each recording site. The auditory stimuli consisted of pure tone bursts with a 5-ms rise/fall time and a 20-ms steady-
state duration. The tones covered a wide range of frequencies, spanning 18 distinct values from 1.6 to 64 kHz, and were 
presented at seven different sound pressure levels, ranging from 20 to 80 dB SPL in 10-dB steps. In total, 126 unique 
tone bursts were used to characterize the FRA. The stimuli were delivered in a pseudorandom sequence with an inter-
tone interval of 600 ms, and each tone was repeated 20 times. FRA maps were generated for each neuron based on 
their responses to the presented tones. After examining the FRA maps, we selected two tones that were one octave apart 
and elicited robust responses from most recorded neurons. These two tones were then used as the stimuli for the subse-
quent experiments investigating the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions using an intensity well above the 
threshold of a typical neuron.
Experimental design
To investigate the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions, we designed eight experimental conditions, each 
employing an oddball paradigm with two distinct tones and a fixed 5% probability of tone omissions. The stimuli were the two 
sinusoidal tones chosen before with a duration of 50 ms, including 5-ms rise and fall ramps. These tones were arranged in 
sequences of 1,000 stimuli, with an SOA of 150 ms. In the first condition, one tone (Tone A) comprised 95% of the sequence, 
while the other tone (Tone B) was absent. Across the subsequent conditions, the proportion of Tone B gradually increased by 
5% increments, while the proportion of Tone A decreased accordingly. This resulted in the following sequences:
Sequence 1: 95% Tone A, 0% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 2: 90% Tone A, 5% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 3: 85% Tone A, 10% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 4: 75% Tone A, 20% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 5: 50% Tone A, 45% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 6: 20% Tone A, 75% Tone B, 5% omissions

PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242 June 18, 2025 22 / 30
Sequence 7: 10% Tone A, 85% Tone B, 5% omissions
Sequence 8: 0% Tone A, 95% Tone B, 5% omissions
This design allowed us to systematically manipulate the relative probabilities of the two tones while maintaining a consis-
tent rate of omissions. By progressively shifting the balance between the tones across conditions, we could examine how 
the neural responses to tone omissions were influenced by the statistical context provided by the sequence.
Data analysis
Omission responses. Omission response was defined as the firing rate measured in a 5–120 ms post‐omission 
window, with a local baseline subtracted on a per‐trial basis. The baseline was computed as the mean firing rate within a 
−24 ms to +5 ms window relative to the expected tone onset, a period that closely reflects the neuron’s state immediately 
prior to the omitted tone and controls for transient adaptations or fluctuations that might occur mid‐sequence. The 
computed baseline was then subtracted from the mean firing rate obtained during the post‐omission period, yielding a final 
omission response value that was typically around zero when the neuron exhibited no net change in firing rate. Although we 
corrected responses using this immediate pre‐omission baseline, we also examined pre‐sequence spontaneous firing rates 
and observed no correlation between those rates and omission responses (see S8 Fig). This methodology is consistent 
with established work [32], which demonstrated robust omission responses using a similar immediate reference period.
Clustering of correlation coefficients. To examine the presence of distinct groups based on the strength of the 
correlation between each neuron’s omission response and predictability of OP tone, we performed k-means clustering 
on the correlation coefficients. Thus, neurons encoding predictability exhibited either strong positive or strong negative 
correlations. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method, which identifies the “knee point” 
in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The knee point suggests the optimal 
number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data (see S1 Fig). 
The k-means clustering analysis was performed using the k-means function in MATLAB with 10 replicates for each 
cluster number. The WCSS was calculated for each cluster number, and the optimal number of clusters was determined 
by finding the knee point in the WCSS plot. The clustering results were then visualized using histograms to display the 
distribution of correlation coefficients within each cluster.
Split-Half approach for PEON classification. To mitigate potential biases such as double dipping—where the same 
data are used both to select and evaluate effects—and to ensure the robustness of our probability encoding analysis, we 
employed a split‐half approach. For each probability condition, the 50 omission trials were divided into two equal halves—
an odd‐indexed “training set” and an even‐indexed “testing set,” with each set providing 25 omission trials per condition. 
Using only the training set, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation between each neuron’s omission response and 
the probability condition. Neurons with a significant correlation (p < 0.05) were provisionally labeled as “correlated,” and 
the OP tone for each neuron was defined based on the direction of the correlation in the training data. From this subset 
of correlated neurons, we then pooled the training‐set trials in the conditions where the OP was standard (75%–95%) and 
applied a one‐sample Wilcoxon sign‐rank test (p < 0.05) to determine whether their omission response was significantly 
above zero. Because the omission response is computed as the firing rate minus a local baseline, testing against zero 
effectively assesses whether post-omission activity exceeds the neuron’s immediate pre-omission baseline. Only neurons 
that exhibited both a significant correlation and a robust omission response were designated as PEONs in the training 
set. All subsequent population plots—such as boxplots or group correlations—were generated solely from the testing set, 
ensuring that any observed trends were unbiased by the training‐set selection process. Complementary analyses were 
also carried out using even‐indexed trials for training (with odd‐indexed trials for testing) as well as a non‐split method 
utilizing all trials; these additional analyses, presented in the in S2–S5 Figs, confirm that our main conclusions do not 
depend on the specific trial split.

Data subsampling of tone responses. To ensure that neuronal responses across different tone probability 
conditions were not biased by differences in statistical power due to varying trial counts, we implemented a standardized 
subsampling procedure. For each neuron, within each condition, we limited the analysis of tones to 50 trials per stimulus 
type to prevent conditions with more trials from exerting disproportionate influence. If more than 50 trials were available, 
we selected every k-th trial, where k was chosen to achieve 50 trials (e.g., for 100 trials, k = 2; for 200 trials, k = 4, etc.). 
This ensured that all conditions were analyzed with equal statistical power.
For analyses comparing tone responses with the split-half approach used for PEON identification and characterization 
(see “PEON Identification” section), an additional subsampling step was performed. After the initial reduction to 50 trials 
per condition, the remaining trials were further divided into ODD and EVEN subsets, with each subset matched to the 
corresponding half used for omission responses.
Buildup of omission responses. For each PEON and each repetition, omission responses were extracted from 
the four conditions in which the OP tone was presented as the standard (i.e., 75%, 85%, 90%, and 95% OP tone). The 
omission responses were binned based on their sequence position, and for each bin the mean firing rate and standard 
error were computed, yielding a two-dimensional response matrix that captures the temporal evolution of omission 
responses.
The mean omission response was then modeled with a logistic growth function using MATLAB’s nlinfit function. The 
model was defined as: FR(n) = a/[1 + exp(–b × (n – c))], where n represents the bin center corresponding to the sequence 
position, and a, b, and c are free parameters estimated from the data. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating 
the R-squared value based on the residual and total sums of squares. To control for non-specific drift in neural activity, 
responses to standard tones during the first 50 trials were similarly analyzed. These responses were fitted with an expo-
nential decay function of the form: FR(n) = d + e × exp(–f × n), where n denotes the trial number, and d, e, and f are free 
parameters. The fit quality was evaluated using the R-squared metric.
Laminar and areal distribution of neurons. To determine the laminar distribution of neurons, we adapted the 
methodology from Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. We used CSD analysis on local field potentials recorded with 
Neuropixels electrodes to identify cortical layer boundaries. The earliest clear current sink, typically corresponding to 
the border between layers 3 and 4, was used as a key marker. Individual neuron depths were estimated based on their 
distance from the probe tip, as determined by spike sorting. Neurons were then classified into supragranular (Layers 1–3), 
granular (Layer 4), and infragranular (Layers 5–6) layers. Cortical thickness and layer boundaries were set according to 
Shiramatsu and colleagues [62].
Tone and omission selectivity indices. To assess the relationship between tone-evoked selectivity and omission 
selectivity, we computed selectivity indexes – TSI and OSI for each neuron. TSI was calculated as:
 
TSI = TOP –TONP
TOP + TONP 
TOP and TONP represent the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to the OP and ONP tones, respectively, averaged across 
the seven probability conditions in which each tone was presented. OSI was calculated as:
 
OSI = OOP –OONP
OOP + OONP  
OOP and OONP denote the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to omissions occurring in the 4 sequences where the OP 
and ONP tones were standard, respectively. To test whether a neuron’s tone selectivity predicted its omission selectivity, 
we computed Spearman’s correlation between TSI and OSI.
Computational modeling. We constructed a circuit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons following

with membrane time constant τm = 30ms and membrane resistance Rm =1 MΩ. When V > 10 mV, neurons emitted a 
spike (X =1 ) and were reset to V =0 mV for a refractory period of 2 ms. Synaptic currents Iexc and Iinh were modeled with 
instantaneous rise and exponential decay,

and equivalently for Iinh, with time constants τexc =5 ms and τinh = 20ms. Spikes from presynaptic neurons X ∈ {0,1}

connections between streams s1 and s2 delivered spikes with delay d =5

(s2–s1)2 . Sensory 
stimulation was presented through the input neuron I by setting its Istim to a constant S_strength =0 .2 μA (target stream) 
or S_strength =0 .1 μA (adjacent streams) for 20 ms. Similarly, prediction signals were fed to the P neuron by setting 
Ipred = P_strength∗ 0.2 μA with identical timing. P_strength was initialized to 0 and updated by spikes in prediction neu-
rons as follows:
 
d
dtP_strength =0 .001XPE+ –0.0003XPE–
 
and clipped to ensure 0 ≤ P_strength ≤ 1 at all times. Both Istim and Ipred were raised to their respective values for 
20 ms at the start of each trial, then reset to 0 μA for the remaining 130 ms.
The model was written in Brian2 [65], which allowed calculating exact solutions for the internal neurons of the circuit 
(PE+, PE–, I+, I–). The remaining neurons (P and I), synapses and P_strength were integrated with a time step of 0.1 ms 
by forward Euler integration. Simulations were run over 500 trials.
Sensory adaptation. To model sensory adaptation, we adjusted the input Istim by using an adaptation factor a, which is 
greater than zero, and a base firing factor b, which is between 0 and 1. The input strength for the A and B streams under 
different values of Prob(A) was adjusted as follows:
 SstrengthA = (1–b) ∗ e
Prob(A)
a + b 
 SstrengthB = (1–b) ∗ e(1–Prob(A))/a + b 
Examples of S_strengthA versus Prob(A) are shown in S6 Fig, with 12 combinations of a (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and b (0.1, 
0.3, 0.5).

S6 Fig.  Model comparisons with adapted sensory signals. (A) Firing rates of thalamic neurons (n = 130) for Tone 1 
(red) and Tone 2 (blue) across varying probabilities of the preferred tone (Prob(OP)). Error bars indicate SEM. (B) To mimic 
the thalamic sensory inputs shown in the panel A, the strength of sensory signals (S_strength) for Tones A (red) and B 
(blue) was modelled as exponential decay functions. Simulations with various combinations of the adaptation factor a and 
base firing factor b were performed, and the results are shown with different symbols. (C) Comparison of mean firing rates 
in different model configurations: Lateral PE+ to PE– (left), Lateral I to PE– (middle), and No lateral (right). Firing rates for 
Tones A (red), B (blue), and omissions (O, black) are plotted against Prob(A). The same symbols are used as in panel B.

S7 Fig.  Positive error encoding in non-PEONs. (A) Population-level firing rates comparing omission responses (black), 
tone responses to the OP tone (blue), and tone responses to the ONP tone (red), plotted against the probability of the OP 
tone. The y-axis indicates firing rate (spikes/s), and error bars show standard error of the mean. All data are drawn from 
the EVEN trials of non-PEONs identified in ODD trials.

S8 Fig.  Pre-sequence spontaneous firing rate versus omission response strength. (A) Scatterplot of pre-sequence 
spontaneous firing rate versus omission response strength. Each point represents a single neuron in a specific probabil-
ity condition. The x-axis shows the pre-sequence spontaneous firing rate (spikes/s), measured before the onset of tone 
sequences, while the y-axis indicates the omission response strength (spikes/s). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) 
and p-value are displayed in the lower-right corner. Underlying data are provided in S4 Data.
