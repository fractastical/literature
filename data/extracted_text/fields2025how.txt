Abstract 
This paper examines the constraints that the free-energy principle (FEP) places on possible model of consciousness, particularly 
models of attentional control and imaginative experiences, including episodic memory and planning. We first rehearse the classi-
cal and quantum formulations of the FEP, focusing on their application to multi-component systems, in which only some components 
interact directly with the external environment. In particular, we discuss the role of internal boundaries that have the structure of 
Markov blankets, and hence function as classical information channels between components. We then show how this formal struc-
ture supports models of attentional control and imaginative experience, with a focus on (i) how imaginative experience can employ 
the spatio-temporal and object-recognition reference frames employed in ordinary, non-imaginative experience and (ii) how imagina-
tive experience can be internally generated but still surprising. We conclude by discussing the implementation, phenomenology, and 
phylogeny of imaginative experience, and the implications of the large state and trait variability of imaginative experience in humans.

Highlights
• We present a model of imaginative experience that is compli-
ant with the free-energy principle (FEP).
• We particularly address the questions of how imaginative 
experience is controlled and how it can be surprising.
• We emphasize the roles of thermodynamic energy flows and 
metacognitive control in regulating both imaginative and non-
imaginative experience.
• We discuss the implementation, phenomenology, and phylo-
genetic distribution of imaginative experience, as well as state 
and trait variability in imaginative experience in humans.
Introduction
This paper investigates the constraints placed on theories of con-
sciousness by the variational free-energy principle (FEP). The FEP 
is concerned with dynamical systems having state spaces that 
can be partitioned, over some time period of interest, into the 
states of some “thing,” “particle,” or subsystem of interest, and the 
states of the “environment” of that subsystem, which compose (by 
definition) the rest of total state space ( Friston, 2019). Such par-
titioning is possible if, but only if, both the “particle” or “thing” 
and its “environment” have statistical boundaries or Markov blan-
kets, and behave in ways that preserve their distinguishability or 
mutual conditional independence, and hence their boundaries, 
over the entire time period of interest. Under these conditions, 
which correspond to conditions of weak interaction or sparse cou-
pling, both the “thing” and its “environment” have “internal” states 
not directly perturbed by their interaction. The FEP provides, effec-
tively, a dictionary for translating descriptions of the behavior 
of dynamical systems equipped with such partitions stated in 
the languages of either classical (Friston, 2019; Ramstead et al., 
2022) or quantum (Fields et al., 2022 ) physics into the language 
of approximate Bayesian inference, i.e. Bayesian satisficing. In 
particular, whenever a “thing” and its “environment” behave in a 
way that preserves their mutual boundary and hence their distin-
guishability, the dynamics of their respective internal states can be 
described as implementing models ( Safron, 2020) of each others’

behavior that generate, and then test, predictions of each others’ 
actions, where the “action” of—informational output from—each 
system on the boundary of the other constitutes the “sensation” 
of—informational input to—the other system.1
The FEP does not stipulate any particular definition of the term 
“consciousness” and is not, in and of itself, a theory of conscious-
ness ( Hohwy and Seth, 2020 ). However, since the FEP provides 
a principled inferential description of all systems that can be 
distinguished from their environments in terms of both internal 
information processing and input/output behavior, it constrains 
theories of consciousness indirectly, by attributing the minimal 
structures (e.g. perceptual inferences) that are necessary for con-
sciousness in paradigmatically conscious systems—including all 
organisms—and more broadly to all physical systems sparsely 
coupled to their environments. It characterizes systems that both 
modify their behavior in response to environmental inputs and 
modify their environments by acting on them as agents (Safron, 
2020; Safron, 2021a ; Friston et al., 2022 ), indeed as Bayesian 
agents, with the degree of agency correlated with both the rep-
resentational power and the temporal depth of the deployed 
model (Friston et al., 2022). This agentic perspective on physi-
cal systems may appear counter-intuitive, but as shown by the 
Conway-Kochen “free will” theorems (Conway and Kochen, 2006; 
Conway and Kochen, 2009), viewing all physically implemented 
systems as “free” in the specific sense of exhibiting behaviors not 
causally determined by their environments is required for con-
sistency with the combination of non-superdeterminist quantum 
theory and special relativity; see Fields and Levin (2025) for further 
discussion.2
By treating dynamical systems as agents and interpreting phys-
ical interactions between them as sensation-action loops medi-
ated by internal, model-based Bayesian inference, the FEP sug-
gests a simple constraint on theories of sensation, and hence on 
theories of sensory consciousness: it suggests that systems “expe-
rience” whatever is “written” on their boundaries (Fields et al., 
2021
). It is important to emphasize that “boundaries” here are 
informational boundaries—boundaries in state spaces—that may 
not, and in general do not, coincide with intuitively-obvious spa-
tial boundaries such as cell membranes or the skin of an organism. 
“Sensation” includes whatever is written by the action of the envi-
ronment upon the informational boundary, but also, potentially, 
includes whatever may be written by the action of internal pro-
cesses on the informational boundary as discussed in detail below. 
While the classical formulation of the FEP is silent on what else a 
system may be capable of experiencing, the quantum formula-
tion imposes a further constraint on any experiences with specific 
content. In the quantum formulation, classical information—
information with specific content—is encoded only on informa-
tional boundaries, as shown explicitly in Fields et al. (2022). The 
quantum formulation makes up for this by inducing such bound-
aries between any systems that are not entangled (Fields, 2024); 
hence the quantum FEP requires internal boundaries in any sys-
tems that are not pure quantum computers, i.e. any systems with 
1 This statement is, and is intended to be, very general, applying to “inert” 
systems such as rocks (Friston et al., 2022) or even elementary particles as well 
as to complex, self-sustaining (i.e. functionally closed), adaptive systems such 
as organisms or ecosystems. Distinctions between such systems can be con-
structed within the FEP framework, in terms of computational architecture and 
capabilities as discussed below; again see Friston (2019) or Friston et al. (2022) 
for overviews.
2 There are many nuanced senses of “free will” that go well beyond the 
straighforward “physical” idea of freedom from local determinism implied by 
the Conway-Kochen theorem, which is indeed required for separability between 
system and environment (Fields et al. 2022); see e.g. O’Connor (2022) for review. 
For the purposes of this paper, freedom from local determinism is sufficient.
distinct, mutually conditionally-independent components. Hence 
the quantum formulation can be read as rendering all experience 
with specific content “sensory” as this term is used in the FEP (Fris-
ton et al., 2020), and as associating such sensory experience with 
all boundaries between mutually conditionally-independent sys-
tems.3 The quantum formulation of the FEP is fully scale-free and 
applies in the same form to all physical systems; indeed it follows 
directly from the quantization of information into discrete units 
(Fields et al., 2022). When information flows between systems—i.e. 
causal influences—are large enough to be treated as continuous, 
one obtains the classical formulation, which is effectively a low-
resolution or “macroscopic” approximation. It bears emphasis that 
neither formulation of the FEP says anything directly about the 
semantics of these experiences or “what they are like” for the sys-
tem that has them. From a biological perspective it is natural, 
but by no means logically necessary, to associate prediction errors 
with negative valence and hence stress (Peters et al., 2017; Linson 
et al., 2020; Fields et al., 2021; Hesp et al., 2021).
Identifying “experience” with input to a Markov blanket raises, 
however, an obvious problem when applied to complex organisms, 
particularly humans: it appears to restrict awareness to aware-
ness of the external environment, so while it is consistent with 
humans or other systems engaging in complex cognitive tasks 
such as planning, it appears to rule out any experiences of the per-
formance of such tasks. Indeed, it appears to rule out all imagina-
tive (i.e. counterfactual) experiences, including mnemonic expe-
riences or planning as well as dreams, introspective thought, etc. 
Such experiences involve sensations, such as the aural sensation 
of inner speech, the visual sensation of self-generated imagery, or 
the kinesthetic sensation of imagined movement (Kosslyn et al., 
2001), but the causal source of these sensations is not the external 
environment or even, as in somatosensory or kinesthetic sensa-
tions, the body below the brainstem. As pointed out in Fields et al.
(2021), preserving the equation of “experience” with input cross-
ing, and hence being encoded on, a boundary requires postulating 
the existence, in any systems that have imaginative experiences, 
of internal informational boundaries, or “inner screens” on which 
such “inner” experiences can be encoded. This raises an obvious 
question: given some system S that is capable of imagination, are 
S’s experiences—as distinct from the potential experiences of any 
proper components of S—written on one informational bound-
ary or on two or more? If the answer is two or more, how can 
this be consistent with the experiences written on these multi-
ple boundaries all being the experiences of S, not the experiences 
of multiple distinct systems smaller than S? These are questions 
that any inner-screen theory must address.
The idea of experiences as encoded on “inner screens” is, of 
course, far from novel; an internal “theater of consciousness” 
is postulated explicitly in Baars’ (2005) global workspace theory 
(GWT) and is implicit in traditional thinking about conscious-
ness at least back to Descartes. It is not implausible to regard 
the “mind” or “inner world” of folk psychology as some kind of 
inner screen. From an informal, intuitive perspective, imagina-
tion plays a large role in the notion of “mental life” and would 
seem to be a hallmark of consciousness; the phrase “unexpe-
rienced inner speech,” for example, sounds like an oxymoron. 
3 This reading is highly deflationary, as it treats “experience” as a simple 
synonym for the inscription of physical traces, by some process or other, on 
the boundary. Some consciousness researchers explicitly define “experience” or 
“consciousness” in more restrictive terms (e.g. requiring an experienced sense 
of self or “awareness of awareness”) or by appealing to intuitions that restrict 
the range of conscious entities. Such questions are beyond the present scope; 
see Fields and Levin (2025) for related discussion and Andrews et al. (2025) for 
a recent perspective from biology.
Free-energy principle and conscious experience  3
Our goal in the present paper is to determine whether, and if 
so how, these informal ideas can be made more rigorous via the 
FEP, and in particular, whether they can be made strictly com-
pliant with a requirement that all the experiences of a system 
S are encoded on S’s informational boundary. As noted earlier, 
the FEP is not itself a theory of consciousness, and says nothing 
about whether any of the internal information processing that 
it characterizes agents as doing—for example, the computation 
of expected free energies for the outcomes of alternative poli-
cies during planning—is done consciously. Hence our goal here 
is to specify necessary conditions for imaginative experiences in 
systems that meet previously-proposed necessary conditions for 
any experiences, e.g. the condition of temporal coarse-graining 
proposed by Whyte et al. (2024). We will focus, in particular, 
on three questions relevant to any “inner screen” construction. 
The first is whether, and if so how, an FEP-compliant architec-
ture can support experienced metacognitive control, including 
experienced attentional control via the top-down modulation of 
Bayesian precision. While it is clear that generic hierarchical 
predictive-coding models can support attentional control, it is 
not clear what constraints, if any, such models generically place 
on the experience of exercising such control, either at the whole-
agent level or at the level(s) of the components. Recent models 
proposed by Bennett et al. (2024) and Laukkonen and Chandaria 
(2024), for example, incorporate hierarchical predictive coding 
with attentional control without, apparently, localizing the expe-
rience of attentional control to any boundary, whether external or 
internal. The second question is how imaginative experience can 
employ the same spatio-temporal and object-recognition refer-
ence frames—concepts, categories, properties, coordinate systems 
and so forth—employed in ordinary, non-imaginative experience 
(Kosslyn et al., 2001). When faced with the “experienced by whom?” 
question, traditional inner-screen models postulate an “inner 
observer” possessing whatever conceptual structure is required 
to interpret what is “displayed” on the inner screen. As pointed 
out by Maturana and Varela (1980) and many others, any model in 
which the inner observer must duplicate the conceptual structure 
attributed to the whole observer is circular and therefore non-
explanatory. An acceptable, FEP-compliant model of imaginative 
experience must show how the agent of interest can be the “expe-
riencer” of both externally- and internally-generated sensations 
and the “actor” for both externally- and internally-directed actions 
while employing the same physically-implemented conceptual 
structure, acting on the same informational boundary, for both. It 
must also explain how some agents, including most humans, can 
switch between deliberate actions accompanied by imaginative 
experiences—e.g. “thinking” via inner speech or visualization—
and similar actions performed “automatically” in the absence 
of such imaginative experiences, e.g. well-practiced actions per-
formed in “flow” states. The third question is how, given that they 
are internally generated, imaginative experiences can be surpris-
ing, as they so often are, and as they must be in order to be 
cognitively useful.
Ours is, of course, not the first attempt to develop an integrative 
treatment of consciousness that is compliant with the FEP; for pre-
vious general discussions, see e.g. Whyte et al. (2022) or Wiese and 
Metzinger (2017). One notable attempt to integrate a broad spec-
trum of theories of consciousness is integrated world modeling 
theory (IWMT) ( Safron, 2020; Safron, 2022). IWMT represents an 
attempt to integrate FEP accounts with two other leading theories 
of consciousness, namely, GWT and integrated information theory 
(IIT 3.0) (Tononi, 2015; Tononi et al., 2016). A second body of work 
that has focused on the role of active inference in the selection 
of “winning hypotheses” corresponding to conscious perceptual 
contents, as in binocular rivalry paradigms (Hohwy, 2013; Hohwy, 
2022; Hohwy et al., 2008; Parr et al., 2019), has also presented an 
FEP-theoretic perspective on lines of evidence motivating many 
distinct theories of consciousness. More recently, Whyte et al.
(2024) have argued that the active inference framework can be 
interpreted as setting constraints on any theory of conscious-
ness. One of these is that what is “experienced” by any system 
is (a subset of) its posterior probability distributions, a require-
ment that is consistent with what we outline below provided 
encodings on MBs are taken to be coarse-grained. The present 
proposal differs from this previous work in taking an explicitly 
architectural approach that considers each component of a com-
plex cognitive agent to be an agent that must cope with its own 
immediate environment, which in most cases consists primarily 
or even exclusively of other components of the complex agent. It 
aims to show how active inference at the scale of the complex 
agent as a whole can be re-described as the collective behavior 
of its component agents, and hence to show how the experience 
of the complex agent as a whole relates to the experiences of 
its component agents. This work can, therefore, be considered to 
represent a step toward identifying necessary, though not demon-
strably sufficient, conditions for the realization of imaginative 
consciousness in any entity to which such experience might be
attributed.
The paper is structured as follows. We first briefly review the 
FEP in both its classical and quantum formulations, and develop 
an explicit formal framework, applicable to arbitrary systems, for 
specifying perception and action capabilities and the represen-
tation of space and time. We also provide an explicit represen-
tation of the flow of thermodynamic free energy (in living sys-
tems, metabolism), and of how systems employ environmentally-
sourced thermodynamic free energy to power cognitive process-
ing. We then provide a minimal model of an active inference 
agent with multimodal perception and action that employs a 
metacognitive controller to differentially allocate thermodynamic 
resources and attention to different ways of interacting with its 
environment. This system is capable of planning—i.e. of comput-
ing expected free energies and algorithmically choosing a pol-
icy with minimal expected free energy (EFE)—and hence meets 
the criteria for consciousness suggested by Whyte et al. (2024). 
However, it would have no imaginative experiences associated 
with this cognitive activity; it would experience its behavior in 
the way that a person with complete, multi-modal aphantasia 
(Zeman, 2024) might experience it. We then develop a minimal 
extension of this model that is capable of imaginative experi-
ences. We discuss how the differences between these two models 
allow us to capture the range of variation of both state and 
trait human imaginative experiences. We conclude with a dis-
cussion of core concepts and predictions that emerge from this
treatment.
Preliminaries: a short introduction to the 
free-energy principle
The classical formulation of the free-energy 
principle
The FEP is a mathematical principle that, much like the principle 
of least action, can be used to derive the mechanics of dynamical 
systems, i.e. equations of motion that describe their observable 
dynamics (Friston, 2019; Ramstead et al., 2023; Ramstead et al., 
2024). Just as one can think of the principle of least action as the 
variational principle that underwrites classical mechanics, one 
4 Fields et al.
Figure 1. Illustration of a Markov blanket (MB). Internal and external (i.e. environmental) states (denoted 𝜂 and 𝜇, respectively) interact via sensory and 
active blanket states (denoted s and a, respectively, with the total blanket state denoted b = (s,a)); the latter induce a conditional independence 
between internal and external states. In virtue of this conditional independence, one can associate internal states with the parameters or sufficient 
statistics of a conditional (a.k.a., variational) density over external states, given blanket states. In turn, one can then interpret internal (and active) 
dynamics as a gradient flow on a variational free energy that plays the role of a marginal likelihood or model evidence in statistical inference. 
Equations represent time derivatives (the notation ̇a = 𝜕a/𝜕t; ∇ is the gradient operator) of the state variables as functions of each other. The vertical 
solid arrow emphasizes that the time evolution of both sensory and active states depends on the total blanket state b.
can think of the FEP as the variational principle that describes the 
way that probabilistic beliefs evolve over time; which is known as 
Bayesian mechanics (Ramstead et al., 2023; Sakthivadivel, 2022). 
The FEP provides an explanation—from first principles—of why 
any thing that physically exists looks as if it infers the proper-
ties of the environment to which it is coupled, but from which 
it can be separated (Ramstead et al., 2023 ). In other words, the 
FEP provides us with a way to model the dynamics of any phys-
ical “thing” that exists, as itself modeling the statistical structure 
of the other “things” that constitute its embedding environment 
(Ramstead et al., 2024).
The core construct of the FEP formulation is the Markov blanket
(MB), which separates a “thing” or particle from its environment—
but also couples the one to the other (Ramstead et al., 2023 ; 
Ramstead et al., 2024 ; Sakthivadivel, 2022 ). An MB renders the 
internal states of some thing conditionally independent from the 
external states of that which it is not. Analyses of systems in terms 
of active inference (Parr et al., 2022), which applies the FEP to the 
study of action-perception loops, assume a further decomposition 
of the MB into sensory and active states (Palacios et al., 2020). By 
construction, sensory states are those that influence but are not 
influenced by internal states; whereas, symmetrically and recip-
rocally, active states influence but are not influenced by external 
states. Figure 1 illustrates this. 
Heuristically, the FEP says that, if a system can be partitioned 
into “things” that have MBs, then those “things” will look as if they 
encode and update probabilistic beliefs about the other “things” 
to which they are coupled. More precisely, the FEP says that, when 
they exist, the Markov blanketed subsets of a random dynam-
ical system will look as if they infer or estimate or “track” the 
parameters of probability distributions over other subsets of the 
system. This is because the dynamics or observable behavior of 
any Markov blanketed “thing” can be read as a gradient flow over 
surprise and because anything that flows over surprise gradients 
is, mathematically, a form of inference (Ramstead et al., 2024). 
In this setting, we can express the dynamics of active and inter-
nal states of a “thing” in terms of a gradient flow over surprise 
or (equivalently) on an upper bound of surprise, known as varia-
tional free energy. This is a tractable quantity that depends upon 
the data generated by sensory states, and on a generative model of 
how external states cause sensory states (Friston, 2010); where the 
word “cause” is used in the straightforward (dynamical systems) 
sense that one state causes changes in another state because the 
first state enters the equations of motion of the second ( Ram-
stead et al., 2023 ). Effectively, this allows one to interpret the 
autonomous (i.e. internal and active) dynamics as a process of 
inference; namely, changing in a way that minimizes variational 
free energy or, equivalently, maximizing the evidence for the gen-
erative model. This is sometimes called self-evidencing ( Hohwy, 
2016).
In a system that conforms to the FEP, the internal states of 
a particle will look as if they are updating a probabilistic rep-
resentation of the causes of its sensory states. Note that this 
description can never be directly verified, because the internal 
states are inaccessible, provided the MB remains intact: just as the 
system observes its environment only via its blanket, the environ-
ment observes the system only via its blanket.
4 This probabilistic 
representation, parameterized by internal states, is a variational 
density over external states. Particles model their environments 
via the evolution of this variational density. It is worth noting 
that this sense of “representation” differs substantially from other 
usages of this term in the literature, particularly the idea of “rep-
resentation” as causal-informational dependency that features in 
traditional philosophical psycho-semantics (Dretske, 1981; Fodor, 
1990; Usher, 2001) and has been roundly criticized by Maturana 
and Varela (1980) among others. Broadly speaking, Dretske (1981), 
Fodor (1990) and others posit atomic relations of lawful covari-
ation between the internal states of agents, on the one hand, 
and entities or events in the represented world (what a FEP the-
orist would call external states), on the other. On this account, 
an internal state represents an external state if, and only if, there 
exist lawful relations of covariation between both states, such 
that changes in internal states track changes in external states. 
In the FEP formulation, the internal states of a system do not 
directly track or covary with the external states of a system: rather, 
they encode the parameters of a conditional probability density
over external states—the variational density—and it is this den-
sity which represents external states (Sprevak, 2020). This is a core 
but crucial difference. That said, this form of mapping relates to 
4 The strength of this statement becomes evident when it is applied to 
human observers, particularly experimental scientists. Scientists observe sys-
tems only via their own MBs. The consequences of this fact for the epistemology 
of science are of obvious interest, but are beyond the present scope; see Moore 
(1956) for an early formalization.
Free-energy principle and conscious experience  5
“tracking” in the conventional sense, since internal paths of least 
action encode expectations about external paths (where action is 
the path integral of variational free energy). Crucially, the fac-
tors of the conditional density (e.g. types of objects, outcomes, 
and events) that “carve up” the world may vary arbitrarily, subject 
only to the constraint that model evidence is conserved on average 
(Ramstead et al., 2023; Sakthivadivel, 2022). This account of repre-
sentation may thus be regarded as justifying (or dovetailing with) 
Quine’s view that categories—in terms of which we experience 
the world—are akin to theoretical posits, which earn their keep 
via their predictive and explanatory power with respect to sensa-
tion (Quine, 1960). Despite this, structural correspondences can 
be expected to obtain at the level of internal and external states 
as a whole ( Conant and Ashby, 1970; Gładziejewski, 2016; Kiefer 
and Hohwy, 2018; Ramstead et al., 2020b), where the KL-divergence 
between the variational and generative densities has been argued 
to provide an account of misrepresentation, and thus a form of 
semantic normativity ( Kiefer and Hohwy, 2018; Ramstead et al., 
2020a).
The quantum theoretic formulation of the 
free-energy principle
As mentioned in the Introduction, the continuous representa-
tion of causal processes, and hence of information flows between 
systems, employed in the classical formulation of the FEP can 
be viewed as a macroscopic limit of a discrete representation. If 
information is quantized into discrete units—e.g. bits—a quantum 
formulation of information flow is required. Standard quantum 
theory provides such a representation (Nielsen and Chuang, 2000). 
Formulating the FEP in the language of quantum theory extends 
its range of application to systems not ordinarily thought of as 
“things,” e.g. to quantum fields. For the present purposes, the 
quantum formulation provides both the strong constraint that 
classical information must be localized to boundaries discussed 
above, and a convenient language—the language of quantum ref-
erence frames (Bartlett et al., 2007) described in § 2.3 below—with 
which to characterize sensation-action loops with their associated 
predictive-model components as computational modules.
Similar to the classical formulation of the FEP that starts with a 
random dynamical system, the quantum formulation starts with 
a quantum process 𝒫U(t) defined on a finite, isolated system U
that is taken to include “everything of interest” in some situa-
tion. The process 𝒫U(t) for an isolated system can be written as 
𝒫U(t) =exp((−𝚤/ℏ)HU(t)), where ℏ is the reduced Planck’s constant 
and HU is the Hamiltonian or total energy operator defined on the 
state (Hilbert) space ℋU of U. Any such system U can be decom-
posed into arbitrarily-chosen components S and E, a “thing” and 
its “environment” respectively, by writing ℋU = ℋS ⊗ ℋE, where ⊗
is the Hilbert-space tensor product, and HU = HS + HE + HSE, where 
HU, HS, and HE are the internal Hamiltonians of U, S, and E respec-
tively, and HSE specifies the interaction between S and E. Provided 
that the coupling HSE between the thing and environment is suffi-
ciently weak, the joint state |U⟩ (employing Dirac’s notation) may 
be (approximately) separable, i.e. not (significantly) entangled, and 
hence we can factor it as |U⟩ = |S⟩|E⟩. In this case, S and E can be 
regarded as “distinct” systems that each have “internal” states that 
are not directly involved in the interaction HSE. This condition of 
separability, or non-entanglement, assures only causal interaction 
between, and hence conditional statistical independence of, the 
components S and E.
The Hilbert-space decomposition ℋU = ℋS ⊗ ℋE induces a 
boundary ℬ between S and E. Provided the joint state |U⟩ is sepa-
rable, i.e. |U⟩ = |S⟩|E⟩, this boundary ℬ functions as a holographic 
screen separating S from E.5 A holographic screen is a boundary 
satisfying the holographic principle, a fundamental result in 
physics that asserts that a finite volume of state space or “bulk” 
cannot contain more externally-observable or accessible informa-
tion than can be encoded on its boundary; 6 it moreover asserts 
that if the system of interest is embedded in spacetime, the maxi-
mal information encodable on its boundary is 𝒮(ℬ) =Aℬ/4, where 
Aℬ is the area of ℬ in Planck units (Almheiri et al., 2021; Bousso, 
2002; Fields et al., 2022 ). As the interaction HSE is defined at ℬ, 
we can in fact say precisely what this information is: at any time 
t, ℬ encodes the eigenvalue of HSE at t (Addazi et al., 2021). We 
can, therefore, represent ℬ as an array of N qubits (quantum 
bits), where N is the number of bits required to encode the largest 
eigenvalue, i.e. the maximum strength, of HSE. The boundary ℬ
therefore has an effective Hilbert space of dimension 2N. The inter-
action HSE is “weak” in the required sense if 2N ≪ dim(ℋS),dim(ℋE), 
i.e. ℬ being small compared to S or E corresponds to “sparse cou-
pling” as required by the classical formulation of the FEP. Under 
these conditions, ℬ functions as an MB between S and E.
Given the above characterization of ℬ, the interaction HSE at a 
given time can be precisely specified as: 
HSE = 𝛽kkBTk
N
∑
i=1
Mk
i , (1)
where k = S or E, the Mk
i  are single-qubit operators with eigenval-
ues +1 and −1, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, Tk is temperature, and 
𝛽k ≥ ln2 is an inverse measure of thermodynamic efficiency. The 
coefficient 𝛽kkBTk is the energy per bit written and assures the 
compliance of HSE with Landauer’s Principle (Landauer, 1961; Lan-
dauer, 1999). Informally, HSE can be represented as a cycle in which 
S “writes” N bits on ℬ that E then “reads,” after which E writes N
bits that S reads in turn (Fields et al., 2022; Fields and Glazebrook, 
2022).
The variational free energy for either system can be defined as 
the difference between the bit string most recently written and the 
bit string that is subsequently read, i.e. the string most recently 
written onto the screen. The FEP requires any system to minimize 
the difference between expectation (the written string) and obser-
vation (the string subsequently read). As the limit of this process 
(in which writes and reads exactly match) corresponds to quan-
tum entanglement, the FEP can be seen to be the classical limit 
of the principle of unitarity, i.e. the principle of conservation of 
information, upon which quantum theory is based; see Fields et al.
(2022) for details and Fields et al. (2023) for a detailed comparison 
of the classical and quantum formulations of the FEP.
The classical formulation of the FEP starts with a random 
dynamical system; in this classical setting, separability between a 
5 It should be noted that the term “holography” has been used in two 
different (but conceptually related) ways in the literature, which should be dis-
tinguished from each other. On the one hand, the term “holography” refers 
to a set of techniques allowing for the reconstruction of a three-dimensional 
image by exploiting the interference patterns of multiple two-dimensional 
wavefronts. The term “holographic,” as used in connection with the holographic 
principle in physics, retains the essential idea that the information content 
of a bulk can (from the point of view of an observer) in principle be encoded 
on a lower-dimensional surface, but without any commitment to encoding via 
interference patterns. The former sense of holography was in play in previous 
theories of consciousness, e.g. the holonomic brain theory (Pribram et al., 1991); 
it is the latter sense of holography that is relevant here.
6 The holographic principle is sometimes stated as the claim that the bulk 
can contain no more information than is encodable on the boundary, leaving 
out the qualifier “externally-observable or accessible.” While in some settings 
this is innocent, in others it introduces errors; see, e.g. the discussion of Fig. 19 
(Wheeler’s “bag of gold”) in (Almheiri et al., 2021). The “bag of gold” is a large 
system with a small boundary and hence a weak interaction with its environ-
ment; it is therefore a good model for an organism. If all the information in a 
system is exposed on its boundary, it cannot have the “internal states” required 
by the FEP.
6 Fields et al.
system and its environment can be achieved by separating them 
in state space. We can then define the states of some thing, 
as against random fluctuations, by appealing to timescale sep-
aration: some states change slowly enough at some scale to be 
reliably re-identified as (effectively) the same states ( Fields et al., 
2022); while other states change so quickly that they average out. 
Thus, the classical FEP is inherently multi-scale (Heins et al., 2023; 
Ramstead et al., 2021). The quantum information theoretic for-
mulation does not assume a spacetime background; indeed, it is 
consistent with quantum-gravity models in which spacetime is 
both emergent from the underlying informational dynamics and 
system-relative ( Fields et al., 2024). It is, therefore, fully scale-
free, applying in the same form to all systems; ranging from 
particle-particle interactions within the Standard Model, through 
the scales of molecules, cells, multi-cellular organisms, biological 
populations, and communities, through to the cosmological scale 
of quantum fields, black holes, and large-scale structures.
Reference frames for perception and action
While the classical FEP abstracts the dynamics of S to a system-
scale generative model, the quantum formulation abstracts HS
to a collection of quantum reference frames (QRFs). As briefly 
introduced in ( Fields et al., 2021 ), a QRF is a physically imple-
mented (hence quantum) measurement standard—meter sticks 
and clocks are canonical examples—that allows both observations 
and actions to be compared. They allow “differences that make a 
difference” (Bateson, 1972) between inputs to be detected by pro-
viding the fixed points against which differences are measured. 
Each QRF implemented by S can, therefore, be viewed as a gener-
ative model of some aspect or component of E’s actions on ℬ. The 
QRFs implemented by a system S collectively encode the complete 
set of inputs from E that can be processed and assigned actionable 
meanings by S.
Informally, QRFs can be regarded as encoding “categories” or 
“concepts,” including concepts specifying individual objects. Con-
sider, as an example, walking into your office and seeing your 
laptop. Identifying your laptop as a specific object requires differ-
entiating it from the background in which it is embedded, includ-
ing the other objects in your office. This is done by noting certain 
distinguishing features of your laptop, e.g. size, shape, color, mark-
ings, etc.; these constitute the time-invariant “reference state” of 
your laptop. The network in your brain that implements these fea-
tures and their expected values—hence, your generative model of 
your laptop—is the “reference” QRF for your laptop. The network 
that allows you to detect a specific, but non-identifying, state of 
interest of your laptop—a “pointer state” in physics language—
such as a text or image displayed on the screen, is a “pointer” QRF 
specific to your laptop. The brain of a typical adult human clearly 
implements at least 100s of thousands of such QRFs.
Formally, a QRF implemented by S is a bidirectional hierarchy 
of operators that accepts input from, and transfers output to, a 
subset of the operators MS
i  appearing in Eq. ( 1). These operators 
can be visualized as in Fig. 2. The system comprises a (nonunique) 
hierarchy of operators between a finite “base” set of operators 
𝒜i that interface directly to ℬ and the (unique) operator 𝒞 that 
is both the category-theoretic limit and colimit of maps to or 
from the 𝒜i, should such a 𝒞 exist; see (Fields et al., 2022; Fields 
et al., 2023) for details and theoretical background. This represen-
tation is provably general for all repeatable, finite-resolution state 
measurements or manipulations (Fields et al., 2022b). 
As also shown in Fields et al. (2022b), any QRF can also be rep-
resented as a quantum operator Q : ℬ → ℬ that reads from and 
writes to some sector of ℬ. These operators may or may not com-
mute, and hence may or may not be simultaneously deployable 
(Fields and Glazebrook, 2022). “Swapping” one QRF for another on 
the same sector of ℬ is, effectively, changing the Hilbert-space 
basis used to define the MS
i  acting on that sector of ℬ. Any sys-
tem S that is separable from its environment E provably has “free 
choice” (i.e. not determined by its own past or that of E) of basis 
and hence of QRF for any sector of ℬ (Fields et al., 2022a); this free 
choice guarantees compliance with the Conway-Kochen theorems 
mentioned earlier.
As QRFs correspond to sensation-action loops as mediated by 
their associated predictive-model components, they encode expecta-
tions and enable detecting “differences that make a difference” 
to action; they encode semantics or “meaning” for S (Fields et al., 
2021). They are, however, also “just physics” as shown by their for-
mal definitions as rehearsed above. This encoding of semantics by 
physics is fundamental to the notion of agency defined by the FEP, 
and in the quantum setting underlies the panpsychist notion that 
all distinct “things” are free agents that cannot be fully described 
by any locally-deterministic theory (Conway and Kochen, 2009).
Space and time quantum reference frames
By adopting classical dynamical systems as a formal setting, the 
classical formulation of the FEP places agents in universal or clock 
time. The quantum formulation employs a notional “time” param-
eter t to define the propagator 𝒫U(t), but this is not a measurable 
time. It moreover assumes nothing about an embedding space. 
Hence models of agents built within the FEP must specify whether, 
and how, each agent measures time and space.
As discussed in (Fields et al., 2022), any agent S can be repre-
sented as implementing an agent-specific time QRF that counts 
actions on or writes to ℬ. The simplest such clock has no asso-
ciated memory, so can only count to one. An agent equipped 
with this clock has only instantaneous experiences, none of which 
are remembered, although they may result, via the action of a 
learning algorithm, in changes to the internal dynamics HS. A 
finite memory for clock ticks is required for any ability to com-
pare a current event—i.e. current sensory input—with one or 
more past events. Such comparisons clearly require, in addition 
to the clock-associated memory, a read/write memory on which 
(possibly highly coarse-grained) records of previous events can be 
written. This memory resource may be a sector of ℬ, in which 
case the memory is written on E, and so is stigmergic at the scale 
of S. It can, however, also be an internal, inter-component bound-
ary sector, in which case the memory is stigmergic at the scale of 
the component that wrote it. Such internal memories are ubiqui-
tous in biology, and are supported by multiple systems from the 
genome to the cell membrane at the cellular level and by local to 
large-scale cellular interactions in multicellular organisms. Both 
the short- and long-term memories for nutrient concentration 
levels that support chemotaxis in bacteria are well-understood, 
cellular-scale examples (Fields et al., 2021).
While all vertebrates, all cephalopods, and at least most arthro-
pods appear capable of spatial orientation, and hence must imple-
ment spatial QRFs, the prevalence of spatial QRFs in organisms 
in general is not at all clear. It is, moreover, not clear whether 
all organisms with spatial QRFs have three-dimensional (3D) spa-
tial QRFs, or whether all organisms with even effective 3D spatial 
QRFs implement the kinds of agent-centered projective geome-
tries that humans, and presumably all mammals and birds, 
appear to implement ( Rudrauf et al., 2017). Hence, while all but 
the most trivial agents implement multi-step clocks, agents may

or may not implement spatial QRFs. Spatial QRFs clearly pro-
vide a format that is advantageous for cognition, because space 
provides a memory resource, a “place to put” information—e.g. 
an object or a stigmergic memory—where it can be kept dis-
tinct from other information and be retrieved later. Understood 
naively, this use of spatial location as memory location under-
lies many discussions of embodied, spatialized cognition, includ-
ing spatialized imagination (Safron et al., 2022), but is often left 
implicit. A full account of the use of spatial QRFs in general 
cognition, memory, and imagination must ground such spatializa-
tion in physics without assuming an objective spacetime embed-
ding (i.e. without naively identifying an agent’s experienced spa-
tially embedded objects with separable components of the agent’s 
external environment; cf. the concluding remarks in ( Fields
et al., 2021).
Thermodynamics and compartmentalization
As mentioned in connection with Eq. (1), acting on the world is 
energetically expensive. The fact that all agents must source ther-
modynamic free energy (TFE) from their environments is built 
into the FEP ( Sengupta et al., 2013), but is often left implicit 
in discussions of agents as inference systems. The requirement 
for sourcing TFE from E breaks an exchange symmetry on ℬ, 
dividing it into two distinct, non-overlapping sectors, a ther-
modynamic sector that manages TFE inputs and waste heat 
outputs—analogous to the power supply and cooling system of 
your laptop—and an informative sector that supports meaningful 
sensation and action (Fields et al., 2022);7 see Fields et al. (2024) for
details.
Living systems, unlike most artifacts ( Ororbia and Friston, 
2024), can be expected to operate on limited, if not severely 
restricted, TFE budgets. Living systems will, therefore, in general 
be forced to make tradeoffs that maximize the utility of the infor-
mation that they expend energy to process and the actions that 
they expend energy to make. Keeping information processing and 
overt action—action on E—within the bounds of the TFE budget 
is the most basic task of an attention system (Fields et al., 2021). 
The simplest mechanism of top-down attentional control is top-
down control of the TFE supply—“turning off” QRFs that are not 
yielding useful information or productive action; in neurobiology, 
this could be read as sensory attenuation. As TFE resources can 
be expected to vary slowly compared to sensory inputs or actions, 
this top-down process can be expected to involve a system-scale 
metaprocessor, or “executive” control network that balances VFE 
reduction with TFE supplies (Kuchling et al., 2022).
7 It should be noted that this carving up of MBs into “thermodynamic” and 
“informative” sectors inherits the observer-relativity of any description of sys-
tems in terms of information-processing (Horsman et al., 2014 ; Fields et al., 
2024). While certain subsystems of biological agents are clearly specialized 
for certain types of action or for the integration of sensory information via 
specific channels, there is a generic reading of “sensory” and “active” states 
that licenses a simpler duality between physical and information-theoretic free 
energy dynamics ( Friston et al., 2020 ; Kiefer, 2020). For example, as implied 
in the Introduction, the dissipation of heat may be regarded as a trivial, 
uninteresting form of “action” on the environment.
8 Fields et al.
As mentioned above, QRFs that commute, and hence are 
simultaneously deployable, can be combined to form larger QRFs 
that recognize more complex events and enable more complex 
actions (see Friston et al., 2024 , for a classical treatment). Ener-
getic constraints can, however, limit co-deployability, making 
in-principle commutative QRFs effectively noncommutative. Non-
commuting QRFs can only exchange information causally, i.e. 
classically, so must be separated by boundaries. This requirement 
for classical internal communication compartmentalizes systems 
with limited TFE supplies, and by requiring internal classical 
actions—writing classical bits—increases their TFE requirements
(Fields, 2024).
Any complete description of physical systems as uncer-
tainty minimizers—hence any complete description employing 
the FEP—must include a description of how such systems mini-
mize their uncertainties about both the availability and accessibil-
ity of TFE resources and their current and expected requirements 
for TFE. A requirement for productively allocating limited TFE 
resources will be better met by systems that incorporate feedback 
from their component QRFs that indicates their rate of TFE expen-
diture, and a self-monitor on the TFE distribution system that 
indicates current TFE availability and usage. These are the func-
tions of the metabolic—or more generally, allostatic—stress sig-
naling systems found in all organisms, including bacteria ( Peters 
et al., 2017 ; Fields et al., 2024 ). At the whole-organism scale in 
mammals, these are brainstem functions that subserve arousal, 
including TFE distribution to the rest of the brain. The essential 
contribution of these systems to consciousness in humans and 
other vertebrates has been emphasized by Solms (2021) and Solms 
and Friston (2018).
The key role of TFE flows in experience rests on the distinction 
between informational content (on inner screens) and the regula-
tion of how that content is read, which has no information content 
per se. The same distinction applies to the classical homologue 
of TFE flow; namely, the regulation of precision: in classical (i.e. 
Bayesian belief updating) formulations of the FEP, precision refers 
to the confidence afforded content; such that reading from the 
sensory sector of MBs depends upon the precision afforded con-
tent. This distinction is sometimes cast in terms of first and second 
order statistics, respectively (Feldman and Friston, 2010). As inti-
mated above, there is an interesting link between quantum and 
classical formulations of the ensuing metacognitive architectures. 
For example, gauge theoretic treatments of the FEP ( Sengupta 
et al., 2016 ) speak to precision as the Fisher information metric 
of statistical manifolds upon which belief updating unfolds. On 
this view, the thermodynamic cost of belief updating (i.e. move-
ment on a statistical manifold) corresponds to the information 
distance between consecutive updates, which increases with pre-
cision and, via the Jarzynski equality (Evans, 2003; Jarzynski, 1997; 
Seifert, 2005), the requisite thermodynamic work. This speaks to 
an intimate relationship between TFE flow, precision, attention 
and experience.
A “simple” agent with only 
non-imaginative experience
With these preliminaries, we can construct a minimal architec-
ture for an agent that experiences sensations from—and actions 
on—its environment E, but does not experience imaginations. This 
architecture is illustrated in Fig. 3. This agent implements mul-
tiple QRFs that read from and write on the informative sector 
of its boundary or MB ℬ. These QRFs implement the agent’s 
processing and categorization of sensations and its execution 
of actions; hence they collectively specify the agent’s repertoire 
of sensory and action capabilities. Attentional control is imple-
mented by an executive system, which is metacognitive in the 
sense that it both monitors and exerts control over the behav-
ior of the “lower-level” QRFs that act directly on ℬ. In particular, 
the executive/metacognitive system allocates TFE to each QRF to 
control its processing ability and/or rate (in classical formulations 
this “rate” can be read as the precision or attention afforded to 
the sensory sectors of MBs). This executive/metacognitive sys-
tem is itself an agent, with its own boundary/MB and its own 
environment, the local components of which are the QRFs imple-
mented by S. Like any FEP agent, the executive/metacognitive 
system senses and acts on its environment via its own, meta-
level QRFs, which collectively implement its meta-level predictive
model.
We assume that each of the low-level QRFs implemented by the 
system incorporates a TFE usage monitor as discussed above, and 
that the executive/metacognitive system allocates TFE to these 
QRFs in accord with their usage, their current priority as com-
puted by the executive/metacognitive system, and the overall 
availability of TFE. Under conditions of insufficient TFE, the exec-
utive/metacognitive system can implement a “stress response” 
that may include differential activation of QRFs or simply shutting 
down some processes altogether. Some QRFs, for example QRFs 
that monitor and control resources essential for homeostasis, may 
be refractory to TFE regulation by the executive/metacognitive 
system. If an induced stress response produces detectable actions 
on ℬ, e.g. molecular secretions, bioelectric field changes, bodily 
movements or vocalization, the system S will experience its stress 
response; if no detectable actions on ℬ are generated, it will not. 
If the TFE supply falls below the threshold required to operate its 
QRFs, S will cease to have experiences.
The internal boundary ℬMC of the executive/metacognitive sys-
tem is an “inner screen” that mediates classical communications 
between the executive/metacognitive system and the QRFs that it 
controls. A system with this architecture may have many other 
internal boundaries and hence many other inner screens; for 
example, any or all of its QRFs may have internal boundaries 
between hierarchical processing layers. This potential complexity 
is elided in Fig. 3 and as will be seen below, is irrelevant to what S
experiences. 
If we equate the experience of a system with the sensations 
from its environment that are encoded by its boundary/MB, then 
S experiences inputs from and, via their effects on subsequent 
sensations, outputs to its environment E.
8 The executive/metacog-
nitive component of S experiences inputs from and outputs to 
the QRFs implemented by S. These experiences are correlated—S’s 
executive/metacognitive component only experiences a QRF out-
put when S experiences an input to that QRF—but have different 
content; they are, in particular, experiences of entirely different 
environments. If we take S to represent an E. coli, for example, S
experiences some external milieu, e.g. the nutritious medium in a 
laboratory culture dish, while its internal executive/metacognitive 
component, a complex of gene regulatory pathways, experiences 
the macromolecular milieu inside the E. coli cell. Should any of 
the components of S, e.g. S’s QRFs, have internal boundaries, 
these internal boundaries will encode experiences for the inter-
nal components that they bound, but unless some mechanism 
8 The environmental feedback that enables the experience of actions may 
be very fast; one can see one’s hand moving via feedback at the speed of 
light. Even neural reafferance loops are “environmental” for a brain from an 
informational-boundary perspective.

implemented by an executive/metacognitive system (orange rectangle). Both the agent S as a whole and the executive/metacognitive component have

the TFE distribution system are shown by grey hatching; the informative sectors of boundaries are dull blue. Red vertical arrow indicates that TFE 
inputs to some QRFs, e.g. homeostatic interoception, can over-ride attenuation by the executive/metacognitive system. Equating what is experienced 
with what is encoded on the informative sector of the boundary/MB, the overall agent S experiences sensations from and actions on its environment E, 
while its executive/metacognitive component experiences inputs from and outputs to the QRFs labeled 1, 2, … n. Neither S nor its 
executive/metacognitive component have imaginative experiences, i.e. experiences of something other than their interactions with their own 
environments.
also encodes them on the boundary of S, they will be irrelevant 
to the experience of S. The architecture shown in Fig. 3, therefore, 
cleanly separates the experience of S from the potential experi-
ences of any of its components without having to invoke an a priori
restriction on the experiences of components, e.g. the “Principle of 
Exclusivity” employed in IIT 3.0 (Tononi, 2015).
While an agent such as that shown in Fig. 3 has no imagina-
tive experience, it may be cognitively sophisticated, e.g. having 
internally-encoded memories and the ability to compute EFEs 
and hence to choose alternative action policies. To continue the 
previous example, E. coli cells are able to choose between and 
execute different behavioral policies subserving chemotaxis. To 
do this, they must encode internal memories and compute EFEs, 
which they do via well-characterized biochemical networks (Fields 
et al., 2021). Organisms much more complex than bacteria, e.g. 
“lower” vertebrates such as fish or reptiles, are clearly capable 
of context-dependent action selection without any evidence of 
imaginative abilities. When processes in such systems are “off 
line”—decoupled from the environment—they may be entirely 
non-conscious.
While a Fig. 3 agent has no imaginative experiences, it can 
monitor its own cognition, including its metacognitive compu-
tations, provided these processes couple to the environment by 
generating actions on ℬ as output. Systems without imagination 
are not, therefore, necessarily metacognitive zombies. For exam-
ple, a Fig. 3 agent could engage in conscious, deliberate planning 
by reporting metacognitively-executed planning steps to itself via 
vocalized speech. It could, if equipped with the appropriate QRFs, 
use pencil and paper to record notes on its deliberations, draw dia-
grams, or perform calculations. However, it could only do these 
things overtly, and hence in a sense publically. Lacking imagina-
tion, it could not engage in inner speech, inner imagination, or 
computation “in its head.” It would, in other words, be incapable 
of any experienced covert actions.
Equipping agents with imaginative 
experience
Why is imaginative experience problematic?
Imaginative experience raises three questions for the FEP. Employ-
ing the idea of an “inner screen”ℬin on which such experiences are 
encoded, they can be posed as:
1 How can QRFs defined on ℬ be re-deployed to access infor-
mation encoded on an inner screen ℬin?
2 How are the contents of imaginative experiences generated 
and written onto ℬin?
3 How can the contents of imaginative experiences be surpris-
ing?
Answering these question requires an architectural model of an 
agent S that:
i Specifies the architectural and functional relationship 
between the S-E boundary ℬ and the inner screen ℬin.
ii Specifies the control structure that switches attention 
between inputs encoded on and outputs directed to ℬ and 
inputs encoded on and outputs directed to ℬin.
iii Explains how ℬin-directed actions are initiated and exe-
cuted.
iv Explains how ℬin-directed actions can be unpredictable by, 
and hence surprising to S.
To construct such a model, we will employ two assumptions. 
First, we assume that the same set of QRFs that are used to 
interpret input from and act on the external environment are 
also used to implement imaginative experience by interacting 
with ℬin. This is a strong constraint, as it restricts S’s repertoire 
of imaginative experiences to a subset, not necessarily proper, 
10 Fields et al.
Figure 4. Adding an inner screen ℬin and a control layer to the architecture shown in Fig. 3 enables imaginative experiences that employ the same 
QRFs as non-imaginative experience. The agent S can, with this architecture, choose to perceive and act on the external environment E or on an 
“imagined environment” encoded only on ℬin. Horizontal red arrows indicate that some external inputs can over-ride being attenuated by the 
executive/metacognitive system; this over-ride capability can be expected to be both state- and trait-variable.
of its repertoire of environmentally-driven experiences. It also 
implies that ℬin requires no distinct thermodynamic sector, i.e. 
the thermodynamic requirements of imaginative experience are 
handled by the same mechanisms that handle the thermody-
namic requirements of non-imaginative experience, with TFE both 
sourced and exhausted through the thermodynamic sector of ℬ. 
Second, we assume that while imaginative experience may be 
coarse-grained relative to externally-sourced experience, it is not 
required to be so coarse-grained. Hence we assume that all QRFs 
capable of contributing to imaginative experience do so at full
resolution.
Sector-specific gating between ℬ and ℬin
The simplest solution to the problems posed above is an architec-
ture in which S’s QRFs act only on, and hence S experiences only
sensations and actions encoded on, an inner screen ℬin. A min-
imal architecture implementing this solution is shown in Fig. 4. 
This architecture modifies that of Fig. 3 by interposing an inner 
screen ℬin between S’s QRFs and the informative sector of its 
boundary—relabeled ‘ℬout’—with E. It also adds a control layer of 
QRF-specific gates that allow input and output to flow between 
ℬin and ℬout. If these gates are all open, ℬin is rendered “trans-
parent” and S experiences sensations from and acts on E, i.e. the 
architecture functions exactly like the architecture of Fig. 3. If the 
gates are closed, S experiences only sensations that result from 
its own actions on ℬin. Some inputs, e.g. homeostatic interocep-
tion, may be refractory to executive control, and hence difficult or 
even impossible to turn off. If some gates are open and some are 
closed, S experiences a combination of external and imaginative
content. 
Individually gating input and output channels from S’s QRFs, 
and hence sectors of both ℬin and ℬout, enables S to experience 
imaginations in some modalities and external inputs in others. 
Humans clearly have this ability, e.g. the ability to engage in 
unvoiced inner speech while driving a car. At a higher level of 
resolution, it enables a mix of imaginative and external inputs 
in a single modality, e.g. hallucinating an imaginary person in an 
externally perceived room. It is worth noting that cross-modality 
mixtures of imagination and externally-driven experience are typ-
ically both voluntary and useful, while within-modality mixtures 
are sometimes involuntary and pathological.
Externally-imposed selective pressures on living systems can 
be expected to yield control gates between ℬin and ℬout that do 
not completely close, and can be over-ridden by external sig-
nals of sufficient amplitude. Selective pressures on mammals, for 
example, can be expected to yield ventral attention systems that 
can override the dorsal attention system. In humans, this ven-
tral override capability can be defeated pharmacologically, e.g. by 
alcohol. “Leaky” valves between ℬin and ℬout can be expected, in 
general, to produce a somewhat fuzzy and maleable boundary 
between imagined and external worlds, an effect that is evident in 
hyperphantasia (Zeman, 2024), schizotypy (Humpston et al., 2017), 
psychosis, and intoxication (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019).
Generating imaginative contents
In the architecture of Fig 4, imaginative contents are actions on 
ℬin that are fed back into the QRFs that generated them instead 
of being passed outward to ℬout. They are, therefore, generated in 
exactly the same way that actions on the external world are gen-
erated. There is, in other words, nothing metaphysically “special” 
about the generation of imaginative content.
Whether S is a metacognitive zombie similarly depends on the 
QRFs it implements just as it does in the imagination-incapable 
architecture of Fig. 3. As in Fig. 3, S does not experience what is 
written on the executive/metacognitive system’s boundary ℬMC. 
Only the executive/metacognitive system experiences these data. 
Unlike in Fig. 3, an imagination-capable S does experience the 
results of writing selected covert actions on ℬin, e.g. inner speech, 
visual images, or other modal imaginings. Because the processing 
capabilities of the QRFs do not differ between Figs 3 and 4, noth-
ing can be imagined in Fig. 4 that cannot be experienced overtly by 
either architecture. Nothing can be said, for example, with inner 
speech that cannot also be voiced, though the consequences of 
voicing thoughts to E may be very different from the consequences 
of keeping them covert. The architecture of Fig. 4 is, therefore, 
fully consistent with the “flat mind” proposed on the basis of both 
behavioral and neurocognitive data by Chater (2019).
How can imaginative content be surprising?
We are now in a position to address the primary challenge to 
theories of imagination posed by the FEP: if imaginations are inter-
nally generated, how can they be surprising? Imagination would 
Free-energy principle and conscious experience  11
be useless if its content was not surprising. What good would 
inner speech be, for example, if you could not discover anything 
by using it? If an agent were fully aware of its generative model, 
consciously worked through all of its predictions, and could con-
sciously monitor its actions, it could never be surprised by its 
covert actions on its own inner screen. Such a system could learn 
nothing from imagination; an imagination capability, and hence 
an inner screen, would just be costly architectural baggage.
In the architecture of Fig. 4, covert action generates a predic-
tion for the next imaginative input. This prediction process has 
no access to the immediately-preceding action selection, which 
is performed by the executive/metacognitive system. What does 
this imply about how the executive/metacognitive system reads 
and writes from its boundary? The environment of the execu-
tive/metacognitive system is (mostly) the collection of QRFs. Their 
behavior—what they report as output to the MC—is what triggers 
the surprise. The executive/metacognitive system has a model 
of its environment—a model of what the QRFs do and how they 
work—but this model must be learned and so cannot be fully 
accurate. This reflects the fact that the executive/metacognitive 
system is just an ordinary agent living in an ordinary environment, 
even though this environment is locally internal to S.
A system S with the architecture of Fig. 4 can be surprised by 
its imaginative experience, therefore, because it is not aware of its 
generative model and does not know how its own actions are gener-
ated. We can say this as: we (systems like S) do not know how our 
QRFs work, and neither do our executive/metacognitive systems. 
The Executive Network is controlling a system that it only has 
a coarse-grained, heuristic model of. This idea that systems are 
ignorant of their own internal processing is, again, fully compli-
ant with the “flat mind” concept, and with views in the philosophy 
of mind that treat self-knowledge and knowledge of other minds 
alike as based on inference (Sellars, 1997 ). It follows, moreover, 
as a constraint on all classical information processors via Ashby’s 
Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby, 1956), and as a theorem for any 
bounded quantum system (Fields et al., 2024).
Metacognition as an expected free energy 
calculator
The FEP models planning as policy selection following computa-
tion of expected free energies for possible courses of action. A pri-
mary task of the executive/metacognitive system is, therefore, EFE 
calculation. As we have seen, however, the executive/metacog-
nitive system cannot have a fully-accurate model of the QRFs it 
interacts with, so it cannot have a fully-accurate model of either 
the sources of its inputs or the capabilities of its outputs. It cannot, 
therefore, reliably compute EFEs.
Systems with imaginative capability have, therefore, a qual-
itative advantage over systems that lack this ability: a Fig. 4 
system can supplement is unreliable models of how its QRFs 
work by covert experimentation. This process is still unreliable, 
as the results of such experiments must still be interpreted using 
an unreliable model, but experimentation can be expected to 
improve reliability provided the results can be surprising. The exec-
utive/metacognitive system is, in other words, precisely in the 
position of an empirical scientist, as indeed all agents are.
The advantage of experimentation via imagined, covert action 
over straight prediction using an unreliable model of QRF behav-
ior can be expected to increase as the planning depth, and hence 
the anterograde extent of the “cognitive light cone” (CLC) ( Levin, 
2019
) of S increases. It can also be expected to increase as the spa-
tial extent of the CLC increases, as how spatial and object QRFs 
relate may be difficult to compute from their executive/metacog-
nitive system-resident models. Systems that have highly practiced 
overt actions, however, may not require imaginative simulation to 
adequately plan instances of similar actions, particularly if they 
can experience relevant real-time sensory feedback from E while 
carrying the action out.
Discussion
The implementation of imagination
The architectures depicted in Figures 3 and 4 are intentionally 
generic, implying no specifics about implementation beyond com-
partmentalization into the indicated components. In an artifi-
cial system, these boundaries could be realized through classical 
application programming interfaces (APIs) with any underlying 
classical data structures. The processing components could, in 
principle, be implemented by computational modules with any 
sufficiently capable architecture—from a finite lookup table or 
production system to a fully-unitary quantum process. Aside from 
differences in running time and TFE consumption, the behaviors 
of these alternative implementations could be made identical.
It is worth emphasizing the implementation independence of 
the current, FEP-based approach in contrast to IIT 3.0. Within 
the FEP framework, implementation independence is principled: 
observations of a system cannot penetrate beyond its MB and 
hence cannot reveal implementation details. This is, obviously, 
a black-box assumption, and the requirement of implementa-
tion independence can be traced to the fundamental theorems 
of Moore (1956), and beyond them to the Church-Turing thesis. 
Experimental disassembly accompanied by theoretical decom-
position is clearly allowed within the FEP framework, with the 
property of implementation independence then transferred to 
the components. These distinctions reflect the fact that the FEP 
framework is fully scale-free, while IIT 3.0 assumes a particular 
scale that is regarded as “of interest” for the analysis of some 
computational outcome.
Switching from a generic perspective to that of modeling spe-
cific cognitive systems, e.g. humans, it is necessary first to say how 
the informational boundaries specified in Figs. 3 and 4 relate to 
functional or anatomical boundaries in the implementing system. 
It is natural to take the system S to be implemented, in humans 
or other animals, by the nervous system, including both central 
(CNS) and peripheral (PNS) components, and the environment E
to comprise all other components of the organism’s body as well 
as the external environment. This way of relating informational 
and anatomical boundaries makes the nervous system the “agent 
of interest” and focuses attention on how it observes and acts on 
the rest of the body as its immediate environment. This mapping 
allows us to make sense, in particular, of the rest of the body 
as the exclusive source of TFE for the nervous system, and of 
homeostatic interoception and its associated control functions as 
observation and (partial) control over the functioning of the rest 
of the body.
This way of relating the boundaries clearly does not work in the 
case of non-neural organisms. As there is currently no evidence 
for imaginative cognition in non-neural organisms, this does not 
pose a problem for the current analysis. However, there are also 
considerations that tell against the idea that the boundary of S
(the subject of typical whole-system level conscious experience 
in human-like organisms) extends to the peripheral nervous sys-
tem. It is common, for example, to experience features across 
different sensory modalities co-located in the same 3D space (e.g. 
the sound and visual appearance of my fingers snapping). It is 
12 Fields et al.
difficult to account for this sort of “unity” of conscious expe-
rience if ℬin resides very close to the sensorimotor periphery, 
where cross-modal information has not yet been integrated into 
a shared spatial reference frame, and visual and auditory infor-
mation would presumably be written to and read from distinct 
“locations” on the peripheral screen. Classic arguments for Carte-
sian intuitions, such as the reality of “phantom limb” syndrome, 
also tell against the inclusion of peripheral systems as neces-
sary components of S, since qualitatively similar experiences may 
occur in the absence of the peripheral parts.
9
While the boundaries of S may thus remain inevitably fuzzy 
at the population level, it is easier to generalize about the core. 
In our model, the fundamental enabler of both experience and 
information processing is TFE flow. The most basic function of 
awareness is, therefore, the monitoring and control of TFE flow. 
In mammals, this is a function of the PNS together with brain-
stem and mid-brain nuclei. Hence our model is broadly consistent 
with that of Solms (2013), which emphasizes the importance of 
interoception—the sensing of internal bodily states—in generat-
ing consciousness. Solms proposes, in particular, that the Freudian 
id, associated with instinctual drives and emotions, is a nec-
essary enabler of consciousness; see Safron (2021b) for critical 
commentary. We would phrase this differently, as the claim that 
the experience of homeostatic interoception is the most funda-
mental kind of experience for a neural organism. In either case, 
interoceptive processes form the foundation of conscious experi-
ence, upon which higher-order cognitive processes are built. The 
idea of interoception as observation of the body clearly aligns with 
our approach, highlighting that what a system can be conscious 
of is encoded peripherally, while whether the system is conscious 
of those contents is encoded centrally by the energy/arousal dis-
tribution system, the executive system, and their interaction. We 
can expect highly distributed neural correlates of consciousness, 
and look forward to the Global Neuronal Workspace versus IIT 
experiments (Consortium, 2023) to test this expectation.
Memory and the phenomenology of imagination
The processes of imagination and memory are inherently influ-
enced by our internal bodily states. Arousal and interoception 
shape our immediate conscious experience, both via attentional 
control and affect, and influence how we reconstruct past events. 
Through the integration of interoceptive signals with memory, 
the metacognitive system generates rich, embodied simulations. 
Imaginatively reconstructed episodic memories are thus con-
nected to our internal physiological states.
Imaginatively reconstructed episodic memory serves multiple 
functions, primarily to update our predictive models of the world 
(Friston, 2017). Retrograde mental time travel (remembering the 
past) often serves anterograde mental time travel (planning for the 
future), as the metacognitive system gets refined based on past 
experiences. Episodic recall is not exclusively future-oriented; it 
also reinforces self-identity and supports emotional regulation.
The subjective-timescale model presented by Zakharov et al.
(2021) shows that by collecting episodic memories based on salient 
9 Later on, we will discuss trait variability in the capacity for imagina-
tive experience. Perhaps the most sane thing to say about the extension of 
S is that it, too, may vary, not only across species but (to a lesser extent) 
both across individuals and perhaps across time in the same individual. Philo-
sophical debates about the richness or paucity of perceptual experience, for 
example, may appear intractable in part because different parties to the debate 
experience the contents of inner screens that exist at different computational 
distances from ℬout, and thus correspond to different degrees of multimodal 
sensory integration and thus to genuinely different experienced contents. At 
the least, we have as yet considered no principles that rule out such variability.
events, an agent has flexible temporal reasoning that can support 
both retrospective analysis and prospective planning. The Husser-
lian concept of a “living present” that integrates past, present, 
and future experiences (Albarracin et al., 2022; Bogotá and Djeb-
bara, 2023) depends on tight coupling between retrospective and 
prospective processes. The agent can simulate both past and 
future scenarios, supporting counterfactual thinking and enabling 
individuals to learn from past experiences and imagine potential 
future outcomes (Parr and Pezzulo, 2021). The hierarchical struc-
ture of these models, with multiple timescales of representation, 
mirrors the brain’s ability to integrate immediate experiences with 
longer-term memories and plans.
Covert actions are written on the inner screen ℬin to simulate 
past experiences or imagine future scenarios without engaging 
in overt behavior. Thus, episodic memory serves multiple func-
tions, including updating predictive models and supporting both 
retrograde and anterograde mental time travel (Friston, 2017). The 
surprise generated by covert actions on the inner screen, due to 
the metacognitive system’s imperfect model of the QRFs, can lead 
to new insights or unexpected associations. This surprise-driven 
process could account for the creative and adaptive aspects of 
episodic memory, enabling the agent to discover novel connec-
tions between past experiences and potential future situations.
Constant, Friston and Clark (2024) define creativity as a rolling 
process of hypothesizing solutions to problems, testing them, 
and evincing solutions that are both novel (statistically different 
from other products) and apt (responding to task demands). In 
their simulations, creativity emerged when agents were placed 
in “exploration bubbles” that perturbed their normal operating 
conditions. A creative process could be implemented through 
the interaction between the metacognitive system and the QRFs. 
When faced with a novel problem, the metacognitive system could 
initiate a process of “cognitive husbandry” by manipulating the 
inner screen ℬin to create challenging scenarios. The QRFs, repre-
senting past experiences and potential future states, would then 
interact with these perturbed scenarios on ℬin, potentially leading 
to novel combinations and insights.
The surprise generated by these novel combinations mani-
fests as unexpected patterns of activation on ℬMC. Such surpris-
ing patterns could then feed back to the metacognitive system, 
potentially leading to updates in the agent’s world model and 
decision-making processes. Creativity thus takes place within the 
constraints of the agent’s existing model space. Constant, Fris-
ton and Clark (2024) suggests that this addresses the Enlightened 
Room Problem (i.e. the problem of accounting for how prediction-
error-minimizing agents can seek novelty and act creatively) by 
showing how novel solutions can emerge without expanding the 
bounds of the agent’s prediction arena.
The separation between the metacognitive system and the 
QRFs explains why episodic recall can feel like “re-experiencing” 
rather than simply retrieving information, as the process involves 
actively reconstructing experiences on the inner screen rather 
than accessing stored data.
Pathologies of the inner screen
The model of imaginative experience presented here suggests that 
disturbances in mental functioning, such as depression and anx-
iety disorders, may at least in some cases result from disruptions 
in the functioning of the inner screen ℬin and/or its relationship 
with the external world via ℬout. At the core of many of these disor-
ders are disruptions of allostasis and interoception (Friston, 2023), 
which may manifest as alterations in the content and dynam-
ics of the inner screen. We do not, of course, claim that the 
Free-energy principle and conscious experience  13
remarks below constitute a full account of either the etiology or 
the phenomenology of such conditions.
In depression, the brain’s internal model, whose traces appear 
on ℬin, eventually becomes heavily biased toward negative pre-
dictions and inefficient energy regulation. This aligns with Barrett 
et al.’s view of depression as a disorder of allostasis (Barrett et al., 
2016). Persistently pessimistic interoceptive predictions may lead 
to the subjective experience of fatigue, low mood, and somatic 
symptoms characteristic of depression. While negative imagery is 
an important feature of clinical depression, the inability of inter-
nal components to take covert actions that produce surprising 
effects on the inner screen—whether positive or negative—could 
lead to stable imaginative experience with negative valence, and 
hence is arguably sufficient to bootstrap the disorder. Since action 
on the internal screen is, as discussed above, no different in kind 
from the initiation of external action, depressed individuals can 
be expected to be less likely to visit novel paths in the external 
world (i.e. they lack motivation to pursue changes from the status 
quo), and thus come to predict less variety, a vicious cycle.
Moreover, chronically accurate prediction of sensory inputs (an 
internal analogue of the “depressive realism” hypothesis ( Moore 
and Fresco, 2012 )), which is facilitated by a reduced variety 
of experiences, may contribute to literally low-energy (i.e. low-
TFE) states of the internal components responsible for initiating 
covert action: only unexpected inputs require posterior belief 
updates, necessitating computation that would attract metabolic 
resources. Lack of belief updating may then over time give rise to 
a lethargic condition in the mechanisms responsible for initiat-
ing covert action, a mechanism that might also partially explain 
core aspects of aging and senescence. Energetic inefficiency, as 
proposed by Barrett et al. (2016), manifests as psychomotor retar-
dation, lack of motivation, and the cognitive difficulties often seen 
in depression, as the system struggles to allocate resources for 
generating varied and dynamic content on the inner screen.
A key feature of both depression and anxiety disorders is rumi-
native episodic memory. In our model, rumination is a maladap-
tive attempt to update internal models, where the metacognitive 
system becomes stuck in a loop of recalling negative experi-
ences (Jin et al., 2024 ). This process occurs on the inner screen, 
with the system repeatedly replaying negative scenarios without 
successfully integrating this information to improve future pre-
dictions (Knolle et al., 2023). This “stuck” state might result from 
overly precise priors about negative outcomes or an imbalance 
in the gating between ℬin and ℬout, leading to a stable atten-
tional focus on negatively valenced imaginative content—e.g. 
ruminative narrative—with reduced attention to external sensory
input.
The gating mechanism in depression may strongly favor ℬin
over ℬout, explaining the tendency for depressed individuals to 
become absorbed in negative internal narratives at the expense 
of engaging with the external world. In anxiety disorders, this 
manifests as excessive simulation of negative future scenarios on 
the inner screen (Limongi et al., 2023). Depression might involve a 
reduction in the counterfactual depth of the inner screen’s con-
tent (Rappe and Wilkinson, 2023). The ability to generate or utilize 
alternative scenarios, particularly positive ones, may be impaired. 
This could account for the difficulty depressed individuals have 
in imagining positive future outcomes or alternative interpreta-
tions of events, all of which would normally be simulated on the 
inner screen. The metacognitive layer manages the inner screen’s 
content and may become locked into a state where it contin-
ually reinforces negative models. This explains the persistence 
of depressive symptoms despite environmental changes, as the 
inner screen remains dominated by negative content even when 
external circumstances improve.
Depression thus entails altered precision weighting, where 
inappropriately high precision is assigned to negative content 
on the inner screen, with low precision given to positive sen-
sory inputs from ℬout. This explains why depressed individuals 
often discount positive experiences and overemphasize negative 
ones—the inner screen becomes “stuck” displaying high-precision 
negative content. These factors interact in a self-reinforcing cycle 
on the inner screen. Altered interoceptive predictions lead to nega-
tive bodily sensations being prominently displayed, reinforcing the 
gating bias toward internal states and further reducing engage-
ment with potentially positive external inputs. The impaired 
counterfactual thinking limits the ability to populate the inner 
screen with alternative scenarios or solutions, maintaining the 
pessimistic internal model.
We can also account for unusual imaginative experiences, 
such as phantom limb pain (Feldman, 2016 ) or hallucinations in 
psychosis (Knolle et al., 2023). In the case of phantom limbs, indi-
viduals continue to experience sensations, including pain, in a 
limb that has been amputated. The persistence of the brain’s inter-
nal model or “body schema” of the missing limb (Makin et al., 
2013) accounts for this. The mismatch between the brain’s expec-
tations (the presence of the limb) and the actual sensory input 
(absence of the limb) leads to the generation of phantom sensa-
tions. These experiences, along with hallucinations in psychosis, 
can be understood as mismatches between interoceptive predic-
tions and actual sensory input (Barrett and Simmons, 2015; Seth, 
2013; Seth et al., 2012). The brain, attempting to minimize pre-
diction error, generates phantom sensations or hallucinations to 
reconcile this discrepancy. In schizophrenia, this mismatch might 
be exacerbated by altered precision-weighting of internal versus 
external signals (Limongi et al., 2023; Friston, 2023).
In some cases, psychosis might be better understood as a 
difficulty in distinguishing or appropriately using counterfactual 
versus factual hypotheses (Rappe and Wilkinson, 2023). This could 
manifest in several ways. There might be a “reality monitor-
ing” breakdown as described by Simons, Garrison and Johnson 
(2019), where counterfactual parts of the model are misidenti-
fied as pertaining to the actual world; or there could be a loss of 
access to parts of the counterfactual model, resulting in an inabil-
ity to access certain alternative hypotheses. Poor counterfactual 
underpinning might occur, in which the agent lacks the ability 
to generate sufficient alternative hypotheses. There could also be 
problems with subjective markers of reality, leading to difficul-
ties in assigning appropriate “reality tags” to experiences ( Rappe 
and Wilkinson, 2023). The internal and external points of refer-
ence, and hence QRFs, used by humans to distinguish “real” from 
“counterfactual” information are poorly understood and may vary 
widely between individuals, and studies of self-deception ( von 
Hippel and Trivers, 2011) and motivated reasoning (Rigoli et al., 
2021) demonstrate. Further work in this area is clearly needed.
Imaginative experiences as internal simulations gated from 
external input can account for both normal imaginative functions 
and their alterations in various psychopathological conditions. 
The same underlying mechanisms can lead to adaptive simu-
lations that guide behavior or maladaptive patterns that main-
tain disorders. In schizophrenia and psychosis, we can explain 
how disruptions in the balance between internal and external 
inputs can lead to reality distortions and cognitive disorganization 
(Sterzer et al., 2018; Limongi et al., 2023). Generating “inaccu-
rate” or counterfactual hypotheses is not unique to psychosis 
but is a crucial part of normal cognition (Rappe and Wilkinson, 
14 Fields et al.
2023). The neurotypical brain constantly generates counterfac-
tual, de-coupled hypotheses as part of its rich tapestry of cognitive 
processes. This “counterfactual depth” underlies our ability to 
engage in complex reasoning, planning, and even our sense of 
reality itself (Seth, 2014; Wilkinson, 2021).
The phylogeny of imagination
The meaning, and therefore the phylogenetic distribution, of “cog-
nition” is a subject of active debate (Bayne et al., 2019 ), with 
positions ranging from the pancognitivism of Maturana and Varela 
(1980) and many others in the basal-cognition movement to a 
primary focus on apparently-unique features of human cogni-
tion (Dehaene et al., 2022 ; Penn et al., 2008). It is not, however, 
clear where or how often in phylogeny a transition from Fig. 3 to 
Fig. 4 architectures has occurred. While imagination may be most 
associated, functionally, with “thinking” and introspection, it also 
underlies such activities as dreaming and imaginative play. Organ-
isms that entirely lack the kind of symbolic reasoning emphasized 
by Penn et al. (2008) or Dehaene et al. (2022) may nonetheless expe-
rience some internally-generated content in some circumstances. 
Whether non-human mammals and other big-brained organisms 
dream is an active research question (Malinowski et al., 2021; 
Manger and Siegel, 2019); a similar question could be asked about 
imaginative play.
We can also ask this phylogenetic question from an evolution-
ary perspective: In what organisms would a capacity for covert 
action be selectively advantageous? Many social situations call 
for covert action in the form of unexpressed thoughts or emo-
tions, and selection for social adeptness was (and still is) strong 
in the human lineage (Dunbar and Shultz, 2007). While the ability 
to deceive is enhanced by the ability to self-deceive (von Hip-
pel and Trivers, 2011), the development of robust self-deception 
in a system incapable of covert action seems unlikely. The dis-
tinction between behaving in a way that is effectively deceptive, 
which may characterize even individual cells in a multicellular 
organism (Fields and Levin, 2020a), and intentionally deceiving via 
covert action is, however, difficult to draw in the absence of inde-
pendent evidence of covert experience. Commonplace instances 
of mimicry, for example, are deceptive but do not suggest any 
experience of active deception.
We are left, therefore, with the usual conundrum about any 
form of experience, one that only advances in comparative func-
tional neuroscience is likely to resolve. Covert action could have
evolved early and often, and would have been selectively advan-
tageous in many contexts. It could, however, also have evolved 
late and seldom—and possibly only in the human lineage—with 
the evident abilities of other systems to deceive being explicable 
without appeal to covert action. The enormous diversity in human 
imaginative abilities, most of which remains uncharacterized by 
functional neuroscience, suggests that the latter option is at least 
plausible.
Human variation in state and trait imagination
Individual humans are capable of—and when it is involuntary, suf-
fer from—state variability in imagination, and human populations 
exhibit substantial trait variability in imagination. That behaviors 
involving high levels of automaticity—including “flow” behaviors 
exhibiting high-level expertise—involve little to no introspective 
cognition or imaginative self-awareness and are characterized by 
strongly-attenuated default network activity is well-established. 
In the notation of Fig. 4, these states involve “turning off” covert 
action by “turning on” the flow of action to the external environ-
ment. Such states are surprisingly common, including all of “type 
1” cognition (Evans and Stanovich, 2013) as well as everyday activi-
ties such as grammatical (native) language use. State variability in 
covert experience can also manifest as pathologically uncontrol-
lable imaginative experience, e.g. in depression or psychosis. State 
variability of this kind has been described in terms of Bayesian pre-
cision modulation (Friston, 2023); Fig. 4 can be seen as assigning a 
locus to the experiential effects of such modulation.
More significant from the present perspective is the large trait 
variability in human imaginative capabilities. Heavey and Hurl-
burt (2008) showed by random experience sampling that some 
behaviorally typical, apparently unimpaired, and undistressed 
humans experience essentially no inner speech or essentially no 
visual imagination. Palombo et al. (2015) found that some healthy 
adults experienced essentially no imaginatively-vivid autobio-
graphical memories. It is now known that some people experience 
little or no imaginative content in some or all modalities (Zeman, 
2024). This condition of aphantasia is not a clinical syndrome and 
those who experience it typically have no obvious deficits,
10 while 
the opposite condition, hyperphantasia, can present as schizotypy 
or symptomatic schizophrenia, as noted above.
The fact that individual humans can be behaviorally typi-
cal, apparently unimpaired, and undistressed while experiencing 
essentially no “inner life” is counter-intuitive for many, and sad-
dles any theories of consciousness that build in requirements for 
covert inner experience with the consequence that some behav-
iorally typical, unimpaired and undistressed humans are in fact 
philosophical “zombies.” From the present perspective, it merely 
suggests that some people have cognitive architectures much 
more like Fig. 3 than like Fig. 4, and that most of us cannot tell 
the difference by external observation.
Conclusion
We have showed here how to implement a system that can sur-
prise itself with its imaginings, something that humans are clearly 
capable of doing. We have used only minimal assumptions that 
are compliant with the FEP; hence the model is completely generic 
and could apply, in principle, to any system, whether biological or 
artificial or a combination of the two.
One novel and important aspect of our approach is that it 
proposes that inputs to and outputs from the categorization or 
conceptual system (i.e. the hierarchy of internal QRFs) are encoded 
on the same boundary, ℬin in Fig. 4. This architecture, which 
is a natural fit with predictive-processing models such as the 
FEP framework—or indeed with any framework that respects 
the inherently bidirectional nature of all physical interactions—
obviates any need for duplicate categorization or conceptual sys-
tems to interpret what is displayed on the inner screen, a com-
mitment that drives critiques, e.g. that of Maturana and Varela 
(1980), of “representationalism” in traditional models of cognition 
and consciousness.
While this question is less central to our proposal, placing the 
inner screen that encodes experience at the whole-system level 
as close to the informational periphery as possible—noting that 
the 3D anatomy of this periphery may be very complicated—
avoids the potential regress of internal “perceptual” processing, 
and attendant risk of circularity, of “theater of consciousness” 
models that postulate an “internal observer” along the lines of 
10 Presumably, aphantasia would impact capacities that directly leverage 
mental imagery—for example, the ability to draw or paint from memory, which 
appears in a rather extreme form in artists such as Stephen Wiltshire, who can 
apparently simply copy inner iconic representations onto canvas just as one 
might draw from a photograph.
Free-energy principle and conscious experience  15
Baars (2005); see Safron (2021a), Safron et al. (2022) for a construc-
tion of “internal observers” as constrained self-models. Encoding 
whole-system level experience peripherally has an immediate and 
powerful consequence: because the same low-level QRFs are used 
for both environmentally-driven and imaginative experience, the 
inputs to and outputs from the executive/metacognitive system 
are not experienced at the whole system level unless they are 
encoded as imaginative content by the lower-level categorization 
or conceptual system, with encoding by inner speech an obvi-
ous example. Again, this consequence is consistent with the “flat 
mind” hypothesis of Chater (2018), and is supported by the evi-
dence adduced in support of that hypothesis. It is inconsistent 
with any models that localize whole-system level experience at 
the boundary of the executive/metacognitive system, as both GW 
models and some varieties of higher-order thought (HOT; Brown 
et al. (2019)) theory are easily interpreted as doing—though the 
condition that experiences can only be of what is inscribed on (rel-
atively peripheral) systemic boundaries is a priori consistent with 
there being internal determinants of whether a system experiences 
a given inscribed content, as in versions of HOT that take relevant 
higher-order states to merely “index” first-order content without 
duplicating it (Lau, 2019 ). Similarly, our proposal is inconsistent 
with models according to which the content of experience is suf-
fused throughout the system, as it appears to be in IIT 3.0 (Balduzzi 
and Tononi, 2009) and the recent models of Bennett, Welsh and 
Ciaunica (2024) and Laukkonen and Chandaria (2024), though it is 
consistent with the processing of experience being fully distributed.
Our model is novel in its treatment of the role of TFE flow in reg-
ulating cognition and hence experience, explicitly distinguishing 
the content of experience, whether interoceptive or exteroceptive, 
from its enabling condition, i.e. from adequate TFE flow to power 
cognition. It also explicitly represents homeostatic interoception 
as refractory to executive/metacognitive control, consistent with 
models of emotional experience as primary.
Like the FEP itself (Friston, 2019 ), the model here depends 
primarily on mathematical and physical assumptions, particu-
larly on the quantization of information that underpins quan-
tum theory, the association between information and energy that 
underpins classical thermodynamics, and the local causality that 
underpins Special Relativity. The model is, therefore, primarily 
a formal demonstration that the FEP can, in fact, account for 
imaginative experience. The primary empirical assumption of 
the model is that environmentally-driven and imaginative expe-
riences are processed by the same QRFs, and hence the same 
physical or anatomical structures in an agent’s body. It is this 
assumption that entails the peripheral encoding of imaginative 
experience, and hence the need for the inner screen ℬin. Any evi-
dence that pathways implementing imagination are distinct from, 
or use conceptual or categorical representations not available 
to, environmentally-driven sensory pathways, would be evidence 
against this model. We acknowledge that direct tests of the model 
may not be feasible; while neuroimaging methods reveal the pro-
cessing pathways involved in sensory experience, they do not 
reveal the locus of encoding of experiential contents. While it is 
plausible to identify the informational boundary of a cell with 
its membrane, or of a brain with its sensory interfaces, including 
those in the brainstem, the informational boundary of the “I” that 
reports subjective experiences is notoriously undefined. Identify-
ing the anatomical locus of the proposed ℬin is, therefore, not at all 
straightforward; as noted earlier, the anatomy of ℬin may be very 
complex. That said, understanding both the transition from Fig. 3 
architectures to Fig. 4 architectures in phylogeny and the large 
trait diversity in imaginative experience of humans will require 
substantial advances in functional neuroscience, in particular in 
mapping the anatomical correlates of system-scale informational 
boundaries. We hope the work presented here will be useful in 
guiding this process.
