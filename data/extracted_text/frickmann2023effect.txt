Abstract
Purpose of Review Music therapy has seen increasing applications in various medical fields over the last decades. In the vast 
range of possibilities through which music can relieve suffering, there is a risk that—given its efficacy—the physiological  
underpinnings are too little understood. This review provides evidence-based neurobiological concepts for the use of  
music in perioperative pain management.
Recent Findings The current neuroscientific literature shows a significant convergence of the pain matrix and neuronal 
networks of pleasure triggered by music. These functions seem to antagonize each other and can thus be brought to fruition 
in pain therapy. The encouraging results of fMRI and EEG studies still await full translation of this top-down modulating 
mechanism into broad clinical practice.
Summary We embed the current clinical literature in a neurobiological framework. This involves touching on Bayesian 
“predictive coding” pain theories in broad strokes and outlining functional units in the nociception and pain matrix. These 
will help to understand clinical findings in the literature summarized in the second part of the review. There are opportunities 
for perioperative practitioners, including anesthesiologists treating acute pain and anxiety in emergency and perioperative 
situations, where music could help bring relieve to patients.

Introduction
Pain is a fundamentally subjective experience. This is 
reflected in the revised International Association for the 
Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain [1 ], where physi-
ological processes of nociception are distinguished from the 
sensation of pain as an emotional experience. The latter dis-
tillates multiple pain mechanisms [2, 3] and converging pain 
pathways [4–6], which individually or collectively influence 
pain perception with varying degrees of importance. Thus, 
the embodiment of pain is comprised of different aspects: 
affective, perceptive, attentive, discriminative, and vegeta-
tive components [7•]. The multidimensional nature of pain 
facilitates external modulatory access to pain processing. 
This has led to an increased interest in and growing body 
of literature on non-pharmacological pain-modulating inter-
ventions [8 –10]. We illustrate neurobiological concepts, 
clinical context, and possible practical applications of the 
pain-modulating effects of music, focusing on the intra- and 
postoperative setting [11, 12•, 13•]. These are outlines from

the viewpoint of anesthesiologists administering music as 
part of a multimodal anesthesia and pain analgesia approach 
[14, 15]. We start from current pain theories embedded in 
the framework of predictive coding models for pain theory 
[16•]. A discussion of neurobiological modulation of pain 
perception and sensation through music [17•, 18, 19] and its 
measurability through electroencephalography (EEG) [20•] 
and vegetative symptoms follows. We provide an overview 
on clinical trials, using music as a remedy or a complimen-
tary treatment for acute pain [21–26]. The evidence presented 
is meant to inform practicing clinicians adopting music into 
their non-pharmacologic therapeutic approach to manage 
pain. We will stress the application of music to the analgesic 
armamentarium. Its effectiveness treats pain while respecting 
the patient’s agency [27•].
The Neurobiology of Pain
The Pain Matrix
Following a noxious stimulus, information on the tissue injury  
is transmitted from the periphery to the posterior horn of  
the spinal cord, where primary pain nerve fibers end and  
synapse. The secondary neuron crosses over and ascends 
contralaterally in the ascending spinal pathways of the anter-
olateral system. Here, the signal can travel one of three ways:
1. The primary nociceptive path of this ascending sys-
tem is the spinothalamic tract. Information on this 
path travels either towards reticular formation (RF) to 
modulate arousal, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the 
mesencephalon (also involved in the autonomic nerv -
ous system and threat response) [28], or is further car -
ried to the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus, medial 
nucleus of the posterior complex (POm), and central 
lateral (CL) (intralaminar) nuclei of the thalamus [29]. 
From here, information can be disseminated to the 
primary somatosensory cortex (PSC, discriminative 
information on noxious stimulus, i.e., precise location) 
and to subcortical and cortical areas, including the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC), hypothalamus, and hippocampus 
(Fig.  1). This allows for generation of an emotional 
reaction to the noxious stimulus, modulation, and 
finally pain perception and vegetative responses [4 , 
5, 30]. The intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus have 
connections to the insular cortex and cingulate cor -
tex (Fig.  2). These areas deal with information on the 
quality of the pain (dull, burning, crude touch) and are 
responsible for emotional associations.
2. Spinal trigeminal projections travel to the RF and con-
tinue with other afferents, ending close to the PAG or in 
the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM; information on 
sharp pain) and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. The 
VPM also has connections to the primary somatosen-
sory cortex.
3. The spinoreticular tract carries information to nuclei in 
the reticular formation and rostral ventromedial medulla 
(RVM) and from there to the intralaminar nuclei of the 
thalamus. These pathways create a multisynaptic circuit, 
the pain matrix [31]. Signal transmission in the ascend-
ing pain pathways is facilitated by norepinephrine as a 
neurotransmitter [29].
Top‑Down Control
Descending pathways originating segmentally in the spinal 
cord [32], as well as from the mesencephalon, specifically 
the periaqueductal gray (PAG) [33–35] and medulla oblon-
gata (rostroventral medulla, RVM), the hypothalamus, and 
the prefrontal cortex, allow for further modulation of pain 
perception and sensation [36]. This second part of the pain 
pathway creates a top-down control [36– 38] and grants 
access points for external pain modulation. Multiple receptor 
types and neurotransmitters are involved in these modulatory 
processes, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), facilitat-
ing interaction between descending fibers and afferent path-
ways in the dorsal horn, blocking or amplifying pain signals. 
These are then further transmitted to the PAG and amygdala 
among others, for re-assessment [29]. Figure  1 displays the 
pain pathways and matrix.
Predictive Coding Models for Pain Theory
When Gardner et al. published their study on auditory anal-
gesia in dentistry in 1959 [39], a vivid debate ensued about 
therapeutic potential and the physiology of analgesia medi-
ated by music and sound [40]. The initial study had shown 
significant analgesia in more than 5000 patients undergoing 
dentistry, while listening to waterfall noise with underlying 
relaxing music. The patients were modulating the intensity 
of the noise overlayed on soothing music. It was argued that 
attention and concentration afforded to this task dissociated 
patients from nociceptive cues. Patients reported that pain 
was present but of inconsequential character. Another group 
of dentists proposed that auditory analgesia could modu-
late pain perception by (1) cross-modality masking, by (2) 
distraction or dissociation, or (3) by suggestion of positive 
emotions. All three could alter the threshold for pain per -
ception. These questions remain unanswered but resonate 
with new concepts of pain perception and musical emotions 
in a very interesting way. Whether music should block out 
nociceptive sensations, alter the weighting of stimuli (gain) 
219Current Pain and Headache Reports (2023) 27:217–226

or just alter the interpretation of a potentially painful stimu-
lus remains unclear. Current theories of predictive coding, 
Bayesian inference in the brain, and reinforcement learning 
offer conceptual depth in reflecting on the problem both in 
clinical-practical and scientific terms. They offer a different 
view on pain genesis, assisting with its comprehension but 
not intending to deny biomedical concepts. Under a “Bayes’ 
brain” assumption [ 41] to “make sense of the world”, the 
brain must integrate all sensory inputs with (social) setting 
information and preexisting knowledge [42•]. Adapted from 
the inference statistical theory, the brain processes pain by 
estimating the probability that a perception (unpleasant 
stimulus) is true, based on preexisting conceptions and 
knowledge [43]. This Bayesian analysis is applied continu-
ously to incoming data (sensory inputs), generating the top-
down signaling cascade. These correspond to the brain’s 
“predictions” about the reality. When ascending informa -
tion from the afferent pain pathways clashes with the brain’s 
predictions—as pain perception—about an incoming stim-
ulus, a so called “prediction error” occurs, prompting re-
analysis with new top-down signals and closing the loop of 
the multisynaptic pain circuitry (Fig.  1) [44•].
Neurobiological Modulation of Pain 
Perception and Sensation Through Music
Music as part of a multimodal intra- and postoperative pain 
management concept has significant effects on both subjec-
tive pain levels and analgesia requirements postoperatively 
[45]. The modulatory influences of music on the brain seem 
to be multidimensional [46], encompassing effects on mood 
and arousal [47] and focus of attention [46].
Pain perception is dependent on the emotional valence 
(positive, negative, neutral) of a stimulus [48]. By changing 
the emotional significance of a painful stimulus, through

cal connections (grey arrows) and regulatory descending pathways 
(blue arrows). Musical sounds stimulate the auditory cortex, which 
has connections to the amygdala (AMG). AMG interconnections 
are indicated with green arrows. Top-down reactions to a simultane-

distraction, induction of a positive frame of mind and 
reduced responsiveness, music can modify pain perception 
[18, 20•]. Comparing the neuronal networks involved in 
pain appraisal with those of music evaluation in the brain 
shows significant convergence. Especially the orbitofrontal 
and insular cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the amygdala, and 
the periaqueductal gray seem to determine both the affec-
tive valence of a nociceptive cue and pleasant music [49 •]. 
Activity and connectivity patterns of these neuronal hubs 
when concomitantly activated by nociception and pleasant 
music may determine the threshold of a perception to be 
felt as pain. This corresponds to “precision” in predictive 
coding theory. EEG findings described by Lu et al. suggest 
that listening to self-chosen music directly before a painful  
stimulus is associated with a decrease in alphaoscillations 
corresponding to an activation of brain areas related to 
music processing, mainly the prefrontal cortex and anterior 
cingulate cortex [20 •]. Thus, it can be hypothesized that 
music activates brain regions involved in descending pain 
pathways andamplifies top-down pain modulation.
The provoked change in emotional appraisal of an 
unpleasant stimulus can be viewed in the context of the 
positive valence musical sounds can have on the state of 
emotional arousal. Musical sounds perceived as pleasant by 
an individual can trigger a dopamine-fueled reward cascade. 
It leads to positive emotions and so-called musical chills as 
the highest state of pleasure caused by music [50– 52] and 
consequently causes a shift in baseline mood and arousal. 
This phenomenon was electroencephalographically meas -
ured by Chabin et al. [50]. The authors were able to demon-
strate a distinct neuronal activity represented by an increase 
in theta-bands in the prefrontal cortex amongst others, dur -
ing subjective positive emotional arousal, and linked this 
specific EEG pattern to a state of “pleasure” [50]. Neuro-
biologically, connectivity between the auditory cortex, the 
amygdala, and a plethora of other regions involved in the 
emotional processing allows for modulation of stimulus per-
ception. Consequently, the cortical representation of a pain-
ful stimulus and thus its significance and evaluation at any 
given time is related to the emotional state of the individual 
[18]. Music induces “pleasurable chills”, and this positive 
emotional arousal state could be identified by the distinct 
EEG pattern, and used to modulate pain induced neuronal 
activity. However, it is important to consider that both musi-
cal experiences and pain are ultimately subjective. Objec-
tifying both is thwarted by the difficulties of quantifying 
the emotional dimensions an organism goes through while 
suffering pain or enjoying music. Along with dopamine-
reward circuits, effects of music on other neurotransmitter 
and neuroendocrine systems have been proposed. Nilsson 
et al. measured rising oxytocin levels during relaxation with 
calming music at 60 to 80 bpm and 50 to 60 dB [53]. In 
addition, a stimulation of endogenous opioid release [54] 
has been theorized as a link to top-down pain-regulating

pathways, but a direct connection between incoming audi-
tory stimuli and decrease in pain response and perception is 
yet to be shown [55•].
The second pain-modulating component of listening to 
music presents as a shift in attentional focus (distraction). 
In neuroimaging methods (magnetoencephalography, MEG), 
this seems to be characterized by a decrease in pain-induced 
delta-amplitudes in the cingulate gyrus and the insular cor -
tex. This shifts attention away from pain towards music [46].
Present-day experimental findings speak for more com-
plicated neuropsychological processes involving preexisting 
expectations responsible for the analgesic effect of pleas-
ant sounds [55•]. This is supported by the predictive model 
of pain perception, viewing the brain not as a behavioralist 
black box [56] where certain inputs mechanistically trigger 
an outcome, but rather as a complex matrix of prior expe-
riences and assumptions, leading to a co-analgesic effect 
[42•, 44•]. The neurobiological base to this psychological 
theory may be viewed to be the interconnections of the pain 
network, the relay of spino-thalamic-cortical and subcortical 
connections [42•]
Measuring Pain Modulation: Neuroimaging, 
EEG, Hormonal, and Vegetative Markers
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis 
has shown different activation patterns of spinal and corti-
cal areas to painful stimuli with music compared to without 
music [57]. This can be seen as neurobiological evidence 
for the hypothesis that music changes (secondary) pain pro-
cessing. However, neuroimaging for pain has its limitations 
[58] as shown in numerous, contradictory, studies over the 
past years trying to isolate brain regions selective for pain. 
These limitations mainly arise from “reverse inference” used 
to deduce the meaning of certain signals in fMRI. There 
seems to be debate amongst neuroscientific researchers as 
to whether MRI signals can be conclusively assigned to spe-
cific neurocellular processes [59, 60].
EEG signals obtained during and after a painful stimu -
lus furthermore suggest that preferred music decreases the 
unpleasantness (subcortical affective pain component of 
the amygdala, insular cortex, and PAG), though not the per-
ceived pain intensity (cortical somatosensory discriminatory 
and attentional prefrontal pain component) [20•, 48, 61]. Lu 
et al. [20•] could not conclude whether an alteration of the 
emotional state of the participants or a diversion of atten-
tion away from the painful stimulus evoked a decrease in 
pain sensation. More recent findings lean towards a mecha-
nism where assigned emotion influences the affective com-
ponent of pain (unpleasantness) more than the attentional 
component [48]. Williams and Hine [26] found that across 
39 articles, distraction (in terms of gate control theory [36]) 
was mostly used as an underlying mechanism to explain the 
analgetic effectiveness of music, followed by relaxation, 
emotional shift, oscillatory entrainment of neuronal activ -
ity, and endogenous analgesics stimulated by music (opioid 
receptor expression, interleukine-6, and morphine-6 glucu-
ronide [62] or increase in endorphins [63, 64]). The analysis 
showed that despite the effort of explaining the underlying 
mechanisms, most of the studies did not select music with 
parameters conducive to these processes [26]. For example, 
if entrainment is to be considered a valid contributor to the 
pain-relieving effect of intraoperative music, this connection 
should be explored further through EEG studies under seda-
tion and general anesthesia, respectively. It is hypothesized 
that music, with a steady rhythm and frequencies around 60 
to 80 bpm, could be ideal to promote a decrease in sympa-
thetic activity and thus stress [26, 62, 65, 66].
Brain regions involved in pain processing, namely, the 
PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus, are also involved in stress 
response [67]. These in turn have close connections to the 
hypothalamus and thus to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal  
(HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by 
signaling to the adrenal glands [68]. When matched for time  
of day and circadian rhythms, Koelsch et al. [69] found  
lower intraoperative cortisol levels in patients receiving music 
during general anesthesia as well as deeper sedation stages 
as measured by bispectral indices (BIS). This suggests lower 
sedative requirements and consequently a lower activation of 
the SNS in patients undergoing musical intervention. This 
supports earlier cortisol level results from Nilsson et al. [70], 
but contradicts others showing no effect on stress hormone 
levels and BIS [71].
Measuring cortical electrical signals has been shown to 
be a useful and accessible tool to determine effects of both 
musical [72] and painful stimuli on brain activity. We pro-
pose that future studies use raw EEG sedation stages and 
wave patterns as an additional feasible outcome measure 
for intraoperative stress and pain perception. Co-analgesic 
effects of music characteristics matching specific EEG 
patterns could be analyzed for their potential to reduce 
pain unpleasantness.
Clinical Context: Opioid‑Sparing Effects 
and Postoperative Recovery
To objectify the clinical analgesic effect of perioperative 
music interventions, the following outcome parameters seem 
to have been most useful: the effect on postoperative pain 
during the first 24 h after general anesthesia (self-reported 
on the NRS, quantified by reduction in opioid requirements 
[13•]), the effect on intraoperative analgesic requirements 
under general anesthesia as quantified by intraoperative opi-
oid dosage, the influence on the duration of the hospital 
222 Current Pain and Headache Reports (2023) 27:217–226

stay, and the effect on successful early mobilization. The 
most feasible measure of the effect on intraoperative stress 
and pain reaction to surgical intervention seems to be heart 
rate variability [73], with neuroendocrine measurements not 
being easily applicable to the daily anesthesiology practice.
So far, no significant reduction in length of hospital stays, time 
spent in the intensive care unit, or overall costs during hospitali-
zation through music-analgesia could be demonstrated [13•, 74].
Most of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses, includ-
ing recent publications by Fu et al. [13 •] and Dale [86 •], 
found a reduction in postoperative opioid requirements after 
perioperative music across all analyzed studies [ 75], which 
cemented the conclusions of Kühlmann et al. [9 ] pointing 
towards significant reductions in pain levels in patients receiv-
ing musical interventions during general anesthesia. This con-
trasts with an earlier meta-analysis which did not find signifi-
cant differences in pain levels for patients being played music 
during colonoscopies [76]. However, the very limited target 
group must be considered here. A subsequent analysis of pain 
reduction through music during different endoscopic proce-
dures showed that no significant analgesic-saving effect could 
be detected, especially during colonoscopies and bronchos-
copies [77]. Further research is needed to determine patient 
subgroups who would most benefit from peri-interventional 
and perioperative music. Currently available publications of 
clinical trials and randomized-controlled studies in adults are 
predominantly published in the field of orthopedic surgery, 
urology and obstetrics, and ophthalmology, as well as inter-
ventional radiology and heart and thoracic surgery [78–84]. 
Orthopedic and thoracic surgery focused on postoperative 
musical interventions during recovery [10], although all stud-
ies found reductions in procedural pain through music.
Clinical Applications
The currently available body of literature is very heteroge-
neous, which makes concrete conclusions for practice only 
possible to a limited extent. In order to make use of music as 
a tangible co-analgesic, a feasible framework for such inter-
vention needs to be defined. Further research needs to deter-
mine the differences and optimal timing of the intervention 
(solely preoperatively, solely intraoperatively, solely postop-
eratively, from induction of general anesthesia or sedation 
until after emergence). Compelling evidence for preserved 
auditory sensory perception under general anesthesia [85] 
suggests that intraoperative acoustic stimulation with music 
could maintain its pain-modulating effect even during deep 
sedation [74]. Comprehensively, the timing of the musi-
cal intervention seems to have only marginal influence on 
postoperative pain reduction [74]. Additionally, it needs to 
be determined which type of music or sounds proves to be 
the most beneficial (patient’s choice, classical or electronic 
sounds of a specific frequency, chosen from preselected 
playlist or free choice, nature sounds, white noise) and for 
which intervention [26]. It must be noted that nature sounds 
have not consistently shown the same analgesic effect as 
self-selected music [55 •]. Fu et al. in their meta-analysis 
excluded all studies that used nature sounds during inter -
vention and focused solely on recorded music [13•]. Future 
research should consider the complex mechanisms of music 
to determine whether the melody, harmony, or rhythm might 
be the determining factor for its analgesic effect [26, 75]. 
Overall, the evidence points to patient-preferred or self-
selected music, respectively, as being the most effective in 
reducing postoperative pain [9, 20•, 86•].
Across all systematic reviews and meta-analysis currently 
available, no adverse effects of musical interventions have 
been reported.
There are currently two ongoing studies registered with 
Clini calTr ials. gov on perioperative musical intervention 
during general anesthesia [87, 88].
Summary and Outlook
There appears to be some consensus that auditory stimula-
tion with music during or after surgical interventions, under 
sedation or general anesthesia, can be considered an effec-
tive and low-cost, low-side-effect complimentary treatment 
to alleviate procedural and postoperative pain. Musical 
interventions have a low-threshold applicability in every -
day clinical practice. Offering music via headphones during 
operations under regional anesthesia, with or without seda-
tion, is already common practice. Anesthesia providers seem 
to hope for a relaxing and distracting effect, especially dur-
ing operations with high noise levels, such as orthopedics. 
Patients can play their own music via their mobile phones 
or choose from a provided music library with a selection of 
genres and artists. In our experience, clinicians do not seem 
to have concrete expectations of reduced intraoperative opi-
oid or sedative requirements when offering musical stimu-
lation to their patients in the operating room. Our aim was 
to concretize anecdotal assumptions of musical analgesia, 
encourage anesthesia teams to systematically use music as 
a co-analgesic, and suggest ways in which future research in 
this area can unite neuropsychological and biological, philo-
sophical, and anesthesiologic theories of pain and conscious-
ness and further establish pain modulatory approaches.
