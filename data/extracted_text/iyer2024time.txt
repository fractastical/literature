Abstract
This article explores the conservation principles that may apply to time, contrasting them with the well-established 
conservation of energy. Publications of peer reviewed papers enabled the author to derive time to be a tensor, algebraic than 
merely arithmetic scalar. Here, these are brought out in a dramatic manner to highlight gradation of high rank tensors, which 
decompose to multiple vectors. This study reexamines time originally as potentially the most conserved attribute in physics, 
considering the quantum nature of well-known established by thermodynamic fundamentalistic energy conservation. 
Literature surveys quoting time conservation versus energy physics studies, especially quantum gravity, Page–Wootters 
formalism, and related areas with concept of time as emergent and travel phenomena associated to time as a wavefunction 
tensor have been highlighted. Mathematical theory derivations showing conservation of time principle with tensor analysis 
giving key equations and establishing time invariance with point in space via differential testing in relation to domains of 
reality of time tensor,  = constant proves that conservation of time applies like the general principle of energy quantum 
conservation well within given conditions. Quantified clocks applying time conservation principle analyze strong gravity 
versus weak gravity environments like microblackholes and the zero-point fields, showing how branes may produce curled 
up dimensions, like Kaluza-Klein 5D curled up dimensions.
Verifications with experimental methods, especially testing time conservation potentially would uncover new fundamental 
principles of physics - time conservation principle after establishment will propel to revolutionize our understanding of the 
universe and drive innovation in both theoretical and applied physics, specifically quantum technologies and astrophysical 
endeavors, especially measurement techniques with LHC, for example have been considered to launch research efforts of the 
future.

definition basis on known physics [https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Time]: Time is the continued sequence of existence and 
events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession 
from the past, through the present, and into the future. This 
corresponds well with that of the well-known dictionary 
definition of time as: (1) the indefinite continued progress of 
existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded 
as a whole: “travel through space and time” (2) a point of 
time as measured in hours and minutes past midnight or 
noon, for example. Reference Listing [1-18] provides physics 
literature that will have extensive specific details on the 
statements, claims, evidential observations, justifications 
of mathematical analysis, derivations, and equations giving 
theoretical proofs of the hypothesis and concepts advanced 
by all these treatises. According to the Hindu Mythology-there 
was limitless ocean before the beginning of the universe, 
when Golden Egg (so called Cosmic Egg) was formed inside 
this ocean, floated one thousand years and then broke into 
two halves through which our universe was created [15]. 
Triggering Problem in the Origin of the Universe]. Using the 
Hindu Mythological concept these authors explain: what 
was before the Big Bang? (i.e., the ocean of supra-physical 
energies); where did the Big Bang take place? (i.e., inside 
the Cosmic Egg); the Triggering Source (i.e., the size of the 
Cosmic Egg). The significance of their proposed model is that: 
it explains the presence of golden ratio everywhere in every 
living as well as non-living objects as a relic of the creation 
moment - a universal footprint of golden flow originated at 
the creation moment of our universe.
Questions that have been asked on time are whether it is 
present in conservation as the implicit or explicit dimension. 
Holling H [5] argues that thinking of time so far has not 
involved conservation, merely perhaps only as episteme with 
theoretical engagement and research activities, with method 
of measurement with clocks, machines, scientific apparatus, 
historic chronology, industry, and labor. In the Copenhagen 
interpretation, conservation time exists as a merely 
implied dimension. Holling H [5] adapted the sequential, 
chronological time that results in the understanding of 
time merely as a method of its measurement – the time of 
clocks, machines, scientific apparatus, historic chronologies, 
industry, and labor. According to Holling H [5], while critical 
theory, philosophy and art practice have long been engaged 
with anachronistic and heterochronic interpretations of 
historical time. In this regard, decay of energy to entropy 
may be considered to define arrow of time.
The conservation of energy is a cornerstone of classical 
and modern physics, addressing issues such as the ultraviolet 
catastrophe through quantum mechanics. However, the 
vacuum catastrophe presents a new challenge, particularly in 
the context of general relativity. This paper proposes a novel 
perspective: the conservation of time. By examining time as 
a tensor, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of its 
role in the universe’s fundamental states, from high infinite 
temperatures to absolute zero. With tensor theoretically 
time to be considered as a dimension, the author would point 
to quantum solution physics [Brant Carlson: Separation 
of variables and the Schrodinger equation, https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=IZAfn-iGU5U], separation of the 
space and time variables works to get quantum solutions. 
With quantum gravity considerations here, quantum aspects 
of relativistic space-time may be isolated to have tensor 
time theoretically represented adequately as dimension; 
therefore, time conservation would be quite justified to 
proceed further.

clocks, they explore potential solutions such as the 
Page–Wootters formalism, emphasizing the need for a 
consistent framework to address the problem of time in 
quantum gravity. 
• Alonso-Serrano A, et al. [1] these authors explore 
concept of emergent time, suggesting time may not be

concepts.

However, it was not clear how time quanta work without 
understanding tensor nature of time affecting energy 
quantum. 
The author is showing here knowhow based on modeling 
in peer reviewed paper and presentation [6,10] how tensor 
time conservation law comes about.
Tensor Analysis Giving Key Equations
Per the author’s peer published papers, time is much 
more than scalar arithmetic; it will have to be expressed 
as algebraic {wavefunctionality} tensor, highlighting its 
algebraic properties and conservation [6-11]:

: here, L is the Lagrangian, p is 
the momentum, x is the position, and H is the Hamiltonian. 
The Legendre transformation allows us to switch between 
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations with physics, 
noting that action, S per physics literature is given via: 
S Ldt pdq Hdt= ∫= ∫− . Tµναβ = constant in the above 
differential testing of conservation in relation to domains of 
reality; thereby it proves that conservation of time applies 
like the general principle of energy quantum conservation 
well within these conditions. We see also from above only 
analytical quantum conservation with energy and not 
necessarily all forms of energy will make conservation of 
time more universal than all forms of energy. For example, in 
superluminal noisy condensate [8], energy conservation may 
not occur when infinite energy possibilities are possible 
having random process noise. Alternatively, time may have 
universal realistic existence only by having real matter 
universe. Hence, such conservation will be in vogue existing 
within only the restricted matter universe with gravity like in 
geodesics.
It was shown [6-11] that graded decomposition of time 
tensors from Rank 6 to Rank 1 vector will make it eventually 
scalarized observables that become measurables [11]. Then 
multi-vector time will have resolvability into various 
directions on the space. For example, we can consider time

pointing from proper time to real time. We can resolve that 
proper time vector going from one location to another 
location point, a vector directing that time will make that go 
to real time location point!! Mathematically time tensor can 
be decomposed to multiplicity of vectors: 
123456ˆijklmnt tttttt=⊗⊗⊗⊗⊗  essentially allowing operator 
algebra with resolution of the vectors [7,11]. Further 
interpretative physics will allow many worlds tensor 
wavefunction deduction of collapse to resolved time vector 
in Hilbert space Dirac bra-ket form. The author has shown 
further that generating commutator scalar and/or density 
matrix is possible by interacting with gravity vector to give 
general form of the action Lagrange physics dynamics [7,11].
Quantified Clocks Applying Time Conservation 
Principle
Time clocks will differ depending on the domain of 
reality. For example, in the movie “ AVATAR” there are at 
least 2 domains of reality for clocks. In general, there are 
6 different clocks possible with quantum astrophysical 
reality per my peer reviewed articles [10,11]. The domains 
of reality would depend on types of gravity. Clocks would 
run slower within strong gravity like blackhole having local 
symmetry correlating Swampland conjectures [Episodes of 
HISTORY OF PHYSICS: https://www.youtube.com/@teknet_
earthglobal2923/streams]. However, clocks will run faster 
having a weak gravity environment like electromagnetism 
photons with global symmetry; we would expect 
consequently universal expansion via dark energy extending 
general relativistic theory [7-10]. 
Contravariant synergistically, gravitational effect 
depends on the domain of reality [6,8,11]. Logically, gravity 
domain of reality will give function equation of clock like f (gR, 
Rg), where gR ≡ gravity which is domain dependent, whereas 
Rg ≡ domain of reality that is gravity dependent. This will 
reflect some of the available literature, wherein authors 
describe modified f (R, T) gravity, having R representing the 
Ricci scalar and T denoting trace of the energy-momentum 
tensor [14]. This is where time comes to picture with 
domains of reality, with time conservation principle helping 
to figure out what is going on with timeline-event sequences.
The author’s peer-reviewed publications demonstrate 
link of time vector to gravitational gradient as well as Lagrange 
of Action equation of object motion in various domains of 
reality [11]. Application of Principle: Time Conservation 
quantifies Equivalence Principle as well as Correspondence 
Principle [8] in Quantum Astrophysics enabling knowhow 
to track and measure clocks at different domains of reality, 
applying author developed equations earlier [6,8,11]. From 
these articles, the following formulations are helpful to 
proceed quantitatively.

quite differently.

microwave background radiation at light speed} have 
essentially relativistic zero-points, whereas microblackholes 
along the IM matrix will contract due to their strong gravity 
slowing clocks. Thus, branes may form like vacuum thin 
sheets that act typically like flat branes at a relatively high 
speed of light of the zero-point fields. Microblackholes 
with slower gravity clocks will then locally curve branes 
generating microgravitational waves. Eventually, the locally 
distorted fields will create curled up dimensions. All these 
events lead to spatial and temporal warping within sub-
mesoscopic levels. Principle of time conservation will help 
in modeling quantitatively the clock speeds at the varying 
domains of reality as well as gravitational geodesic fields.
The author would extend further thinking of the curved 
M branes to curled up dimensions creating quantum local 
clocks possibly be key to real physicality as well as mental 
consciousness of life forms. 
Manipulations of the clocks are possible having the 
knowledge of metrics controlling them with interactive 
gravity-domain of reality-time aspects. Per 4x4 tensor 
time matrix in comparison with local and the global clocks 
point to local clock manifestation transitioning proper to 
real time versus global clock manifesting transitioning 
local to the global time within the physics domain of reality 
context of quantum relativistic ASTROPHYSICS [6]. Typically, 
branes are expected to have Planck thickness and branes 
are expected to be separated by the discontinuum length 
symbolized DL [8]. The above argumentation of typical 
curled up submesoscopic dimensions analogizes to Kaluza-
Klein 5D curled up dimensions [https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory]. Essentially, gravity 
maybe considered to be manifestation of convergence-like 
inside-spiraling of 5D-curled up tensor causing densification 
of matter leading to mass function convergence, whereas 
electromagnetism will analogize to Noether [https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem] symmetrical 
equivalence of the divergence-like outside- spiraling of the 
5D-curled up tensor.
We can write decomposition of rank 2 tensors 4x4 
time matrix into vector time to represent local clock t lc as 
well as another vector time to represent global clock t gc.tlc 
vector would characterize time pointing the proper to real 
like for a microblackhole situation, whereas tgc vector would 
be characterizing time pointing global to the local like for a 
vacuum situation [6,11]. These aspects are analyzed further 
with ongoing projects PHYSICS, that will appear only in later 
publications. One of the potentially unifying grand PHYSICS 
will involve quantifying baryonic gravitational mass function 
density operator, based on time conservation application to 
existence of real matter universe within superluminal noisy 
condensate acting like “superfluids”!!
What are the Implications of Time Conservation?
The concept of time conservation, if proven, could have 
profound implications across various fields of physics and 
beyond. Here are some potential implications:
• Unified Framework Linking Classical to Quantum as 
well as Relativistic PHYSICS: Time conservation could 
provide a unified framework for understanding different 
physical phenomena, bridging gaps between classical 
mechanics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity.
• New Physical Laws Extending Beyond 
Thermodynamics that Point to Time Conservation 
Principle Generalizing Entropy Temperature to 
Physical Transformations of Real Universe Matter: 
It might lead to the formulation of new physical laws or 
the modification of existing ones, particularly in how we 
understand the relationship between time and energy.
• Cosmology Evolution with Conserving Time with 
Interactive Gravitational Geodesical Formations to 
Real Matter and Life within Galactical:  In cosmology, 
time conservation could offer new insights into the 
evolution of the universe, particularly in extreme 
conditions such as the early universe or near black holes.
• Quantum Mechanics: It could impact our understanding 
of quantum mechanics, potentially offering solutions 
to existing paradoxes and problems, such as the 
measurement problem or the nature of quantum 
entanglement.
• Technological Advancements:  Practical applications 
could emerge in fields like quantum computing, where 
a deeper understanding of time could lead to more 
efficient algorithms as well as processing techniques.
• Philosophical Implications Exciting thought 
Experiments Quantifying Discontinuum Physics: On 
a philosophical level, rethinking time as a conserved 
quantity might influence our perception of reality, 
causality, and the nature of existence itself perhaps [8].
• Interdisciplinary Research: This concept could foster 
interdisciplinary research, encouraging collaboration 
among physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers to 
explore the fundamental nature of time.
These implications highlight the potential for time 
conservation to revolutionize our understanding of the 
universe and drive innovation in both theoretical and applied 
physics.
How can we Experimentally Test Time 
Conservation?
Testing conservation of time experimentally is a 
challenging but fascinating endeavor. Here are some potential 
approaches:

 High-Energy Physics Experiments
• Particle Accelerators: Using Particle Accelerators 
like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): observing 
measurements with theoretical gravitons, answer why 
only left-handed neutrinos seem to really exist, such as 
with possible measurements of neutrino oscillations 
to observe high-energy collisions. By analyzing the 
behavior of particles and their interactions over time, 
researchers can look for evidence of time conservation 
principles [12].
• Decay Rates of Gravitons with Relation to Partonic 
Neutrinos, by Studying Top Quarks, for Example, 
Quantum Entanglement Measurement with top 
Quarks LHC:  If time is conserved, studying the 
decay rates of unstable particles processes should 
exhibit consistent patterns that align with theoretical 
predictions [12].
Quantum Experiments
• Quantum Entanglement:  Investigating entangled 
particles to see if time conservation affects their 
correlated states - experiments could measure how 
changes in one particle’s state influence the other over 
time.
• Quantum Computing: Utilizing quantum computers to 
simulate scenarios where time conservation might play 
a role - could help identify any deviations from expected 
outcomes.
Cosmological Observations
• Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR):  
Analyzing the CMBR for signs of time conservation - 
variations in the CMBR could provide clues about the 
behavior of time in the early universe.
• Black Hole Studies: Observing the behavior of matter 
and energy near black holes - time dilation effects in 
these extreme environments could offer insights into 
time conservation.
Thermodynamic Experiments
• Temperature Extremes:  Conducting experiments at 
extremely high and low temperatures to observe the 
transition between vacuum and superconductive states 
– by monitoring exactly how time may behave in these 
conditions could reveal conservation properties.
• Entropy Measurements:  Measuring entropy changes 
in isolated systems – that if time is conserved, entropy 
changes should follow specific patterns that can be 
predicted and tested.
Mathematical and Theoretical Models
• Tensor Analysis: Developing mathematical models that 
treat time as a tensor - models can be tested against 
experimental data to see if they accurately describe 
observed phenomena.
• Simulation Studies:  Running simulations that 
incorporate time conservation principles -comparing 
these simulations with real-world data can help validate 
the theoretical framework.
Interdisciplinary Approaches
• Collaboration with Other Fields : Working with 
experts in fields like mathematics, computer science, 
and philosophy to develop new experimental techniques 
and theoretical models will generate new interest and 
exciting outcomes with mathematical physical sciences.
These approaches can help test the hypothesis of time 
conservation and potentially uncover new fundamental 
principles of physics.
Conclusions
This study proposes that time, much like energy, may 
be a conserved quantity in the universe. By treating time 
as a tensor, we uncover new insights into the behavior of 
time as conserved, by having quantum energy transformed 
canonically to time quanta, evident in time differential of the 
integral, i.e. f(tQ)..dtQ = 0, implying invariant time with point 
in space. Tensor Analysis giving key equations of time tensor, 
Tμναβ = constant is shown by differential testing in relation to 
domains of reality, proving that conservation of time applies 
like the general principle of energy quantum conservation 
well within these conditions. Quantified clocks applying 
time conservation principle analyze strong gravity versus 
weak gravity environments like that of the microblackholes 
and the zero-point fields, showing how branes may form. 
Eventually these branes may produce curled up dimensions, 
like Kaluza-Klein 5D curled up dimensions. Future research 
emphasizes efforts to further explore the implications of time 
conservation and its potential applications in various fields 
of physics. Projects that will quantify time gravity geodesic 
baryonic mass density functions will help in knowhow 
proving asymmetry of matter/antimatter evolution of the 
real matter cosmic galactical and life forms well within a 
superluminal noisy general condensate extent infinitely!!
