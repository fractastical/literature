Abstract 
Our paper takes as its starting point the recent proposal, at the core of this special issue, to use the active inference framework (AIF) 
to computationally model what it is for a person to live a meaningful life. In broad brushstrokes, the AIF takes experiences of human 
flourishing to be the result of predictions and uncertainty estimations along many dimensions at multiple levels of neurobiological 
organization. Our aim in this paper is to explain how AIF models predict that uncertainty can sometimes, under the right conditions, 
be conducive to the experiences of flourishing. Our focus is on playfulness, because playful individuals have learned a high-level prior 
that in certain safe contexts, uncertainty and error should be tolerated and explored. They have expanded the phenotypic bound on 
the amount of surprise they are prepared to tolerate in their lives. The positive embracing of uncertainty has a number of positive 
knock-on effects for the kind of lives playful individuals are able to lead. First, a playful individual attends to the world in a way that 
is open and expansive, a mode of attending that is effortless and therefore conducive to being in the present. This openness to the 
present moment allows for deep engagement and participation in experience that can furnish a renewed appreciation for life. Second, 
playful individuals will actively seek out spaces at the edge of their own abilities and will therefore be more likely to grow and develop 
in their skills and relationships in ways that contribute to their living a good life. Finally, playful agents seek out situations in which 
they can monitor, observe, and learn from their own affective responses to uncertainty. Thus, uncertainty becomes something familiar 
to them that they not only learn to tolerate but also enjoy positively exploring, in ways that provide them opportunities to grow. For 
these three reasons, we will argue that playfulness and openness to experiences of uncertainty and the unknown may be important 
ingredients in human flourishing.

Introduction
Our paper takes as its starting point the recent proposal (Miller 
et al. 2022, Smith et al. 2022a), at the core of this special issue, 
to use the active inference framework (AIF) to computationally 
model what it is for a person to live a meaningful life. Such an 
explanatory project aims to address what Flanagan (2007) has 
called the ‘really hard problem’—the problem of explaining how 
it is possible for an evolved biological being, living in a material 
world, to live a meaningful life.
There are likely many factors that contribute to a person suc-
ceeding or failing to live such a life. Psychologists make an impor-
tant conceptual distinction between eudaimonic and hedonic 
well-being (see e.g. Ryan and Deci 2001 ; Baumeister et al. 2013, 
Diener et  al. 2017; Smith 2017 , Bloom 2021 ). Eudaimonic well-
being refers roughly to life-satisfaction—the capacity to fulfil 
and develop one’s potential through the pursuit of goals that 
fit with one’s personal values such as spending time with loved 
ones, working on one’s garden, making music, or campaign-
ing for a political cause. Hedonic well-being by contrast focuses 
on momentary positive affect and the pleasures that arise from 
social interactions and physical activities like eating a delicious 
meal or drinking a fine wine. In what follows, we will sometimes 
also make reference to these distinct, and sometimes conflicting, 
components of flourishing.
2 Kiverstein and Miller
By a ‘meaningful life’, we mean a life of flourishing, or what is 
sometimes called a ‘good life’. Peak experiences, social connect-
edness, mastery, and purpose have been argued to be important 
ingredients in flourishing (Seligman 2011; Smith 2017; Bloom 
2021). We will however avoid committing to any particular account 
of flourishing. We agree with Bloom (2021) that there are likely to 
be many factors that contribute to flourishing and a great deal 
of individual variability. Our project is instead to explain what 
one can learn about human flourishing, broadly construed, using 
the computational modelling tools of the AIF. The AIF has as 
its theoretical underpinnings, the free energy principle (see Fris-
ton 2010, Parr et al. 2022 ). We do not discuss the free energy 
principle in what follows, though it is in the background of our 
discussion. We use the terminology of active inference, as a gen-
eral unifying framework that applies to cycles of perception and 
action, and all the cognitive processes that depend on these
cycles.
Our claim is that computational models of learning and action 
control can contribute to understanding some of the neurobio-
logical processes that differences in experiences of human flour-
ishing may depend upon (see Miller et al. 2022 , Smith et al. 
2022a). We will therefore assume that human flourishing is, at 
least partly, dependent on scientifically intelligible neurobiolog-
ical processes that can be computationally modelled using the 
mathematics of the active inference theory. The active inference 
theory can be used to computationally model, and thereby to 
identify, the neurobiological causes and constituents that must 
be in place for a person to experience a life of meaning. Our 
aims in this paper are mainly theoretical and conceptual, to 
use AIF to identify a key ingredient—playfulness—that AIF would 
suggest might be a necessary ingredient for living a meaningful
life.
In broad brushstrokes, the AIF takes experiences of human 
flourishing to be the result of predictions and uncertainty estima-
tions along many dimensions, at multiple levels of neurobiological 
organization. AIF proposes that there are a limited set of states 
that must be maintained (through processes akin to homeostasis) 
if the creature is to persist in its current form in the future. This set 
of states are modelled as ‘expected’ states—states the organism 
believes it will continuously revisit. In order for these expectations 
to be fulfilled, the organism must act on its environment, seeking 
out for instance the warmth, food, security, and social attachment 
necessary for its continued existence. More generally, an individ-
ual’s desires, goals, and purposes are modelled as expectations. 
Expectations are beliefs or presuppositions about what events in 
the body and world are probable given, among other things, the 
individual’s goals, purposes, and desires. These beliefs serve a 
self-regulatory function, controlling the sampling of sensory infor-
mation. They do so with the aim of maximizing the evidence 
for the agent’s beliefs, including beliefs about what is desirable, 
valuable, and worth pursuing in life. Since expectations take the 
form of beliefs, an agent that succeeds in maximizing the evi-
dence for its beliefs will also succeed in fulfilling its expectations
over time.
‘Uncertainty’ is translated in AIF terms as unpredictability 
relative to what is known. One might naturally think that unpre-
dictability should be of negative value for creatures that aim at 
keeping their prediction errors to a minimum over time. This 
is indeed true for a certain kind of uncertainty experienced in 
volatile environments. Volatility can be analysed as unexpected 
uncertainty ( Bland and Schaefer 2012) in which the outcomes 
of actions are continuously changing over time in ways that are 
hard to predict. Sustained exposure to volatility is associated with 
chronic stress, which leads to anxiety and a reduced sense of con-
trol (Barrett et al. 2016; Stephan et al. 2016; Paulus et al. 2019). In a 
volatile environment, the constant updating of predictions is nec-
essary in ways that make it difficult to get a good grip on expected
uncertainty.
Our aim in this paper is to use AIF to explain how uncertainty 
can sometimes, under the right conditions, be conducive to expe-
riences of flourishing. In other words, unpredictability need not 
always be the source of negative affect and suffering. When play-
ing for instance, humans and other animals enjoy creating just 
the right amounts of uncertainty (Andersen et al. 2022). The indi-
vidual engaged in playing actively creates errors that violate their 
expectations, which they subsequently find a way to resolve. Thus, 
there is a slope of error creation and reduction in play. In our ear-
lier work (e.g. Andersen et al. 2022 ), we have been focused on 
using the AIF to understand why play experiences are fun and 
enjoyable. In this paper, we will make a more ambitious claim. 
We will suggest that play does not only contribute to momen-
tary happiness. Playful individuals have learned a high-level prior 
that in certain safe contexts, uncertainty and error can be toler-
ated. They have expanded the phenotypic bound on the amount 
of surprise they are prepared to tolerate in their lives. We will sug-
gest that this ability to positively embrace uncertainty, when the 
conditions are right, may be an important ingredient in a life of
meaning.
First, the playful individual attends to the world in a way that 
is open and expansive; a mode of attending that is effortless 
and therefore conducive to being in the present ( Bar 2022). We 
can contrast this open experience of the present moment with 
a mode of relating to the world that prioritizes past habits, rou-
tines, and stereotypical modes of thinking. Open experiences of 
the present stand in contrast with a distracted state in which 
one’s awareness is taken up with oneself and the thoughts that 
are wandering through one’s mind. A playful openness to the 
present moment allows for deep engagement and participation 
in experience, which is, arguably, one important ingredient in 
flourishing.
Second, playfulness will have the consequence that an indi-
vidual is prepared, in the right contexts, to hang out in volatile 
environments. Such agents will actively seek out spaces at the 
edge of their own abilities. They will be on the lookout for enough 
error to keep them interested but not so much error that the 
activity becomes uncontrollable and unmanageable. Agents that 
remain poised at the edge of their own abilities will be more likely 
to grow and develop in their skills and relationships in ways that 
contribute to their living a good life.
Third, we will describe how playful agents seek out situations in 
which they can monitor, observe, and learn from their own affec-
tive reactions. We focus on the example of engagement with fictive 
and highly improbable scenarios. When a movie goer watches 
a horror film, for instance, they experience events that are at 
once terrifying and also far removed from those they are likely 
to encounter in their everyday lives. They can nevertheless gain 
valuable lessons from engaging with such media about what it is 
like to experience intense disgust, fear, and anxiety at the very 
edge of what they can tolerate. What seems to motivate people to 
actively seek out such experiences is morbid curiosity—an interest 
in seeking information about highly threatening situations that 
trigger deeply rooted anxieties (Clasen 2017, Scrivner 2021a). We 
will suggest that engaging with our own emotions playfully can 
be functionally useful because it allows the person to learn about 
their own responses to uncertainty. Their responses to uncertainty 
can, in this way, become familiar and expected, something that 
Playfulness and the meaningful life  3
can be well predicted, making these responses less newsworthy 
or attention-grabbing. Playfulness can thus contribute to emotion 
regulation, equipping a person with skills for engaging with the 
world in ways that are psychologically flexible. For these three rea-
sons, we will argue that playfulness and openness to experiences 
of uncertainty and the unknown may be important ingredients in 
a meaningful life.
Error dynamics and flourishing
Consider an unfortunate individual who consistently fails to 
achieve their goals and satisfy their needs. Such an individual 
will likely experience a mixture of anxiety and depression in their 
dealings with the world. Depression for instance has been linked 
to consistent failure to successfully regulate the internal con-
ditions of the body leading to what has been termed reduced 
‘allostatic self-efficacy’ (Stephan et al. 2016; see also Barrett et al. 
2016
; Paulus et al. 2019). Related experiences of ‘learned helpless-
ness’ (Maier and Seligman 1976 ) then arise in which the person 
comes to experience that nothing they do can make a difference 
to achieving their goals and needs. This can be made sense of, in 
the terms of AIF, as the consequence of the person embodying a 
model whose predictions consistently fail to guide actions in ways 
that reduce expected predicted errors. Instead, the person comes 
to expect prediction errors—they no longer expect to achieve the 
outcomes they desire, leading them to remain in unhealthy rela-
tionships, or working a dull job that brings them no joy. They are 
certain of their own uncertainty about how to act in the world, 
which produces feelings of lack of control or helplessness (see 
Clark et al. 2018, Kiverstein et al. 2020).
The AIF predicts that it is not only the minimization moment by 
moment of prediction errors that is important for flourishing but 
also the minimization of expected prediction errors—errors arising 
from predictions that concern the person’s existence in the future. 
Keeping expected prediction errors to a minimum over time will 
sometimes require prediction errors to remain high at some lower 
layers of the generative model so that the expected prediction 
errors can be minimized at higher levels. Smith and colleagues 
give the example of high expenditure of metabolic energy during 
busy periods in one’s work life (Smith et al. 2022a). This expen-
diture of energy may well lead to high-allostatic load in terms of 
the stress and fatigue the person experiences. However, they may 
also find a sense of purpose and meaning in work that allows for 
the person to act in ways that are consistent with higher-level self-
beliefs about what a good life means for them. Thus, even though 
errors are sustained at high levels at some layers of the model, this 
is the price to be paid for reducing expected prediction errors aris-
ing from higher-level self-beliefs that concern what a meaningful 
life looks like for them in the long-run.
Smith and colleagues have usefully mapped out six compo-
nents that allow for a specification of what they call the ‘compu-
tational phenotype’ that underwrite different strategies for living 
a meaningful life. A computational phenotype refers to the val-
ues of the parameters of an internal model that best describe an 
individual’s behaviour (Schwartenbeck and Friston 2016, Smith 
et al. 2022a, Section 4). We will refrain from presenting the details 
of their account but we highly recommend interested readers to 
consult their paper. In earlier work, we have argued that one 
factor in both short-term happiness and long-term eudaimonic 
life-satisfaction is progress in error reduction ( Miller et al. 2022). 
Drawing on Van de Cruys (2017), we have argued that valence 
depends upon error dynamics—the change in the rate of error 
reduction (Kiverstein et al. 2019a ). By change in the rate of error 
reduction, we mean to refer to error reduction through action that 
unfolded either better or worse than the agent predicted. In select-
ing action policies that are expected to reduce prediction error, an 
agent must assess the efficiency of each action policy and pick 
the policy they believe to be most efficient. Rate of error reduc-
tion, we have hypothesized, may provide agents with a measure of 
efficiency (Kiverstein et al. 2019a). Reducing error at a faster than 
expected rate is an efficiency gain, while a slower than expected 
reduction in error means that an action policy performed less 
efficiently than was expected.
Affective states with positive valence (henceforth ‘positive 
affective states’) are elicited when the agent performs better than 
expected at bringing about preferred outcomes. This is to say that 
they do better than expected at reducing precise or significant 
errors, since preferred outcomes will be weighed as highly pre-
cise predictions. Conversely, affective states with negative valence 
(‘negative affective states’) occur when an agent does worse than 
they expected at securing preferred outcomes. An agent will 
experience negative affect when they fail to reduce a significant, 
precise error at the rate they expected.
To make progress in error reduction, an agent must be will-
ing to disrupt habits of thinking and acting in ways that may lead 
to temporary increases in error and uncertainty. An agent must 
find the right balance between performing epistemic actions that 
aim at uncertainty reduction and pragmatic, habit-based actions 
that aim at directly and immediately bringing about preferred out-
comes. A model that always opts for epistemic actions may well 
be accurate and comprehensive but it will fail to guide behaviour 
towards preferred outcomes in a particular action context. The 
agent will be faced with an explosion of possibilities they will need 
to prune in order to determine how to act in a particular context. 
A model that always generates pragmatic actions will run the risk 
of becoming trapped in local optima.
To escape these two extremes, what seems to be required 
is a context-sensitive weighing of the precision of predictions. 
A creature that does a good job of keeping prediction errors to 
a minimum over time must know when the predictions of its 
model are unreliable and not to be trusted and when to ignore 
prediction errors and to rely on its predictions. AIF assigns this 
work to so-called ‘precision estimations’ that regulate how much 
weight to give to prediction errors relative to predictions. When 
the quality of a model’s predictions is estimated to be high, any 
prediction errors will be down-weighted. Recall how the agent’s 
needs, goals, purposes, and preferences are modelled as expected 
sensory states—sensory states that the agent expects, with a high 
degree of confidence (i.e. a high-precision weighting), to be able to 
bring about through its actions. The agent’s model can be said to 
be ‘optimistically biased’ (Sharot 2011): the expectations that the 
agent estimates to have a high precision tend to relate to states 
that the agent optimistically believes with high confidence it can 
bring about through its actions.
If an agent is to succeed in keeping its prediction errors to a 
minimum, it is necessary that this optimism bias be kept in check 
by reality. The expectations the agent has about the future states 
they can affect through their actions must fit with what can real-
istically be achieved in the particular context in which they are 
acting. It is therefore important that the agent strikes the right 
balance between acting confidently to bring about its preferences 
and updating its beliefs about what goals it can expect to realize 
in a given context. Without finding this balance, and sometimes 
using feedback from reality to update its optimistic expectations,
the agent will run the risk of an inefficient expenditure of its 
resources. Van de Cruys et al. (2020) describe the biasing of the 
4 Kiverstein and Miller
predictive model by the agent’s needs and preferences as a ‘con-
trolled optimism’. Predicted states corresponding to an agent’s 
goals, needs, and preferences must exhibit some robustness in 
the face of challenges. At the same time, it is also necessary 
that the agent must be open to revising some of these predic-
tions when the evidence points to the predicted outcomes being
unattainable.
We have proposed elsewhere, that this balance could be 
achieved by using affective states, understood in terms of error 
dynamics, to weigh precision as the agent shifts between contexts 
(Kiverstein et al. 2019a; and see Hesp et al. 2021 for modelling work 
that is supportive of this hypothesis). An agent that uses error 
dynamics to weigh precision and update its precision expectations 
as it moves between contexts will stay well-tuned to opportuni-
ties to make progress in learning. This is to say that they will do 
a good job at acting in ways that are conducive to bringing about 
preferred outcomes, arguably a key ingredient in living a good life. 
They will also tend to spend a good deal of their lives in positively 
valenced affective states, since valence is, we argue, dependent 
on error dynamics. Agents that tend to do better than expected at 
error reduction because they succeed in continuously finding their 
way to opportunities to do better than expected at bringing about 
their preferred action outcomes will likely feel good about their
lives.
Of course, in real life, people rarely fare so well. The environ-
ment, which includes other people pursuing their own preferences 
and interests, is frequently uncooperative. The person must take 
the good with the more frequently occurring bad. Our point is 
simply that it is a prediction of AIF that tolerating error and uncer-
tainty, through exploring for opportunities to improve one’s skills 
and abilities, is an important ingredient in human flourishing. The 
opposite may also be true: low tolerance for error leads to less 
exploration, which in turn leads us to pull back and retreat from 
volatile situations. This can have the consequence that the per-
son’s beliefs become rigid making them more brittle and less able 
to maintain a good grip on a dynamically changing world. People 
that are less tolerant of error will tend to exhibit a strong need 
for control. When they find themselves in situations in which this 
need is not fulfilled, they may experience intense anxiety. One 
response to anxiety is to fall back on habitual modes of behaviour. 
This can be seen in the ritualistic and compulsive behaviours of 
people diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder that are a 
means to the reduction and control of the anxiety arising from 
their obsessions (Kiverstein et al. 2019b). Long-term addiction can 
also often be viewed as a reasonable strategy for keeping an other-
wise unruly and volatile environment under control ( Miller et al. 
2020
; Lewis 2015).
We will argue in the next section that play activities are exam-
ples of behaviours in which an agent productively tolerates and 
explores error. When playing, agents use error dynamics to weigh 
precision with the result that they are guided to what we have 
called ‘just-right’, consumable surprises—errors that are neither 
too complex nor too easily predicted such that there is nothing for 
the agent to learn. We will suggest that the disposition of playful-
ness may be an important ingredient in human flourishing. Playful 
individuals are prepared to tolerate uncertainty that accompanies 
temporary increases in error. It is this tolerance or equanimity 
towards uncertainty which we will focus on in the remainder of 
our paper as a key ingredient in flourishing.
The joy of play
Animals and humans engage in play in large part because it 
is enjoyable and fun to play. Play is intrinsically motivated—it 
is rewarding in itself, not only as a means to bring about an 
extrinsic reward. Ryan and Deci (2000) contrast intrinsic with 
extrinsic motivation based on activities that are performed for 
‘the enjoyment of the activity itself, rather than its instrumental 
value’. Think for instance of a child’s motivation for doing their 
homework (Oudeyer and Kaplan 2007). They can be extrinsically 
motivated by the threat of punishment—the sanctions from their 
parents and teachers—which they will receive if they do not do 
their homework. However, they may also be intrinsically moti-
vated by the pleasure of learning, discovering new knowledge, or 
finding the solution to a puzzle. Solving a problem in mathematics 
can for instance be motivating for some students of mathematics 
in a similar way to playing a video game. Both can be intrinsically 
fun activities.
What is it that learning and play share in common such that 
both can be enjoyable activities? What makes an activity intrin-
sically fun? First, both learning and play can be characterized 
by active exploration or information-seeking that results in the 
reduction of uncertainty or better than expected gains in error 
reduction. Novel experiences (i.e.  an unpredicted event that vio-
lates pre-existing expectations) can be intrinsically motivating if 
the sampling of observation leads to new discoveries that improve 
the future predictions of a model ( Oudeyer and Kaplan 2007 , 
Oudeyer et al. 2007 ). Agents that aim at prediction error mini-
mization will be intrinsically driven to explore in ways that lead to 
temporary increases in error. In doing so, they will be led to new 
discoveries that allow them to do better than expected at reduc-
ing error in the long-run. Recall that doing better than expected 
at reducing significant (i.e. precise) error is, we have argued, the 
source of positive affect. Novel experiences that allow for learning 
progress will be intrinsically motivating because they elicit states 
with positive valence.
The promise of securing positive affective states will there-
fore drive agents towards niches replete with ‘consumable 
errors’—errors that are neither too complex to get a practical 
grip on nor too simple and predictable to be devoid of new infor-
mation. In earlier work, we have argued that in play activities, 
agents willingly create errors and surprises that they can resolve 
over the course of the play activity and thereby make progress in 
their learning (Andersen et  al. 2022, Deterding et al. 2022, Miller 
et al. 2023). When playing, people intentionally create situations in 
which they generate small consumable errors. They deliberately 
create situations in which they are uncertain what will happen, 
temporarily generating a sensory flow that takes them outside of 
their comfort zone. In an enjoyable game, there will not be so 
much unpredictability that the agent loses grip on the game. Nor 
should the game be so predictable that there is nothing of sur-
prise that happens. The game should instead strike the sweet spot 
between predictability and unpredictability we have described in 
terms of the game or play activity offering ‘just-right’ surprises 
(Andersen et al. 2022). The surprises the agent creates pique their 
interest because they contain just the right mixture of novelty or 
violation of expectation.
Play allows agents to encounter new information with just the 
right amount of complexity for them to make progress in learn-
ing. This feature of games is interestingly related to what the 
Playfulness and the meaningful life  5
developmental psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1978) called the ‘zone 
of proximal development’. Vygotsky showed that the developmen-
tal growth takes place at the edge of an agent’s current abilities. 
In the terms of the AIF, what we are calling ‘consumable errors’ 
allow for the learning of something new and thus for growth and 
improvement in one’s skills and abilities (i.e. for learning progress). 
A child for instance playing with a faucet will encounter surprise 
when they are sprayed with water. However, it is just the right 
amount of surprise for them to learn how to do better at reducing 
error in the future. Play feels good when the agent does bet-
ter than expected at actively transforming an unpredictable and 
uncertain world into a predictable one. Video games, for instance, 
are often designed in such a way as to amplify, apportion, and 
sequence uncertainty so that the player can eventually, with some 
effort, reliably resolve their uncertainty, preferably at a faster than 
expected rate (Deterding et al. 2022). Such a carefully engineered 
game will build in possible jolts of positive affect as the player 
gradually experiences mastery of the game.
So far, we have discussed the contribution of play to momen-
tary happiness. It might therefore be thought that play is only 
relevant to explaining meaning in life if one understands flourish-
ing in hedonistic terms of maximizing pleasure. In the remainder 
of our paper, we will argue however that such an impression 
would be mistaken. Play might also contribute to long-term life-
satisfaction. Here, what seems to be important is the more global 
trait of playfulness. This trait can be thought of as a disposition, 
a persistent background state of mind, that shapes how a person 
finds themselves in the world from moment to moment. Playful 
people tend to be curious; they are more inclined to investigate 
the world and learn about it. By ‘curiosity’, we mean the tendency 
to seek out novel and challenging interactions with the world in 
ways that facilitate learning and growth in skills and relationships 
(Kashdan and Steger 2007 , Berlyne 1960). Playful individuals will 
expose themselves to new experiences in ways that temporarily 
increase their uncertainty but that also allow for growth in skills 
and relationships that we have been arguing are key ingredients 
in flourishing.
Openness to experience
Playful people who are highly curious about the world, and about 
other people, will be more likely to be tuned into consumable 
errors. They will tend to engage in exploratory behaviours of the 
novel and the challenging, thereby making it more likely that 
they will encounter events that offer possibilities for growth and 
meaning in life (Kashdan and Steger 2007). What is crucial here 
is that the error and uncertainty the agent encounters be “con-
sumable”—that is to say, at just the right level to be mastered 
given the individual’s competence. Consumable errors provide the 
agent with the opportunity to act at the edge of their current 
ability, mastering and resolving the uncertainties that arise and 
thereby growing in their skills. Playful individuals will tend both 
to be drawn towards errors and believe they are competent to get 
a good grip upon those errors. This combination of skills means 
that playful individuals will be well-positioned to take advantage 
of and make the most out of opportunities for growth when they 
arise.
Sadly adults, unlike children, tend not to have the trait of play-
fulness, shunning opportunities to explore uncertainty. Adults for 
instance will often approach going to the gym or doing sports as 
something to do because of its functional benefits, not as an oppor-
tunity to explore and grow in their abilities (Thiel et al. 2016). Why 
is this? We can provide a tentative answer to this question by 
contrasting children that tend to exhibit playfulness with adults 
who do not. Developmental psychologists hypothesize that one 
reason why children are motivated to play is that play gives them 
an active way to learn how the world works and what it affords 
for them. Children engage in what is called a ‘high-temperature’ 
search over a broad space of hypotheses that allows them to grow 
in their knowledge of the world and its workings ( Gopnik 2020). 
Adults, by contrast, have thoroughly explored and experimented 
with the world earlier in their lives and only expend the effort 
to experiment and explore when they expect to learn something 
new. They tend to engage in low-temperature search over a nar-
row space of hypotheses, assigning high precision to their prior 
beliefs. The knowledge adults have amassed about the world over 
the course of their development can lead to our being some-
what inflexible and narrow-minded in our thinking. The more 
knowledge we amass, the more certain we become of how the 
world works. We tend to act based on a desire to exploit what is 
already known to plan and to get things done. The result is a mode 
of cognition characterized by ‘attentional focus, inhibition, and 
executive function and behaviours like long-term, goal-directed 
planned action’ (Gopnik 2020: p.2). Moreover, many of us grow up 
in cultures in which play is regarded as frivolous, unproductive, 
silly and even irresponsible when there are more serious matters 
to attend to. We learn from our peers that society expects us to 
be sensible, serious, and above all else productive, which leaves 
us with no room in our lives for enjoying playing. In the West, we 
also tend to structure our educational practices around such an 
expectation. There is increasingly little room in the classroom for 
play and active exploration due to a greater emphasis on stan-
dardized testing that leaves less room for thinking creatively and 
imaginatively (Kim 2011).
There is however a high price to pay. First of all, and perhaps 
most obviously, we miss out on the moments of joy and plea-
sure that can occur when we play. Worse still, we may run the 
risk of becoming rigid, narrow, and psychologically inflexible in 
our beliefs about the world if we do not remain open to exploring 
the world. The exploitative mode of cognition in which high pre-
cision is assigned to prior beliefs leads us to act based on habit 
and expectation. This allows us to keep our attention focused on 
narrow tasks which of course can be important for achieving our 
goals. However, inflexible precision weighting can limit the pos-
sibilities for a person. It can keep them locked into patterns of 
thinking and acting based on past experience that may not serve 
us well and that may also stand in the way of them changing. Just 
exploiting what has been learned in the past does not leave space 
for the kind of broad, open, and creative thinking that can result 
in progress and growth in skills.
The opposite of psychological inflexibility is open, curious, and 
broad exploration that allows us to have the kinds of novel expe-
riences less tightly constrained and bound by past expectations. 
An example of this flexible psychological mode of thinking and 
acting is the state of mind that can be induced through the use 
of psychedelic drugs (see Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019 ). The 
relaxing of the precision on prior habits and expectations that 
occur with the use of psychedelic substances results in a flatten-
ing of the attractor landscape the person forms in their dynamic 
coupling with their environment (also see Hipolito et al. 2023, this 
volume). No attractor in this landscape is too dominant allowing 
for an agent to escape local optima and to engage in a wider explo-
ration of possibilities. In particular, psychedelics relax the preci-
sion given to high-level beliefs the person may have formed about 
themselves and their past experiences in ways that make possible 
6 Kiverstein and Miller
transformative experiences that change the person’s sense of who 
they are and what matters in their life.
Psychedelics introduce disorder into the brain (and the larger 
agent-environment system the person forms with the world) in 
such a way as to remould the rigid beliefs the person may have 
formed in the past about themselves and the world. They induce 
a state in which rigid and inflexible habits of thinking and act-
ing become objects apt for reflecting on, testing, challenging, and 
reshaping. Something similar may also be true of the global back-
ground state of mind of playful individuals. They are constantly 
ready to stress, challenge, break, and rebuild the models that 
shape their perception of the world ( Miller et al. 2020). Curious 
individuals can find it interesting to engage in behaviours that 
are incongruent with their habitual behaviour tendencies. They 
can experience positive affective states when engaging with novel 
and challenging situations that diverge from those that they have 
come to expect. Shedding the defences that one has set up over 
the course of one’s life to protect oneself can be enormously 
stressful. The playful person however is able to find their way to 
meaningful opportunities for growth precisely by being willing to 
shed these defences in ways that allow them to move forward
and grow.
What is crucial is that the novel and challenging events they 
seek out are ones that they believe they are competent to man-
age and control. This self-confidence makes them more prepared 
to tolerate uncertainty and the resulting stress that might be 
experienced as aversive and to be avoided by the less playful 
among us. Indeed for the playful person, anxiety and fear are just 
more experiences to be curious about that can be rendered ‘famil-
iar, predictable, manageable, and controllable’ (Maslow 1962, p.6, 
quoted by Kaufman 2020, p.93) through exploration that leads to 
growth in knowledge and understanding of self and world. The 
playful person’s high-tolerance of stress makes them more able 
to explore the unknown and uncertain, unimpeded by their fears 
and anxieties. This has the consequence that they are able to grow 
in their skills in ways we have been arguing contribute to them 
leading a meaningful life.
Kaufman (2023) has recently argued for a strong relationship 
between playfulness and self-actualisation, which he defines as 
the ‘motivation to become all that one is capable of becoming’. 
People scoring highly on playfulness are also likely to be moti-
vated to pursue personal growth in their lives (See Kashdan et al. 
2018 for a similar finding in a study investigating the relation 
between the curiosity trait and personal growth). Playful indi-
viduals that exhibit a need to explore the world for novel and 
challenging experiences have also been shown to exhibit reduced 
latent inhibition ( Peterson and Carson 2000 , Carson et al. 2003 , 
Kaufman 2020: pp.110–11, cf. Bar 2022, pp.137–40). Latent inhibi-
tion refers to a preconscious gating mechanism associated with 
dopamine production in the brain ( Lubow and Weiner 2010). It is 
thought to allow for the imposing of top-down prior conceptual 
categories onto the world in ways that constrain the activation of 
associations and the expansiveness of a person’s thinking. Latent 
inhibition serves the important function of allowing individuals to 
tune into what is relevant and what is not in a particular context, 
which is clearly crucial for acting in ways that call for a narrow 
focusing of attention, such as when driving under dangerous con-
ditions. (Panksepp 1998 ) has suggested that rough and tumble 
play may promote frontal lobe maturation and areas of the brain 
associated with inhibition. Panksepp suggests that ‘[t]he explo-
sion of ADHD diagnoses may largely reflect the fact that more 
and more of our children no longer have adequate spaces and 
opportunities to express this natural biological need to play with 
each other in vigorous rough-and-tumble ways, each and every 
day’ (p. 91)). Inhibition however also narrows our engagement with 
the world to what is relevant to meeting our immediate needs, 
goals, and preferences. Reduced inhibition leads to experiences 
that are not so tightly constrained by top-down expectations.
Such experiences may allow for what Maslow (1954) described as a 
‘continuous freshness of appreciation’. The deployment of atten-
tion is no longer guided by top-down predictions that are given 
high precision.
Intriguingly, this kind of quieting or turning down the preci-
sion on top-down prediction has been argued to be a feature of 
the type of conscious state people are able to enter into through 
engaging in practices of meditation and mindfulness (Laukkonen 
and Slagter 2021; Bar 2022). It allows people to be more present in 
the moment instead of experiencing the world exclusively through 
the lens of their past expectations and habits of thinking and act-
ing. This may in turn allow them to experience the familiar afresh 
and with less distraction from their expectations that take them 
away from the moment unfolding in front of them.
Mindfulness meditation, in common with playfulness, enables 
psychological flexibility. By remaining in the present, the person 
need no longer get caught up with and stuck in unhealthy pat-
terns of thinking and acting. Gaining some distance from their 
expectations means no longer identifying with them as fixed and 
unchanging properties of ourselves but as potentially changeable 
through reframing. In the final section of our paper, we describe 
how playful exploration of uncertainty can allow an agent to mon-
itor and learn about their own affective responses. This learning 
can make opaque the affective processes that would typically 
transparently drive action policy selection. This process of opaci-
fication allows for the same kind of psychological distancing from 
our affective responses as have just described in mindfulness 
meditation. A playful person will be open to reframing and rein-
terpreting their habitual responses in ways that can allow them to 
grow in wisdom and intelligence.
Play, metacognition, and wisdom
Much of the literature on active inference has tended to focus on 
two ways in which error can be reduced over time. Either the agent 
makes their model fit the world through updating the predictions 
of a model—the prior beliefs the model encodes—or they make the 
world fit the model by producing sequences of actions that bring 
about preferred (i.e. predicted) sensory outcomes. There is how-
ever a third, under-appreciated way in which to reduce the errors 
one encounters in the long-term (which was, incidentally, already 
highlighted by Clark (2013) ). This is to change how precision is 
deployed. For example, faced with the uncertainty of a late train, 
we can update our model to form the belief that our train is late 
(perceptual inference), leaving unchanged our frustration. Alter-
natively, we can leave the station and take a taxi instead (active 
inference). Finally, we can view the lateness as an opportunity to 
have some more time to sit quietly on a bench at the train platform 
and enjoy a coffee (redeployment of precision). In the last possi-
bility, we have found a way of reframing the situation, giving less 
weight to the frustration that would otherwise provide the fram-
ing for our perception of the late train. In fact, as we will see, it is 
by altering our experience of frustration (giving it less importance) 
that we improve our ability to change our perspective on the situ-
ation. Play (especially risky play) offers good opportunities to learn 
and change our relationship with uncertainty and the frustration 
it can bring.
Playfulness and the meaningful life  7
We suggest that playful engagement with consumable errors 
(a safe amount of uncertainty) can help predictive agents to learn 
about how to redeploy precision in much the same way as in the 
train example. Consider as an example of such playful engage-
ment with error, listening to true crime stories, or watching horror 
movies. People that enjoy these media are engaging with fictional 
realities depicting extremely low-probability but highly volatile 
and threatening events. What is interesting and makes us curious 
to explore such realities, despite the improbability of our ever find-
ing ourselves in such situations, is our own embodied reactions. 
Play of this kind provides us with the opportunity to learn about 
our own reactions to dangerous and highly volatile situations in 
which our lives would be at risk were we to be so unfortunate 
to encounter them. Horror films provide people with the possibil-
ity to explore simulated or imaginary experiences of dangers and 
threats. What such fictions do is imagine what it would be like 
were one’s worst fears, and even fears one had never previously 
imagined, to be brought to life. This allows viewers to safely gather 
information about what it would be like to deal with dangerous sit-
uations, so as to prepare for related situations they may encounter 
in their own lives. Indeed, recent research has shown that peo-
ple who watched horror movies during the pandemic experi-
enced less psychological distress during the pandemic ( Scrivner 
2021b) and reported feeling more prepared for the second-wave
(Gifford 2020).
There is evidence more generally that people who are attracted 
to horror movies tend also to experience high levels of anxiety. Peo-
ple diagnosed with anxiety disorders (such as generalised anxiety 
disorder, panic disorders, and social anxiety disorder) have been 
shown to also be fans of horror (Grisafi 2016; Turner 2017; Scrivner 
& Christensen). These individuals experience exaggerated and out 
of proportion worry and apprehension they find difficult to control 
in response to potentially threatening situations such as difficul-
ties at work or in personal relationships. Morbid curiosity, in which 
people are motivated to seek out information about threatening 
situations, is no doubt part of what explains why people with 
high levels of anxiety in their lives might enjoy horror. Horror sto-
ries provide anxious people with information about the situations 
that worry them that may allow them to better prepare for these 
situations.
We suggest that in addition engagement with horror sto-
ries may provide highly anxious people with a means of affect 
regulation. Learning about our own affective reactions requires 
metacognitive monitoring—the observation of one’s own cogni-
tive operations. Agents are learning to metacognitively model their 
own affective responses when they engage with fictive realities. 
We have suggested the valence of affective states can be identified 
with error dynamics that may play a role in the context-sensitive 
adjustment of precision weighting. When playful engaging with 
fictive realities allows a person to learn about their own affec-
tive responses, this amounts to the person learning to model their 
own deployment of error dynamics in precision weighting. They 
are learning second-order expectations about how precision is 
assigned across different contexts.
Competitive sports may also serve as a context in which to 
learn such second-order expectations about how precision is 
assigned. For example, in many competitive play experiences (e.g. 
football, baseball, martial arts, etc…) players are similarly learn-
ing about what it is like to act skillfully under pressure, which 
requires them to learn about, and so increasingly tolerate, a vari-
ety of challenging uncertainty-related experiences (e.g. the stress 
of performing well, supporting your team, dealing with forms of 
aggression, managing unexpected situations, avoiding/tolerating 
injury, etc…). Learning about how one responds to uncertainty can 
be important for flourishing, because it contributes to resilience 
and what Taleb (2012) calls ‘antifragility’—the growth of skills in 
the face of stress. (See Kiefer et al. (2018) for an example of these 
ideas in the context of training competitive athletes.) We suggest, 
in addition, that learning to tolerate stress and uncertainty can 
contribute to the learning of emotion regulation skills that are 
important for flourishing in life more generally. We will return to 
this point below.
Following Sandved-Smith et al. (2021), we suggest that as an 
agent increasingly models its own error dynamics it improves its 
ability to regulate those dynamics. The effect of learning about 
our affective responses is that we can potentially render predic-
tion error signals less newsworthy that would otherwise be given 
high-precision weighting. We can turn down the precision on these 
error signals. This happens by making the error signals opaque. 
Ordinarily, error dynamics are experienced transparently—they 
are not accessible to the system itself, but rather drive selections 
of policies directly given our phenotype and habits. Insofar as neg-
ative affective states are transparent, they are treated as signalling 
sources of error that could be essential to the self’s integrity. They 
therefore get to drive the agent’s behaviour as if they were essen-
tial to the agent’s integrity. This has the effect of producing a 
powerful ‘urgency for change’ in the agent, leading it to behave 
in ways that either prolong the positive state or quickly bring to 
cessation the negative ones.
The opacification of this part of the precision machinery opens 
new opportunities for control. Observing the arc of our affective 
reactions in play allows us to develop new higher order poli-
cies about how precision (via valence) is being set on policies. 
Instead of affective states adjusting precision on policies directly, 
and so automatically conditioning us to behave in certain ways, 
one can now learn to activate alternative policies depending on 
the usefulness of the valenced signals. Consider the extraordi-
narily free-climbing skills of Alex Honnold. He has climbed some 
of the most challenging of America’s steep cliff-faces without 
ropes, harnesses, or protective equipment, including the 3000 foot 
El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Honnold tells us he has 
trained himself to no longer be moved by fear. When he first began 
free-climbing, he experienced the very same fear responses sig-
nalling the danger of the sport that you or I would experience. 
Over time however he learned to have a high tolerance for uncer-
tainty so that he is now able to continuously explore and stretch 
the limits of his own skills. We suggest this may be something 
Honnold was able to train himself to do by no longer relating to 
his negative affective states of fear and anxiety transparently as 
signals that should be given high-precision and therefore drive 
the selection of his actions. Instead, he made his negative affec-
tive states opaque, gaining sufficient psychological distance from 
them until they were no longer given the weight to automatically 
drive his behaviour. Interestingly, when Honnold was placed in an 
fMRI machine and presented with emotionally highly disturbing 
images, his brain showed virtually no activity in areas such as 
the amygdala that would typically be highly activated (Mackinnon 
2016). It is as if in training himself to be fearless he succeeded in 
turning down the precision signals on error signals, expanding the 
phenotypic bounds on the amount of uncertainty, danger or threat 
that his body is prepared to tolerate.
Again a comparison with mindfulness will prove instructive. 
Mindfulness has been shown to be highly effective, in people who 
are trying to quit smoking cigarettes, at disrupting the habitual 
patterns of response that lead from the affective state of crav-
ing to smoking (Bowen and Marlatt 2009). Mindfulness in effect 
8 Kiverstein and Miller
selects a policy to closely attend to the feelings of craving—the 
negative valence driving processing toward the expected rate of 
error reduction relative to nicotine levels—every time they arise. 
The new goal (instead of smoking a cigarette), now activated 
every time there is a craving, is to watch, as closely as possible, 
the arising, the progression, and the inevitable depletion of the 
craving-related feelings. Overtime, these sorts of mindfulness 
practices have the effect of making cravings opaque, teaching the 
system that cravings are in fact just feelings in the body, which can 
be allowed to direct processing and behaviour or not. This discov-
ery can represent a major return of control for people struggling 
with nicotine addiction. The negative valence of cravings remains 
unchanged through this process of opacification. What changes is 
that it begins to be interpreted by the system as information that 
can be useful, but is not obligatory, in selecting policies.
We see then that as an agent learns to model their own pro-
cesses of precision estimation, they also improve their ability 
to regulate their emotional reactions—the degree to which error 
dynamics are allowed to directly drive action selection. Sandved-
Smith et  al. (2021) have suggested that in a deep parametric 
generative model, lower-level precision dynamics (such as those 
that are believed to be closely related to affective valence) can 
be optimized by deeper predictions about precision deployment 
over predictions. In effect, the agent is now able to take lower-
level precision estimates as the observations over which higher-
level predictions can now be made. These meta-cognitive abilities 
increase our capacity to stay flexible—not driven directly by affec-
tive changes. This flexibility in turn allows us to more readily 
cognitive reframe like in the example of the late train with which 
we began. This ability to cognitively reframe requires there to be 
a tolerable amount of uncertainty about its expectations, which 
will allow the system to flexibly alter those expectations and so to 
change their behaviour.
This kind of psychological flexibility may be a key part of living 
wisely. Once an agent’s affective reactions become opaque, they 
will no longer unthinkingly drive the agent’s behaviour. The agent 
can gain sufficient distance from their affective reactions so that 
they no longer identify with their affective states as reflecting their 
current reality and how they are faring in the world. They can 
engage flexibly with their affective states without reifying or tak-
ing to be objectively real how those states present the world. Many 
psychopathologies, from addiction to depression, are character-
ized by an agent’s reifying their affective responses to the world. 
Think for instance of craving in addiction or of ruminative think-
ing in depression. Agents relate to their emotions transparently, 
taking them to represent reality rather than to be a particular 
interpretation or perspective on reality. As we saw in the previ-
ous section, the result is a rigidification of the agent’s priors laid 
down through past patterns of thinking and acting. The agent is no 
longer drawn into an open and broad mode of curious exploration. 
What is common to the dispositions of mindfulness and playful-
ness is an openness to explore the unknown that is a consequence 
of the person being prepared to tolerate uncertainty. The willing-
ness to stress, break, and challenge their model of the world opens 
up the possibility to grow in their skills, which we have argued is 
a key element of living a meaningful life.
Conclusion
We have used the AIF to identify a key computational ingredient in 
human flourishing—playfulness. We have argued that playfulness 
may contribute to living a meaningful life in three ways. In play 
activities, agents are drawn towards what we called consumable 
errors—errors that are complex and challenging but nevertheless 
manageable given the individual’s level of competence. We have 
argued first that agents that are disposed to engage with the world 
playfully will tend to seek out novel, challenging, and uncertain 
information. They will be willing to explore the unknown and 
unfamiliar without fear or anxiety. They will thereby find them-
selves well-positioned to take advantage of, and make the most 
out of opportunities for growth when they arise. Second, playful-
ness is characterized by a reduced latent inhibition. This means 
that the playful individual is able to encounter the familiar with-
out expectation allowing for an experiencing of the world in the 
present moment and with fresh appreciation. Third, playful agents 
will tend to actively create situations in which they can monitor, 
observe, and learn from their own affective reactions. In learn-
ing to model their own affective reactions, agents can come to 
exercise improved emotion regulation. Their affective responses to 
the world become opaque, no longer unthinkingly driving action. 
Instead, the individual is able to flexibly reappraise their meaning. 
What is the connection between these three features of playful-
ness and flourishing? We suggest that what they share in common 
is that in each case the agent has learned to tolerate uncertainty. 
The playful individual has installed a high-level prior that uncer-
tainty is sometimes safe to explore and even to create. The insight 
that uncertainty is neither necessarily good nor bad but is to be 
treated with an attitude of equanimity is, we have suggested, 
among the key ingredients in living a fulfilling and meaningful
life.
