Complex living agents consist of cells, which are themselves competent sub-
agents navigating physiological and metabolic spaces. Behaviour science,
evolutionary developmental biology and the field of machine intelligence all
seek to understand the scaling of biological cognition: what enables individ-
ual cells to integrate their activities to result in the emergence of a novel,
higher-level intelligence with large-scale goals and competencies that belong
to it and not to its parts? Here, we report the results of simulations based
on the TAME framework, which proposes that evolution pivoted the collec-
tive intelligence of cells during morphogenesis of the body into traditional
behavioural intelligence by scaling up homeostatic competencies of cells in
metabolic space. In this article, we created a minimal in silico system
(two-dimensional neural cellular automata) and tested the hypothesis that
evolutionary dynamics are sufficient for low-level setpoints of metabolic
homeostasis in individual cells to scale up to tissue-level emergent behaviour.
Our system showed the evolution of the much more complex setpoints of cell
collectives (tissues) that solve a problem in morphospace: the organization of a
body-wide positional information axis (the classic French flag problem in
developmental biology). We found that these emergent morphogenetic
agents exhibit a number of predicted features, including the use of stress
propagation dynamics to achieve the target morphology as well as the ability
to recover from perturbation (robustness) and long-term stability (even
though neither of these was directly selected for). Moreover, we observed
an unexpected behaviour of sudden remodelling long after the system
stabilizes. We tested this prediction in a biological system— regenerating
planaria— and observed a very similar phenomenon. We propose that this
system is a first step towards a quantitative understanding of how evolution
scales minimal goal-directed behaviour (homeostatic loops) into higher-level
problem-solving agents in morphogenetic and other spaces.
1. Introduction
How does the complex anatomical structure of the body form reliably from the
activity of individual cells? More than emergent morphogenesis, many organisms
are able to reach the same specific target morphology despite surgical injury ,
changes of cell size or number, organ rearrangement, genetic defects and many
other insults [1]. How does the collective decision-making of cell groups enable
regeneration, regulative, development, metamorphosis and cancer suppression?
Answers to these questions are critical to many fields, including evolutionary
developmental biology , cell biology and complexity science [2,3]. Beyond their
importance for basic science, the ability to control the collective behaviour
of cells toward specific anatomical shapes has massive implications for

transformative biomedicine. How can we best control morpho-
genetic systems composed of several levels of organization
from cell to tissue, to achieve desired outcomes in regenerative
medicine and synthetic bioengineering [4]?
All of these questions raise the problem of understanding
how the competencies of cells relate to those of the emergent
tissue-level swarm, and what evolutionary dynamics enable
the shift between those states to occur. No individual cell
knows what a finger is or how many a salamander is sup-
posed to have, and yet when amputated, the collective will
actively build until precisely the right number, size, shape
and position of the fingers is restored [5]. What is the origin
of the dynamics that enable a cellular collective to work
toward large-scale anatomical target states that are too
complex and big for individual cells to represent?
Some frameworks, motivated by cybernetics and behav-
iour science, seek a deep symmetry among homeostatic
behaviour across scales and material implementations [6,7].
It has been suggested [8] that evolution pivoted some of the
same strategies for navigating problem spaces across meta-
bolic, anatomical and behavioural domains. For example
(reviewed in [9,10]), the same mechanisms using ion chan-
nels, electrical synapses and computations via bioelectrical
networks underlie problem-solving in physiological space
by bacterial communities [11,12] and plants [13,14]; naviga-
tion of morphospace by a wide range of embryonic and
regenerative systems [15–17]; and classical behaviour by
organisms with neurons and brains [18,19].
Traditional behaviour science focuses on the cognitive
capacities of an ‘individual’— memory , perception, learning,
anticipation, decision-making, goal-directed behaviour— and
makes two assumptions. First, the body is usually conceived
as a fixed structure, following the mainstream paradigm that
the genome codes for specific bodyplans. Second, brain struc-
ture is thought of as stable— the individuality of its neuronal
cells is gone for good. Our primary experience is that of a cen-
tralized, coherent self. For organisms like caterpillar, which
undergo metamorphosis, with drastic changes of body , brain
and behaviour, studies usually focus on their separate phases
of life. The transitional states are usually not studied [20].
However, all intelligences are collective intelligences, they
are made of parts that are themselves biological agents.
Regenerative biology and the development of new organisms
like biobots [21] reveal that studies of cognition in intact
bodies present just a narrow slice of a much bigger picture:
that of the multi-scale interface between body and mind.
Indeed, cognition is tightly linked to the physical structure
of the body, from the anatomical level to the molecular and
bioelectric levels that store its information [20]. And structure
and function are both highly plastic. Cognition continues to
function despite important changes to the body/brain
and the corresponding modification of its information at
the cellular, molecular, or bioelectric level [22].
In the age of regenerative medicine, and of hybridization
between evolved and designed subsystems [23], it seems
essential to understand how mind and body coevolve [24],
in order to explore the origin of multicellularity and the scal-
ing of basal cognition of individual cells into larger
organisms. The algorithms that allow cells to perform goal-
directed decision-making and the transition to larger selves
are still poorly understood [20,25]. To integrate and advance
the fields of developmental/evolutionary biology, synthetic
bioengineering, artificial intelligence and cognitive science,
it is fundamental to begin to develop computational frame-
works that allow us to ask how cognitive capacities arise in
agents made up of parts, and how these emergent cognitive
agents scale up during evolution.
In the scale-free cognition framework [20], we rely on
ideas from control and information theory to identify multi-
scale information processing principles. That theoretical fra-
mework proposed that the scaling of homeostatic behaviour
in morphogenetic space is the direct result of group dynamics
of homeostatic subunits in metabolic space [20]. The work we
present here is a quantitativein silico embodiment of that
theory, generating testable predictions. It provides, to our
knowledge, the first exploration of the emergent morphogen-
etic consequences of a scaling that does not treat cells as
simple automata following static rules, but instead as entities
with information-processing homeostatic capacity. Earlier
studies showed that individuals can be outperformed by
collectives [26], and that a collective’s overall performance
is dependent on several characteristics including the organiz-
ational or network structure [27], the information aggregation
and communication system among individuals, and the
diversity of members [28]. These studies focused mainly on
human networks and the associated wisdom of the crowd.
We focus here on morphogenetic systems.
The mechanistic and algorithmic invariance between scales
of organization has enabled numerous tools and approaches
from neuroscience to be ported to developmental biology
[4,29,30] resulting in novel capabilities in regeneration, cancer
reprogramming, and repair of birth defects. To move this field
forward, and to better understand the role of evolution, it is
essential to develop quantitative, generative models that
reveal what dynamics are sufficient for the scaling of competen-
cies and their generalization to new problem spaces. Thus, we
sought to create a minimalin silicosystem in which we could
observe whether, and how, evolutionary dynamics could
drive the shift from cell-level metabolic goals to the much
larger, body-wide goal of patterning a positional information
axis. The scope of this work applies to any organism capable
of axial patterning including not only metazoans but also
plants, corals and sponges [31–33]. Goals are here defined
from the perspective of a cybernetic approach, focused on
error minimization with respect to a specified homeostatic set-
point [34,35]. Here, we present the details and analysis of a
simple artificial embryogeny system (two-dimensional cellular
automata with each cell
’s behaviour controlled by an evolution-
ary artificial neural network) which we initialize with cell-
level physiological homeostasis and observe the emergence
of competence to reach a target morphology (solving the classic
French flag problem [36]) in an entirely new problem domain:
anatomical morphospace. While a number of models have
been proposed for solving the French flag problem [37–40],
our model uniquely shows how the capability to robustly self-
organize a spatial axis at the tissue level emerges from unicellu-
lar metabolic competencies (cellular homeostasis in the absence
of local instruction). In this work, we used the French flag pro-
blem as a measure of morphogenetic competency to flesh out a
specific theory of how collective intelligence scales up across
problem spaces in evolution. Our data show that evolutionary
forces drive the emergence of several higher-level competen-
cies, including error-minimization to reach an anatomical goal
state and robustness to perturbation. This multi-scale homeo-
stasis is driven by shared (non-local) stress dynamics and
biologically plausible cell–cell interactions. Our analysis reveals

2
how minimal low-level metabolic requirements can scale up
into morphogenetic competency.
2. Foundation for the model
Our model is based on the following background assumptions
as defined in detail in the TAME framework [7]. The first is
that individual cells already have the competency to stay
alive via homeostatic pursuit of metabolic resources. This is
a minimal requirement for all living forms (already present
in microbes, both unicellular and multicellular), but we
assume its presence— we are not modelling the origin of life
or the initial formation of the very first reproductive unit,
but rather seeking to understand the collective behaviour of
subunits that were once independent organisms themselves.
Second, we model two scales: a developmental phase where
cells are alive and interact with each other, and an evolutionary
wrapper which changes the frequency of different behavioural
policies of the cells based on the fitness of the collective (how
well the resulting‘embryo’ matches a very simple criterion:
having a single, three-valued positional information axis).
Third, our use of the term‘goal’is not meant in any kind
of meta-cognitive, self-aware complex sense. Goals here are
synonymous with the cybernetic approach [34,35], in which
certain systems can expend effort to reduce error from a
specified homeostatic setpoint. Our aim is to show how
such goals can scale in size and arise spontaneously in new
problem spaces under evolutionary selection, given very
minimal and realistic assumptions about the properties of
the components.
Finally, while we do not explicitly invoke bioelectric sig-
nalling mechanisms, our cell interaction model is quite
compatible with that mode of communication (spelled out
in detail in [20]). We do provide the cells with gap junctions
(electrochemical synapses [41,42]), through which they can
share state signals. We also include a mechanism for stress
signals (initially, intracellular detectors of out-of-homeostasis
states) to be propagated outward from cells, experiencing
geometric frustration (a measure of how much the neigh-
bours of a cell share the same state) as predicted by the
TAME framework [7].
3. Related work: in silico embryogeny
Multicellular morphogenetic algorithms or set of built-in be-
havioural and signalling policies that allow cells to cooperate
and compete to reliably construct complex body pattern are
still incompletely understood [20,25]. One relevant approach
is amorphous computing, which refers to systems of many
identical simple processors that have limited computational
power and that interact locally. Typically, such systems
have a more irregular structure in contrast to the regular
structure of cell networks as they are used in our study
[43]. Several authors have investigated pattern formation in
developmental biology using the same task we use in this
article, the French flag problem. Herman and Liu solved it
through the simulation of linear iterative arrays of cells [44].
Several other models have been developed to resolve the
same problem, including a reaction–diffusion model, use of
computational primitives and genetic programming [37–40].
Miller evolved a development program that follows a prede-
fined grammar that connects developmental encodings to
genetic programming. He used a feed-forward Boolean cir-
cuit to implement a cell program [38]. Chavoya and Duthen
used a genetic algorithm to evolve cellular automata that pro-
duced different two-dimensional and three-dimensional
shapes [45] and evolved an artificial regulatory network
(ARN) for cell pattern generation, resolving the French flag
problem [46]. While others have simulated evolutionary
growth of neural network-controlled cellular automata with
hardwired mechanistic rules, this is the first exploration of
the emergent consequences of evolutionary scaling based
on dynamic interactions of cells with information-processing
homeostatic capacity. The combination of neural networks
and cellular automata which grow under evolutionary con-
trol is described in the work of Elmenreich & Mordvintsev
[47,48]. However, their neural cellular automata do not
include any cellular signalling or any use of stress capable
of linking the different homeostatic levels for the scaling of
goals (metabolic in individual cells and morphogenetic for
the tissue). A key difference in our work is that the artificial
neural network (ANN) inside each cell here models the
behaviour of a gene-regulatory network and can control
gap junctions to deliver the morphogen and the ability to
reduce stress (tendency to reduce geometric frustration) to
the other cells (figure 1).
Past studies have also investigated the multi-scale interface
of body and mind, notably with‘morphological computation’
in artificial life and soft evolutionary robotics [49–53]. These
studies model and exploit the fact that brains, like other develop-
ing organs, are not hardwired but are able to ascertain the
structure of the body and adjust their functional programs
accordingly. Similar to scale-free cognition, morphological com-
putation is about connecting the body and cognition— showing
how optimal control policies span different scales, mechanisms
and problem spaces. However, to our knowledge, no prior
model has explicitly investigated how cell-level metabolic
competencies scale up into tissue-level morphological ones.

4.1.1. The general scheme of the evolutionary simulation
4.1.1.1. General system
We developed an evolutionary simulation system composed of
cells that forms a tissue on a two-dimensional grid (figure 1). The
system is an evolutionary , agent-based, spatialized model that
uses two main time-scale loops, with different temporal scales.
The outside loop is an evolutionary (phylogenetic) long time
scale where genomes are mutated (here the genome is the one cor-
responding to the evolutionary algorithm and it generates the ANN
controlling each cell in the tissue and agents are selected). The inner
loop is a short time-scale ontogenetic loop that constructs each
agent, simulates development, and then tests the phenotype for fit-
ness. Each agent is one cell, that encodes some very simple
metabolic processes and interacts with the other cells.
We integrated a homeostatic loop that enables it to optimize for
the levels of energy (we are not trying to model the origin of life
itself— we start with cells that can keep themselves alive via basic
homeostasis, e.g cells that need to keep a level of energy superior

to 0). We allow cells to attach to each other using gap junctions, to
send intracellular signals. These signals, and their properties— such
as speed of spread, ability to propagate gap junctions, gating prop-
erties of gap junctions based on signal and cell state etc.— are all
controlled by the ANN inside each cell through evolution. Cells
do not know the origin of a given signal once it is inside the cell;
it has been suggested that this‘wiping property’ enables a kind
of shared memory that is essential for the scaling of small agents
into larger intelligences [7]. The cells have a minimal memory of
the past and have access to their stress and energy levels, and
their states, at timet and t −1 (see algorithm 1).
The general approach is related to cellular neural networks [54]
and more particularly to the growing neural cellular automata [48]
where each cell has access to the states of its neighbours and con-
tains a neural network to drive actions (neural networks are simply
a convenient formalism for encoding cell behavioural properties,
equal in power to gene-regulatory networks [55]). In our case,
the number of cells is fixed and does not grow with time and the

tissue formed by those cells has borders (i.e. it is not a torus). The
order of execution of cells is shuffled at each step.
4.1.1.2. Cell description
Each cell contains an ANN (representing the computational func-
tions carried out by gene-regulatory networks and pathways
operating within cells [55,56]) which controls the opening and clo-
sure of gap junctions in four directions: up, down, left, right. ANNs
are commonly used to model genetic regulatory networks [57]; in
that line of research, the ANN inside each cell can be interpreted
as a genetic regulatory network controlling the metabolic processes.
Each cell has one type of morphogen molecules that can go through
the gap junctions depending on their openings and that will trigger
different kinds of genomic expression leading to three different cell
states: blue, white, or red (see figure 1a). These states depend only
on the level of morphogen inside the cells (red if the level of mor-
phogen is between 0 and 5, white if between 5 and 10, blue if
greater than 10). We also imposed an energy cost on state change.
Each cell also has a stress molecule and an antistress counterpart
that can be sent to its neighbours (see algorithm 2). To summarize,
each cell can contain the following: the energy state, necessary for
survival and for state change, morphogens that can go through
gap junctions to define the cell state; and stress and stress-reduction
molecules, which can also move between cells via gap junctions,
and which define the stress state.
Our model does not enforce the use of the stress system: it is
completely evolved since the number of stress and stress-reduction
molecules to be transferred is chosen by the embedded neural net-
work. In addition, evolution can decide to make the stress molecule
instructive or not. We have chosen to refer to it as the stress molecule
but, before evolution, it is just another communication system for
cell signalling that does not directly affect the cell state (see
§4.1.1.5). The neural network, which is identical for each cell, has
11 inputs: the internal levels of morphogens, energy at timet,
energy at timet −1, stress at timet, stress at timet −1, the internal
state at timet and t −1, the size of the collective the cell is part of
(number of cells of the same state connected by opened gap junc-
tions in the tissue), the error between the size of the collective the
cell is part of and the target size in percentage— e.g. the size of
one stripe— (|100 −[size of sub-collective/(total number of cells
in the tissue/3 × 100)]|), the perception of the cell neighbourhood
(geometrical frustration or how similar the cell is to its neighbours)
and a bias set at 0.5. The four outputs of the ANN are: the number of
morphogen molecules to send to neighbours, the number of stress
molecules to send to neighbours and to be applied to the cell
itself, the number of stress-reduction molecules to send to neigh-
bours and to be applied to the cell itself, and the opening of gap
junctions in the four directions. The level of stress of one cell is
bounded between 0 and 100.
4.1.1.3. Learning task
The learning task is the French flag problem [58,59] (see
figure 1b). It was originally developed by Wolpert [58] to
formalize discussions about how spatial gradients might specify
patterns of cell fates in a tissue.
4.1.1.4. From local to anatomical homeostasis
We tied the single-cell and the anatomical homeostatic loops. Each
cell has only one goal— to survive— and that corresponds to being
in the appropriate state in order to receive energy (with the other
members of the collective). On the other hand, the collective/
tissue has a morphogenetic goal, which is to reach the French flag.
At each step, each cell receives a reward in the form of an
amount of energy which is proportional to how close its corre-
sponding sub-collective (corresponding to one stripe and
therefore bigger that the immediate neighbourhood of one cell) is
to reaching the appropriate anatomical goal. Each cell therefore
has a reward uncertainty , because the reward depends not only
on that cell’s own behaviour but also on the behaviour of the (sub)-
collective; in other words, the reward is affected by the decisions of
distant cells. Therefore, the environment of the cells is of high uncer-
tainty. In a sense, this scheme can be understood as a problem of
multi-agent reinforcement learning under reward uncertainty.
Goal-directed systems have the ability to focus on relevant
information and ignore distracting information. To do so, they
rely on selective attention and/or interference suppression. Selec-
tive attention would rely on top-down biasing mechanisms as
proposed by Desimone & Duncan [60]. In our case, the top-
down biasing mechanism is represented by the reward in energy
that ties the two homeostatic levels. We also imposed an energy
cost for communication and state changes (respectively , of 0.8
and 0.25 per step).
4.1.1.5. Stress system
Stress can be defined as three related concepts— the external and
internal stimuli that cause stress, the emergency physiological
and behavioural responses activated in response to those stimuli,
and the pathological consequences of over-stimulation of the emer-
gency responses [61,62]. Here, we implemented a communication
system that enables diffusion of a stress molecule through the
tissue to allow other cells to feel stress that was not caused by
their own internal state. When the ANN of a cell makes the
decision to send stress, that cell will diffuse a molecule to its neigh-
bours, equally increasing its own stress level and that of its
neighbours. In the same manner, the ANN can also cause the
cell to send a stress-reduction molecule (functionally equivalent
to an anxiolytic intervention) to the neighbouring cells that will
decrease the cell stress levels (figure 1f ). Importantly , whether or
not (and how) the stress system is used to solve the patterning pro-
blem is not determined in the code. Evolution can produce agents
that do or do not use this set of signals as a communication system.
In other words, before evolution, what we call the stress system
here is just another communication system in the tissue where a
specific cell signalling will increase (or decrease) the level of a mol-
ecule inside the cell. This cell signalling works exactly like the
morphogen communication system, except that it does not have
royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsfsInterface Focus13: 20220072
5
any effect on the cell state. Evolution can choose whether or not to
add an‘interpreter’to these specific molecules (e.g. the ones we
defined in this section as stress and stress-reduction molecules)
to make their levels informative for the cells or by triggering a
specific behaviour (like biological stress).
4.1.1.6. Evolutionary algorithm
We use ES-HyperNEA T [63] to simulate the evolutionary cycle. ES-
HyperNEA T (evolving substrates HyperNEA T) is an extension of
the original HyperNEA T method for evolving large-scale artificial
neural networks using the NEA T method (neuroevolution of
augmenting topologies). HyperNEA T evolves large-scale neural
networks using the geometric regularities of the task domain. It
uses compositional pattern producing networks (CPPNs) to gener-
ate the structure of the ANN. ES-HyperNEA T allows the positions
and number of the neurons to be evolved instead of being defined
before evolution as in HyperNEA T [63]. The fitness function is the
percentage of good states the tissue has:
fitness ¼ð number of good states=number of cellsÞ/C2 100: ð4:1Þ
The whole system has been coded in Python programming
language, using the agent-based modelling framework Mesa
[64] and the MultiNEAT package. It is freely available on
https://github.com/LPioL/scalefreecognition.
4.1.1.7. Parameters
All experiments in this article used the same parameters and
have been repeated over 20 runs. For each evolution, we used
250 generations, a population size of 350 individuals, a division
and variance thresholds of 0.03. The energy cost for state change
is 0.25 and at each step, cells lose 0.8 in energy. The minimum
and maximum number of species are, respectively, 5 and 15.
The number of generations without improvement (stagnation)
allowed for a species is 10. The depth for the neural net is
four hidden layers (increasing the number of hidden layers to
five did not change the general fitness score) and three for the
quadtree.
The available CPPN activation functions for the French flag
task domain were sigmoid, Gaussian, linear, sine and step. The
band-pruning threshold for all ES-HyperNEAT experiments
was set to 0.3. The bias value for the CPPN queries is−1. The
cells starts with energy levels initialized at 70. The energy cost
of communication is set at 0.8. We also applied an energy cost
of −0.25 to the state change for all cells.
4.1.2. Information-theoretic analysis
Information theory [65] is a very useful tool to understand the infor-
mation dynamics in complex systems. We used two information-
theoretic measures to analyse the information dynamics of the results:
active information storage (AIS) [66] and transfer entropy [67].
4.1.2.1. Active information storage
The amount of information in the past of one agent that is rel-
evant to predict its future state is defined as the information
storage. In this article, we focus on the AIS component, which
is the stored information that is currently in use for computing
the next state of the agent [66]. Formally, the AIS of an agentQ
is defined as the local (or unaveraged) mutual information
between its semi-infinite past q
ðkÞ
n as k →∞ and its next state
qn+1 at time stepn +1 :
aQðn þ 1Þ¼ lim
k!1

pðqðkÞ
n , qnþ1Þ
pðqðkÞ

aQ(n, k) represents an approximation of history lengthk. The
average over time (or equivalently weighted by the distribution
of ðqðkÞ
n , qnþ1ÞÞ: AQ(k)= 〈aQ(n, k)〉. With AIS, an agent can store
information regardless of whether it is causally connected with
itself [66].
In this article, we compute the local AIS over the states of the
cells.
4.1.2.2. Transfer entropy
Transfer entropy is the information provided by the agent source
about the destination’s next state that was not contained in the
past of the destination agent. In this article, we use the local trans-
fer entropy introduced by Lizier [66]. The local transfer entropy
from a source agent Z to a destination agent Q is the local
mutual information between the previous state of the sourcez
n
and the next state of the destination agentqn+1, conditioned on
the semi-infinite past of the destinationqðkÞ

Transfer entropyTQ(n, k) is the (time or distribution) average:
TQ(k)= 〈tQ(n, k)〉 and tQ(n, k) represents an approximation of his-
tory length k. While mutual information measures correlation
only, the transfer entropy measures a directed and dynamic
flow of information in the network of agents.

For the analysis of our information dynamics, we computed
a different kind of transfer entropy: the transfer entropy from
stress (by discretizing it by chunks of 10) to the states of the
neighbours (blue, white, red). We computed the local transfer
entropy pairwise with all the neighbours of one cell and aver-
aged it. In the same manner, we computed the transfer entropy
from the energy state to the state of the cells and conversely
the transfer entropy from the state of the cells to the energy state.
We also defined the transfer entropy from one stripe to
another as the sum of all transfer entropy of one cell of one
stripe to all cells of the other stripes computed pairwise on the
time series of the internal states. Formally, we define the aver-
aged transfer entropy over a range of source–destination pairs
in the spatial locations of different stripesS

4.2. Method for the planaria experiment on
repatterning
4.2.1. Colony maintenance
Dugesia japonica were maintained in Poland Spring water at
20°C, fed calf liver paste once a week and cleaned twice a
week, as described in [68]. Animals were starved for one week
prior to usage in amputation and pharmacological treatment
experiments and were not fed for the duration of all experiments.
4.2.2. Animal manipulation
Cutting of planaria was performed on a cooling plate using
scalpel fragments. For generating headless animals, pre-tail frag-
ments were cut by placing a cut at the pharynx opening and
another cut narrowly above the tail tip. For tracking tail regener-
ation, animals were cut halfway between the head and tail. For
tracking regeneration along the anterior/posterior axis, animals
were either decapitated narrowly by cutting just below the auri-
cles, cut halfway between the base of the head and the top of the
pharynx, or cut directly at the top of the pharynx.
4.2.3. Pharmacological treatments
Headless worms were produced through transient pharmaco-
logical treatment of freshly cut pre-tail fragments in 18 μM
U0126 (a well-known blocker of ERK/MAP kinase [69]) dis-
solved in DMSO (Sigma). No more than 40 fragments were
treated per 10 cm Petri dish. Fragments were incubated in
U0126 for 3 days at 20°C before washing out the drug solution.
At 14 days post-amputation, the fragments were scored for
regenerative phenotype.
4.2.4. Scoring of repatterned phenotypes
Headless animals were maintained in individual wells of 12-well
plates and their phenotypes were scored weekly for the duration
of the experiment. Any significant changes in morphology , such
as head regeneration, fissioning or ectopic tissue development,
were noted. Time of repatterning was determined once one eye
was visible in the forming head structure. Worms were labelled as
‘Polarity Flip’when a headless worm fissioned and a head regener-
ated at the posterior wound site. Worms were labelled as‘Dorsal/
Ventral repatterning’when an outgrowth of tissue occurred in the
dorsal/ventral (D/V) plane of the headless worm. Worms were
labelled as ‘Lateral growth’ when significant changes in mor-
phology occurred with growth on the lateral area of the animal,
resulting in stable morphology which did not produce a head.
5. Computational results
We analysed a number of experiments performed with this
system, tracking key physiological parameters over time in
each experiment (see figures), including gap junctional com-
munication, stress levels and cell types as a function of
position. We focused on the most biological evolved tissue:
the one where stress emerged during evolution as an instruc-
tive signal and increases and decreases as a function of the
homeostasis of the tissue.
5.1. The tissue minimizes error for reaching the target
morphology
We first tested the ability of the cellular collective to solve the
French flag problem, that is, to organize the two-dimensional
tissue into a one-dimensional axis of positional information with
respect to cell type identity. Eachcell received energy according
to is location on the tissue, and itsenergy reward was proportional
to how well the other cells of one stripe of the French flag were
resolving the French flag pattern (in other words, evolution gives
partial credit for imperfect primary axial patterning, selecting for
embryos with optimal morphogenesis). The cell colours in all
figures represent cell fate, as in the original definition of the pro-
blem in which an embryo must spontaneously pattern itself into
three ordered regions of cell fate [58]. All cells started in the blue
state (homogeneous tissue corresponding to an un-patterned nas-
cent blastoderm). To solve the problem, cells had to dynamically
cooperate with, and send the appropriate signals to their neigh-
bours. The fitness function was computed for 100 steps, defining
the time course of development in this virtual embryo.
We observed that the ANN inside each cell evolved, and that
this system was able to solve the problem (figure 2). A typical
tissue behaviour had the following features. First, the regions
corresponding to future white and red stripes began to be
stressed and then it was mainly the red stripe that was stressed.
All gap junctions were open, the upper and right gap junctions
were fully open and the low and left gap junctions were half
open. The gap junction states weighted the flow of molecules
so that the streams from right to left and left to right were
equal as was also the case for the streams in the vertical axis.
The diffusion of morphogen molecules from left to right
occurred because the cells of the blue stripes acted as a reservoir
of morphogens and the cells decided to send more or fewer of
these molecules to their neighbours depending on the dynamics.
In the representative example we show here, the stress
increased at 55 steps and it then decreased as the French flag
morphogenetic problem was resolved. At 90 steps, the tissue
reached 95.1% of the French flag target morphology , and
there were four remaining blue cells in the red stripe (an
almost perfect solution). The same result was seen over 20
repeat runs, solving the problem in 94:4 +0:84% of over 20
runs. The sharp change in morphogenetic activity around
step 55 appears because the cells had learned to be stressed
at a specific energy level. This converts continuous metrics to
sharp discontinuities— the perception and decision-making
that cells have learned over their history. This is demonstrated
by our finding that when the stress level at initialization
is increased, the spike in stress is delayed proportionally (see
electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
Thus, the tissue learned to minimize error between its current
s t a t ea n dt h et a r g e tm o r p h o l o g yduring its lifetime in order to
stay alive; by doing so, the tissue— starting from a homogeneous

state— resolved the French flag problem. It seems to work less
well with random initializations, suggesting that robust develop-
ment is optimized when cells start with a muted, homogeneous
‘baseline’ state, not highly diverse starting states, which is
indeed what is observed in real development, where embryos
do not begin as a collection of randomly differentiated cells, but
as a homogeneous mass of undifferentiated ones (see electronic
supplementary material, figure S3). We conclude that this mini-
mal system shows how cell behaviours (that can be tuned by
evolution or learning) enable the collective to harness individual

Figure 2. Dynamics of resolution of the French flag problem. (a) Temporal dynamics of changes in cell state, stress and gap junction status during problem resolution. The
cells resolve the French flag problem almost entirely by the 90-step timepoint. The dynamics of the resolution is represented by five time steps takenat steps 0, 45, 60, 75
and 90–100 of the simulation. These five time steps are indicated in the leftmost column, and the remaining columns represent (from left to right): the statesof the cells in
the tissue (blue, white, red), the use of the stress system on a colorimetric scale (the darker the red, the more the system is stressed), and the percentages of open gap
junctions in four directions (down, left, up and right), again using a colorimetric scale. Grey represents closed gap junctions and the green scale denotes the range of opening:
the darker the green, the smaller the percentage of open gap junctions. The stress system is used throughout the resolution of the French flag problem.(b) Amount of stress
in the tissue during the resolution of the French flag problem. The stress system is used all through the resolution of the French flag problem. The amount of stress increases
around step 55 and decreases rapidly after about step 64, approaching zero when the target morphology is reached around step 90.

metabolic homeostatic loops (the pursuit of energy) towards a
global patterning goal.
5.2. The tissue is robust to perturbation
The cells had learned error-minimization in order to reach the
anatomical goal, but did they follow a hardwired plan that
could only enable a feed-forward emergent pattern? Or had
they in fact acquired an ability for homeostasis that would
allow the tissue to reach the target morphology even in the
presence of perturbations beyond theab initiomorphogenesis?
To determine the degree of plasticity of this process, in this
next set of simulations, we perturbed the tissue by artificially
changing at 110 steps the states of the last two columns of the
red stripe to white cells. The cells had never been evolved on
more than 100 steps. However, after the perturbation at 110
steps, the tissue corrected the red stripe in 10 steps and a few
blue cells appeared in the white stripe (figure 3). The stress
increased and decreased in parallel to the perturbation and
its resolution, as it did to resolve the French flag problem.
This capacity is similar to that observed in biological systems,
many of which are able to regain normal morphology despite
a wide range of perturbations [1]. The system tried to get rid of
the remaining blue cells left in the white stripe. At 200 steps, the
tissue reached 95.1% of the French flag. The dynamics of
the gap junctions stayed the same as during the French flag
resolution as seen in figure 2 without perturbation.
We also examined the effect of changing the size of the per-
turbation domain (see electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). The tissue can adapt sufficiently for survival follow-
ing a range of smaller perturbations (from two cells to two
columns within a stripe) made at step 110. However, it was
unable to recover from a much larger perturbed region (e.g.
converting the entire red stripe into a white one). In this case,
it attempted to adapt but dies at 200 steps. For smaller pertur-
bations, the tissue reached a French flag compatible with
survival. Interestingly , biological data support this surprising
result: in the case of transformation of normal melanocytes in
tadpoles to body-wide melanoma [70], and in the case of trans-
plantation of healthy tissue into a deformed tadpole to repair
its brain development [71], a very few cells are necessary to
effect system-wide morphogenetic change.
Thus, we conclude that even though we did not specifically
reward for anything other than the single self-organizing prop-
erty , the cells were able to repair to the target setpoint from
multiple starting configurations. In this sense, the tissue is excit-
able as a perturbation will spread and change the morphology.
5.3. The tissue maintains allostasis in adulthood
We discovered that the tissue can resolve the French flag problem
and is robust to perturbation, but does the tissue reach long-term
survival and maintenance of an adult phase? To answer this
question, we performed simulations running for 1000 steps.
We observed that the tissue maintained its morphology during
the whole lifetime. In addition, at 1000 steps, the morphology
was even better than in the developmental phase, with the
tissue reaching 96.3% of the French flag target morphology on
this simulation (figure 4a). The tissue was observed to spon-
taneously become stressed several times during its lifetime;
these stress increases were not the consequence of any external
perturbation, and were due to the intrinsic dynamics of the
tissue. The first stress increase, as described above, happened
prior to step 90 in order to reach enough of the target
morphology to stay alive. We observed (e.g. in the representative
i n d i v i d u a ls h o w ni nf i g u r e4b) four additional stress increases at
steps 285, 322, 395 and 896. At these steps, the intrinsic dynamics
of the tissue created deviations from the target morphology that
increased the level of stress, after which the tissue corrected the
new anatomical trajectory in order to reach homeostasis, at
which point stress decreased. Once the tissue reached a mor-
phology compatible with life, stress was reduced to 0. On
average for this task, the collective reached 87:7 +13% of the
target morphology over 20 runs. These deviations represent
spontaneous remodelling as no external perturbation has been
applied to trigger them. Remodelling first begins after a time
window three times greater than the time needed to reach the
target morphology during development. In other words, the
morphogenesis can be said to have been completed and
ceased long before spontaneous morphogenetic activity sud-
denly resumes. This phenomenon is similar to that described
by catastrophe theory [72], and suggests self-induced missing-
tissue response (MTR) [73,74], a process similar to the one we
observed in the planarian experiments (see §6). In our simu-
lations, a dramatic spike in stress immediately precedes the
sharp onset of extensive morphogenetic activity (see electronic
supplementary material, figure S1a), suggesting that stress
drives the morphogenetic changes in the tissue.
Interestingly , the cells had never been evolved over a period
of time greater than 100 steps— there was no selection pressure
for long-term stability or survival. However, they were able to
maintain the tissue more than 10 times longer than their initial
developmental period (the only aspect on which they were
evolved). We were also surprised to find they also learned allos-
tasis. Following the definition of McEwen & Wingfield [75]:
allostasis is the process of maintaining stability (homeostasis)
through change in both environmental stimuli and physio-
logical mechanisms. In this simulation, the tissue changed
regularly as it tried to get rid of remaining, inappropriately
located blue cells; sometimes this remodelling process took the
collective a sufficient distance from the French flag target mor-
phology to activate homeostatic mechanisms which then
drove it back to normal, allowing long-term maintenance and
survival of the tissue.
Thus, we conclude that long-term stable survival does not
need to be specifically selected for, as intrinsic dynamics and
emergent anatomical regenerative capacity are enough to
maintain order through an adult phase. Homeostasis is an
active process which is mirrored in this case by the level of
stress that increases and decreases with the distance between
the current tissue state and the target morphology.
5.4. Stress: different use-cases
The morphogenetic process exhibits interesting stress
dynamics, consistent with the proposals [7] that homeostatic
loops are driven by stress as a reflection of delta from setpoint,
and that complex setpoints such as tissue-level morphogenetic
patterns could arise from cells sharing stress information to
optimize plasticity and coordinate in more complex problem
spaces. Thus, we next studied the functional role of stress in
the emergent morphogenesis we observed.
5.4.1. Evolution exploits stress as an instructive signal to reach
the target morphology
We first sought to determine whether stress was instructive
or merely a by-product of the various dynamics. To answer

this question, we simulated a loss-of-function of the stress
system in the tissue (e.g. as the action of an anxiolytic
drug), which forcibly reduced the level of stress to 0 during
the whole lifetime of the embryo (figure 5).
The dynamics of the gap junctions were similar in this
anxiolytic experiment to what they were when stress was
used (figure 2). However, we observed that at 90 steps, the
tissue reached only 82.8% of the target morphology. And at

99 steps, the collective of cells corresponding to the location
of the red stripe of the French flag dies. The collective
achieved 67:3 +2:8% of the target morphology over 20 runs.
These experiments reveal that, in the absence of stress,
anatomical homeostasis is not reached nor maintained
during the lifetime of the cells. By contrast, when stress is
available to the cells, the tissue reaches 95.1% of the French
flag target morphology at 90 steps and it maintains the
morphology after this step.
Thus, we conclude that cells exploit the ability to use the
stress mechanism to implement morphogenesis and survival
of development.
5.4.2. Stress is instructive but only at particular levels
Having seen the importance of stress mechanisms among
cells, we next wanted to know if the stress system featured
a window of optimality: is too much stress bad for this pro-
cess, as it is for real biological systems? Thus, we artificially
induced a very high stress (compared to what is needed
and used during the French flag resolution) at the locations
of the white stripe at 110 steps of the simulation (figure 6).
With this excess stress, we simulated an environmental stres-
sor that is not adaptively informative about the current
situation of the tissue since it had already reached a version
of the French flag compatible with survival (e.g. the cells
receive enough energy). Stress decreased immediately with-
out changing the states of the cells. At step 140, a line of
blue cells appeared in the white stripe. It seems that stress
was only instructive at specific concentrations inside the
cells, and then blue cells appeared in the white stripe.
Stress transformed the cells close to the borders of the stripes
into reservoirs of morphogen molecules, and by accumulat-
ing them, they became blue. It seems the cells evolved by
making stress instructive only at specific levels as it had no
effect during those last 30 steps and it kept decreasing.
We conclude that evolution used stress as a communi-
cation system using a particular encoding, in which stress
level is instructive and has effects on cell behaviour only at
specific concentrations.
5.4.3. Evolution exploits the stress system but anxiolytics do not
always have an impact on anatomical homeostasis
Evolution finds more than one way to solve a problem. Here,
we analysed the counterexamples— the individuals that can
solve the problem without the use of stress. In 10 evolutions
that achieved a fitness score superior to 90% on average (over
20 runs) for reaching the French flag, simulations acheived
93 +2:6% of target morphology with stress and 91:5 +8%
when anxiolytics are added. However, 70% of the evolved tis-
sues use the stress system but it is not systematically
functional. This high standard deviation for the anxiolytics
experiment is explained by the fact that for the majority of
the evolved individuals, stress is not fundamental to reach the

target morphology. For one evolved tissue, the absence of stress
results in embryonic death during development, while for
others it has no negative impact. Quantitatively, 1/10 of the
evolved tissues used stress as an instructive signal and died
when anxiolytics were added. This is true for the evolved
tissue in the different experiments above. This ratio is low
but, in terms of biological evolution, it would be sufficient to
spread into the entire population over time if it increases the
overall fitness of the organism during evolution. The other
virtual embryos are still able to develop the French flag without
stress even if they used it as a result of artificial evolution. Three
in 10 of the virtual embryos had better scores on average on the
French flag in the presence of anxiolytics, meaning that stress is
an o i s ys i g n a lf o rt h e m .
Why does biological evolution use stress— does the use of
the stress system in our simulation increase the adaptive
responses of the organisms in more complex scenarios? In
order to answer this question, we used the same 10 virtual

ao n es a m p l et-test to compare these two means and found the
difference statistically significant (withp-value = 0.0312). Thus,
it is possible that stress enables adaptive responses in poten-
tially harmful environments.
In summary , we found that the stress system is not always
needed to resolve the French flag problem during develop-
ment. For this problem, anatomical homeostasis without
stress is possible but exploiting spatial propagation of stress
information seems to increase adaptive fitness by improving
performance in scenarios where the normal process of
morphogenesis is impacted by external perturbations. As has
been suggested [7], stress is an ideal parameter for evolution
to exploit as a representation of the error in homeostatic con-
texts, and the drive to reduce stress could then implement
‘grow and remodel until complete’in regenerative settings [7].
5.5. Information-theoretic analysis of the dynamics
of the anatomical homeostasis
To truly understand how cellular collective behaviour solves
morphogenetic problems, and to derive efficient interventions
for biomedical contexts, it is essential to understand what the
cells are communicating to each other: what information is
available to groups of cells? How does its propagation through
the tissue enable the cohesion of multiple competent agents
into an emergent individual at a higher level of organization
that can achieve a morphogenetic goal? Thus, we next applied
information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of the
tissue during anatomical homeostasis. We computed the local
active information and local transfer entropy for the original
simulation without any perturbation (figure 2). We also com-
puted the transfer entropy from one stripe to another to
understand if one sub-collective could drive the information
dynamics and ultimately the anatomical homeostasis (figure 8).
The transfer entropy from stress of one agent to its neigh-
bour started to increase in the tissue at time step 55. Then we
wave an important increase at time step 59 in the locations of
the white and red stripes. This correlates with the increase of
stress in the same spatial locations. The overall transfer entropy
was almost 300 bits at this time step (figure 8c). Then, the trans-
fer entropy decreased and reached a steady state around 0. The
black squares represent negative local transfer entropy , meaning
that the cells receive information from the stress that is mislead-
ing for predicting their next state. We also compared the transfer
entropy from stress of one cell to its own state and found it to be
much less important than the transfer entropy from the stress of
one cell to the states of its neighbours (figure 8c). This suggests
the key signalling mode for the stress is paracrine, not autocrine.
The dynamics of the local AIS on the cell states followed
different dynamics. When transfer entropy was increasing,
we observed several spatially located negative local AIS
among the spatial locations of the white and red stripes (see
figure 8a). At 55, 59 and 60 time steps, the AIS was mainly nega-
tive for the white stripe, after which it increased gradually until
it reached steady state (figure 8a,b). For the red stripe, AIS also
decreased globally until around step 70 and then we observed
an important increase, indicating cells could predict better their
future state from the past memory. Concurrently , the stress is
decreasing. The local AIS of the blue stripe was 0 throughout
as the cells in this region never changed their states. Thus,
stress increases concurrently with a decrease in local AIS in
the tissue (as seen in figure 8b) or, in other words, when the cel-
lular memory does not effectively predict the future. This is
compatible with the definition of stressors as unpredictable
and/or uncontrollable stimuli [76,77].
We also computed the average local transfer entropy from
one stripe to another, from the cells corresponding to the spatial
locations of the red stripe to the white and conversely
(figure 8d). This averaged transfer entropy was 0 at each time
step for the blue to red and white stripes and from each of
those to the blue. Using a time window ofk =4 , b e f o r e 6 0
steps, we observed a peak of 250 bits of transfer entropy from
the red stripe to the white, suggesting the tissue changes were
driven by the red stripe. Just after 60 steps, this reversed: trans-
fer entropy from the red stripe to the white stripe decreased and
transfer entropy from the white stripe to the red became much
higher, with a peak around 450 bits of information suggesting
that the white stripe was now driving the change in the states.
The ‘organizer’ region (here defined as a region or group of
cells in a tissue that can induce and instructively pattern other
cells) seemed to change over time, suggesting embryonic
regions take turns driving the large-scale process.
Finally , to evaluate the direction of information flow, we
looked at local transfer entropy from energy to the state of
each individual cell, taking an average across all cells in the
whole tissue, as well as the converse— transfer entropy from
the cell state to energy (figure 9a). The first peak we observed,
at around 55 steps, corresponded to the transfer entropy from
energy to states, indicating information flow came from the
anatomical homeostatic loop. After 60 steps, the two transfer
entropies overlapped. At the same time, the average energy
of all stripes was either increasing or started to stop decreasing
(figure 9b). Thus, in our scheme, the information was first
driven by the anatomical loop, and the energy needed for
single-cell survival was controlled by this loop.
We conclude that stress was very informative in the state
changes of direct neighbours of one cell. Stress increased con-
currently with a decrease in local AIS in the tissue (as seen in
figure 8b). This is similar to biological systems where stressors
are defined as unpredictable stimuli. In our scheme, evolution
used the stress system as a communication system that was
activated when memory of past events was not effective for
predicting the future. There was a wave of information flow
from red to white stripes, and it seems that the larger anatom-
ical homeostasis loop came first in terms of information flow
from energy to differentiation state. Taken together, these ana-
lyses reveal the dynamics of the information flow in the tissue.
We observed an emergent behaviour when the‘organizer’
region changes over time, stress is used as a communication
system with the neighbours, and the higher level of homeosta-
sis (anatomical homeostasis) came first in the dynamics

suggesting that top-down information is key to manipulate the
dynamics of the tissue.
6. Experimental results on repatterning of
planaria
The sudden remodelling of cell fates after a long period of
apparently quiescent, stable pattern in our model (figure 4)
predicts that something similar may occur in biological sys-
tems. Might some phenotypes that seem complete in fact
need to be followed for much longer to observe the true
dynamic? We indeed found this to be the case [78], for pla-
narian flatworms [79] regenerating after exposure to U0126,
a blocker of ERK/MAP kinase signalling which plays an
important role in many model systems of regeneration
[74,80–82]. Several studies have shown that ERK inhibition
immediately following amputation leads to the formation of
headless animals [74,80,81]. These headless animals that
regenerate after ERK inhibition had previously been assumed
to have reached a terminal, stable morphology [74]. However,
when we monitored them for 18 weeks following ERK inhi-
bition, we observed a remarkable phenotype in which some
of the headless animals suddenly began to repattern, with
some regaining a wild-type single-headed morphology.
To quantify this phenomenon, we defined repatterning as
any morphology change occurring after four weeks post-cut-
ting. In headless animals observed from when they were cut
until their death (n = 181), 22% showed some form of sudden
repatterning even though regeneration had completed and
morphogenesis had ceased weeks prior (figure 10b). Impor-
tantly, this repatterning occurred without any intervention.
The remaining 78% of headless animals did not show any
change in morphology except for shrinking in size, as head-
less animals are unable to feed and therefore allometrically
scale down over time [83]. We observed repatterning from

four weeks onwards and the majority of repatterning
occurred between 4 and 10 weeks (figure 10 c). After 10
weeks only sporadic new repatterning was observed,
although some worms began forming new heads as late as
18 weeks after cutting. This spontaneous repatterning that
allows the re-establishment of a normal morphology many
weeks after regeneration is completed suggests the existence
of tissue processes that operate on a time scale much longer
than previously known. Anatomically, the observed repat-
terning fell into four different categories. In the most
common repatterning type (61% of all repatterning worms),
normal single-headed wild-type morphology was regained
(figure 10 b,d(i)). The second most common phenotype
(18%) was a polarity reversal, in which, following fissioning
of a headless animal, the posterior blastema formed into a
head (figure 10b,d(ii)). The remaining two categories rep-
resent the rare animals that exhibited growths which did
not lead to the formation of a head, in the form of either
dorsal outgrowths (D/V repatterning, 10%, figure 10d(iii))
or lateral outgrowths (11%, figure 10d(iv)). When headless
animals repatterned to form a new head, the pigmentation
of the round anterior end began to lighten and the tissue flat-
tened out, forming a structure resembling a blastema (figure
10e). Once the blastema formed, first one eyespot appeared
(figure 10e(ii)) and then the second one formed with a few
days’ delay (figure 10e(iii)), along with the head reshaping
to regain the typical morphology (figure 10 e(iv)(v)). In
addition, animals were stained using synapsin antibodies to
visualize regrowth of the underlying brain tissue at intervals
during the repatterning process. This showed that early
brain repatterning occurred via the formation of a cluster of
neural tissue at the anterior rounding of the ventral nerve
cord (figure 10f(i)). Brain structures formed progressively
from there, first in an apparently unorganized manner
(figure 10 f(ii)), before expanding and reforming into a
well-organized brain resembling that of a normal animal
(figure 10f(iii–v)). While the repatterning process resembles
normal head regeneration in its progression, the timeframe
was distinctly slower than normal head regeneration [84],
taking up to 25 days from the first observation of changes
at the anterior to a fully formed head.
7. Discussion
One of the key open questions in evolutionary developmental
biology , as well as basal cognition [8,20], is how single-cell
capacities (competency in physiological and metabolic
spaces) scale up to enable systems to solve problems in mor-
phogenetic space (anatomical homeostasis), such as axial
polarity and body-wide positional information axes. Because
intelligence can be defined as competency in navigating arbi-
trary problem spaces, and all agents are fundamentally
composites of other parts, it is important to understand
how evolutionary forces and generic dynamics [85–87] work
together to scale up collectives and pivot their simple homeo-
static properties into more complex capabilities. Here, we
presented an evolutionary simulation of the scaling of goals
from individual cell-level metabolism to embryo-wide axial
positional information. This system is a model of multi-scale
homeostasis that illustrates how cells can join into collectives
that solve problems in new spaces. We found that evolution
was able to use the shared stress system to coordinate across
space and time, and developed error-minimization and
homeostatic capacities (as demonstrated by robustness to
perturbation). The resulting tissue was found to be robust
to external perturbation, and use of the stress system was
both instructive for initial morphogenesis and necessary for
long-term survival.
While maintaining allostasis, the tissue also tried to get rid
of the few aberrantly placed blue cells after development,
taking the collective temporarily away from the French flag
target morphology , to then allow homeostatic mechanisms to
drive it back to normal, resulting in long-term maintenance
and survival of the tissue. This corresponds in the TAME fra-
mework [7] to ‘delayed gratification’— the ability to not get
trapped in local minima by temporarily stepping further
from the goal in the problem space. This ability to move
away from the goal in order to reach a better solution later (fol-
lowing not only minimum-distance paths) is an important
capability of some cognitive systems. Degrees of this kind of
‘delayed gratification’in cybernetic systems enable more soph-
isticated behaviour, along the continuum from simple‘roll
downhill’ mechanisms to complex problem-solving systems

[7]. Interestingly , neither of these things were directly selected
for during the evolutionary cycle, revealing how some capa-
bilities of multi-scale homeostatic systems can emerge as a
kind of‘free lunch’, without direct selection pressure [2,88].
Our analysis reveals the emergent functional connections
between the single-cell and anatomical homeostatic loops.
Each cell has one goal, to survive, and it corresponds to
being in the appropriate state to receive energy (with the
other members of the collective), e.g. navigating in a one-
dimensional metabolic continuous space but by discretizing
it: the new emergent problem space solution has three
instances (blue, red, white), corresponding to different cell
fates along a positional information axis. On the other
hand, the collective/tissue has a morphogenetic goal, the
French flag, and it is simultaneously navigating a problem
space of 3
n instances (n, number of cells).
Our model made a surprising prediction— spontaneous
and sudden re-initiation of morphogenetic activity long
after patterning has completed. This phenomenon was reca-
pitulated by the results ofin vivo experiments in planaria.
Of course, our model is provisional, and not claimed to defi-
nitively capture all of the complexity of the biology , but the

fact that it reproduces surprising behaviour not predicted by
other known models is reassuring. Such minimal models are
an important contribution to the field of molecular biology
and genetics, which are awash in enormous datasets of
detail and in need of conceptual tools for extracting under-
standable meso-scale dynamics sufficient to explain the
observed biological robustness.
The observation that planarians are capable of recovering a
wild-type bodyplan by spontaneously triggering a regener-
ation-like process, after maintaining a stable abnormal
morphology for long periods of time, poses interesting ques-
tions about how abnormal morphologies are first maintained
and how they are eventually detected to trigger correction.
In other organisms, there is some evidence that remodelling
of tissues to fit new morphologies can be part of regeneration,
such as the remodelling of transplanted tail tissue into a limb
in amphibia [89]. The repatterning reported here is distinct
from previous studies where it was shown that general
injury signals can induce regeneration in headless animals
[74], as here we applied no triggering injury of any kind.
The newly demonstrated ability to mount a regenerative
response without any triggering injury is consistent with the
idea that a MTR may not be necessary for regeneration to
occur [90] and that subtle internal dynamics may be sufficient
to initiate change long after the process appears to have
reached a stable point. Our finding that the spontaneous repat-
terning is slower than normal regeneration is also consistent
with other examples of regeneration in the absence of the
MTR [90]. The timepoint at which repatterning starts appears
to be stochastic within the population. The observation of
sudden initiation of repatterning in a seemingly quiescent
tissue raises a key question: what process in the tissue serves
as a ‘clock’ that enables remodelling at a particular time
frame? It must be distinct from the on-going and obvious mor-
phogenetic processes because remodelling initiates suddenly ,
on a background of constant cell identity distributions.
Recently , Chouet al.found a dynamic in bacterial biofilms
similar to the clock and wavefront model describing somito-
genesis [91]. Interestingly , they observed that nitrogen stress
response in the biofilm can form a complex pattern of con-
centric rings— revealing that spatial distribution of stress
responses had occurred already at the time that social microbes
emerged. Their results show that the development of bacterial
biofilm collectives is driven by an oscillatory process that can
locally amplify nitrogen stress responses, such that spores
may develop in different areas of the biofilm even under a
more abundant nutrient environment (not only in the starved
interior of the biofilm). Interestingly , in our model, we observe
a similar behaviour with a subtle oscillatory stress response of
the cells in different areas of the tissue (figures 1b and 8a)
allowing the formation of the French flag configuration. We
found that the pattern generated by the stress response in
our simulated tissue defines spatial regions where cells differ-
entiate into the different stripes, a mechanism similar to
that seen in the biofilm when various strains of bacteria
differentiate into spores. This behaviour is similar to somito-
genesis where a homogeneous tissue becomes segmented
(transcriptionally and anatomically). In both our simulation
and the biofilm, stress seems to play a key role and convey
information leading to differentiation of the cells and bacteria
similar to the clock and wavefront model. Our system is not
similar in every aspect, but they resolve the same problem:
how to create spatio-temporal order and to shift from cell-level
metabolic goals to the much larger tissue-level morphogenetic
goals. Thus, conserved dynamics could be relevant across
bacterial, metazoan and in silico minimal models of the
scaling of spatial patterning from single-cell metabolic and
stress dynamics.
The communication system is fundamental for collective
intelligence. In our scheme, communication is mediated via
gap junctions, a well-known system for coordinating physio-
logical and morphogenetic activity which has also been
proposed to be an essential complement to enhancing collectiv-
ity [20,41,92]. In our simulation, three types of molecules can be
exchanged: the morphogen, the stress molecule and its counter-
part, the‘anxiolytics’. In our simulation, stress plays a key role.
Stress is an ambiguous and transdisciplinary concept we used
from material science to physiology and ecology [62,93,94],
encompassing different meanings: certain stimuli can be stres-
sors; the emergency responses to the stressor is defined as the
stress response; and chronic stress is the over-stimulation of
the emergency responses [62]. In addition, the definitions of
these three concepts are mutually dependent: a stimulus that
initiates a stress response is a stressor, but the physiological or
behavioural response is considered a stress response if it is
initiated in response to a stressor. One solution has been to
define stressors as stimuli that disrupt or threaten to disrupt
homeostasis [95], but the concept of homeostasis has its own
limitations [96]. A more general definition is that stressors are
unpredictable and/or uncontrollable stimuli [76,77]. Interest-
ingly , this last definition fits with the emergent use of the
stress system in our simulation. Stress increased concurrently
with a decrease in local AIS in the tissue as seen in figure 8b.
Thus, in our scheme, evolution used the communication
system as a stress system that was activated when the
memory of past events was not effective for predicting
the future. This relates to the active inference framework and
the free-energy principle, both of which have recently been
developed to integrate homeostasis and allostasis [97], as
applied to morphogenetic systems [98,99].
Network structure is key to collective intelligence
[67,100,101]. It has been shown that flat, fully connected, net-
work structures provide the most efficiency for collectives to
resolve a task since that type of structure maximizes the
aggregation of information received from members of the col-
lective [100]. However, this kind of network is very costly as it
necessitates n(n −
1) connections and is probably not biologi-
cally realistic. Indeed, in most cell networks, cells are only
connected to their near neighbours. The stress system can
be seen as another communication system and could play a
role in changing the network structure to a flat (fully con-
nected) structure, at least for some part of the network,
thus facilitating information aggregation (see [102] for a
review of non-local cell communication modalities).
One purpose of these kinds of simulations is to develop
protocols that could enable robotics and artificial intelligence
approaches to benefit from the kind of robustness and
problem-solving ability observed in biology. In artificial intelli-
gence, the fact that all intelligences are collective intelligences
has not been emphasized [7], but there are recent attempts
for swarm robotics and deep learning to develop new methods
based on collective intelligence [48,103]. Deep learning has
started to integrate the approach with adversarial networks
with two networks working together [104]. Artificial collective
intelligence is usually studied from the point of view of swarm
intelligence or human society [105–107] but morphogenetic

systems present several characteristics that swarms lack: a
(growing) grid network architecture, the informational
wiping property (cells do not know the origin of a given
signal), and a different communication system closer to the
information processing of a cellular automaton that can only
communicate with its direct neighbours. In addition, in this
work, we were interested in a reward that has to be explicitly
global. In our simulation, individual cells have a high uncer-
tainty on the reward, as it depends on how well the collective
is performing. We developed a global mechanism which
rewards for complex, non-local dynamics, solving a problem
that is also known as‘credit assignment’in machine learning.
We wanted to address the question of how this long-range
reward can drive scale-up of single-cell competencies toward
tissue-level goals without having to pre-specify each cell’sc o r -
rect final state. This is a way of mechanistically linking top-
down rewards for system-level performance with the low-
level component behaviours, addressing the problem of
credit assignment, and is thus a step toward integrating the
scaling of cognition findings into artificial intelligence by
demonstrating dynamics that can lead to desired emergent
properties across scales.
Lastly , it is interesting to consider the relevance of this
system for basal cognition [108,109]. It has been argued that
body patterning and behavioural control seem to share a
common origin, not only via the mechanisms of ion channels
and neurotransmitters, but also via the evolutionary pivot by
which biology uses similar processes to solve problems from
physiological to morphogenetic and ultimately three-dimen-
sional behavioural spaces [8,9]. Indeed, several somatic tissues
exhibit evidence of learning and basal cognition, including car-
diac [110], bone [111] and pancreatic tissues [112], in addition
to the large literature on learning and decision-making in
microbes and other unicellular organisms [113–118]. These
capacities are very old [119,120] and the molecular apparatus
of higher cognition (ion channels, neurotransmitters and synap-
tic mechanisms) was already present in our unicellular
ancestors [13]. Brains and neurons have been speed-optimized
by evolution from other cell types [121]. But somatic cells did
not lose their cognitive repertoire and computational capabili-
ties during their transitions to multicellularity or in becoming
part of metazoan swarms (bodies): they scaled them to
pursue larger anatomical goals [4]. The symmetry between
development/regeneration and traditional cognition is not
simply an emergent result of hardwired processes, but the
emergent result of a very plastic, context-dependent system
that achieves invariant patterning outcomes under uncertainty.
Biological systems have remarkable capacities to achieve
the same morphogenetic outcomes despite a range of
perturbations, such as different starting conditions, different
numbers and sizes of cells, and various interventions (reviewed
in [1,122]). In this work, we simulated the transitions from
single-cell homeostasis to anatomical homeostasis using
stress, and tested the hypothesis that a minimal evolutionary
framework is sufficient to scale small, low-level setpoints of
metabolic homeostasis in cells to the larger morphogenetic
setpoints of collectives (tissues) (figure 11). These transitions
take place in a continuum from body patterning to cognition.
We propose that evolution pivoted the collective intelligence
of cells during morphogenesis of the body into traditional
behavioural intelligence by scaling up the goals at the centre
of homeostatic processes. This work is a first step towards a
quantitative understanding of the scaling of cognition.
