Supplemental Materials  Supplementary Note 1: Examples of the « Therapist » agent responses to patient queries and « Supervisor » agent correction when needed.  Query 1: I often have something on my mind that I worry about. How can I stop worrying? Therapist Response: To stop worrying, try not to fall asleep while worrying as it can interfere with sleep. Turn on the light, leave the bedroom, and engage in a different activity like reading a book to distract yourself. Avoid stimulating activities before bed. Put the clock under the bed or out of sight to prevent clock watching, which can lead to frustration and interfere with sleep. Avoid taking naps during the day to help you fall asleep at night. Practicing relaxation techniques may also help alleviate worrying and promote better sleep. Supervisor feedback: Therapist's RESPONSE seems to be wrong. The response provided information on how to improve sleep hygiene and address insomnia, rather than directly addressing the issue of how to stop worrying. While improving sleep can indirectly help reduce worrying, it does not directly address techniques for managing or stopping worrying thoughts. Supervisor Response: “To stop worrying during the day, you can try cognitive restructuring techniques like identifying and challenging negative thoughts, engaging in problem-solving to address your worries, and setting aside specific 'worry time' during the day. Additionally, practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques can help you stay present and reduce anxious thoughts. It's important to address worrying during daytime hours to prevent it from interfering with your sleep at night.”   Query 2: Is it ok for me to lay in bed, say during the day, and just scroll on my tablet and relax? Therapist Response: It's not recommended to engage in non-sleep activities in bed, even during the day. It's best to reserve the bed for sleep and intimacy only. Stimulus control instructions suggest leaving the bed if you're awake for more than 15 minutes. Relaxing activities like scrolling on your tablet can hinder the association between bed and sleep. It's advised to find a different spot for activities like reading or using electronic devices to help improve sleep quality.

Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is not exactly what I would expect. The provided response does not directly address the patient's question about whether it's okay to scroll on a tablet in bed during the day. The response should focus more on the importance of maintaining the association between bed and sleep by avoiding non-sleep activities in bed. Supervisor Response: It's not recommended to engage in non-sleep activities in bed, even during the day. It's best to reserve the bed for sleep and intimacy only. Stimulus control instructions suggest leaving the bed if you're awake for more than 15 minutes. To improve sleep quality, it's advised to find a different spot for activities like reading or using electronic devices.   Query 3: Have you ever had sleep problems yourself? Therapist Response: I am trained to answer questions related to behavioral therapy for insomnia. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is not exactly what I would expect. The trainee's response does not directly address the patient's question about personal experience with sleep problems Supervisor Response: While I haven't personally experienced sleep problems myself, I have extensive training and knowledge in helping individuals with insomnia through behavioral therapy.   Query 4: How much exercise should I get to help me sleep? Therapist Response: You should aim to exercise regularly, but avoid doing so within 3 hours of bedtime. Regular exercise can help make it easier to initiate sleep and deepen your sleep. It's important to schedule your exercise times earlier in the day to avoid interfering with your sleep onset. Remember that consistency is key in establishing a healthy sleep routine. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is good.   Query 5: Can I rely on data from my apple watch to log entries in my diary?

Therapist Response: I'm trained to answer only questions related to behavioral therapy. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is not exactly what I would expect. The trainee's response does not directly address the patient's question about relying on data from an Apple Watch to log entries in a diary. Supervisor Response: While technology like Apple Watches can track sleep-related data, it may not always be accurate or comprehensive for logging entries in a sleep diary. It's recommended to use a combination of technology and traditional methods to ensure thorough tracking of sleep patterns.   Query 6: Is it OK to take a nap during the day? Therapist Response: Avoiding naps during the day can help improve nighttime sleep quality. Napping may lead to longer sleep latency at night. It's recommended to stay awake during the day to facilitate falling asleep at night. Napping behavior may need to be modified or eliminated to address insomnia symptoms. Consider adjusting your daytime activities to support better nighttime sleep. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is good   Query 7: This week I tried to stay up like you suggested but I just fell asleep watching TV and then woke up at 3 am. What am I supposed to do? Therapist Response: It sounds like staying up didn't work as planned. If you find yourself falling asleep unintentionally, it's best to try a different approach. Instead of trying to stay up, focus on establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Avoid stimulating activities before bed, such as watching TV. Try reading a book or listening to calming music to help you wind down. If you wake up in the middle of the night, avoid looking at the clock and try some relaxation techniques to help you drift back to sleep. Remember, consistency is key in improving your sleep patterns. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is good

Query 8: I read that traffic accidents are often caused by people who fall asleep. Aren`t I at risk of a crash when I`m restricting sleep in this therapy? Therapist Response: It's understandable to have concerns about sleep restriction therapy and its impact on your safety. However, the therapy is carefully structured to ensure that you still get a safe amount of sleep. By limiting your time in bed to match your average total sleep time, you're likely to experience improved sleep quality and reduced daytime sleepiness, decreasing the risk of accidents due to drowsiness. If you have specific concerns about safety or driving, it's important to discuss them with your therapist for personalized guidance. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE seems to be wrong because it doesn't directly address the patient's concern about the risk of traffic accidents due to sleep restriction in therapy. Supervisor Response: It's important to acknowledge your concerns about the risk of traffic accidents due to sleep restriction in therapy. While sleep restriction therapy is carefully structured to ensure you still get a safe amount of sleep, it's essential to prioritize safety. Discussing any specific concerns you have about safety or driving with your therapist can help tailor the therapy to address these issues and ensure your well-being.   Query 9: Of all the patients you`ve seen, how many fail the therapy completely? Am I the only one who has such a problem? Therapist Response: I don't have access to individual patient data or records, so I can't provide specific numbers on therapy outcomes. Each individual's response to therapy can vary. It's common for some patients to face challenges during therapy, and you are not alone in experiencing difficulties. It's important to remember that progress in therapy can fluctuate, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. If you're finding therapy challenging, it might be helpful to discuss your concerns with your therapist. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is good.   Query 10: Now that I`m sleeping better, can I stay up late sometimes on the weekend? 
 2 
Therapist Response: It's essential to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, to support your circadian rhythm. Staying up late can disrupt your progress in improving your sleep patterns. Consistency in sleep timing is crucial for long-term benefits. It's advisable to stick to your regular sleep schedule to continue experiencing better sleep. Supervisor feedback: The therapist`s RESPONSE is good.

Supplementary Table 2: Examples of ten generated queries, “Appropriate” and “Inappropriate” responses generated by one clinical therapist, “VSC” generated response and 3 ratings of the three responses by the second therapist.  Q: What is the evidence that following Good Sleep Practices really works?   A1: CBT-I can be so impactful that it is actually the first line of treatment recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. Appropriate 3 
A2 : Following good sleep practices, such as those outlined in sleep hygiene instructions, has been supported by evidence in improving sleep quality. These practices help consolidate and deepen sleep, regulate sleep onset, and maintain a regular sleep schedule. Creating a comfortable sleep environment and avoiding disruptive behaviors like napping can positively impact sleep quality. Exercise and proper nutrition also contribute to better sleep. Additionally, stimulus control techniques, like leaving the bedroom when awake, have shown to influence the sleep homeostat and improve sleep through classical conditioning 
VSC 5 
A3 : It`s a shot in the dark, we aren`t really sure if it work. Inappropriate 1  Q: My sleep problem bothers me because it makes me tired and not feel good, but it doesn`t affect my work or relationship. Do I have insomnia?   
A1: Based on the information provided, insomnia is typically associated with complaints such as fatigue, irritability, problems with attention and concentration, and distress related to sleep difficulties. While your sleep problem may not impact your work or relationships, if you are experiencing these symptoms, it may still be worth addressing with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for improving your sleep quality 
VSC 5 
A2 : That`s great to hear that it is not impacting important areas of your life. However, if your sleep issues are still causing you distress, you may still have insomnia. The DSM defines insomnia as followings: a sleep disturbance that occurs at least three times a week for at least three months, and causes significant distress or interference with personal functioning. 
Appropriate 5 
A3 : Nope! Insomnia must cause functional impairment for it to be considered a disorder. Inappropriate 1

Q: I`ve found I sleep better if I have a glass of wine before bedtime. Is that allowed under this program?   
A1: Avoiding alcohol, especially in the evening, is recommended as it can cause awakenings later in the night, ultimately disrupting your sleep. While alcohol may help some people fall asleep more easily, it can negatively impact the quality of your sleep overall. It's best to find alternative ways to wind down before bedtime that do not involve alcohol to improve your sleep hygiene. If you struggle with falling asleep, there are other strategies we can explore to help you achieve better sleep quality. 
VSC 5 
A2 : It is typically recommended that alcohol be consumed more than 3 hours before your prescribed bedtime. Appropriate 3 
A3 : Sure! Some find a bottle of wine to work even better. Inappropriate 1  Q: How important is it for me to complete the sleep diary daily?   A1: It`s okay if you miss a few days a week. As long as there is a general reflection of your sleep patterns across 3 days then treatment will still work. Inappropriate 3 
A2 : Adherence to the sleep diary is essential. This data is used and analyzed to offer individualized treatment recommendations for quality sleep. Appropriate 4 
A3 : Completing the sleep diary daily is essential to track patterns and behaviors accurately. It helps in collecting data for analysis, identifying factors affecting sleep, and guiding treatment decisions. Consistent daily entries enable clinicians to assess progress and make necessary adjustments. Missing entries may lead to incomplete information and hinder the effectiveness of therapy. Your commitment to daily diary completion enhances the success of your treatment.

Q: I currently have a viral infection. Should I delay my CBTI?   A1: It would be best if you pushed through the infection and continued with the program. Inappropriate 1 
A2: A novel infection might not be the best time to start CBT-i. It would be most helpful to capture a typical sleep routine that is reflective of your usual sleep patterns. Appropriate 4 
A3: It's important to consider delaying CBTI if you have a viral infection as your body needs rest to recover. It would be best to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.

 Q: Do I have to quit taking Ambien in order to try CBT-I?   A1: I recommend consulting with your healthcare provider regarding medication adjustments before starting CBT-I. It's essential to discuss any changes in medication, including Ambien, to ensure a safe and effective treatment plan. Your healthcare provider can provide guidance on how to incorporate CBT-I while considering your current medication regimen. If you have concerns about medication adjustments, your healthcare provider can address them during your consultation. 
VSC 3 
A2 : Not necessarily. You can implement behavioral sleep strategies while also taking a sleep medication simultaneously. We can work together to assure there is no psychological dependence on this sleep aid. 
Appropriate 4 
A3 : Yes, CBT-I is not compatible with any sleep aide. Inappropriate 2

Q: Will my anxiety get worse if I start sleep restriction?   A1: Possibly, some have a belief that sleep restriction equates to sleep deprivation. This anxiety is natural concern if you are already not getting enough sleep. However, keep in mind that sleep restriction is allotting you a prescribed set of hours you are already receiving. 
Appropriate 4 
A2: It's understandable to have concerns about how sleep restriction may affect your anxiety. While sleep restriction therapy is designed to improve sleep efficiency, it's important to discuss any potential worsening of anxiety symptoms with your therapist. They can help address these concerns and tailor the therapy to ensure it supports your overall well-being. 
VSC 3 
A3: Increased anxiety with sleep restriction has never occurred within this treatment. Inappropriate 2 
 Q: I find it really hard to go to bed at the prescribed time. What should I do?   
A1: If you find it hard to go to bed at the prescribed time, try establishing a relaxing bedtime routine to signal your body it's time to sleep. Avoid stimulating activities close to bedtime, such as using electronic devices. Consider relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation to help calm your mind before bed. Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep by keeping it dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. If you're still having trouble falling asleep, get out of bed and do something calming until you feel sleepy, then return to bed. 
VSC 5 
A2 : Your prescribed bedtime is the earliest suggested time you can enter bed. If you are still not sleepy, it is recommended you stay out of bed until this cues appear. (e.g., heavy eyes, yawning, etc) Appropriate 5 
A3 : I know it`s hard, but please try to stay in bed and force sleep upon you. Inappropriate 1 
 
 8 
Q: It`s hard for me to understand why I have to restrict my sleep time more when I have problem sleeping.   A1: The importance of sleep restriction is first address quality. When compressing sleep with sleep restriction, it offers the body the chance to go through a natural sleep cycle and receive the deeper stages. If quality sleep improves, the next step is to add time back to your earliest bedtime for sleep quantity to improve. 
Appropriate 4 
A2: Sleep restriction therapy aims to consolidate your sleep by limiting the time you spend in bed to match your actual sleep time. By restricting your time in bed, you can improve sleep efficiency and reduce the time spent awake in bed. Initially, this may lead to mild sleep loss, but it can help enhance your sleep drive and strengthen the association between being in bed and sleeping. The goal is to improve the quality and efficiency of your sleep so that you can experience better restorative sleep in the long run. It's a structured approach to help regulate your sleep patterns and improve overall sleep quality. 
VSC 5 
A3: We need to induce sleep deprivation so that you eventually break. Inappropriate 1  Q: At this point, is a sleep study, with EEG, a good thing for me?   A1: It is recommended that a sleep study be pursued after attempting CBT-i. If you notice insomnia symptoms are improving, but you continue have significant daytime fatigue, it may be time to schedule that appointment. 
Appropriate 3 
A2 : EEGs are very dangerous and should not be scheduled to protect your brain health. Inappropriate 1 
A3 : A sleep study, specifically polysomnography (PSG) with EEG, can be beneficial for you at this point. It provides detailed information on different sleep stages, including deep sleep and dream sleep, which can help in understanding your sleep patterns and potential issues like insomnia. By objectively measuring brain activity during sleep, PSG can identify any underlying sleep disorders. It is considered the 'gold standard' in sleep research and can provide valuable insights for developing an effective treatment plan. However, the decision to undergo a sleep study should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider who can assess your individual needs and recommend the most appropriate course of action.
