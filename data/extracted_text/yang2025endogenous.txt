Abstract 30 
Extended cessation (EC) , an advanced meditative state in which consciousness is volitionally 31 
suspended and later reset with immense mental clarity, equanimity, and peace, offers an 32 
endogenous model for investigating the mechanisms of consciousness. Using ultra-high-resolution 33 
7T fMRI with dense within-subject sampling (N=3), we quantified whole-brain activity, functional 34 
and effective connectivity, cortical gradients, and eigenmodes, and related them to 35 
chemoarchitecture and cognitive maps. EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, 36 
down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal 37 
gradient, and decrease in low -order global eigenmodes . Cognitive decoding linked EC to 38 
heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering , and co -varied with 39 
histaminergic H₃ receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal 40 
Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework. 41 
More broadly, EC demonstrates that consciousness can cease without global suppression, 42 
suggesting a potential “reset” mechanism that fosters equanimity and the potential for flourishing. 43

Introduction 48 
In most scientific and clinical frameworks, wakefulness is assumed to entail ongoing 49 
subjective consciousness1. Advanced meditative states challenge this assumption by showing that 50 
consciousness can be radically thinned to minimal ‘content-free’ awareness 2,3 or even entirely 51 
suspended momentarily4-7 or for an extended duration8. These findings highlight the extraordinary 52 
plasticity of consciousness, raising fundamental questions for theories of consciousness, including 53 
Global Neuronal Workspace, Integrated Information Theory, and Active Inferences Framework, 54 
and their relevance to human flourishing9,10. 55 
Advanced meditation situates these rare states within a broader scientific agenda: 56 
understanding consciousness as a trainable and reconfigurable capacity  across meditative 57 
development11,12. This systematic mental training can lead to meditative endpoints, variously 58 
described as  “awakening”13,14, “beatitude” 15, “salvation”16, or “enlightenment” 13,14, that entail  59 
profound shifts in perception, emotion, and self -processing. Studying such endpoints offers not 60 
only a natural experiment for testing theories of consciousness but also insights into how such they 61 
can induce a “reset” of consciousness that  fosters equanimity, resilience, and well -being, all of 62 
which are critical priorities in global mental health17-19. 63 
Here, we study  extended cessation (EC), a rare meditative endpoint where practitioners 64 
report temporary suspensions of ordinary consciousness and mental activities4,8. EC can vary from 65 
minutes to days , is entered and exited volitionally, and is frequently followed by profound 66 
psychological aftereffects, including extreme sense of relief, clarity, openness, peace, equanimity, 67 
heightened sensory sensitivity, significant reduction in mental suffering, reduced repetitive 68 
thoughts, stoppage of negative self -talk, and an absence of inner narration 8,18,19. Unlike non-69 
conscious states induced by pharmacological agents (e.g., anesthesia or psychedelics) 20,21, EC is 70 
unique in being endogenous, reversible, precisely timed, and followed by heightened well -being, 71 
making it an excellent natural experiment for probing the mechanisms of consciousness.  One 72 
canonical form of EC found in Theravada Buddhism is Nirodha Samāpatti 8,22-24. Here, we 73 
investigate the broader neurobiological principles of EC without making definitive claims about 74 
its doctrinal interpretation 4,6,7. Please refer to  Laukkonen et al. f or a recent discussion of the 75 
historical and theoretical context of Nirodha Samāpatti8. It is noteworthy that Nirodha Samāpatti 76

is considered to be among the highest, or the highest, meditative attainment in some interpretations 77 
of Theravada Buddhism25,26. 78 
From a neuroscience perspective, studying EC offers a powerful opportunity to explore the 79 
fundamental nature and mechanisms of consciousness. A central limitation in current 80 
consciousness research is the absence of an endogenous and reversible method to suspend 81 
awareness while preserving physiological stability 20,21 and enabling prospectively timed re -82 
emergence8,23. EC addresses this gap 7,8. Compared to sleep, anesthesia, and disorders of 83 
consciousness, EC constitutes a fourth experimental context in its uniqueness self -initiate and 84 
control consciousness. This enables precise examination of transition dynamics at entry and exit 85 
and the mechanisms that dismantle and reinstate conscious access. Additionally, the notable 86 
aftereffects of EC described above may relate to significant neuroplasticity and reorganization of 87 
the brain, potentially informing techniques to enhance cognitive function, emotional regulation, 88 
overall wellbeing and happiness, and thriving. 89 
Current competing frameworks of consciousness make testable predictions for EC. Global 90 
Neuronal Workspace (GNW) predicts a collapse of long-range connectivity and reduced feedback 91 
connectivity during suspension of consciousness27 while Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 92 
predicts a decrease in network differentiation during non-conscious states28. In contrast, the Active 93 
Inference Framework (AIF) predicts down -weighting of sensory precision via thalamo -cortical 94 
gating during non-conscious states29. The distinct features of EC allow comparison among theories 95 
about how consciousness is represented and suspended in the human brain. 96 
Here we present the first neuroscientific, empirical investigation of EC, using ultra-high-97 
resolution 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the whole -brain 98 
activity, connectivity, and causal dynamics of network organization during EC. The ultra-high 99 
spatial resolution of 7T imaging allows for precise measurement of small but critical brain 100 
structures that are central to consciousness and arousal regulation, such as the thalamus, brainstem, 101 
and subcortical nuclei. This methodology is particularly powerful for the study of consciousness, 102 
where transitions between conscious and non -conscious brain states may be mediated by subtle 103 
shifts in deep-brain activity. Moreover, we used a novel and systematic neurophenomenological 104

approach to rigorously examine the subjective experience of EC, enabling a rare convergence of 105 
first-person insight and third-person measurement. 106 
This study provides important initial evidence for the neuroscience of EC and related 107 
fundamental aspects of consciousness, with potential therapeutic implications for human 108 
flourishing. In this study we sought to answer three key questions: (1) What brain reconfiguration 109 
accompanies voluntary suspension of consciousness? ; (2) What are the causal brain dynamics of 110 
EC; and ( 3) Which neurochemical systems are implicated, as inferred from spatial coupling to 111 
normative receptor distributions?  112 
Our findings indicate that consciousness can be suspended without global cortical 113 
suppression. During EC, unimodal systems (e.g., visual and dorsal -attention networks) remain 114 
selectively engaged while transmodal hubs and thalamo -striatal circuits are down -regulated; the 115 
principal cortical gradient polarizes rather than flattens; and network –neurochemical coupling 116 
aligns with histaminergic (H₃) precision control of sensory gating. Meta-analytic decoding 117 
demonstrated that EC is functionally aligned with perception and attention, while being least 118 
associated with mental suffering and distress. This neuronal signature is most consistent with AIF, 119 
constrains GNW theory, and challenges IIT.  This study demonstrates that the human brain can 120 
volitionally dismantle and reassemble conscious processing, offers a radical model for testing 121 
theories of consciousness, and highlights the possibility that consciousness can ‘reset’ and orient 122 
toward equanimity and flourishing. 123 
Results 124 
EC Phenomenology 125 
Detailed demographic of participants (N = 3) are provided in Methods. Participant 126 
endorsement of EC phenomenology is presented in Fig. 1. Here, we summarize the key 127 
phenomenology for the setup, entry, exit, and afterglow of EC.  128 
Setup. Participants typically used advanced absorption concentration meditation (ACAM) 129 
to set up EC. ACAM is a series of meditative absorption states accompanied by blissful sensations, 130 
emotional happiness, and equanimity, followed by an increasing reduction of input from the 131 
physical environment and the reduction of contents of consciousness to a bare minimum 132

experience. One participant who had previously trained using ACAM for setup, no longer 133 
necessarily needed ACAM to enter EC. Additionally, all but one participant incorporated elements 134 
of advanced investigative insight meditation (AIIM), that is, a neutral observation of phenomena, 135 
as part of their preparatory routine for EC. 136 
Onset. All participants reported that internal verbalization (thinking), body sensations, and 137 
feeling ceased during the onset of EC. With one exception, participants reported no primary 138 
experiential emphasis on either incongruence, transient nature of experience, or self-lessness (these 139 
are typically present during momentary cessations). 140 
EC. During EC, participants reported that typically all consciousness experience was 141 
completely offline. 142 
Exit. Upon emerging from EC, all participates reported that biographical memory and ego-143 
centered cognitive processing were typically absent, and they did not perceive any separation 144 
between themselves and the environment. All participants reported a vivid clarity of mind and an 145 
experience of objectless awareness. All but one participant reported the return of mental activity 146 
in a specific sequence: first thought, then bodily sensation, and finally internal verbalization. 147 
Afterglow. After EC, all participants reported typically experiencing intense sensory 148 
vividness, accompanied by a strong and lasting peace. They all also reported typically being 149 
inclined to solitude, and many described a deep, abiding joy. 150

somatomotor, temporal, and orbitofrontal cortices, posterior frontal opercula and insula, left 159 
precuneus-posterior cingulate cortex, and right cingulate cortex.  160 
In the subcortex, EC was primarily associated with decreased ReHo values.  Regions 161 
include the ventoposterior (THA-VP) and right dorsoanterior (THA -DA) thalamus, left anterior 162 
putamen, right hippocampus, medial amygdala, anterior caudate, and globus pallidus.  Increased 163 
ReHo was also seen in the left hippocampus, medial amygdala, and shell of the nucleus accumbens. 164 
In the brainstem, EC was associated with higher ReHo values in the median raphe, raphe 165 
obscurus, left inferior medullary reticular formation (MRt), mesencephalic reticular formation, 166 
inferior olivary nucleus,  viscero-sensory-motor nuclei complex , right alpha part of the 167 
parvicellular reticular nucleus, superior MRt, and superior olivary complex. EC was also 168 
associated with  lower ReHo values in the  dorsal raphe, left locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, 169 
laterodorsal tegmental nucleus -central gray of the rhomboencephalon, right cuneiform nucleus, 170 
superior colliculus, and parabrachial pigmented nucleus complexes of the ventral tegmental area 171 
(VTA-PBP).  172 
In the cerebellum, EC was associated with higher ReHo values in cerebellum regions 6 173 
(divided attention) and 10 (autobiographical recall and interference resolution). 174 
Additional significant regions of interest (ROIs) for each control condition are presented 175 
below. 176 
EC vs counting control condition.  Additionally, EC, compared to the counting control 177 
condition, was associated with lower ReHo values in the left dorsoposterior thalamus (THA-DP), 178 
raphe magnus, left substantia nigra, and red nucleus. 179 
 EC vs memory control condition.  In the subcortex, EC compared to the memory control 180 
condition, was associated with higher ReHo values in the left posterior globus pallidus and 181 
putamen, and right nucleus accumbens. Decreased ReHo values were found in the bilateral lateral 182 
amygdala and right ventroanterior (THA-VA) thalamus and THA-VP. In the brainstem, higher 183 
ReHo values were found in the left isthmic reticular formation, pedunculotegmental nucleus, 184 
superior MRt, and right medial parabrachial nucleus; and lower ReHo values in the right inferior 185 
olivary nucleus and microcellular tegmental nucleus – prabigeminal nucleus. In the cerebellum, 186

EC, compared to the memory control condition, was associated with lower ReHo in the cerebellar 187 
region 4 (associated with action observation).  188 
Full correlations for the 123 cognitive terms are reported in the Supplementary excel file. 189 
Functional connectivity: Network-based statistics (NBS) 190 
Comprehensive results/summary tables of significant regions are included in the 191 
Supplementary excel file  and results are visualized in Fig. 3a, b . Here, we only provide a 192 
summary of the results. 193 
Across both counting and memory control conditions . Notable findings include 194 
widespread lower functional connectivity throughout the brain, mostly between the brainstem and 195 
cortical networks, including the default-mode network ( DMN), and between cortical networks, 196 
such as DMN-control network [CN], and CN-salience network (SN) during EC compared to both 197 
counting and memory control conditions. 198 
EC vs counting control condition.  We observed reduced connectivity between the 199 
brainstem and somatomotor (SMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks ( Fig. 3a) during EC 200 
compared to the counting condition.  201 
EC vs memory control condition.  Interestingly, during EC, reduced functional 202 
connectivity between cortical networks such as the DAN, limbic network (LN), VN, and brainstem 203 
were notable (Fig. 3b). Additional reduced connectivity were found between the cerebellum and 204 
left subcortex. 205 
Effective connectivity: Directed network-based statistics (dNBS) 206 
Results, including excitatory and inhibitory connections, and averaged weighted in-degree 207 
and out-degree are visualized in Fig. 3c, d. Here, we only provide a summary of the results. 208 
Across both counting and memory control conditions. No similar excitatory or inhibitory 209 
connections were found across both control conditions compared to EC. 210

EC vs counting control condition.  No notable excitatory or inhibitory connections were 211 
found between EC and the counting control condition (Fig. 3c).  212 
EC vs memory control condition.  Both excitatory and inhibitory connections were 213 
observed ( Fig. 3d ) during EC compared to the memory condition. Interestingly, inhibitory 214 
connections extend to nearly all brain networks, including the subcortex and brainstem. 215 
Specifically, we observed primarily excitatory connections to and from the left VN and brainstem, 216 
and inhibitory connections to and from the bilateral SMN, left SN, right CN and VN. 217 
Brain reorganization: Connectivity gradients 218 
Description and distribution  of gradient values. The principal gradient depicted in the 219 
study aligns with previous research 30-34, which identified a potentially hierarchical axis of 220 
functional connectivity similarity variance. This axis extends from unimodal regions, primarily 221 
located in the somatomotor cortex, to transmodal regions centered around the DMN and LN (Fig. 222 
4a). Lower principal gradient values reflect greater functional connectivity similarity to unimodal 223 
cortex, whereas higher principal gradient values reflect greater functional connectivity similarity 224 
to transmodal cortex. We observed a wider range of gradient distribution across all networks. (Fig. 225 
4b). Moreover, EC demonstrated an expansion of principal gradients compared to the two control 226 
conditions (Fig. 4c). Results for the bootstrapped t-tests at the ROI-level are presented in Fig. 4d, 227 
at the network-level in Fig. 4e. Significant results are also presented in the Supplementary excel 228 
file. Below, we summarize the results. 229 
Across both counting and memory control conditions. LMM at the network-level revealed 230 
that EC exhibited greater gradient values in the CN. At the ROI-level, EC demonstrated greater 231 
gradient values in the  right frontal operculum insula, parietal cortex, and lateral PFC; and lower 232 
gradient values in the bilateral visual cortex within  the visual network (VN) . No additional 233 
significant gradient values were found. 234 
Cortical dynamics: Geometric eigenmodes 235 
Across both counting and memory control conditions . LMM revealed no significant 236 
differences between EC and either counting or memory control conditions for mean, max, and total 237 
power or energy in any eigengroups . However, LMM revealed significant differences in main 238

effects of task condition s between EC and control conditions for mean, max, or total  power or 239 
energy (Fig. 5). Specifically, EC, compared to the counting condition, had lower max (b = -0.09, 240 
p = 0.006) and total (b = -0.14, p < 0.001) power. Additionally, compared to the memory control 241 
condition, EC has lower mean (b = -0.15, p < 0.001), max (b = -0.31, p = 0.009), and total (b = -242 
0.16, p < 0.001) energy, and lower mean (b = -0.32, p = 0.007), max (b = -0.21, p < 0.001), and 243 
total (b = -0.37, p = 0.001) power.  244 
Neurotransmitter systems receptor density: Partial least squares correlation (PLSC) 245 
PLSC extracted one significant latent variable relating neurotransmitter systems receptor 246 
densities to delta-weighted-degree maps, explaining 98.85% of the covariance between the two 247 
datasets (pspin = 0. 023, one -tailed). Additionally, a positive correlation was found between the 248 
latent variables (r = 0.42, p < 0.001 , Fig. 6a). We also computed the loadings for each receptor 249 
(Fig. 6b) and delta-weighted-degree map (Fig. 6c), where positively loaded receptors co-vary with 250 
positively loaded delta -weighted-degree in positively scored brain regions and similarly for 251 
negative loadings35. Projecting the neurotransmitter systems receptor density patterns back onto 252 
the delta-weighted-degree weights reflects how well a brain area exhibits the receptor and delta-253 
weighted-degree weighted pattern, referred to here as ‘receptor scores’ and ‘delta-weighted-degree 254 
scores’, respectively (Fig. 6d, e).  255 
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), serotonin 5HT4, and dopamine D1 displayed 256 
the greatest positive loadings while histamine H3 displayed the only negative loading  (Fig. 6b). 257 
Non-significant loadings include serotonin transporter 5HTT, mu-opioid receptor MOR, 258 
norepinephrine transporter NET, and GABA A. Both EC -Counting and EC -Memory delta 259 
weighted-degree maps have similar negative loadings (Fig. 6c). This suggests that the combination 260 
of H3 receptor distributions co-vary with EC-related weighted-degree values in unimodal regions 261 
(Fig. 6d). EC reduces connectivity where mGluR₅/5HT₄/D₁  receptors are abundant and increases 262 
connectivity where H₃ receptors are abundant, relative to both control tasks. Examining the brain 263 
scores, transmodal regions (PFC, PCC, temporal areas), where mGluR₅/5HT₄/D₁/NMDA receptors 264 
are rich, decrease connectivity during EC relative to both controls  (Fig. 6e). In contrast, primary 265 
sensory and motor cortices where H₃ receptors are plenty, increase connectivity during EC. 266

Collectively, these results demonstrate a direct link between whole -brain molecular receptor 267 
distributions and EC. 268 
Neurosynth data-driven cognitive terms decoding analysis 269 
Across both counting and memory control conditions . Correlation analysis revealed that 270 
EC was positively associated with action, attention, fixation, gaze, planning, spatial attention, 271 
visual attention, and visual perception . These terms are associated with perception and planning. 272 
In contrast, negative associations were found with terms such as anxiety, arousal, eating, emotion, 273 
fear, loss, mood, pain, stress, and valence. These terms are associated with mental suffering and 274 
psychological distress. Results are visualized in Fig. 2. 275 
EC vs counting control condition. EC was additionally positively associated with imagery 276 
and object recognition. 277 
EC vs memory control condition. EC was additionally positively associated with selective 278 
attention and efficiency. 279 
Discussion 280 
Using ultra-high-resolution 7T functional MRI, we present the first neural characterization 281 
of an extraordinary non-conscious state of extended cessation (EC). We used an intensive within-282 
subject, dense-sampling design (N=3) , analogous to the rigorous small-N primate study designs 283 
and small -N human case studies to prioritize internal validity and depth of individual -level 284 
analysis36,37.  285 
Human consciousness is supported by integrated brain activity across functionally 286 
segregated areas38. Here we show that EC exhibits a distinctive reorganization of brain networks: 287 
higher brain activity in unimodal brain systems ( VN, DAN), and temporal pol, lower activity in 288 
transmodal brain systems (DMN), as well as regions in the subcortex, brainstem, and cerebellum, 289 
expansion of the principal cortical gradient , enhancing segregation between unimodal and 290 
transmodal regions, and network–neurochemical coupling aligned with histaminergic H₃ receptor 291 
topography. Furthermore, spatial meta-analytic decoding associates the EC pattern with cognitive 292 
processes associated with perception /attention and reduced mental suffering and psychological 293

distress39. These results suggest a reconfiguration of the limbic network 40,41, consistent with 294 
meditators’ post -EC reports and enduring psychological transformation of clarity, relief, and 295 
equanimity. These results offer novel insights into the neural correlates of EC, highlighting its 296 
potential to influence brain function as well as ultimately our understanding of consciousness and 297 
human flourishing, given the profound aftereffects reported. 298 
Contrary to accounts that associate non-conscious states with global cortical suppression42 299 
and gradient flattening and widespread integration loss 43, EC showed higher local activity in 300 
unimodal sensory regions and reduced activity  in transmodal regions  and networks, specifically 301 
the DMN, and key subcortical and brainstem regions such as the caudate, thalamus, globus 302 
pallidus, and ventral tegmentum area. This reduced connectivity, notably in the basal ganglia44-46 303 
and brainstem47 could be indicative of a indicating gating of access of sensation and percpetion 48 304 
and wakefulness47. These findings partially mimic patients having disorders of consciousness, such 305 
as those with minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome 49, who  also 306 
demonstrated reduced brain activity in the DMN . In contrast, the principal gradient expands 307 
(unimodal values become more negative; transmodal values become more positive) and the 308 
distribution was flatter across all networks in EC, suggesting specialization of brain functions 309 
during EC.  Unlike non-conscious states due to pharmacological interventions or disorders of 310 
consciousness, EC is endogenous, volitional, and followed by equanimity rather than 311 
disorientation. These contrasts support the view that multiple routes to non-conscious states exist, 312 
such as pharmacologic/global suppression versus selective decoupling, with divergent network 313 
consequences. 314 
Two most prominent theories of consciousness are GNW and IIT.  GNW posits that 315 
consciousness depends on long -range recurrent broadcast across frontoparietal hubs  and non-316 
consciousness accompanies reduced feedback and integration (e.g., anesthesia) 27. EC is partly 317 
consistent with this view  wherein DMN and thalamic suppression imply diminished recurrent 318 
broadcast to the workspace but constrains GNW because unimodal systems (VN/DAN) remain 319 
engaged and the principal gradient polarizes rather than collapses. Thus, selective decoupling of 320 
recurrent access to transmodal hubs, rather than frontoparietal shutdown, can suffice to suspend 321 
awareness. In contrast , IIT predicts that non-conscious states reflects reduced 322 
integration/differentiation, which often manifests empirically as flattened principal gradients and 323

loss of complex spatial modes in pharmacological interventions and disorders of 324 
consciousness28,43,50. EC shows the opposite pattern: gradient expansion , stronger unimodal –325 
transmodal segregation in the absence of awareness, and reduced lower-order brain modes in EC. 326 
This directly challenges IIT, indicating that excessive segregation rather than loss off integration 327 
can also yield non-conscious states. Finally, according to AIF, loss of consciousness can arise from 328 
down-weighting the precision of sensory prediction errors29. Surprisingly, compared to GNW and 329 
IIT, EC supports AIF on multiple fronts . The reduced activity in the thalamus and brainstem 330 
together with  increased activity in unimodal systems is consistent with precision gating . 331 
Additionally, network–neurochemical coupling to histamine H₃ receptor topography in unimodal 332 
cortex could explain neuromodulation on precision control35. Finlly, post-EC sensory clarity and 333 
equanimity is consistent with a transient precision overshoot, a brief increase in the gain assigned 334 
to sensory prediction errors which yields unusually vivid perception while self -referential priors 335 
remain down-weighted. In short, EC supports precision-gating (AIF), refines GNW by dissociating 336 
recurrent access from generic frontoparietal activity, and challenges IIT by demonstrating non-337 
conscious states with increased hierarchical segregation rather than uniform flattening.  338 
A unique contribution of this study is the link between EC and neurotransmitter receptor 339 
topography. Brain activity during EC co -varies with H₃ receptors  receptor topography. As 340 
presynaptic autoreceptors  and heteroreceptors, H₃ receptors regulate histamine release and 341 
suppress acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine, shaping arousal, attention, and sensory 342 
filtering51-53. EC’s coupling to H₃-dense unimodal cortices and reduced engagement of transmodal 343 
hubs rich in mGluR₅/NMDA/D₁ may allow habitual cognitive constraints to relax, enabling 344 
underlying intrinsic brain dynamics to emerge54 and modulate the type of conscious experience55. 345 
This shift likely allows practitioners to re -engage perception with heightened equanimity and 346 
reduced cognitive bias, providing optimal conditions for deep meditative insight. Notably, similar 347 
decreases in transmodal network activity have been observed during ACAM2 and AIIM56. Upon 348 
exiting EC, unimodal networks enable a rapid, equanimous re -engagement of sensory processes, 349 
giving rise to the vivid clarity, equanimity, and deep insight into the phenomenology of the mind  350 
practitioners describe.  351 
EC may be best understood as a “reset” of consciousness, in which self -referential loops 352 
are silenced, perceptual systems reorganized, and affective load attenuated. Thus, beyond the field 353

of cognitive neuroscience , EC offers  a radical empirical model for advancing mental health, 354 
wellbeing, and human flourishing. The transformative aftereffects of EC—including deep sense 355 
of relief, clarity, equanimity, and reductions in repetitive thought, self-talk, and craving—map onto 356 
diminished self -referential processing and enhanced perceptual networks, according to the 357 
decoded meta-analytic cognitive maps from Neurosynth.  These neural and experiential changes 358 
directly address components of psychological suffering 10. Finally, the neural signatures of EC 359 
could serve as biomarkers for advanced meditation outcomes, guiding machine-learning-based 360 
personalization of practice57 or neuromodulation protocols to target specific meditation outcomes, 361 
such as kindness, concentration, or acceptance 58. Thus, EC  point towards novel strategies for 362 
facilitating increasingly effective mental health interventions59.  363 
This study has considerable strengths including a whole -brain approach at high spatial 364 
resolution using ultra -high-resolution fMRI data with stringent methodological approaches . 365 
Nevertheless, there are several important limitations to consider . First, as this study is the first to 366 
investigate extended cessation, specifically EC, our results should be considered an initial step that 367 
should be replicated. While we compared EC to non-meditative states, a natural extension would 368 
be to compare EC to other meditative states to elucidate similarities and differences between EC 369 
and advanced forms of mediation. The absence of consciousness and self-reports during EC poses 370 
a challenge in understanding the subjective non-experience and its correlation with the 371 
neuroimaging findings. However, Neurosynth decoding offered robust evidence linking EC brain 372 
state to enhanced perceptual clarity, sensitivity, and the absence of mental suffering. These 373 
findings strongly suggest that significant brain reorganization occurs during EC to a degree that 374 
supports these subjective subsequent phenomena. 375 
In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence for the neural correlates extended 376 
cessation. Extended cessation is marked by higher activity in unimodal regions with 377 
downregulation of transmodal and thalamic regions, expansion of cortical gradients, and reduced 378 
low-order global eigenmodes . Our results supports AIF, constraints GNW, and challenges IIT. 379 
These findings not only deepen our understanding of extended cessation but also illuminate 380 
fundamental mechanisms underlying human consciousness. More broadly, EC reveals a selective 381 
“reset” capacity of the mind  that attenuates self-referential burden while sharpening perceptual 382

Materials and Methods 386 
Participants 387 
Participants were three male advanced meditators, Subject 2 (Male, age 32 at time of data 388 
collection), Subject 3 (age 46 at time of data collection), and Subject 4 (age 57 at time of data 389 
collection). Important to the current study, the participants are advanced meditators and reported 390 
being able to incline towards EC as the target of meditation. Subject 2 had over 19 years of 391 
meditation experience with total meditation experience of an estimated at least 15,000 hours. 392 
Subject 3 had over 4 years of meditation experience, and an estimated total practice amount at 393 
least of 9,000 hours. Subject 4 had over 50 years of meditation experience with total meditation 394 
experience of at least 10,000 hours. Lifetime practice hours are approximate self-reports based on 395 
duration and frequency of weekly practice and retreats.  We also note that lifetime hours are not 396 
necessarily a direct measure of meditative expertise. The Mass General Brigham IRB approved 397 
the study, and the participants provided informed consent. 398 
Experimental design 399 
Extended cessation (EC) 400 
FMRI data during EC was collected as part of a larger study of advanced meditation 401 
practices. In this advanced practice of EC, participants have trained extensively to develop the 402 
precision to enter and exit EC at specific, predefined times. This level of mastery reflects not only 403 
the ability to achieve a deep cessation state but also control over the duration and timing of the 404 
state. The participants performed EC meditation as the last meditation session after all other MRI 405 
sessions (structural scans, advanced concentrative absorption meditation, advanced insight 406 
meditation, non-meditative control conditions) were completed. The total amount of fMRI data 407 
collected for EC for each participant was approximately 45 minutes across three sessions. We 408 
asked the participant to meditate, enter, and maintain EC for 15 minutes during each session.  409

An EC run started with the participant making an intention to stay in EC for only 15 410 
minutes. Then the participant started meditating at the start of the EC run. As some participants 411 
indicated that it was not possible for them to self -report entrance to this state, we did not attempt 412 
to mark when the participant entered EC. The run ended when the participant exited out of EC and 413 
indicated the exit with a button press. Retrospectively, we asked participants to estimate the 414 
duration it took them to enter EC if they did not indicate with a button press initially.  After 415 
completing the meditation task, all participants completed a standardized EC phenomenology 416 
questionnaire—designed to reflect how they typically practice and experience EC —covering 417 
preparation, onset, absence of consciousness, exit, and afterglow. Two participants provided their 418 
phenomenology responses after data collection had formally concluded, and their delayed reports 419 
have been included in the dataset. 420 
Non-meditative control conditions 421 
We developed two non-meditative control conditions (hereon control conditions) that were 422 
used to compare against EC. These control conditions were designed to engage the participant’s 423 
mind with non -meditative mental activities. These conditions were carefully selected to be 424 
sufficiently engaging to not induce meditative states. We did not use a resting -state control 425 
condition, since experienced meditators may enter meditative states during this period60.  426 
The two different control conditions implemented in this study were: (1) a memory control 427 
condition in which participants were asked  to reminisce the events of the past two weeks and 428 
narrate them sub -vocally in their minds, closing their eyes and without moving their lips, for 8 429 
minutes (min); and a (2) counting control condition, where the participants were asked to mentally 430 
count down in decrements of 5 from 10,000 for 8 min, closing their eyes and without moving their 431 
lips. We collected two runs for each control condition, which provided 16 mins data for each 432 
control condition. However, for participant ABC, only a single run for each control condition as 433 
part of another study. 434 
Neuroimaging acquisition 435

dimensional echo planar imaging sequence with T2* -weighted BOLD-sensitive MRI, repetition 438 
time (TR) = 2.9 sec, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 75°, field of view (FOV) = [189 x 439 
255], matrix = [172 x 232], GRAPPA factor = 3, voxel size = 1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1 mm 3, 126 slices, 440 
interslice distance = 0 mm, bandwidth = 1540 Hz/px, echo spacing = 0.75 ms. Slice acquisitions 441 
were acquired for the whole brain, with interleaved slices, sagittal orientation, and anterior -to-442 
posterior phase encoding. Opposite phase-encoded (i.e., posterior-to-anterior) slices with the same 443 
parameters were also acquired to perform distortion correction.  444 
Whole-brain T1-weighted structural images were acquired as follows: TR = 2.53 sec, TE 445 
= 1.65 ms, inversion time = 1.1 sec, flip angle = 7°, 0.8mm isotropic resolution, FOV = 240 x 240, 446 
GRAPPA factor = 2, bandwidth = 1200 Hz/Px. The participant’s physiological (i.e., heart rate 447 
using pulse oximetry and respiration using breathing bellows) signal recordings were collected 448 
throughout the scanning session. 449 
Each neuroimaging session started each time the participant’s position was localized in the 450 
scanner and lasted until the next localization was conducted, usually after the participant left the 451 
scanner to rest, typically after two hours.  452 
Neuroimaging preprocessing 453 
Preprocessing steps were conducted at the level of MRI session and for all runs within that 454 
session, similar to our previous protocol, using AFNI 2. Details of the preprocessing steps are 455 
described in our previous study 2. In short, steps consisted of (1) de -spiking; (2) RETROspective 456 
Image CORrection (RETROICOR) 61 to regress out the effects of physiological (cardiac and 457 
respiratory) noise on data; (3) slice time correction; (4) distortion correction using opposite phase-458 
encoded EPI; (5) motion correction; and (6) registering the anatomical dataset (T1) to a standard 459 
(MNI152_2009) template. Additional preprocessing steps included: (7) scrubbing any volume 460 
with motion > 0.3mm and had more than 5% outlier voxels; and (8) regressing out eroded 461 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mask time course and motion parameters (3 translations, 3 rotations) per 462 
run, and band-pass filtering (0.01 – 0.1Hz). Each fMRI run was then segmented into one -minute 463 
segments for statistical analyses, similar to our previous work on advanced meditation 2. 464

We used four different parcellation/segmentation schemes to define ROIs for subsequent 466 
whole-brain analyses: (1) Schaefer -400 parcellation atlas for cortical areas 62; (2) 34-region Tian 467 
subcortex atlas for subcortical regions 63; (3) 54 Bianciardi brainstem atlas 64; and (4) 10 Multi -468 
Domain Task Battery (MDTB) functional cerebellar atlas65. In total our parcellation/segmentation 469 
yielded 498 ROIs across the brain. For functional and effective connectivity analyses specifically, 470 
we opted to use the Schaefer-100 parcellation atlas for cortical areas instead of the 400 parcellation 471 
scheme62 and the 16-region Tian subcortex atlas for subcortical regions63. This decision was made 472 
to reduce the number of ROIs, thereby facilitating the interpretation of whole -brain effective 473 
connectivity patterns and enabling direct comparability between functional and effective 474 
connectivity results, while still maintaining a reasonably high spatial resolution for cortical 475 
regions. 476 
Neuroimaging analyses 477 
Regional homogeneity analysis 478 
Regional homogeneity (ReHo) is a measure of similarity in temporal activation pattern of 479 
a voxel and its nearby voxels66. This measure of local functional connectivity within brain regions 480 
is a close derivative of underlying brain activity 66. A higher ReHo value indicates stronger 481 
synchronization of local brain regions, indicating greater functional connectivity in that region and 482 
thus an index of greater brain activity. In this study, we defined a cluster size of 27  voxels and 483 
calculated the ReHo values for each fMRI segment . We standardized the ReHo values before 484 
smoothing the standardized ReHo maps using a 2 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) kernel. 485 
The standardized ReHo values were then parcellated using the four different 486 
parcellation/segmentation schemes62-65, yielding 498 ReHo values for each fMRI segment. 487 
Functional connectivity 488 
Data was smoothed using a 2 mm FWHM as we were interested in connectivity of smaller 489 
brain regions such as the brainstem. Then for each segment, whole -brain time series of the 180 490 
brain regions as defined previously was extracted, followed by computation of 180x180 functional 491 
connectivity matrices using Pearson’s correlation. 492

 20 
Whole-brain effective connectivity was assessed using regression dynamic causal 494 
modeling (rDCM). rDCM, a variant of DCM for fMRI, enables effective connectivity analyses 495 
across whole-brain networks with computational efficiency 67-71 without sacrificing reliability 72. 496 
The validity of this procedure has been established in both task -based and resting -state fMRI 497 
studies67,68,70,72,73. Specifically, rDCM incorporates modifications to DCM 72 including: (1) 498 
translation of equations into the frequency domain using Fourier transformation; (2) replacement 499 
of nonlinear hemodynamic models with linear functions; (3) mean -field approximation across 500 
regions; and (4) specification of priors for neuronal parameters and noise precision. These 501 
modifications transform linear DCM into Bayesian linear regression in the frequency domain, 502 
which ultimately facilitates highly efficient DCM model inference70,73.  503 
To compute effective connectivity, preprocessed data at step 6 (normalization) was first 504 
smoothed using a 2 mm FWHM. Time series of each ROI were then extracted after regressing out 505 
6 motion parameters, white matter and CSF signals, with discrete cosine basis set with frequency 506 
characteristics of resting-state brain dynamics (0.01– 0.1 Hz). Whole-brain effective connectivity 507 
was then calculated using rDCM for resting -state fMRI 68 to examine whole -brain effective 508 
connectivity69,74-77. First-level rDCM models for 180 ROIs were then computed using the rDCM 509 
module within the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry Advancing Science (TAPAS) 510 
toolbox78. 511 
Principal gradient-mapping 512 
To map the gradients, we first computed a template gradient through a multi-step process. 513 
First, data was smoothed using a 6 mm FWHM  kernel, followed by computation of functional 514 
connectivity matrices for each segment using the Schaefer 400 -regions 7 -network atlas using 515 
Pearson’s correlation, thus producing a 400400 functional connectivity matrix. These individual 516 
matrices were then averaged across all segments, resulting in a mean functional connectivity 517 
matrix. Subsequently, gradients for this mean matrix were derived by thresholding the mean 518 
correlation matrix at 90% sparsity to retain only the strongest connections, followed by generating 519 
a similarity matrix using cosine similarity to capture the connectivity pattern similarities among 520 
ROIs. The resulting similarity matrix served as input for the diffusion map embedding algorithm, 521

from which the principal gradients were extracted. We computed a template gradient from an out-522 
of-sample dataset of 134 subjects from the HCP dataset (the validation cohort used by79). 523 
Following template gradient computation, alignment with individual segment gradients 524 
was performed. The principal gradient values for each fMRI segment were computed based on 525 
their respective functional connectivity matrices and then aligned with the template gradient using 526 
Procrustes rotations with 10 iterations to ensure optimal comparison across datasets. All analyses 527 
described herein were conducted using the BrainSpace toolbox implemented in Python 79. Using 528 
the gradient values obtained from gradient alignment, we computed the average network gradient 529 
values for each network by averaging the gradient values of all the parcels within that network.  530 
Cortical dynamics: Geometric eigenmodes 531 
To decompose fMRI activity into 200 frequency-specific eigenmodes, we used geometric 532 
eigenmodes derived from a population-averaged midsurface thickness template of the neocortical 533 
surface from Pang et al., wherein the methods to generate these geometric eigenmode templates 534 
are also described 80. Briefly, the geometric eigenmodes were computed by constructing the 535 
Laplace-Beltrami operator from the cortical mesh and solving the eigenvalue problem. The 536 
resulting eigenvalues are ordered according to spatial frequency/wavelength of each mode, where 537 
mode 1 has the longest wavelength (lowest frequency) while higher modes have shorter 538 
wavelengths (higher frequency). Conversely, eigenmodes are the complete basis set—a weighted 539 
sum of varying -wavelength modes. Lower-numbered modes capture large -scale spatial patterns 540 
(e.g. left/right hemisphere, anterior/posterior regions) while higher -number modes correspond to 541 
smaller-scale spatial patterns where functional properties of nearby regions vary independent of 542 
proximity.  543 
Using the geometric eigenmodes, we decomposed functional MRI data to reveal emerging 544 
cortical spatiotemporal dynamic patterns by examining the contribution of each eigenmode to the 545 
cortical activity at each time instance. At each time point of each fMRI time courses, fMRI data 546 
were projected onto each of the 200 geometric eigenmodes, yielding the temporal activity of the 547 
particular eigenmode in a method described previously81,82. Subsequently, the temporal activation 548 
of eigenmodes were analyzed in terms of their power (the strength of an eigenmode’s activation 549 
at a given fMRI time instance: |ω k(ti)|) and energy  (the eigenmode’s frequency -weighted 550

contribution, estimated by weighting the square of the eigenmode’s strength of activation by the 551 
square of its corresponding eigenvalue (λk) at each time point: |ωk(ti)|2 λk2) at each fMRI time point. 552 
Mean power and energy were calculated by averaging the power and energy of each eigenmode 553 
across all time points in a single segment (i.e. yielding 200 mean power and energy values for 200 554 
modes per fMRI segment). Maximum power and energy were calculated as the maximum spectra 555 
value for a given eigenmode across all time points within a segment (i.e. yielding 200 maximum 556 
power and energy values for 200 modes per fMRI segment). Unless otherwise noted, all reported 557 
maximum and mean power and energy values are reported on a log-scale82. Brain total power and 558 
total energy were computed by summing power and energy across all eigenmodes for each time 559 
point and then averaging all time points within a segment. 560 
Influence of neurotransmitter systems receptor density: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 561 
neurotransmitter systems receptor density maps 562 
We used a recently made available public neurotransmitter systems receptor density maps 563 
for 19 receptors and transporters, across 9 neurotransmitter systems by Hansen and colleagues 564 
at https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors35. These include dopamine (D1, D2, DAT) 565 
noradrenaline (NAT), serotonin( 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, 5-HTT), acetylcholine 566 
(α4β2, M1, VAChT), glutamate (mGluR5, NMDA), GABA (GABAA), histamine (H3), cannabinoid 567 
(CB1), and opioid (MOR) receptors. Details regarding the neurotransmitter systems receptor 568 
density maps, each PET dataset, and their respective acquisition and limitations  can be found in 569 
ref35. Volumetric PET images were registered to the MNI -ICBM 152 nonlinear 2009 (version c, 570 
asymmetric) template, averaged across participants within each study, and then parcellated and 571 
receptors/transporters with more than one mean image of the same tracer were combined using a 572 
weighted average35. 573 
Decoding of brain activity using data-driven Neurosynth cognitive maps 574 
To provide a complementary approach for analyzing brain activity patterns with behavior 575 
in the absence of behavioral data, we examined the spatial similarity of ReHo maps with 123 meta-576 
analytic brain maps derived from the Neurosynth database. Neurosynth generates probabilistic 577 
measurements that can be interpreted as a quantitative representation of the association between 578 
regional fluctuations in activity and psychological processes. Although Neurosynth’s database 579

drawing from previous research 35,83,84. Our selected set of 123 terms encompasses broad 581 
categories, ranging from attention and emotion, to more specific processes such as visual attention 582 
and episodic memory. The terms also include basic behaviors (e.g., eating and sleep) and 583 
emotional states (e.g., fear and anxiety). 584 
Statistical analysis 585 
ReHo brain activity  586 
Linear mixed -effects models  were used to analyze ReHo differences between EC and 587 
control conditions. The model included task condition as a fixed effect and random intercepts for 588 
participant and for segments nested within subject. Corrections for multiple comparisons across 589 
models were applied using false-discovery rate (FDR) across all 498 ROIs. We used Dunnett's test 590 
to compare the difference between EC and control tasks, with EC as the reference group controlling 591 
for multiple comparisons  using Bonferroni correction for k = 2 comparisons . For ease of 592 
interpretation, all coefficients were flipped to retrieve the contrast of EC against the control 593 
conditions. Analyses were conducted in R85 loading on R Studio v2022.12.0.353.2086. 594 
Functional connectivity: Network-based statistics (NBS) 595 
NBS was used to explore functional connectivity differences between EC and control 596 
conditions in the whole-brain network containing 198 nodes and 19,503 (
198∗197
2 ) unique edges87. 597 
NBS is a nonparametric statistical method used to perform mass -univariate statistical tests for 598 
multiple graph comparisons. NBS identifies interconnected subnetworks exhibiting significant 599 
differences in functional connectivity between groups or conditions. Instead of treating 600 
connections independently, NBS leverages the inherent interconnectedness of the brain by 601 
identifying clusters of connections collectively differing across groups. This enables sensitive 602 
detection of subtle yet interconnected alterations in whole-brain functional connectivity. T-scores 603 
were computed for each pairwise connection under contrasts EC > control and EC < control 604 
separately, with additional separate analyses for counting and memory control conditions. Each 605 
test was conducted at the primary threshold (t = 3.1, p = 0.025) to select the suprathreshold 606 
connections for which the t -scores exceeded the primary t -value. We used p = 0.025 to 607

accommodate two contrasts per control comparison ( EC > control and EC < control). Connected 608 
components where the EC showed higher or lower functional connectivity than the control 609 
conditions were identified, and the number of the edges or their size was stored. A permutation 610 
test was then performed to determine the significance of each component by comparing its size to 611 
the distribution of maximum component sizes under random group assignments (5000 612 
permutations). Corrected p -values were computed as the proportion of permutations with larger 613 
maximum components than the observed size. NBS enabled sensitive detection of interconnected 614 
functional connectivity alterations in EC by leveraging the inherent network structure of the brain 615 
and rigorously accounting for multiple comparisons. 616 
Effective connectivity: Directed network-based statistics (dNBS) 617 
dNBS, an extension of NBS, was used to analyze effective connectivity differences 618 
between EC and control conditions. We investigated two contrast, EC > control and EC < control 619 
separately, with additional separate analyses for counting and memory control conditions. The 620 
statistical significance of the outcomes was determined using a primary threshold of t = 3.1 (p = 621 
0.025) and 5000 permutations, following the same procedures as in the conventional NBS 622 
approach. The key distinction between dNBS and NBS lies in the fact that dNBS analyzes twice 623 
the number of edges compared to NBS, accommodating the directional nature of effective 624 
connectivity measures.  625 
Brain organization: Connectivity gradients  626 
Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze cortical principal gradient differences 627 
between EC and control conditions. These tests were performed at both the network -level, 628 
encompassing 7 cortical networks, and at the ROI-level, comprising 400 ROIs. This dual approach 629 
allowed for a robust examination of gradient variations across different scales of cortical 630 
organization. Corrections for multiple comparisons were applied using false-discovery rate across 631 
the 7 networks and 400 ROIs respectively.  632 
Cortical dynamics of EC: Geometric eigenmode power and energy 633 
To analyze differences in frequency-specific eigenmode mean power and energy between 634 
EC and control conditions while minimizing multiple comparisons, we utilized 15 eigengroups: 635

 25 
grouping of eigenmodes according to spatial frequency 80,88. Eigengroups provide a way to 636 
aggregate degenerate solutions from the solving of the eigendecomposition such that eigenmodes 637 
with the same number of nodal lines and wavelengths are grouped together. This method allows 638 
for investigation of eigenmode metrics that are less affected by noise 89,90. Using this approach, 639 
each eigengroup’s power and energy were then compared as reference values to both counting and 640 
memory control conditions using linear mixed-effects models. The resulting p-values were FDR 641 
corrected across both control condition comparisons. Finally, linear regression was used to 642 
examine mean power and energy differences between EC and control conditions. 643 
Influence of neurotransmitter systems receptor density: Partial least squares correlation 644 
We used partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis to explore the multivariate 645 
relationship between neurotransmitter systems receptor densities and EC delta-weighted-degree 646 
connectivity maps. PLSC is an unsupervised multivariate statistical technique that decomposes 647 
two datasets into orthogonal sets of latent variables with the goal of maximizing covariance 648 
between them 91. In this context, the latent variables consist of receptor weights, EC-control 649 
weighted-degree weights and a singular value that represents the covariance between receptor 650 
distributions and weighted-degree connectivity that is explained by the latent variable.  651 
NS delta-weighted-degree maps were created by first thresholding all negative -weighted 652 
connectivity and self-connections to zero, followed by summing each region’s positive connection 653 
weights to all other regions. we only use cortical atlas for this analysis, similar to previous research 654 
on chemoarchitecture of the brain35,83. Segment-level weighted-degree vectors were then averaged 655 
across all segments within each task, producing a single weighted -degree profile per participant 656 
per task. For each participant, the delta -weighted-degree map was calculated as the difference 657 
between EC and each control task, i.e., EC -Counting, and EC-memory. Finally, participant-level 658 
delta-weighted-degree profiles were then averaged across the three participants to obtain the two 659 
delta-weighted-degree maps, EC-Counting, and EC-memory.  660 
By projecting the original receptor density and weighted -degree data onto the 661 
corresponding latent variable weights, we computed receptor and EC-difference scores, assigning 662 
each brain region a specific score for both. Receptor loadings were then calculated as the Pearson 663 
correlation between neurotransmitter systems receptor densities and receptor scores, with a similar 664

 26 
process used to compute EC-difference loadings (weighted-degree map and EC-difference scores). 665 
Importantly, PLSC does not (1) infer causal links between receptors and EC, (2) establish 666 
univariate associations between specific receptors and EC, or (3) rule out the possibility of 667 
additional connections between receptors and EC.  668 
We assessed the significance of each latent variable’s singular value using permutation 669 
spin-testing92-94. For each map, parcel coordinates were projected onto the spherical surface and 670 
then randomly rotated and original parcels were reassigned the value of the closest rotated parcel 671 
(10,000 repetitions)95. In addition to preserving the distribution of cortical values, this null model 672 
also preserves the spatial autocorrelation present in the data.  673 
Contextualization of brain activity with Neurosynth cognitive maps 674 
We used the continuous.CorrelationDecoder function from the NiMARE python package 675 
to contextualization of brain activity with Neurosynth cognitive maps 96. We first fetched 676 
Neurosynth dataset and converted it to NiMARE dataset. Following, we retrieved the 123 677 
cognitive terms from the database. We also computed delta -ReHo maps (EC -counting, and EC -678 
memory) for decoding. Finally, we used the  CorrelationDecoder function to decode the 679 
association between the unthresholded delta-ReHo maps and cognitive maps. 680

Fig. 2. Differences in regional homogeneity values (ReHo) between EC and control 968 
conditions. (a) EC, compared to the counting control condition, demonstrated increased ReHo 969 
values in the bilateral visual, posterior, temporal regions, parts the brainstem, and cerebellum, 970 
and decreased ReHo in bilateral prefrontal regions and posterior cingulate cortex, largely 971 
associated with the default-mode network. Subcortical activity reveals decreased ReHo values 972 
across the caudate, thalamus, globus pallidus, amygdala, and brainstem. (b) Similarly, compared 973 
to the memory condition, EC displayed increased ReHo values in bilateral visual, posterior, and 974 
temporal regions, and decreased ReHo values in the prefrontal and insular regions, and posterior 975 
cingulate cortex. Subcortical regions primarily showed decreased ReHo values spanning the 976 
caudate, thalamus, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, parts of the brainstem, and 977 
cerebellum. Neurosynth decoding analysis revealed that these patterns of brain activity were 978 
related to cognitive processes associated with perception (e.g., attention, spatial attention, visual 979
