Rationale
The CCIS series is devoted to the publication of proceedings of computer science
conferences. Its aim is to efﬁciently disseminate original research results in informatics
in printed and electronic form. While the focus is on publication of peer-reviewed full
papers presenting mature work, inclusion of reviewed short papers reporting on work in
progress is welcome, too. Besides globally relevant meetings with internationally repre-
sentative program committees guaranteeing a strict peer-reviewing and paper selection
process, conferences run by societies or of high regional or national relevance are also
considered for publication.
Topics
The topical scope of CCIS spans the entire spectrum of informatics ranging from
foundational topics in the theory of computing to information and communications
science and technology and a broad variety of interdisciplinary application ﬁelds.
Information for V olume Editors and Authors
Publication in CCIS is free of charge. No royalties are paid, however, we offer
registered conference participants temporary free access to the online version of the
conference proceedings on SpringerLink ( http://link.springer.com) by means of an http
referrer from the conference website and/or a number of complimentary printed copies,
as speciﬁed in the ofﬁcial acceptance email of the event.
CCIS proceedings can be published in time for distribution at conferences or as post-
proceedings, and delivered in the form of printed books and/or electronically as USBs
and/or e-content licenses for accessing proceedings at SpringerLink. Furthermore, CCIS
proceedings are included in the CCIS electronic book series hosted in the SpringerLink
digital library at http://link.springer.com/bookseries/7899. Conferences publishing in
CCIS are allowed to use Online Conference Service (OCS) for managing the whole
proceedings lifecycle (from submission and reviewing to preparing for publication) free
of charge.
Publication process
The language of publication is exclusively English. Authors publishing in CCIS
have to sign the Springer CCIS copyright transfer form, however, they are free to use
their material published in CCIS for substantially changed, more elaborate subsequent
publications elsewhere. For the preparation of the camera-ready papers/ﬁles, authors
have to strictly adhere to the Springer CCIS Authors’ Instructions and are strongly
encouraged to use the CCIS LaTeX style ﬁles or templates.
Abstracting/Indexing
CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP , Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical
Reviews, SCImago, Scopus. CCIS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI
Proceedings.

Preface
The active inference framework, which ﬁrst originated in neuroscience, can be assim-
ilated to a theory of choice behavior and learning. The basic assumption of this new
theoretical and methodological structure is the distinction between goal-directed and
habitual behavior of an intelligent agent and how they contextualize each other. In this
architecture, the intelligent agent’s main goal is to minimize surprise or, more formally,
its free energy. In particular, in contrast to other approaches, the resulting behavior has
both explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to
ambiguity and risk respectively. Thus, active inference offers an interesting framework
not only for understanding behavior and the brain, but also for developing artiﬁcial
intelligent agents and for investigating novel machine learning algorithms.
In this scope, the present volume presents some recent developments in active infer-
ence and its applications. These papers were presented and discussed at the 3rd Interna-
tional Workshop on Active Inference (IW AI 2022), which was held in conjunction with
the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowl-
edge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD). The workshop took place on September
19, 2022 in Grenoble, France. We received 31 submissions, out of which 25 papers
were accepted for publication after a peer review process. The review process was
double-blind, and three reviewers could score between -3 (strong reject) and 3 (strong
accept). Papers were accepted when a net positive score was obtained. We also awarded
Conor Heins, Ruben van Bergen, and Samuel Wauthier for their contributions, with an
honorable mention for Justus Huebotter and Alex Kiefer.
The IW AI 2022 organizers would like to thank the Program Committee for all
reviews, the authors for their outstanding contributions, VERSES for sponsoring the
awards, Anjali Bhat for her awesome keynote, and all attendees for making it such a
memorable event.
