Abstract 
Suicidal ideation represents one of the most complex mental phenomena  and poorly  
understood. This paper explores the psychic mechanisms of  suicide ideation through a novel 
approach that combines computational methods with Lacanian psychoanalysis, specifically 
utilizing free energy principle (FEP). We begin by outlining foundational concepts of FEP and 
computational Lacanian psychoanalysis . Subsequently, we review contemporary theories o f 
suicide thought including Interpersonal theory, Escape theory, and Lacanian and other  
psychoanalytic perspectives. We identify f our components of suicidal ideation: symbolic 
suicide, imaginary suicide, desire for death, and passage of the act . A recurrent generative 
model is proposed  that simulates suicidal impulses based on  internal states and external 
events. We discuss enhancing the practical applicability and validating this theoretical model 
using real -world data like Social Readjustment Rating Scale and Personality Inventory for 
DSM-5 (PID -5). The predictive capability of our model is evaluating using an open -source 
dataset of PID -5 and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale , achieving an AUC of 0.7 6, 
despite the absence of  life event  data. The model demonstrates the potential of generative 
psychometrics as a paradigm for integrating psychometric measurement with generative 
modeling of psychological phenomena.  Further work should validate the model by 
incorporating external factors to refine its explanatory and predictive power. With continued 
development, this generative psychometric approach could provide new tools for better 
assessing, understanding, and treating suicidal ideation.

Introduction 
According to the World Health Organization, around 703,000 people die by suicide 
annually ((WHO), 2021) . The prevalence of suicidal ideation is even higher , with cross-
national lifetime prevalence around 9% (Jobes et al., 2024; Nock et al., 2008) . Although t he 
understanding of suicid al thoughts and attempt s evolves alongside the knowledge of 
humanity itself, suicide is always one of the most striking events among human societies and 
attract numerous research interests across various fields including  philosophy, theology, 
sociology, jurisprudence, and psychology etc. Suicide ideation and behavior  are complex  
psychological phenomena and intertwined with  cultures, politics, socioeconomic status, 
interpersonal relationships, mental disorders, somatic diseases,  personalities, gender issues , 
and genetic and epigenetic factors  (Wasserman, 2020) . The motivations behind suicide can 
vary widely, ranging from  intense despair and anger to intentions of  punishing others  or 
conveying specific  information, and  sometimes, they manifest  even without explicit  reason 
(Meyer et al., 2017) . Clinically, suicide ideation displays significant heterogeneity in their 
causes, stability, duration, frequency (Czyz et al., 2022; Shiratori et al., 2014; Spangenberg et 
al., 2023). 
Theoretical approaches to understanding suicide thoughts are as varied as the 
phenomenon itself , categorized into descriptive and computational models. Descriptive 
theories include Durkheim’s concepts of  social and moral integration, escape theory, 
interpersonal theory, psychache theory, emotional regulation theory, cognitive theory , and 
various psychoanalytic theories (Wasserman, 2020) . These theories  underscore the cr itical 
roles of emotion, society, interpersonal relationship, and self -related issues in suicide -related 
phenomena. From a computational standpoint, human mind is  usually viewed as complex 
dynamic systems, with mental activities reflecting trajectories and states within these systems. 
Suicide ideation  is seen as arising when these trajectories intersect specific critical points 
driven by multifactor ial life events (Bryan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023) . The integration of 
descriptive models with computational approaches promises a deeper mechanistic 
understanding of suicide , necessitating both rigorous phenomenological investigations and 
deployment of appropriate mathematical tools (Millner et al., 2020). This paper proposes such 
a model that organically integrates these approaches within a structured framework of 
computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. 
In our previous work, we demonstrate how  Lacanian psychoanalysis  could inherently 
assemble free energy principle (FEP), a computational theory applied to  living systems like 
neuron, brain, and mind (Li & Li, 2023, 2024; Parr et al., 2022) . And some basic constructs like 
three orders, remainder, logical time, desire,  the Other,  and self -identification have been  
modelled using FEP . Building on this foundation , th e current  work focuses on h ow 
perturbations in these constructs can lead to  suicidal ideation. Given the distinct differences 
between suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts (Klonsky & May, 2014), this paper specifically 
addresses suicidal ideation to  manage complexity. It starts with a review of computational 
Lacanian psychoanalysis and contemporary theories of suicidal ideation. Then the main 
contributions are threefold: a descriptive model of suicidal ideation, a mechanistic model that 
is both generative and recurrent, and a practical model which allows simulating emergence of 
suicidal ideation with data of personality  profiles and life stressors. We further validate the 
predictive efficacy of this model on open -source dataset of Personality Inventory for DSM -5 
and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale , demonstrating reasonable performance in 
identifying individuals with suicidal ideation, without life event information.  The model 
showcases the potential of generative psychometrics as a paradigm for integrating 
psychometric measurement with generative modeling of psychological phenomena.  This 
model offers several advantages over other computational models, including  greater 
expansive value, interpretability, and practical  utility. The o riginal codes for this work are

Free energy principle for Lacanian psychoanalysis 
For more comprehensive intro ductions to free energy principle (FEP) and Lacanian 
psychoanalysis, readers are referred to our original work (Li & Li, 2023)  and other  sources 
(Dall’Aglio, 2019; Parr et al., 2022) . This section aims to provide necessary background to 
understand computational Lacanian psychoanalysis and subsequent content in this paper. 
Free energy principle 
FEP posits a u niversal framework for understanding  living systems across all  scales, 
from individuals to populations. Each system is delineated from its environment by a Markov 
blanket (Hipólito et al., 2021) . Survival requires the system to infer the state of environment 
(hidden state ) using an internal  generative model based on prior knowledge 𝑃(𝑠), and  to 
generate predictions of potential o bservations through likelihood 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠). Observable data 
 
1
 https://github.com/YabYum/CLP_Suicideation 
serves as evidence for this inference  𝑃(𝑜). The variational free energy F for potential posterior 
belief 𝑄(𝑠) is mathematically expressed as: 
𝐹[𝑄, 𝑜] = 𝐷𝐾𝐿 [𝑄(𝑠)||𝑃(𝑠|𝑜)] − 𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑜) 
The first term on the right -hand side is the KL divergence between the approximate and 
the accurate posterior distributions. The second term is the negative natural logarithm of the 
evidence, representing the strength of the evidence, also known as the surprise or surprisal. 
This expression underscores the goal of FEP: to find an approximate posterior that is as close 
as possible to the exact posterior, highlighting the nature of free energy as an upper bound on 
surprise. When the evidence is relatively weak, a satisfying accurate inference is not available. 
The system may engage with its environment actively, converting  current context to action 
planning. For each conceivable policy 𝜋, the anticipated state of the system, denoted as 𝑥̃, is 
deduced based on transition possibilities 𝑃(𝑥̃|𝑥, 𝜋). The expected free energy  G for each 
potential policy is calculated as: 
𝐺(𝜋) = 𝐷𝐾𝐿[𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑥̃|𝐶)] + 𝔼𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)[𝐻[𝑃(𝑦|𝑥̃)]] 
The calculation of expected free energy G involves risks (divergences between expected 
and preferred states  𝐶) and expected ambiguity (Shannon entropy of expected outcomes). 
Taking a policy with least expected free energy, the system could steer towards preferred 
states while grasp predictability of outcomes.  For long-term planning, the inductive planning 
(Friston et al., 2023)  shifts focus from minimal  𝐺 to minimal (𝐺 + 𝐻), where 𝐻, the inductive 
cost, quantifies if the states at next timestep are on the (optimal) path to intended endpoint. 
Lacanian psychoanalysis 
Central to Lacanian psychoanalysis are the three orders: the Imaginary, the Symbolic, 
and the Real. These  forms a Borromean ring structure that  underpins the human psyche, 
influencing the subject simultaneously and interdependently. Previous research on Lacanian 
neuropsychoanalysis (Dall’Aglio, 2019) maps these orders onto the brain  functions (Figure 1. 
a), providing an intuitive understanding of their roles. 
The Imaginary involves internal representation s of the external world and corresponds 
to the parietal and occipital lobes,  which handle  motor control, visual perception, and self-
representation (body-image). The Symbolic relate s to language and meaning generation, akin 
to Hermeneutics . And it is allocated to the prefrontal and parietal lobes, responsible for 
executing language processing, generating meaning, and conducting thought experiments 
based on anticipation and retroaction (Miyamoto et al., 2023).  
Lacan distinguishes two types of identification, imaginary and symbolic (Miller, 1988) , 
and integrates them with Graph II of desire (Figure 1. f). Imaginary identification is 
illustrated through an optical model (Figure 1. d, upper), which means that the self 
(imaginary bouquet in vase) is represented as a unity ‘from outside ’ (Lacan, 1988) . This 
optical trick mirrors ego development, as the child identifies with this coherent specular 
image rather than their fragmented bodily experience , leading to  the emergence of  ego 
through thi s primordial misrecognition. Symbolic identification  is characterized by the 
internalization of societal norms and language  (i.e. the Other with capital O) , which 
interpellates the individual into specific social roles.  These two identifications collaborate to 
shape an individual into unconscious subject who recognizes themselves as an agent with 
free will. 
According to Lacan, any representation is inherently incomplete, leaving aspects 
unrepresented, also called remainder. And the Real encompasses those unrepresented aspects, 
existing as field of impossibility  and missing reality. Neuropsychoanalysis situates the Real 
within the upper brainstem and diencephalic system, crucial for  affective experiences, 
consciousness, and the primary needs of the body such as sustenance, sexuality, and 
homeostasis. Driven by impulses from the Real, the concept of repetition manifests an 
incessant attempt to represent  the unrepresented. Repetition leads to the endless metonymic 
course of desire. 
Another concept,  logical time , underscores the anticipatory nature of human mind and 
emphasizes the importance of retroactive reconstruction.  In other words, the past bestows 
significance upon forthcoming events in an anticipatory manner, and the future imbues the 
past with retroactive meaning. Along logical time, meaningful relationships between events 
emerge, hence transforming time into  a ‘meaning machine’. A rudimentary definition of the 
human mind from Lacanian perspective could be the composite status of three orders and 
corresponding self -identification which are perturbated by desire running over the logical 
time (Li & Li, 2023). 
Computational Lacanian psychoanalysis 
Recognizing parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, we note that both 
theories provide frameworks on how subjects represent the world and themselves , how the 
unpresented (free energy & remainder) drives changes in beliefs or behaviors, and how they 
incorporate logical time that intertwines anticipation with retroaction . Thus we proposed  a 
series of  FEP models to represent  Lacan’s theor etical constructs , termed computational 
Lacanian psychoanalysis (Li & Li, 2023, 2024). 
First, we design ed a recurrent generative model consisting of three  FEP modules 
interconnected with free energy (Figure 1. b).  This generative model endo genously entails 
aforementioned three parallels between FEP and Lacan ’s theory, and  provides a holistic 
framework of cognitive functions such as  sensorimotor, body image, communication, and 
emotion, by treating them as different modalities within three orders. 
In the context of FEP ,  communication is interpreted as interactions between two 
individuals with shared internal model but different initial states, continuously inferring each 
other’s hidden state  (Friston & Frith, 2015) . Based on thi s, we conceptualized the desire 
running as a partial generalized synchronization (Figure 1. c) from a perspective of complexity 
theory. Lacan views subjects as signifiers within a signifying chain, and desire is an attempt to  
capture the signified of the object – synchronization within the Symbolic order.  The partial 
synchronization allows two symbolically synchronized subjects maintaining their respective 
chaotic behaviors, just as Figure 1. c shown. 
Expanding interpersonal to population, we proposed that the Other  (representing the 
language, laws, social norms, and other Symbolic structure)  could be modelled as collective 
dynamics using multi-agent FEP models. This preliminary framework sets stage for 
subsequent FEP accounts of self-identification.

originated from our two previous papers. 
Imaginary identification is characterized by the formation of a unified body schema that 
minimizes free energy  by gradual controllability (Figure 1.d, lower), i.e. minimizing 
prediction errors between sensory inputs and top -down expectations.  And symbolic 
identification this process is driven by the need to minimize free energy arising from 
mismatches between the individual's innate demands and the constraints of reality  (Figure 1 
e). By synchronizing with the Other's interpretations and acquiring language, the individual 
can effectively express their desires and infer their social position, ultimately identifying with 
the social role that minimizes free energy.  We then investigated the integrated theory of self -
identification based on Lacan's Graph II of desire  (Figure 1 . f)  and designed a digital agent 
that embodied Lacan ’s coherent theory of self -identification from body to ideology (Figure 1. 
g). 

Contemporary theories on suicidal ideation 
Interpersonal theory 
After examining robust clinical risk factors for suicide, Joiner et al. propose interpersonal 
theory, one of the most prominent theories on suicide ideation and behavior (Joiner, 2005; Van 
Orden et al., 2010) . Specifically, suicide behavior stems from both  desire and capability to 
commit suicide. And desire of suicide is triggered by thwarted belongingness and perceived 
burdensomeness. Thwarted belongingness consists of loneliness  (e.g. living alone or self -
report loneliness)  and absence of reciprocal care (e.g. social withdrawal or family conflict). 
Perceived burdensomeness is associated with liability (feeling that one ’s death is better to 
others) and self -hate (e.g. low self -esteem or self -blame). The simultaneous presence of 
thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness fuels suicidal desire (Chu et al., 2017). 
For empirical researches, a 25 items scale, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ), has been 
developed to assess the severity of thwarted belongingness (10 items) and perceived 
burdensomeness (15 items) (Van Orden et al., 2012). According to the sample of (Meyer et al., 
2017), around 20 % suicide was motivated by issues in interpersonal relationships including 
unrequited or lost love (45%), abusive relationship (30%), and unspecified.  Therefore, 
interpersonal theory cannot be comprehensive for clinical complexities, as a prospective 
study reveals  (Forkmann et al., 2020) . Similarly, a nother study suggests that the 
complementary effects of interpersonal theory and escape theory in terms of explaining 
suicidal ideation (Landrault et al., 2020). 
Escape theory 
Baumeister puts forward e scape theory, proposing that suicide is attempt to escape from 
self and world (Baumeister, 1990) . This theory is  structured around  a six -step sequential 
model, composed of (1) severe experience that falls below  expectations, (2) negative internal 
attributions, (3) aversive state of self -evaluation, (4) acute negative affect, (5) impulses of 
escaping from or completely terminating  current state of mind  (cognitive deconstruction) , 
and finally (6) de-inhibition and increased suicide ideation or behavior.  
Steps 1-5 are thought as ‘choice points’ within a decision tree, offering opportunities for 
implementing various coping strategies . The escape theory emphasizes the significance of  
self-awareness, and the interplay between  self and social  expectations, especially when 
individuals perceive themselves as failing to meet these exp ectations (Mueller et al., 2021) . 
Several other theories of suicide similarly view suicide as escape from psychache (Shneidman, 
1993) or other stressors. And research by (Meyer et al., 2017) indicates around 70% victims are 
motivated by escape from psychological (32%), physical (18%), legal or financial (11%), and 
combinations of multiple pain (39%).  
(Wang et al., 2023) formalize the general escape theory of suicide mathematically using a 
set of differential equations and reproduce several clinical features of suicide including rapid, 
brief, and rare onset. First of all, they employ a Brownian motion model to simulate the 
fluctuating intensity of stressor events (S), given by the equation: 
𝑆𝑡 = 𝑆0𝑒
(𝜇−𝜎2
2 )𝑡+𝜎𝑊𝑡  
aversive internal state (A) corresponding to S is modelled with a logistic growth model to 
reflect the self-resilience: 
𝑑𝐴
𝑑𝑡 = 𝑏2𝐴(𝐾 − 𝐴) + 𝑎2𝑆 
where K represents carrying capacity, which means the stable intensity of internal state 
when intensity of stressor S approach zero. The ‘fixed point’ reflects one’s settled affective and 
cognitive pattern. The impulse of escape (U) is defined by a natural decay influenced by the 
aversive internal state: 
𝑑𝑈
𝑑𝑡 =  −𝑐3𝑈 + 𝑏3𝐴 
subsequently, suicidal thoughts (T) ensue from impulses of escape. The onsets are rapid, 
short, and rare, that is modelled using a combination of linear decay and  a sigmoidal growth 
term: 
𝑑𝑇
𝑑𝑡 =  −𝑑4𝑇 + 1
1 + 𝑒−𝑐41(𝑈−𝑐42) 
the sigmoid term depicts a process  that start slow ly, increase rapidly, then slow down 
when reaching peak, akin to a neuronal spike . General escape theory also considers alternate 
escape strategies like alcohol use or physical exercise. Hence T could be expanded to describe 
other coping strategies. With 𝑇̃  representing a composite measure of all potential coping 
responses, suicidal thoughts emerge only when other strategies are insufficient to regulate 
aversive internal states.  Researchers also propose mathematical description for escape 
behavior and coping mechanisms, which is not mentioned  here because of the scope of this 
work is limited in suicidal ideation. 
Psychoanalytic theory 
In the  book Man against himself  (Menninger, 1938) , psychoanalyst  Karl Menninger  
cleverly identifies three components in suicide both conscious and unconscious,  by reflecting 
the literal meaning of suicide -- ‘a murder of the self ’: wish to kill, wish to be killed, and wish 
to die.  The wish to kill stems from a  destructive instinct , and the aggressivity would turn  
inward when external objects of unconscious gratification are deprived. The inward 
aggressivity is contingent upon  three preconditions: (1) self is  perceived as an external object, 
(2) highly ambivalent in the object attachment, and (3) sudden deprivation of  this object 
attachment. The wish to be killed arises from  a sense of guilt imposed by conscience, or 
super-ego. Menninger also observed a curious phenomenon where many individuals express 
a strong will  to live immediately after attempt ing suicide. Nowadays this phenomenon is 
interpreted as the short duration of suicidal thoughts, as mentioned before. But Menninger 
assumes there is an unconscious  and undifferentiated  energy of self -destruction, which 
suddenly bursts and induces suicide attempt. Other psychoanalytic theo ries do not yield too 
many novel insights. For example, Melanie Klein emphasizes the attack wish (paranoid -
schizoid position) and sense of guilt (depressive position), Kohut distinguishes ego attacking 
failed self and cruel superego attacking on self,  and contemporary psychoanalytic theories 
define suicide as emergent escape from unbearable affects or pain  (Schechter et al., 2022; 
Wasserman, 2020). 
Through a Lacanian approach , Zizek briefly (in fact, only 3 pages)  sorts out three types 
of suicide that locate in three orders  (Zizek, 2020) . The first type is  Imaginary -- the suicide 
bearing specific messages to the Other  like political suicide by self-immolation. Obsessed 
with narcissistic satisfaction provided by the imaginary scene, they are convinced that their 
suicide would make certain object realize the errors, feel remorse, and engage in self -
reflection. The Symbolic suicide means a n erasure and cut -off of ‘the symbolic network that 
subject’s identity ’. Simple speaking , symbolic suicide could be understood in the sense of 
identity-crisis. The suicide lying in the  Real order seems to be much more impenetrable , and 
Zizek interprets it as suicidal passage to the act  and full and direct identification with object . 
Literally, ‘passage’ denotes a pre -oedipal mental process from fantasy to act driven by 
unbearable anxiety. The passage to the act  drives the subject  ‘move in the direction of an 
escape from the  scene’ (Lacan, 2011) . The Lacanian  anxiety is actually an intersubjective 
concept, and closely related to desire and (both imaginary and symbolic) identity-crisis (Hook, 
2015). As mentioned before, desire running is driven by the remainders, i.e. lack, but Lacn 
claims that anxiety is ‘the lack of the lack ’. In extreme anxiety, the possibility of desire is 
suffocatingly absent, which is why Zizek  describes suicidal passage of the act as ‘eclipse of 
the Symbolic ’ and ‘opposite of the death drive ’. This Lacanian approach encompasses 
elements from many other theories, such as thwarted belongingness, escape from psychache, 
object relations, and cruel super-ego etc. In the next section, we aim to modeling the Lacanian 
theory of suicidal ideation within the structured framework of computational Lacanian 
psychoanalysis, including descriptive reconstruction, mechanistic computational models and 
empirically verifiable models. 
Modelling suicidal ideation: descriptive, mechanistic, and practical approaches 
Descriptive model of suicide ideation: a Lacanian perspective 
The most comprehensible type of suicidal ideation might be th at situated within the 
Symbolic order, the domain of language, law, and social norms. As introduced previously, the 
symbolic suicide is not actual death by suicide but  rather feeling an erasure and cut -off of 
‘the symbolic network that subject ’s ide ntity’. In our pr ior paper, we analyzed the FEP 
accounts of symbolic identification from three dimensions of the Symbolic order (sociology, 
linguistic, and psychoanalytic) (Li & Li, 2024) . One’s symbolic identification evolves through 
the internalization of social norms and language (i.e. the Other), and the Other further 
interpellates the subject into specific social roles over decades of education and dissemination. 
This process of  interpellation is formalized using FEP as system inferring its own function 
role according to long -term external input s (Albarracin et al., 2024; Ramstead et al., 2021) . 
Consequently, the symbolic identity continuously chan ges with environment,  and sets  the 
priors for  the self’s performance.  When s tressors deviate from these  expectations based on 
priors, the free energy of self-model increase, inducing negative affect (Albarracin et al., 2024). 
Chronic high-level of free energy  can further lead to a crisis of self-identity. Thus, an identity 
crisis occurs when interpellation fails, resulting in the  subject losing their position, i.e. cut-off 
of the symbolic network. The  concept of  symbolic suicide encompasses thwarted 
belongingness (interpersonal theory)  and aversive self -evaluation induced by negative 
emotion on failing (escape theory). 
We position imaginary suicide at the intersection between the Symbolic and Imaginary 
orders (Figure 2. a) . As Zizek suggests, driven by narcissistic satisfaction in the imaginary 
scene, this type of suicidal ideation also aims to convey specific information, thus retaining a 
Symbolic dimension. From a neuropsychoanalytic perspective, the logic of imaginary 
identification parallels that of the  mirror neuron system (MNS). The self is represented , 
perceived, and monitored in the same manner as others are represented, as depicted in Figure 
1. D. And the eye (view point) in this illustration denotes the subject  within Symbolic order. 
The nature of imaginary identification  fosters a  dialectic of imaginary intersubjectivity, 
characterized by a clear duality. The information conveyed through  this type of suicide  
ideation, such as  suicide notes, provides further insights . A qualitive research o f 12 suicide 
notes analyzed through a Lacanian way (Canbolat, 2018)  reveals that note writers exhibit an 
imaginary nature, with several underlying  characteristics including (1) primary aggressivity 
behind ambivalent emotions,  (2) self- gaze and judgement from the position of the Other  
(symptoms akin to depersonalization), and (3) a gap between ideal -ego and perceived self -
image. These elements reflect the perceived burdensomeness, perceiving self as an object, and 
ambivalent attachment discussed previously. We could summarize the se as crisis of imaginary 
identification. Similar to the symbolic identity crisis, the mismatch between ideal -ego and 
monitored self-image raises free energy, triggering primary aggressivity linked to narcissism. 
Chronic or acute high -level free energy diminish the sense of agent, thereby hindering the 
active seeking of self -image (the yellow circuit in Figure 1. f). The impaired sense of agen cy 
exaggerates role of the Other ’s gaze in imaginary identification (blue route in Figure 1.f), 
leading to symptoms of  depersonalization. As evidence, depressed individuals with 
depersonalization exhibit 8 times more often active suicidal ideation and 11 times more often 
passive suicidal ideation that those without depersonalization (Golubović et al., 2018).

general suicidal thoughts that consists of four units – S: Symbolic suicide; I: Imaginary suicide; 
D: desire for death; P: passage of the act. (c) a simple inference process based on free energy 
principle. 
Desire for death, or passive suicidal ideation, is situated at the  intersection between the 
Symbolic and the Real orders. Phenomenologically, passive suicidal ideation could be defined 
as an explicit awareness or acceptance of death , th us revealing two components: symbolic 
thoughts of death and the existential reality of death as the boundary of life. On the one hand, 
everyone would encounter death in their life time and time again, and different culture s (the 
Other) treat death in distinct senses. Menninger judiciously realizes that the romantic praises 
for death of patients and poets are definitely not death instinct but rather  a symbolic artefacts 
or distorted cognitions (Menninger, 1938), and thus retaining a Symbolic dimension. On the 
other hand, there exists genuine death instinct in the Real  order. Given the Real’s complexity 
we address it in  a neuropsychoanalytic way, as introduced before, and linking it closely to 
biology (brain stem, sub -cortical regions, and peripheral nervous system) (Dall’Aglio, 2019) . 
Therefore, the system  regulating bodily functions and its environment al interactions plays a 

crucial role in the emergence of desire for death . This is supported by growing interests  in 
identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets for suicidal ideation and attempts.  
Neurobiological findings related to suicide include heart rate variability (Adolph et al., 2018) , 
inflammation markers like CRP and IL-6 (Neupane et al., 2023) , cortisol, serotonin, lipid 
serum level (Capuzzi et al., 2020), thyroid functions (Toloza et al., 2021) and so on. Capuzzi et 
al. suggest that the dysfunction of biomarkers contribute s to suicide via decreasing serotonin 
in prefrontal cortex and hence impairing cognitive functions like execution and emotion 
(Capuzzi et al., 2020) . Additionally, environment factors at distinct scales across climate, 
season, weather,  and ambient temperature also play roles in modulating suicidal ideation  
(Daliri et al., 2017; Frangione et al., 2022) . Generally, treating the Real as a FEP system that 
regulates bodily functions  suggests that both internal and external abnormalities perturbate 
system’s (Bayesian) equilibrium, i.e., increased free energy. Long-lasting free energy keeps 
reminding the subject of life ’s boundary and thus arouses awareness of death. This explains 
why, compared with the young,  incidence of passive suicidal ideation  is higher in old  adults 
especially those with perceived poor health and limited daily activities (Lee, 2023). 
The final and most obscure component is passage of the act , which  includes another 
aspect of the Real  order besides bodily regulations – memory and emotion . Experiences are 
encoded by limbic system and linked to specific affective system (seeking, rage, panic,  play, 
care, lust, and  fear) in unrepresentative but felt form. According to (Dall’Aglio, 2019) , these 
seven affective instincts are situated at the intersection of the Imaginary and Real  orders, and 
they ‘prepare the organism to interact with the world and meet its needs ’. Each affective 
instinct develops a fixed pattern and reproduces affective reactions in  daily life, which is 
repetition compulsion. Sometimes, these instincts can conflict, which is formalized as ‘policies’ 
with congenial expected free energy  (Connolly, 2018). This affective systems updates states 
according to priors and observations, and transit current state via policy (await, rise, or 
reduced) with minimal expected free energy (Clark & Watson, 2023) . Thus, the Real  order 
entails a socio -emotional model linking current situation (external reality)  with previous 
experiences (psychic reality). Phan Luu et al. suggest that motivations for impulsive behavior 
are feedforward generated from predictive errors detected by dorsal limbic system, and 
constrained by ventral limbic system with sensory feedback; removing theses constraints 
could result in increased impulsive behaviors (Luu et al., 2023; Tucker & Luu, 2023) . And 
neuroimaging findings shows that  decreased frontal -subcortical connectivity and suicidal 
ideation is linked to higher impulsiveness, impaired decision-making, and suicidal ideation  
(Balcioglu & Kose, 2018). From a FEP perspective, it can be interpreted as increased precisions 
(or weights) of priors, and violent affective reaction emerges from subject’s psychic reality.  
In summary, t he Lacanian breakdown  of general suicidal ideation categorizes four 
components occupying different locations in three orders. And this descriptive model  reveals 
several characteristics: (1) it encompasses elements of other theories, (2) it can be modelled 
using FEP mathematically,  and (3) the four components are recurrent rather than linear 
continuum, as assumed in escape theory. 
Mechanistic free energy principle model of general suicidal ideation 
In descriptive model for  general suicidal ideation , we identify four key components 
including symbolic suicide (S), imaginary suicide (I), desire for death  (D), and passage of the 
act (P). We construct a recurrent  generative model to analyze the dynamics of suicidal 
ideation across three orders, with each component represented by an interconnected unit  (see 
Figure 2. b) . These units are linked by variable connection weights 𝑤𝑗𝑘  that represent the 
weights of free energy passing between units. The state of general suicidal ideation  is 
therefore defined by the set: 
𝐺𝑆𝐼 = {𝑆, 𝐼, 𝐷, 𝑃} 
where each element is a dynamic entity  governed by FEP . In real-world scenarios, each 
entity encompasses various modalities, that is, the realistic model is both recurrent and 
hierarchical. However, we focus solely on the outcomes at ultimate layer in this section. 
Take symbolic suicide (D) as example, it is conceptualized as an inference process where 
the subject’s prior belief  of symbolic identification  is perturbated by life events leading to an 
increase in free energy (Figure 2. c). This rise in free energy is influenced by four parameters: 
prior beliefs, observations, ambiguity of likelihood function, and ambiguity of priors.  And we 
explore the dynamics of these modulations in Figure 3. Not surprisingly, free energy increases 
with incremental mismatch between pri ors and observations (Figure 3. a). When the 
mismatch degree is relatively low, higher ambiguit ies in priors and likelihood slightly 
increase free energy, while small ambiguity of priors (i.e. rigid belief) would amplify even 
minor mismatch and cause significant free energy (Figure 3. b, c, d). For situation with high 
mismatch degree, higher ambiguity of priors could effectively reduce free energy compared 
to mild effects from ambiguity of likelihood (Figure 3. e, f). This suggests that destruction of 
self-identification serves as a protective mechanism that can relieve the aversive state induced 
by unexpected stressors. 
 
Figure 3. Impact of four parameters (priors, observations, ambiguity of priors, and ambiguity of 

likelihood) on amount of free energy.  
Considering the differences in time scales, we first link three elements {S, I, D } with 
distinct connection weights.  These elements are more directly related to representational 
process on middle to long term scales. In contrast, passage of the act  is responsible for instant 
emotions and impulses . For each element in {S, I, D}, the variational free energy is calculated 
as the sum of intrinsic free energy and weighted extrinsic free energy received from other two 
elements: 
𝐹𝑝 = 𝐹𝑖 +  ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝐹𝑗
𝑗
 
where 𝐹𝑝  represents the  ‘perturbated free energy ’ which further influences inference 
process. As illustrated in Figure 4. a, an ongoing mismatch (degree = 5) in S (black) can rise 
free energy in I (green) and D (gray) as well, showing a coupling dynamic of three free energy 
items. This situation can be resolved gradually through re -matching the priors and 
observations, such as  lowering expectation (prior s) or  coping with the challenge (improve 
observations). Another way to decrease free energy is modification of am biguity as 
mentioned before. Therefore, we involve a n adaptive  mechanism that allows system 
adjusting ambiguity of priors to minimize free energy. This mechanism might be  crucial in 
situations where exists persistent free energy and  it is outrageous ly difficult change priors, 
because those prior beliefs like self -identification are constructed in decades and thus 
relatively fixed. The relationship between free energy and ambiguity of priors (denoted as am) 
could be presented as: 
𝐹𝑎𝑚[𝑄, 𝑜] = 𝐷𝐾𝐿 [𝑄𝑎𝑚(𝑆)‖𝑃(𝑆|𝑜)] − 𝑙𝑛𝑃(𝑜) 
Figure 4. b illustrates the process of reducing free energy by gradually increasing 
ambiguity of priors. In current context, this increased ambiguity r epresents uncertainty in 
self-identification. 
The next step is to refine and expand the current model to include the Passage of the act 
(P). As mentioned, this component is essentially affective, which  linked physical reality 
(sensory input) with psychic reality (memory), and generates affective impulses among seven 
affective systems  which further  motivate actions. Different events could trigger varying 
emotions, and  in our mechanistic model,  we postulate a  general emotion responsible for 
suicide thoughts (e.g. panic or rage). T he function of  unit P involves collecting free energy  
from other three units  and generate affective impulses . As Figure 4. c demonstrated, we 
utilize a naive integrate -and-fire model for impulses generation.  The o ccurrence and 
frequence of impulses  depend on the accumulated free energy, threshold (similar to carrying 
capability in (Wang et al., 2023)’s model), and time constant (representing irritability). 
 
Figure 4. (a) free energy raised by unexpected events and reduced by re-match between priors 
and observation. (b) free energy raised by unexpected events and reduced by increased ambiguity of 
priors, i.e. uncertainty of self-identification. (c) suicidal thoughts emerge from affective impulse (red 
dots) induced by free energy accumulation in passage of the act (red line). And reduced free energy 
subsides these impulses. (d) complete model of general suicidal thoughts. 
We have  thus developed a complete computational model of general suicidal ideation  
(Figure 4. d). Free energies prompted by stressors in three orders like unemployment, loss of 
loved one, and health issues are transmitted to primal affective systems. Then persistent high-
level of free energy  increases ambiguity of priors on self -identification (imaginary and 
symbolic), triggers emotional impulses, and  finally contributes to emergence of suicidal 
ideation. This mechanistic model integrates multiple facets of suicidal thoughts into a 
cohesive and dynamic framework. The generative model treats suicidal ideation  as 
consequences of interactions between subjective mind and aversive external stressors. 
However, the current model remains broad and imprecise without qualitative meanings. In 
the next section, we aim to refine it to enhance its realism and significance. 
Toward a practical model: reproduce suicidal dynamics 
 We select two scales to gather meaningful data on stressful life changes and parameters 
for our current generative model : Social Readjustment Rating Scale  (SRRS) and Personality 
Inventory for  the DSM-5 (PID-5) (Holmes & Rahe, 1967; Krueger et al., 2012) . The SRRS 
assesses 43 stressful life events , each assigned a different impact score , covering s ignificant 
life changes like death of spouse, divorce, being fired at work etc. A case control study 
involving 1183 subjects (478 suicide attempers) suggested that SRRS c an help identify suicide 
risks, emphasizing the significance of stressful life events in suicide (Blasco-Fontecilla et al., 
2012). PID-5 measures 25 personality trait facets  across 220 items, scored from 0 to 3 , which 
load on  5 personality trait domains.  Empirical studies have shown  that deviations of 
personality trait facets like anhedonia , depressivity, suspiciousness, and eccentricity etc.  are 

indicators of suicide risks  (Aboul-ata et al., 2023; Somma, 2024) . These two scales provide a 
set of parameters and data required for our model , enabling the construction of a  model with 
practical significance. With precise internal states and external stressful events, the generative 
model can simulate changes of free energy across four components and emergence of suicidal 
ideation, as  depicted in  Figure 5. Initially, we generate random scores  for the two scales . 
Using data of PID -5, parameters f or the  generative model are de termined. For example, 
symbolic ambiguity of likelihood is defined by the average score of ‘eccentricity’ and ‘unusual 
beliefs and experiences’, because they both reflect the reality-checking ability within Symbolic 
order (like language and thoughts). Similarly, symbolic ambiguity of priors is calculated 
using average score s of ‘depressivity’, ‘submissiveness’, ‘grandiosity’ (reverse), and 
‘anxiousness’, as these traits  represent varying levels of self -evaluation. Detailed mapping 
from PID-5 to internal model can be found in our original code. We then categorize events in 
SRRS within three orders, e.g., death of spouse in the Real, fired at work in the Symbolic, and 
marital separation in the Imaginary.  Score in each order is processed as corresponding 
mismatch degree, allowing us to estimate  free energy  and simulate varying incidences and 
frequencies of suicidal thoughts. 
 
Figure 5. Simulating emergence of suicidal ideation (bottom panel) using Personality Inventory for 
DSM-5 (PID-5, upper left) and Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS, upper right). 
This simulation experiment demonstrates the feasibility of predicting suicidal risks using 
this model. So, we test the predictive value of this model utilizing a batch of open-source data, 
which includes PID -5 and Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (CSSRS) scores of 139 8 
college-aged subjects including 711 females  (Aboul-ata et al., 2023) . These subjects are 
divided to three group s: a training group (n = 838),  a test group (n = 280), and  a validation 
group (n = 280).  To acquire the precise match between personality traits and parameters of 

generative model, we employ a  basic neural network, multiple perceptron (MLP) , that maps 
25 personality trait facets onto 14 parameters  (Figure 6 . a ). The model  then generates 
predictions on incidence of suicide ideation based on  parameters provided by  the MLP . By 
backpropagating loss between predictions and actual data, we trained this MLP to achieve the 
optimal mapping.  Because this dataset lacks information about subjects’ life events,  a fixed 
and equitable external stressor in symbolic unit (mismatch degree = 3)  is set for every subject. 
Despite th is limitation , the model achieve d an AUC of 0.76 (Figure 6. b), demonstrating its 
reasonable predictive value. Th is relatively ordinary outcome is acceptable and meets 
expectations, as our argument is that the level of suicidal risks is  jointly determined by 
internal model and life events.  Further, t o verify whether  the MLP could properly map 
personality traits to  model parameters, we assessed the resilience of each sample to stressful 
life events. By gradually increasing the mismatch degree in three units (S, I, and D) 
respectively, we identified the ‘suicidal point ’ for each subject . The Figure 6. c shows  the 
distribution of resilience among sam ples in training set. The illustration clearly indicates that 
individuals with suicidal thoughts exhibit lower resilience, while those without have higher 
resilience. This not only confirms that the MLP can execute correct and meaningful mapping, 
but also suggests that a model trained with appropriate data can  effectively identify 
individuals with suicidal traits.

operating characteristics of the model on validation set. (c) Distribution of resilience to stressful life 

events, red points: people with suicidal thoughts; black points: people without suicidal thoughts. 
Compared to the formalized model proposed by (Wang et al., 2023) , our model has 
several advantages including: (1) it is formalized with FEP  that is more biologically plausible 
and principled than a set of differential equations;  (2) we provide an empirical validation 
using accessible psychometric data; (3) it is grounded in a comprehensive theory of human 
mind, namely computational Lacanian psychoanalysis, making it adaptable to other mental 
disorders and psychological process . To fully realize the potential of our model, future 
studies should focus on comprehensive data collection (psychological traits, life experiences, 
and neural biomarkers), refined model architecture and analysis, and explor ing real-world 
applications like risk assessment and targeted interventions. 
Conclusion 
This paper introduces a novel computational model of suicidal ideation based on the 
integration of Lacanian psychoanalysis and free energy principle. The key contributions of 
this work are threefold. First, we offer a comprehensive Lacanian descriptive framework of 
suicidal ideation that organizes the phenomenon into four categories:  symbolic suicidal  (S), 
imaginary suicide (I), desire for death  (D), and passage to the act  (P). This framework unifies 
insights from various existing theories. Second, we formalize this account into a mechanistic 
model that dynamically captures how mismatches between expected and actual experiences  
in S, I, and D generate free energy  and leads to affective impulses that underlie suicidal 
ideation. Third, we extend the model into a realistic and predictive tool by incorporating 
parameters from standardized personality (PID -5) and life event (SRRS) scales. Preliminary 
empirical validation on a sample of 1398 individuals demonstrate the model ’s ability to 
identify at-risk individuals based solely on personality traits – in the absence of life event data. 
The p roposed model demonstrates the potential of generative psychometrics  as a  new 
paradigm for  integrating psychometric measurement with generative modeling of 
psychological phenomena. However, the current work is not without limitations.  The model 
focuses on suicidal thoughts rather than suicidal attempts which  are more dangerous and 
complex. And t he empirical validation is based on a cross -sectional sample and lacks 
longitudinal data on stressful life events. Future work should  extend current model to 
suicidal behaviors and further test the model’s predictive efficiency.
