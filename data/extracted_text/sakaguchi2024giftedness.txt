Syndromic autism spectrum conditions (ASC), such as Klinefelter syndrome, also
manifest hypogonadism. Compared to the popular Extreme Male Brain theory,
the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning model explains the connection between
ASC, savant traits, and giftedness more seamlessly, and their co-emergence with
atypical sexual differentiation. Over excitability of primary sensory inputs
generates a relative enhancement of local to global processing of stimuli,
hindering the abstraction of communi cation signals, in contrast to the
extraordinary local information processing skills in some individuals. Weaker
inhibitory function through gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors
and the atypicality of synapse formation lead to this difference, and the formation
of unique neural circuits that process external information. Additionally,
deﬁciency in monitoring inner sensory information leads to alexithymia
(inability to distinguish one ’s own emotions), which can be caused by
hypoactivity of estrogen and oxytocin in the interoceptive neural circuits,
comprising the anterior insular and cingulate gyri. These areas are also part of
the Salience Network, which switches between the Central Executive Network
for external tasks and the Default Mode Network for self-referential mind
wandering. Exploring the possibility that estrogen de ﬁciency since early
development interrupts GABA shift, causing sensory processing atypicality, it
helps to evaluate the co-occurrence of ASC with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder, dyslexia, and schizophrenia based on phenotypic and physiological
bases. It also provides clues for understanding the common underpinnings of
these neurodevelopmental disorders and gifted populations.

1 Introduction
Various neurodevelopmental atypicalities are overrepresented
in males, and autism spectrum conditions (ASC), which have been
the targets of primary attention, are approximately three times more
prevalent in males than females ( 1) [however, some current
arguments maintain equal prevalence of ASC across sexes (2)].
There are also global sex differences in professional interest and
cognitive strength (3, 4). Classically, Geshwind et al. assumed that
high prenatal androgen levels cause the suppression of“dominant”
left cerebral cortex languageﬁeld development, leading to learning
disorders, left-handedness, and susceptibility to immune diseases
and migraines (5, 6). In a more recent version, Baron-Cohen’s
Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory posits that systemizing-
empathizing dimensions of cognitive preference explain ASC
tendencies in parallel with male-female brain differences (7–9).
There is a global sex difference in the 2nd to 4th digit ratio, and a
smaller (< 0) ratio is regarded to reﬂect a stronger androgen effectin
utero. Theﬁnger digit ratio is easy to measure and came to be the
most popular putative biomarker of prenatal androgen effects,
instead of handedness (10).
However, these premises are rebutted by many accounts that
failed to ﬁnd an association between various androgen measures
and ASC symptoms (11), especially in ASC males (12). Brain
differences between ASC versus typically developed (TD) in
women somewhat overlap with male-female sex differences
among TD, but they have little overlap with ASC-TD differences
within men (13). The diagnosis of ASC does not imply a uniform
tendency, which covers a multifaceted spectrum (14), questioning
the plausibility of research strategies that investigate mechanisms in
parallel with typical gender differences.
Therefore, we focused on mul tiple chromosomal/genetic
syndromes associated with sex steroid deﬁciencies and the known
risks of ASC. About 5–20% of ASC are considered syndromic (15),
and many also show hypogonadism. Characteristically, 30–50% of
individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), one of the most
prevalent syndromes with chromosomal aneuploidy, have ASC, in
contrast to the prevalence rate of 1% in the general population (16).
In other syndromes with hypogonadism, 11–80% of Prader-Willi
syndromes (PWS) are associated with ASC (15). Fragile X and
Down syndromes also show a high prevalence of ASC along with
other neurodevelopmental d isorder (NDD) symptoms and
psychiatric status. Hundreds of genes related to developmental or
psychiatric status overlap across different diagnostic categories (17,
18). The diagnostic criteria category is not as typological as
previously believed. The viewpoint of capturing status as a
spectrum covering diverse phenotypes has become predominant
(14). When investigating the effect of sex steroids on cognitive
function, it would be more promising to focus on syndromes with
known physiological factors and common endophenotypes instead
of being bound by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria (19).
Another drawback of the EMB theory in explaining individual
differences in strength and weakness across cognitive domains, in
parallel with general sex differences, is that the prevalence of non-
heterosexuals among the ASC population is nearly twice that of TD
(20–22) .A tt h es a m et i m e ,t h ep r e v a l e n c eo fA S Ci nm a l ea n df e m a l e
transgender people is approximately 7–1 0t i m e st h a ni nt h eg e n e r a l
population (23, 24). Furthermore, mediation analysis suggests that the
non-heterosexuality of individuals with ASD is mediated by a higher
incidence of gender dysphoria (20). Among KS individuals, some of
whom experience hypogonadismin utero, and self-perceived gender
nonconformity tends to co-emerge with NDDs (25). These pieces of
evidence suggest a common underlying mechanism between NDD risk
and atypical gender identity development.
In this paper, we have collected evidence that non-correlative
biopharmacological studies support thathypoestrogenism is a more
robust predictor of NDDs, and a cluster of outstanding abilities. The
apparent correlation between hyperandrogenism and such cognitive
traits can be explained as the result of negative feedback and a pseudo-
relationship (26, 27) (see section 2.1.3). This paper connects evidence
from atypical sexual development withthe neurodevelopmental theory
of ASC, which is based onthe free energy principleby Karl Friston.
Oxytocin plays an important rolein early insular development by
helping neural predictive signals synchronized with external and
internal stimuli (28), leading to a sense of self-integration (29)
(Figure 1). The insula is a central part of integrating external and
internal sensations into self-image (28) and switches between the self-
referential Default Mode and Central Executive Networks in the neural
process of cognition (30). Steroids and oxytocin bidirectionally and
synergistically affect early neural development and function in adults,
and disruption of oxytocin activity has been reported in PWS, which
shows hypogonadism and a strong tendency toward ASC (31, 32). In
the rat brain, estrogen receptor beta (ERb) is distributed over most
cerebral cortex areas, mainly in layer V. Estrogen receptor beta is
abundant in the primary motor and somatosensoryﬁelds, and has a
lower density in the insula, followed by the cingulate cortex (33). The
cingulate cortex works together with the insula and connects incoming
sensation with emotional recognition and control. A recent hypothesis
regarding schizophrenia suggested that insufﬁcient estrogen and
oxytocin levels are upstream etiologies. Moderate increases in these
hormones ameliorate the positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia by attenuating impairments in prepulse inhibition,
resulting in the facilitation of emotion recognition and social
interaction (34).
The brains of individuals with KS (16), ASC (35, 36), and
schizophrenia (37) commonly show the under-development or
function of the insula. Additionally, KS (16), ASC (38), and also
male-to-female transgender individuals (39) share commonalities

in the overdevelopment of primary sensory areas ( Figure 1).
Underdevelopment of the insula can lead to overfocusing on raw
sensory input processed in sensory areas and an inability to abstract
perceptive stimuli, resulting in shortcomings in emotional
regulation, motor coordination, and the processing of
communication signals, including language ( 28, 40, 41). This
paradigm also helps to focus on the co-occurrence of
endophenotypes across different diagnostic categories, such as
ASC, attention-de ﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( 42),
schizophrenia, dyslexia, along with atypical self-integration, and
mystical thinking, which might become the source of wild
imagination and creative inspiration (43).

Enhanced Perceptual Functioning model and the neurodevelopmental theory based on the free energy principle, in combination with an

individuals with NDDs and savants/gifted individuals. The signiﬁcance of each aspect varies across syndromes and subtypes within them. Brain

syndrome (XXY and its variations with >2 Xs) is the most prevalent
sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), with a high end of prevalence
rate of≈1:500 in males (46). The lifetime diagnosis rate of KS is low,
for example UK, 36% (47) and 23% (48); Australia, 50% (49); and
Denmark, 25% (50), and approximately one-tenth of them are
diagnosed prenatally (47). While typically known for tall stature,
eunuchoid physique, learning dif ﬁculties, and impulsivity, the
emergent phenotypes of KS are diverse. In a population who had
been diagnosed irrespective of symptoms, the prevalence of
gynecomastia and delay in school achievement did not differ from
that in a control population ( 51). Common and robust
characteristics include microorchidism, hypergonadotropic
hypoandrogenism, and infertility ( 16). Hypoandrogenism is
observed in > 75% of the diagnosed cases (16).
Among individuals diagnosed with KS, 30–50% are affected by
ASC (16), and 63% are diagnosed with ADHD (52). The incidence of
schizophrenia has been reported to be high; however, this observation
was based on a small clinical sample (53). Psychosocial atypicality is
generally considered to emerge together with hypogonadism features
(54), whereas there have been case reports of ASC manifestation
together with typical androgen production (55). A greater number of
X-chromosomes leads to more pr onounced physiological and
cognitive characteristics (56, 57). In KS, ASC characteristics are
mild, and restrictions of interest do not emerge ( 58). Verbal
intelligence quotient (IQ) is typically in the low-normal range,
whereas performance IQ measuring visuospatial ability is not
impaired (59) and sometimes reaches a gifted range (>130) (60).
Boys with KS show relative strength in arithmetic (59), although
some report weakness in arithmetic problem solving. Executive
function is affected by diminished cognitiveﬂexibility and reduced
working memory (53, 61). Testosterone supplementation improves
language skills and concentration (53)( Table 1), but not visuospatial
ability, which is generally considered to be promoted by androgens.
Hypoandrogenism develops after puberty; however, speech and
motor delays appear before that. Androgen secretion in the
peripheral and central neural systems prenatally (165) and infantile
mini-puberty (166) tends to be low, implying its inﬂuence on early
developmental stages. Prenatal androgen production rate is diverse,
as manifested in the micropenis manifestation in 10 –25% of
diagnosed cases (16). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism cases are
included in such a phenotype, and the percentage is as low as two in
160 KS individuals (167). Decrease in bone mineral density is
observed in <40% individuals, indicating lower estrogen
function (16).
The XYY karyotype is rare, with approximately 1:1,000 males.
They are characterized by tall stature, hypotonia, and cognitive
problems; however, apparent symptoms are rare. Therefore,
diagnosed individuals comprise a minority, with 0.7% (48), 5.9%
(47), or at most 20% of XYY cases (168). Circulating testosterone
levels are comparable to those in controls (48); however, infertility
rate is higher than that in typical males (169, 170). There are
sporadic reports of intersex states (testicular feminization) (171,
172) and transgender individuals (173) living as females. Among
diagnosed individuals, cognitive and psychiatric proﬁles are similar
to those of individuals with KS (53), but impairments in language
and social responsiveness are more severe (58). To assess subtle
differences in testicular function, particularly during prepuberty,
inhibin B is a sensitive measure of testicular function, and lower
inhibin B levels are associated with more autistic and problematic
behaviors. Interestingly, pubertal rise in inhibin B is blunted, and
prepubertal anti-Müllerian hormone levels are high, similar to those
in KS. In XYY individuals, higher inhibin B or testosterone levels
predict better cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes (126),
contrary to the old expectation that XYY individuals are super-
males and aggressive. Estradiol levels are low-normal (174, 175),
and the osteoporosis rate is not high (48), suggesting that peripheral
estrogen action is typical.
Individuals prenatally diagnosed with XYY show a higher-than-
average IQ, in contrast to those who are postnatally diagnosed
because of physiological/psychobehavioral problems. Postnatally
diagnosed individuals with XYY show lower than average IQ and
more ASC symptoms; however, physiological symptoms are
comparable between the two groups. Although KS is
characterized by shrunken tes tes, XYY males tend to exhibit
macroorchidism, indicating a disrupted hypothalamic pituitary
gonadal (HPG) axis (174).
Another genetic condition that connects hypogonadism and
autistic cognitive predispos i t i o ni sP W S .T h i si sag e n o m i c
imprinting disease that lacks a paternally imprinted 15q11-q13
gene region due to mutations or maternal disomy. In contrast to the
KS variations and XYY, but similar to XXXXY (57), the stature is
short. Disruption of food intake regulation leads to obesity. Both
males and females are since prenatally hypogonadal, adrenarche
starts early, and the ASC prevalence rate is 11–80% (15). Personality
problems are severe, with multiple learning difﬁculties and an IQ of
30–70 (176). Distinct from SCA is the inclination toward obsessive-
compulsive disorders. Language delay is typical, as observed in the
case of syndromic ASC, whereas special characteristics of PWS
include the numbness to pain, vomiting stimuli, and temperature
sensation. Additionally, individuals with PWS are very good at
jigsaw puzzle ( 177). Therefore, locus 15q11-q13 has been
considered to be responsible for savant syndrome (178), which
includes relevant genes, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid type A
receptor subunit gamma3 (GABRG3). Mutation of the gene affects
the activity of the GABA
A receptor subunit, hindering inhibitory
signaling in response to GABA. However, this ﬁnding was not
replicated (179), implying that this region only explains a certain
subtype of savant syndrome. Interestingly, individuals with PWS
tend to be fond of caring for animals and babies (180), suggesting
that they are not indifferent to their interactions with
animate agents.
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a triplet repeat disease caused by
the extension of CGG repeats in the fragile X messenger
ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, which resides in the 5′ end
noncoding region on the X chromosome. This is the most
common cause of mental retardation in males, and the most
common single genetic cause of ASC. Affected individuals show
an elongated face, large ears, other physical malformations, and
difﬁculty in swallowing food. TheFMR1 protein (FMRP) is one of
the most abundant proteins in the brain and is crucial for synapse
formation, regulating mRNA translation within dendrites. The
mutation of FMR1 targets GABA receptor subunits and

downregulates GABAA receptors. The protein is not synthesized
when the number of CGG repeats exceeds 200, leading to obesity
and behavioral problems. Anxiety, ADHD, and sensory
hypersensitivity are frequent symptoms. The perseverance on
topics is also frequent, sometimes meeting the criteria for
obsessive-compulsive disorder. The abnormal enlargement of the
testes begins at puberty. Signiﬁcant to the current argument is the
Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) of FXS, which comprises 10% of all
affected individuals; individuals with PWP have a syndrome similar
to PWS, with heightened prevalence of ASC (54%) compared to
30% among males with FXS (127). The imprinting pattern of
15q11-q13 is normal; however, the cytoplasmic FMRP interacting
protein 1 encoded byCYFIP1 in 15q11-q13 colocalizes and works
together with FMRP in dendrites to form neuronal structures, and
the downregulation ofCYFIP1 results in this phenotype. In PWP,
congenital hypogenitalism and hypogonadism emerge in 6 of 13
cases, with later development of macroorchidism in general (127).
The full-scale IQ, including verbal and performance IQ ranges from
to 36–49. In the molecular biological exploration of the common
factors between FXS and ASC, the delay in synapse maturation,
under-regulation of GABAA receptors and subsequent imbalance of
glutamine/GABA neural systems are considered primary
causes (127).
Additionally, chromosome 21 trisomy (Down syndrome) shows
comorbidities with ASC (1–42%) (130–132) and ADHD (34%)
(130). Individuals with Down syndrome show characteristic facial
features, low IQs, hypotonia, and poor motor coordination. In
males with Down syndrome, approximately one-fourth show
cryptorchism and 10% show hypospadias ( 181). Infertility is
prevalent, and hypogonadism is also reported to be high;

however, sex steroid levels are relatively normal in the
postpubescent population. Appr oximately one-third of the
individuals show elevated LH or FSH levels, indicating primary
gonadal dysfunction (181, 182). Some individuals show savant
skills, such as music ( 183 ), but considered to be rare.
Symptomology related to ASC has eluded research attention in
this syndrome.
In the general population, registry-based studies in Sweden
demonstrated that individuals of both sexes with hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism or delayed puberty showed a signiﬁcant increase in
the prevalence of ASC, ADHD, and intellectual disabilities compared
to matched controls (184). The impact of hypogonadism remained
signiﬁcant even after excluding individuals with chromosomal
abnormalities from the analyses. Kallman syndrome is a genetic
disorder that manifests with outcomes associated with congenital
hypogonadism. Affected indiv iduals show hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, anosmia, an elongated face, large ears, and an
increased risk of osteoporosis, hearing loss, mental handicap, and
schizophrenia (151). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1)
neurons originate from the nasal placode, and atypical development
at this earliest neural development stage leads to disorganization of
HPG axis. Subsequently, several ASC risk genes require the
facilitation by androgen or estrogen to ful ﬁll their typical
neurodevelopmental functions, as discussed in the next section.
Additionally, testosterone (185) and estrogen (see Section 2.1.3)
directly modulate GABAA receptor function, and their deﬁciency
leads to destabilized excitation in the limbic system.
Androgen deﬁciency affects hypogonadal populations mainly
on impairing communication abilities. Weaker activation of the
dopaminergic reward circuit (see section 3.3) and the amygdala (see
section 2.1.3) likely induces interpersonal anxiety and weaker
interpersonal motivation. Impa irment in executive control of
behavior through weaker control of the prefrontal cortex (see
section 3.3.2) and in spatial memory through hippocampal
underdevelopment (3.2.1) are also possible outcomes. The effect
of androgen is partly through AR and partly through ERb in non-
aromatized or after aromatized form.
2.1.2 Cognitive characteristics explaining ASC-
savant traits and major possible target gene
expressions triggered by sex-steroid deﬁciency
The free energy principle is a broad theory in computational
neuroscience that explains the formation of neural circuits and
cognitive processes as the minimization of gaps between the
expectation of signals and reception of input. As a comprehensive
theory similar to Hebb’s rule, the free energy principle tries to explain
how the information from stimuliis joined with the inner process
representing phenomena in neural systems, and the closing gaps
updates neural wiring. The principle was originally formulated to
explain NDD phenomena, such as ASC and schizophrenia, and
explains the characteristics of these two apparently different
symptoms in the same model with different parameters. This
principle has been demonstrated to be applicable to the decision-
making process through the modulation of dopamine receptors (186),
and to the learning process through cholinergic neuromodulation (187).
The neurodevelopmental hypothesis derived from the principle
posits that a major causal factor of ASC symptoms is the disruption of
GABA shift in early development (41)( Figure 2). The oxytocin-
induced GABA shift changes GABAergic neuronal function from
excitatory (depolarizing) to inhibitory (hyperpolarizing). Estradiol,
especially its work on ER b, is essential for organizing neural
distribution in the developing brain (188, 189). Excessive estradiol
delays GABA shift (190–192), and steroidogenesis dysfunction also
delays this shift. For example, high concentrations of environmental
disruptors, such as bisphenol A or bisphenol S hinder oxytocin
function and GABA shift, likely by disrupting endogenous estradiol
function (193). The delay or elimination of the shift leaves the brain
in an immature state, leading to inﬂation of excitation/inhibition (E/
I) ratio and a delay in closingthe critical periodpostnatally, that is
supposed to prune excess synapses, affecting neuronal plasticity (194).
This leads to microstructural atypicality and hypoconnectivity of
neural circuits around the amygdala, insula, and cingulate cortex, as
well as psycho-behavioral atypicality. The GABA shift is an event that
changes the brain from an organizational neural distribution phase to
a synapse pruning phase in accordance with external sensory
input (195).
In contrast, the major psychol ogical explanations of the
cognitive characteristics of ASC, covering communication
deﬁciency and higher performance in certain visual tasks, have
been: 1) the Weak Central Coherence (196, 197); 2) the Enhanced
Perceptual Functioning (EPF) (198, 199); 3) systemizing the brain
through the EMB (7); and in a classic form, 4) the Geschwind–
Galaburda hypothesis, which attributes the cause to the imbalance
of hemispheric development (5, 6). The Geschwind–Galaburda
hypothesis explains that higher prenatal androgen levels cause a
delay in the development of left cerebral hemisphere, as manifested
by an increase in non-right-handedness and atypical brain torque in
individuals with ASC (200). The neurodevelopmental hypothesis
indicates the order of development of these phenomena: the
difﬁculty in closing gaps between internal and external perceptive
stimuli and the expectation of received signals leads to non-optimal
attenuation of perception, as manifested in hyper/hypoesthesia 2),
and difﬁculty in summarizing perceived information 1), resulting in
skewed strength/weakness in cognitive domains 3) and the skewed
development of corresponding brain areas 4). Steroid deﬁciencies in
early development and adulthood are possible causes of failure to
attenuate neural signals. This could be manifested by overexcitation
over primary perceptual input (201), overdevelopment of the visual
cortex and primary sensory areas ( 38), glial cell atypicality
perturbing synapses and neu ral circuit maturation ( 202–204).
Delays in synapse maturation, reduced synapse pruning, and
atypical neural networks of glutamine and GABA (205, 206) are
hallmarks of ASC.
In higher-level cognitive processing, insular malformations are
key to understanding the hindrance to integrating higher-order ego
recognition and naming emotional experiences of self and others
(36). The insula integrates multimodal sensations from the outside
world and inner body into self-awareness. The posterior insula is an
integral part of passinginteroception to the brain, and it comprises
visceral feelings and feedback from the autonomous nervous

Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org07
system. Disconnection from the interoception network leads to
alexithymia (207). The inability to anticipate one’s own bodily
responses leads to easy panicking and shyness (128). Although
ERs are not densely distributed, estrogen infusion into the insula of
the rat brain excites neurons by suppressing GABA release in this
area and activates descending sympathoexcitatory pathways (145,
146 ). On the other hand, higher oxytocin concentrations
correspond to stronger feelings of body ownership ( 29),
sensitivity to the social environment ( 144), and emotional
empathy in humans, possibly by strengthening the interoceptive
network and attenuating physiological reactions to negative stimuli.
Testosterone supplementation in individuals with KS improves
communication and interpersonal skills, possibly by smoothing
the expectation of perceptual input and helping integrate socially
relevant information, thereby reducing anxiety about interacting
with others (128, 208).
Major ASC-susceptible genes are modulated by estrogen and
androgen, and steroid de ﬁciencies can cause diverse cognitive
symptoms. Forkhead box protein P2 gene ( FOXP2), originally
discovered in a family line with language developmental
disorders, and its paralog,FOXP1, the ﬁfth major risk factor for
ASC and a common risk factor for other NDDs (209), are among
them. FOXP2 is expressed in earliest-born cortical neurons in the
subplate, and the protein binds to DNA to facilitate neural
FIGURE 2
Endocrinological environment affecting the timing of GABA shift. Perturbation of ERb activity hinders neural and glial cell development and adhesion.
This also interrupts the function of oxytocin (right pane) and delays the timing of the GABA shift. The extended immature phase of the brain
corresponds to weaker GABA inhibition and the skew to the serotonergic system compared to the dopaminergic system. Also, excessive estradiol
doses by endogenous/exogenous causes a delay in GABA shift and can induce epilepsy, with possible subsequent distortion of steroidogenesis and
functional pathways. ASC: autism spectrum condition; BPA: bisphenol A; BPS: bisphenol S; ER: estrogen receptor; GABA:g-aminobutyric acid; KCC:

development and cell-type differentiation (210). Non-aromatizable
androgens are necessary for normal expression and function of
Foxp1 and Foxp2 in rats (211). Foxp2 is expressed in the sensory
and motor-related cortices, cer ebellum, and medial amygdala.
Knockdown of Foxp2 in mice compromises social behavior
processed in the medial amygd ala, in dopamine-dependent
manner ( 63). In female zebra ﬁsh, Foxp2 deﬁciency leads to
disruption of the HPG axis (212), and FOXP2 is overexpressed in
human prostate cancer cells ( 213). These results suggest that
FOXP2 functions in the feedback on estrogen and
androgen pathways.
Additionally, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3
(SHANK3) is another major gene factor against ASC, regulating
neuronal and synaptic excitability (214). In line withSHANK1 and
SHANK2, it functions onthe N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and
glutamate receptors, and is involved in dendritic spine maturation
(215). SHANK3 is crucial for ﬁxing and guiding the actin
cytoskeleton of neurons before synaptic transmission; knockdown
of SHANK3 reduces neuronal soma size, growth cone area, neurite
length, and branch numbers (216). In macaque monkeys with the
ASC-type mutant SHANK3, behavioral outcomes include sleep
disturbances, motor deﬁcits, repetitive behaviors, and social and
learning impairments. Neuronal networks were also altered into
hypo-connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN: see section
2.2.1) and local hyper-connec tivity in areas including the
somatosensory and posterior cingulate cortices (217). In human
cell culture, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased the expression of
SHANK by 35% and estradiol by 15%, indicating that both AR,
ERa,a n dE Rb contribute to regulation ( 218). In contrast,
Srancikova et al. found that testosterone downregulates SHANK1
and SHANK3, and that gene expression was lower in the
hippocampus of male than of female rats (219).
In rodents, estrogen regulates sexual characteristics, puberty, and
neurobiological reproductive systems through ER a.C o n t r a r y ,
estrogen modulates non-reproductive systems, such as anxiety,
locomotion, fear, memory, and learning, through ERb. If the action
of estrogen on these neural systems during developmentally critical
stages is insufﬁcient, the typical development of neurons, synapses,
and glial cells is hindered (220). The action of ERb is not necessarily
estrogen-dependent (188); the androgen metabolite androstanediol is
also suggested to promote oxytocin function through ERb (221). In
human brain, areas with especially abundant ERb are somatosensory
cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum (222). Insufﬁcient
estrogen action is a possible causal factor for various psychiatric and
NDDs that emerge with different sex ratios after puberty. In women,
psychiatric syndromes, including schizophrenia, ASC, ADHD, and
general anxiety disorders are exacerbated when estrogen levels are
low (222).
2.1.3 Estrogen deﬁciency sometimes emerges
with an increase in androgen markers in males
Differentially expressed gene analysis across different phenotypes
of ASC revealed that both androgen and estrogen signaling pathways
are related to these conditions. Androgen signaling is associated with
the emergence of a savant tendency (223, 224). Among ASC related
genes, scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1) which codes a
membrane protein regulating cholesterol usage in cells is also
involved in sexual differentiation, and 5 a-reductase type 1
(SRD5A1) gene controls cellular cholesterol intake and testosterone
metabolism (224). However, these two genes have relatively small
explanatory power among ASC-related genes (209). An apparent
increase in steroid biomarkers may be secondary to a deﬁciency in sex
steroid action during critical d evelopmental periods and the
subsequent disruption of steroidogenesis. Additionally, steroids
functions not only trigger genetic expression cascades through
classical actions on nuclear steroid receptors. Instead, many
estrogenic neuromodulatin g mechanisms seem to depend on
receptors on the membrane, which directly and rapidly modulate
the strength of GABA or glutamate signal transmission in neurons
(225, 226), and the activities of glial cells (98, 227–229), which guide
neural extension, synapse modulation, and information transmission.
The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a major
estrogen membrane receptor expressed in primate LH-releasing
hormone neurons in the olfactory placode and hypothalamus,
modulating the HPG axis ( 230). Male HPG axis negative
feedback loop is mainly controlled by estrogen instead of non-
aromatized androgen in pituitary, suggesting the insuf ﬁcient
estrogen action behind the gonadotropin increase (231). GPER
plays an important role in the control of spermatogenesis in the
testes (231). Individuals with KS typically show hypergonadotropic
hypogonadism, and their testicular tissue shows a 12-fold increase
in GPER and a decrease in ERb mRNA expression compared to
control males, indicating insufﬁcient estrogen control for testicular
function in this population (232). GPER is expressed in both the
central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the
cardiovascular system. Among children with ASC, serum GPER
levels decreased with an increase in symptom severity. However,
serum estradiol levels did not correlate with GPER levels (233).
During the developmental phases in men, excess androgen
levels trigger negative feedback or are buffered within the high-
normal range, which does not necessarily deliver unique
developmental characteristics, as expected in women. For
example, fetuses with congenital androgen hyperplasia (CAH) are
exposed to androgens at supranormal concentrations in the adrenal
glands because of a lack of metabolic pathways. This causes
physiological and psychological masculinization (234, 235) only
in females, butdoes not increasethe odds of ASC, according to a
recent meta-analysis (133).
When mothers suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
and androgen production is elevated, the conceived babies’
risk of
developing ASC increases (134). Animal models suggest that in
girls, the elevation of prenatal exogenous androgen levels is likely to
induce postnatal upregulation of androgen production and activity,
whereas in males, this induces a decrease in luteinizing hormone
(LH) and underdevelopment of the testes ( 236). Estrogen
concentrations in affected mothers and offspring are not
consistently altered, but aromatase activity decreases in the
placenta of mothers (237). In mice, the offspring of androgen-
exposed mothers show downregulation of AR or ERa in a sex-
dependent manner in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and
amygdala, showing anxiety symptoms. The expression of
serotonergic and GABAergic genes tends to increase in a sex-

Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org09
dependent manner (238). A survey of gifted boys, who would have a
common physiological background with savants reported that they
had smaller 2D:4Dﬁnger ratios, suggesting the inﬂuence of higher
androgens in the prenatal environment. However, salivary
testosterone levels were signiﬁcantly lower, and performance on
reading in the eye test was poorer (239). This case might correspond
with the case of offsprings who have been exposed to exogenous
androgen in utero, while in male neonates, the association between
amniotic testosterone levels and the 2D:4D ratio is questioned
(240). Additionally, an initial report of smaller 2D:4D ratios in
individuals with autism (241) was not replicated (12), or was limited
to syndromic cases among men (242).
In an attempt to distinguish adults with Asperger’s syndrome
from those typically developed with 24 serum biomarkers, only four
markers were common between men and women. An increase in
LH and free testosterone levels was observed only in women; among
men, the main characteristics were higher levels of cytokines and
other inﬂammatory measures (135). Geschwind et al. pointed that
ASC and gifted are often suffering from autoimmune diseases (5).
Autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in females compared to
males in the general population. However, long-term aromatase
deﬁciency induces autoimmune diseases in mice (243).
Congenital estrogen deﬁciency results from the deletion of the
aromatase gene cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1
(CYP19A1) or abnormal function of ERs (estrogen resistance). The
PWP of FXS, who are at high risk of ASC (127), shows aromatase
deﬁciency, with eunuchoid propor tions, early onset metabolic
syndrome, and oligozoospermia, similar to KS, in combination
with cryptorchidism or macroorchidism (see section 2.1.1).
Among various endocrinological diseases with the depression of
estradiol levels, aromatase deﬁciency causes a large drop in estradiol
levels; testosterone levels are low in some cases, and high in others
(26). Mothers with fetuses affected by aromatase deﬁciency show
virilization during the third trimester. Congenital estrogen
deﬁciency in women leads to virilization of the genitalia,
decreased estrogen levels, and increased androgen levels (27). In
rats, prenatal exposure to synthetic progesterone in the form of oral
contraceptives results in ERb suppression in the amygdala and
ASC-like behavior ( 244). Estrogen de ﬁciency leads to insulin
resistance, which hinders synaptic plasticity and dopaminergic
function in the ventral striatum, thereby inducing anxiety and
depression. Hypoactivation of the mesocorticolimbic and
nigrostriatal dopamine pathways has been suggested to
correspond to low social interaction motivation and stereotyped
behavior (245).
Deﬁciencies in ERb, CYP19A1, and ER coactivators in the
middle frontal gyrus can be a direct cause of ASC (136). Acid-
related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) is a transcription factor that
induces aromatase expression through a feedback loop at sex steroid
concentrations (246). In ASC population, RORA and aromatase
expression are greatly decreased (247, 248). In a survey of the
Japanese population, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
ESR 1/2 were found to be related to the severity of symptoms in
ASC. Human ER genes, ESR1 and ESR2, encode receptors that are
homologues of ERa and ERb respectively, and ESR1 was concerned
with the impairment of social interactions, and ESR2 with
emotional regulation. However, ESR1/2 SNPs did not predict the
severity of social communication problems, stereotypies, or sensory
abnormalities ( 137). Among male and female transgender
populations, which tend to co -emerge with ASC, many gene
variants correspond to estrogen signaling pathways in sexually
dimorphic brain areas, but none to androgen pathways (249).
In the prenatal environment, low concentrations of
unconjugated estriol (uE3) and high concentrations of maternal
serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) in the maternal serum increased
the odds ratio of ASC prevalence in offspring (138). A low uE3
concentration is an indication of insufﬁcient production of adrenal
steroid (dehydroepi androsterone and others) in infants, and
MSAFP suppresses estrogen activ ity. Additionally, prenatal
exposure to progestin, which is prescribed to prevent threatened
miscarriage, has been reported to suppress the expression of ERb in
the fetal brain, thereby increasing the risk of ASC in rat experiments
and epidemiological studies (139).
The above evidence suggests that one of the main factors that
induce ASC is the depression of estrogen action; if the potential for
steroidogenesis in the fetus is intact, the androgen production rate
would be increased to compensate for estrogen de ﬁciency. In
another case, an increase in ex ogenous androgen circulation
downregulates endogenous androgen genesis in the fetus, that will
cause estrogen deﬁciency subsequently; however, using a Danish
cohort sample, Baron-Cohen et al. showed an increase in various
estrogen and progesterone concentrations in amniocentesisﬂuids of
boys with ASC (11, 140).
In addition to syndromic ASCs that lack steroid hormones
during early development, there are known cases of externally
caused shortages of sex steroids that induce ASC. The responsible
environmental disruptors are dioxins and herbicides (141). An
analysis of umbilical codes suggests that exposure to high levels of
dioxins suppresses androgen production in male fetuses (250).
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a blocker of AR (251) and ER, affecting the
expression of multiple ASC related genes. Bisphenol A exposure in
pregnant rats increased neurite length and the number of neurite
branches in offspring of both sexes, while an increase in neuronal
cell death, the impairment of neuronal development in the
hippocampus and learning ability were observed only in male
offspring (
252). The prefrontal cortex of adult Long-Evans rats
prenatally exposed to high concentrations of BPA showed an
increase in the number of neurons and glia in layers 5/6, but only
in males (253). In contrast, an epidemiological test using a public
human cohort demonstrated that the effect of BPA on ASC
susceptibility was more apparent in girls (254).
Studies have reported the disr uption of steroidogenesis in
individuals with ASC, particularly alterations in metabolic
pathways before steroids are converted into sex hormones (255).
Along with estrogen, neurosteroids such as the progesterone
metabolite allopregnanolone , are crucial for neural cell
proliferation, migration, myel ination, synapse formation, and
modulation of GABAA receptors in the cerebral cortex, thalamus,
Sakaguchi and Tawata 10.3389/fendo.2024.1343759
Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org10
and hippocampus ( 256, 257). This function persists from the
earliest stages of brain development to maturity. Androgens show
similar functions or work in consort with estrogen, but their
importance in early neural development and cognitive
modulation seems to be secondary, as direct pharmacological
evidence of the effects of developmental androgen alteration is
limited. Such reasoning resolves the discrepancy, especially in
affected males, where researchers have largely failed to ﬁnd an
increase in androgen markers prenatally or postnatally (133, 255).
One epidemiological support for the early idea that an
abnormal increase in steroidogenesis causes ASC comes from the
fact that peripubertal (15–19 years) individuals with ASC have a
higher incidence of genital/ovarian cancer. Mothers of individuals
with ASC also frequently exper ience sex hormone-responsive
cancers ( 258). The increased vulnerability to disease, likely
derived from the abundance of sex steroids, is more evident in
female ASC than that in male ASC cases. Some ASC-related genes,
such asFOXP1 and copy number variation, are known to suppress
tumors or cancer if they are intact, requiring further examination to
explore how such a genetic background interacts with steroid excess
contributing to cancer risk.
2.2 Extreme success in“masculine”
artistic-academic ﬁelds inversely correlate
with masculinity indices among men
2.2.1 Connection between developmental
disorders, savant/gifted, and atypical
sexual differentiation
Approximately 50% of individuals with savant ability are from
the ASC population (259), and the emerging ratio of sex differences is
approximately three men to one woman (260). Savant ability is
independent of total IQ scores. In the general population,prodigious
savants who show distinguished talents that are difﬁcult to interpret
with common sense, are very rare, with only approximately 50
individuals worldwide. If the deﬁnition is expanded to talented
savants who show some distinguished abilities relative to other
domains of talent of their own, the prevalence among the ASC
population is estimated to be from 28.5% (260) to 42% (261)o rn e a r l y
50% (262). In the early stages of academic notice, savant art was
considered as an emotionless repetition of the gross amount of
memory without original creativity. This notion was later corrected;
savant art has its own originality, and is considered a model of the
root of creativity (262, 263).
In contrast, gifted individuals are deﬁned as “those who show
exquisite talents in one or severalﬁelds (logical thinking, learning
ability, etc.), or those who show abilities of top 10 scores of a
population (264).” The greater the extraordinary ability, the greater
tends to be the developmental unevenness across cognitive domains
and social maladaptation. The behavioral output of gifted
individuals is often difﬁcult to distinguish from or co-exists with
ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ASC, schizophrenia, and
avoidant personality disorders (155). Whether an individual is
judged as savant or gifted is largely inﬂuenced by the academic
background of the report.
Using the Bayesian explanation of the free energy principle,
hypopriors (having fewer internal models prior to processing
stimuli) can explain hypersensitivity to sensory input, immunity
to being distracted by contextual information (better at copying
impossible ﬁgures), and incompetency in communication
dependent on summarized inference (265)( Figure 1). Therefore,
the EPF model in combination with the free energy principle does
not require supposing a lack of empathic motivation in theﬁrst
place, but suggests that the characteristics of perceptual processing
are the basis of both unevenness in the strength of cognitive
domains and communication inaptness.
The main premise of the EBM theory is that higher androgen
action on the prenatal brain increases ASC traits between and
within sexes. However, ASC traits are more observable among
hypoandrogenism conditions, contrary to expectations, except for
females with PCOS and offspring of mothers with PCOS (133). The
effects of maternal PCOS on offspring are under debate, with
complications from epigenetic effects, genetic inheritance, insulin
resistance (266, 267), and the effects of metformin administration
on mothers (268). Additionally, Baron-Cohen et al. admit that MRI
voxel-based morphological ASC-TD brain differences within sex are
not parallel between sexes, and the difference within men is
especially discordant with TD sex differences ( 13). They also
reported in adults, blood serum biomarkers, such as high LH and
free androgen index could dist inguish between women with
Asperger’s syndrome and controls; however, the same marker set
did not have discrimination power for men (135).
The DMN is the functional connection of brain areas involved
in self-referential mind wandering, which becomes active when a
person is not focused on perform ing tasks. Researchers have
become increasingly interested in the DMN because of its ability
to discriminate atypical cognitive statuses. Baron-Cohen et al.
compared the connectivity strength of the DMN between sexes in
TD and within sexes across ASC and TD groups. They reported that
TD males and individuals with ASD had weaker connectivity in the
DMN (269). In contrast, in an analysis of whole-brain connectivity
without presupposed theories, the connectivity between social brain
areas (fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal
cortex, insula, and posterior cingulate cortex) and other areas was
stronger in female ASC (male-like), but weaker in male ASC
(female-like) ( 270). They argued that this result supports the
atypical sexual differentiation theory of ASC genesis instead of the
EMB theory.
Do gifted individuals tend to be hypermasculine or gender
neutral? Several studies support the latter tendency. Theﬁelds of
interest and strengths of gifted individuals tended to be gender-
neutral instead of following stereotyped gender categories (155,
271). Their gender identities also tend to be neutral (272). Another
survey showed that neutral gender identity was more evident
among gifted women than in men ( 273). Additionally, more
students in gifted classes recognized themselves as sexual
minorities than their non-gifted counterparts (274).

3 Expectation mismatch on perceptual
input will lead to uneven development
of perceptual processing and difﬁculty
in information integration
3.1 Oversensitive perceptual input as the
basis of weak central coherence, extreme
systemizing, and
communication deﬁciency
3.1.1 Hyperacuity and overexcitability over
sensory input likely start at early development
Widely observed cognitive underpinnings among ASC and
other NDDs are the dominance of primary and local sensory
information processing, the weakness of abstracting from that
information, and having a global view. They also have difﬁculties
combining information of different modalities over time. The
peculiarities of vision perception have been extensively studied.
This can lead to excellence in information processing in certain
domains, such as in savants, and at the same time, difﬁculties in
real-time responses need ed for communication ( 201, 275).
Perceptual distinctiveness observable daily is the inﬂation or
suppression of senses in response to external stimuli (149, 276), a
characteristic shared by the gifted (277). The high excitability of
neurons because of insuf ﬁcient suppression by GABA, and
increased glutamine concentrations are considered physiological
factors (201).
Brain development starts from lower-level sensory areas;
subsequently, integration functions in the association areas and
prefrontal lobes develop over a long period. The peculiarities of
developmental trajectory in individuals with ASC are observable
immediately after birth; their brain size is larger than that of TD
individuals in the early stages of life (278), especially in the visual
cortex and primary sensory areas, followed by the inferior temporal
cortex (38)( Figure 1). Dominance of local visual processing seems
to start in infancy (279), indicating that peculiarity in perception
begins at the earliest development of primary sensory receptive
ﬁelds, inducing the overdevelopment of certain perception-oriented
information processing neural network traits, and neural
excitability (280). Hypersensitivity of receptiveﬁelds and sensory
processing in ASC individuals seems to be underlined by the
peculiar density in neural cell packing; in ASC postmortem brains
from infancy to young adults, mini-columns in the cerebral cortex
were narrower in Brodmann area 3 (primary sensory area), 4
(primary motor area), 9 (prefrontal association area), 17 (V1), 21
(temporal visual association area), and 22 (temporal auditory area)
(202, 281). In other specimens, ASC did not differ in cell structure in
area V1 (Brodmann area 17), and narrowing of the mini-columns
was most prominent in the ventral and orbitofrontal prefrontal
lobes (282).
The function of estradiol on ERb seems to be critical for early
neural/glial distribution and closing the immature phase shifting to
stimuli-dependent synapse modi ﬁcation (Figure 2). The time
phases and pathways of neural maturation differ across
perception modalities. In embryonic stem cell lines in which
SHANK3 was mutated into the ASC type, olfactory placodal
neurons ﬁrst emerged at the earliest stage of neurogenesis, and
then developed smaller cell bodies and more and longer neurites
compared to those in controls. These shifts were not observed in
cortical neurons, except for the shortening of neurites (283). Similar
changes were observed in the auditory areas, but in the opposite
direction, with a wider interval between mini-columns compared to
that in controls in the primary auditory and associationﬁelds. This
difference was particularly signiﬁcant in the primary auditoryﬁeld
in younger populations (284).
As stated previously, hyperacuity in the visual senses appears to
be underlined by differences in neural cell structures. Notable
characteristics of individuals with ASC include larger numbers of
near-distance neural connections ( 285), a larger proportion of
intra-hemispheric in contras t to inter-hemispheric neural
connections, an inclination to excitation in the neural E/I balance,
and heterogeneity of development between brain areas. The
incoherence of processing and communication speed across
modalities makes it difﬁcult to combine information in real-time,
resulting in the creation of unique information-processing networks
that detour neurotypical processing in language areas, which may
manifest as a unique brain torque (200) or non-right-handedness
(286) in parts of the population.
3.1.2 Visual imagery and synesthesia as the bases
of savant ability
Typically appearing cognitive skills in savants are categorized as
follows: 1) calendar calculation; 2) music; 3) art; 4) mathematical
and number skills; 5) mechanical or spatial skills; and 6)“other
obscure skills” which include exceptional multilingualism, sensory
discrimination abilities, synesthesia, and knowledge in speciﬁc ﬁelds
(121, 287). For ASC individuals, Temple Grandin grouped
characteristic cognitive styles into the following: 1) visual
thinkers; 2) music and math thinkers (pattern thinkers); and 3)
verbal logic thinkers (288). Distinct cognitive strategies observable
in high-functional ASC, savants, and gifted are calculation,
architecture, and art creation by manipulating vivid visual
imagery (68, 108–113). Enhanced pattern detection is likely to
develop through exceptional sensory acuity and veridical mapping
across isomorphic structures (289).
Individuals with ASC tend to preferentially use the visual
cortex, in contrast to neurotypicals who use the prefrontal cortex
to solve visuospatial tasks, s uch as mental rotation, under
experimental conditions ( 93, 94) .F u r t h e r m o r e ,e v e ni nn o n -
spatial tasks, such as the N-back working memory task which is
typically processed verbally in neurotypicals, ASCs tend to use the
right hemisphere and posterior cerebral regions, including the
inferior temporal area and occipital lobe, indicating that they
solve tasks visually ( 95). Inferior temporal gyrus comprises
“what” ventral pathway in visual processing and responsible for
object imageryhandling color, texture, and patterns. The area stores
single cells which index long-term memory, connecting semantic
signi ﬁcance to the images, and also processes letters and
manipulates numbers. Among individuals with ASC, visual
imagery itself, focus on detail, and low communication ability
were not related to savant abilities; however, highspatial mental

Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org12
imagery predicted a larger number of savant abilities (121). Spatial
imagery is processed in the dorsal visual pathway leading to the
occipito-parietal regions.
Synesthesia is another key to understanding savant phenomena
through atypical sensory processing. In synesthesia, the senses of
the different modalities are joi ntly perceived. Synesthesia is
relatively common in ASC populations and closely associated
with the emergence of savantism (290). Mental imagery ability is
closely associated with sequence-space synesthesia, leading to
savant abilities, such as calendar calculation ( 114, 115). The
inferior temporal cortex and areas adjacent to the fusiform gyrus
are responsible for grapheme-color synesthesia (291). In contrast, a
survey of a larger population reported that the emergence of
synesthesia was independent of the strength of visual imagery,
and that individuals with weak visual imagery could possess
synesthesia (292). Connectivity in the superior parietal or frontal
cortex is responsible for the synesthesia irrespective of its subtype
(291). Absolute pitch recognition is an aspect of veridical mapping
and sound-related synesthesia that sometimes hinders language
recognition, which requires the abstraction of information from
similar phoneme patterns (289, 293).
In summary, the endophenotype connecting the cognitive
characteristics commonly observed among ASC and other NDDs,
savant and gifted individuals is heightened sensory sensitivity (121).
The overdeveloped cortical parts in ASC high-risk infants overlap to
those in male-to-female transge nder individuals experiencing
signiﬁcant body dysphoria (transsexuals), in contrast to their
cisgender counterparts in the postcentral gyrus (primary sensory
area), left inferior temporal gy rus, and right lingual gyrus,
respectively ( 38, 39). The other overdeveloped regions in the
frontal and parietal occipital regions are located adjacent to each
other (Figure 1). Lingual gyrus is responsible for visual imagery and
creative thinking, in combination with other occipito-temporal-
parietal complex areas ( 294). Another indicator that possibly
reﬂects the early overdevelopment of sensory processing network
is eidetic memory and memories from the early stages of life.
Individuals with ASC have memories from an earlier age, not in
an episodic form, but with sensory details (295).
3.1.3 Untypical olfactory sensitivity
Olfactory sensitivity is another cognitive domain in which
individuals with ASD do not simply exaggerate their TD male
traits. Among TD individuals, olfactory sensitivity is superior in
females, and some individuals with ASC individuals are obsessed
with smell stimuli (68). Among the sensory symptoms, atypical
sensitivity to taste and smell is the most prominent in ASC, and is a
strong predictor of social deﬁcits (72). Experimentally, some studies
supported heightened sensitivity in trace smell perception threshold
tasks in ASC (69), while others did notﬁnd differences from TDs
(296, 297) or found blunter olfactory sensitivity (hypotonia) (73)
and lower activity in the olfactory cortex (74), leaving the argument
inconclusive (298).
In TDs, arousal in the autonomous nervous system is increased
by the snifﬁng of human sweat during fear, but the response of
ASCs was the opposite ( 299). The authors argued that social
dysosmia (the inability to disc riminate socially relevant
chemosensory signals) is a causal factor in ASC ’si n c o r r e c t
reading of others ’ emotions (298). Experiments using general
odorant substances have shown that ASCs are rather impaired in
the discrimination ability of odorants, and that the evaluation of
smell stimuli is atypical (72, 75, 76).
In any standardized olfactory perception task to identify
sensitivity threshold, discrimination ability, and identiﬁcation with
known stimuli, TD females outperform TD males, and the
difference is most evident atthe threshold (62), culminating in the
ovulatory period when estrogen and androgen concentrations are
the highest (67). In contrast, hyperosmia in women (strong sense of
smell) is associated with morning sickness, but the emergence of
morning sickness does not coincide withﬂuctuation of sex steroids,
but with an increase in human chorionic gonadotropin ( 66).
Pregnant women with morning sickness perceive the smell of
food to be unpleasant. This does not necessarily correspond to a
lowered threshold of olfactory senses; discrimination ability is
undermined for some odorant stimuli ( 71). Unusual olfactory
perception in ASC seems to be similar, reﬂecting a hyperreaction
to perceived stimuli, but not n ecessarily the manifestation of
heightened sensitivity (76).
Notable changes in the olfactory sensitivity have been observed
in patients with epileptic seizures. In some cases, olfactory
hypersensitivity and phantom odors are perceived as precursors
or aftereffects of epilepsy (70). Epilepsy is found in 4–46% of
individuals with ASC, and is also common in syndromes that
contribute to ASC. An imbalance between excitatory and
inhibitory neural activity is thought to be a common mechanism,
and excessive estradiol activity in the brain during the critical period
is a risk factor for epilepsy (192). Synesthesia sometimes emerges
after epilepsy, drug intake, or brain trauma which cause the
shufﬂing of neural sensory mapping in cortical layer V. Brain
trauma converts neural environments into immature patterns,
resulting in atypical neural cir cuitry in adults. Excitation of
pyramidal neurons with the serotonin receptor, 5-HT2A, induces
destabilization of the thalamus, possibly resulting in reinnervation
with neural inputs from different modalities (300). Researchers have
suggested similarities between hyperosmia, phantom odor, and
synesthesia (301). Weakened inhibition from the frontal lobe due
to a lesion in the right inferior parietal lobule is suggested as a
trigger of hyperosmia (302).
3.2 Savants/gifted individuals excel in visual
imagery processing, but are poor in
spatial memory
3.2.1 Cognitive and neurological proﬁles of
individuals with SCA in reference to ASC
Brain morphology and cognitive characteristics in SCAs overlap
with those in ASC. In studies on KS, the total cerebral volume was
reduced, but the gray matter volume in the parieto-occipital and
sensorimotor cortices were signiﬁcantly increased (16, 303)o ra t
least preserved (304), whereas the inferior frontal and temporal
areas, especially in the dominant hemisphere, were reduced. A
reduction in the frontal lobe corresponds to attenuated executive
Sakaguchi and Tawata 10.3389/fendo.2024.1343759
Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org13
function, which is mostly evident in impaired mentalﬂexibility (61).
In the general male population w ith hypogonadism, there is
evidence of an association between androgen de ﬁciency and
compromised executive function (151).
Although androgen therapy in adult KS is ineffective in
improving mental ﬂexibility, a mouse model suggested a
combined negative effect of the number of X chromosomes and
gonadectomy on the cognitive domain (77). Skews in cognitive
domains (performance IQ>verbal IQ) overlap with other SCAs,
except for Turner syndrome (karyotype XO) (53, 305). The ASC-
like tendency was more severe in other SCA (XYY and XXYY) (58,
129) than in KS. Therefore, the general assumption is that the
duplication of sex chromosomes, rather than sex steroid action
mainly affects cognitive atypicality in SCAs (306). However, as
suggested in Section 2.1.1, even XYY individuals which are generally
categorized to possess typical steroid levels share some phenotypes
suggestive of disruption of the steroid metabolism-feedback
pathway, similar to other syndromes with hypogonadism.
Chromosome-manipulated mouse models also suggest that the
effect of chromosome number on cognitive differences is
negligible, except when ch oosing same-sex conspeci ﬁcs for
mating, but is moderated by the organizational effect of sex
steroids ( 307 ). A more comprehensive view is that the
activational function of steroids is altered in individuals with
SCA, as reported in animal models (308) and humans, probably
through the alteration of organizational pathways. For example, the
effect of CAG repeat on AR might be inverted in naturally
hypogonadal populations, such as KS and female populations; in
TD women, a longer CAG repeat, implying less active AR receptors,
is associated with a higher circulating androgen concentration
which is typically considered to be the marker of stronger
masculinization (99).
Individuals with Turner syndrome are females with estrogen
deﬁciency, characterized by superior verbal and poor visuospatial
abilities (53). This pattern appears to be in contrast with KS and
XYY, supporting the notion that sex chromosome allocation is
crucial for cognitive deﬁciency and strength patterns. However,
examination of task scores shows that they are more alike than the
ﬁrst look; impaired visual memory and visual attention are also
observed in NDD with performance IQ strength, such as in
individuals with ASC without superior IQ (82–84) or at older age
(85). Visual memory corresponds to drawing complex ﬁgures
through recall, using such as the Rey-Osterrieth complexﬁgure
test as a typical measuring tool . Androgen supplementation
improves the scores in female-to-male transgender individuals
experiencing signiﬁcant body dysphoria (transsexuals) (78), and
estradiol improves the scores in hypogonadal males (79), but is
ineffective in women with Turner syndrome ( 86). In Turner
syndrome, superior verbal ability is limited to certain domains,
such as word knowledge, receptive/expressive abilities, verbal
memory, coemerging with lower verbalﬂuency, articulation, and
social skills. The prevalen ce rates of ASC, ADHD, and
schizophrenia are greatly increased compared to those in TD
women. Such overlaps of cognitive characteristics with KS and
XYY suggest Turner syndrome ’s similarity to ASC with
hypergraphia (language production-strong subtype) (86).
A lack of optimal estrogen supply through critical periods
throughout life leads to the suppression of verbalﬂuency, verbal
memory, and executive function, and increases the risk of
schizophrenia, ASC, ADHD, general anxiety disorder, and
depression (222). Such cognitive proﬁles correspond to KS, XYY,
and Turner syndromes. The general cognitive bene ﬁts of
testosterone supplementation in KS ( 124 ) and general
hypogonadal men (88, 125) are an increase in verbalﬂuency, but
not in visuospatial ability. In a comparison between testosterone
and DHT supplementation in hypogonadal men, only DHT was
effective in improving spatial memory (route and spatial array
learning tests), whereas testos terone improved verbal memory
(story recall), suggesting that the latter effect occurs after
conversion to estradiol (88).
Decreased brain volume in KS is known to occur in the
hippocampus, insula, striatum, and amygdala ( 16). However,
some studies did notﬁnd a reduction in the hippocampus (304).
Spatial memories of complexﬁgures and places can be attributed to
the hippocampus. The hippocampus is abundant in both AR and
ERb (290 ), and estrogen de ﬁciency impairs hippocampal
development. In female mice, ER b-KO causes a decrease in
visuospatial learning ability (90). In KS, oral supplementation of
the androgen, oxandrolone, in boys of 4–12 years was effective in
increasing hippocampal volume to the TD range (80). The volume
of the hippocampus positively correlated with scores on the Recall
of Designs subtest of the Differential Ability Scale ( 81).
Oxandrolone is a non-aromatizable androgen, but sometimes
causes gynecomastia through an unknown loop. Sex steroid
administration in gonadectomized male rats has revealed that the
cognitive-enhancing effect of androgen on the hippocampus is at
least partly through its action on ERb (89).
A comprehensive review of the effect of estrogen on androgen-
deprived males showed that estradiol treatment improved visual/
verbal memory and behavioral inhibition (79). It should be noted
that in the comparison of visuospatial tasks between animal models
and humans, the latter depends on the manipulation of visual
images, whereas the former depends on localization in actual
spatial environments.
3.2.2 Effect of steroid hormones across different
components of visuospatial abilities
The EBM theory gives the impression that visuospatial abilities,
such as mental rotation, are derived from higher androgen levels,
and that female-favored verbal abilities are more facilitated by an
increase in estrogen levels. Although previous reports have
supported these ideas, recentﬁndings have refuted such a simple
relationship. The most robust sex differences in cognitive ability
have been found in mental rotations using two-dimensionally
depicted polygons (92). Lesbians and women with CAH exposed
to high levels of androgens during fetal life have higher scores for
mental rotation among women, whereas men with CAH have lower
scores than typical men (96). Two explanations are possible for the
latter association: androgen negative feedback may be in effect,
resulting in lower androgen action and visuospatial ability, or the
highly androgenic environment in the early male developmental
period reduces the capacity for mental rotation. Animal models
Sakaguchi and Tawata 10.3389/fendo.2024.1343759
Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org14
have also shown inconsistent results regarding the effects of CAH
on males, and it cannot be determined which model is more
appropriate ( 104). Additionally, in a meta-analysis of CAH
studies, 2D:4D digit ratio was found to be an ineffective predictor
of spatial ability (96).
A notable ﬁnding was that although boys with CAH were
masculinized in hobby choice compared to their siblings, their
spatial and mechanical abilities were lower (104), suggesting that
higher prenatal androgen levels compromised their spatial and
mechanical abilities. Boys with androgen excess disorders
(Familial male precocious pub erty) did not show an ability
difference in a virtual water maze task compared to controls
(309). A study of adult TD males found that mental rotation and
spatial visualization scores (paper folding and MacQuarrie blocks)
were negatively correlated with salivary T levels, whereas shorter
AR CAG repeat polymorphisms (stronger androgen action) were
associated with higher scores on spatial visualization tasks (97).
Visuospatial abilities, such asmental rotation, may be best in
populations with testosterone levels intermediate between those of
women and men (99, 100). A longitudinal investigation of cycle
effects for eight weeks reported a quadratic association between
salivary T and mental rotation scores within each sex (101). Among
boys, gifted individuals had superior mental rotation ability, and
higher scores were associated with lower prenatal androgen action,
as suggested by longer AR CAG repeat lengths and larger 2D:4D
ratios ( 215). Contradictory to this picture is a report that
heterosexual and gay men without childhood gender
nonconformity scored better in mental rotation than those with
childhood gender nonconformity (102).
Although various reports have found no association between
circulating androgen levels ( 103, 239, 310–312)o ra n d r o g e n
administration and visuospatial ability, particularly among men
(313), a robust relationship has been reported in which high
circulating estrogen levels suppress mental rotational capacity.
The mental rotation scores of naturally cycling women increase
during periods of low estrogen concentration (314), correlating
negatively with saliva ry estradiol levels ( 105). In men, lower
estrogen concentrations were associated with higher mental
rotation scores (103).
In contrast, spatial memory, which uses visuospatial working
memory to remember where things are located, is better in women,
and higher estrogen levels are more advantageous. Androgen-
suppressed, TD men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy
for prostate cancer, and long-term abusers of exogenous
androgens have reduced visuospatial working memory ( 91),
which can be caused by estrogen deﬁciency.
3.2.3 Similarity of visual processing
endophenotypes of dyslexia to ASC and savant/
gifted in reference to KS
The most robust and prevalent cognitive proﬁle of KS is a
slightly inferior language ability, withdyslexia occurring in 50–70%
of cases (52, 123); auditory processing and verbal memory are the
weakest components ( 315). The cognitive characteristics of
individuals with dyslexia have similarity with those of savants and
gifted. A person may be gifted in mathematics, but has difﬁculty
with sequential calculations and memorizing formulas (316). They
also excel in various artistic activities and are superior at extracting
patterns from visual noise (a measure of object imagery). Art
students showed a higher rate of dyslexia (106, 122) and weaker
speech perception skills.
In dyslexic brains, hypoactivation of the left occipital-temporal
region during language tasks (317) and underdevelopment of the
left frontal gyrus have been observed, especially among populations
that use logographic letters, such as Chinese (318). Brains of KS
have been reported to show a similar lack of dominance when
processing language tasks (319, 320), although not all (321).
T h et o t a lb r a i nv o l u m ei nK Si ss m a l l e rt h a nt h a ti nT D(322),
with smaller volumes in the insula, frontal and temporal lobes, and
subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, hippocampus (16, 51, 94,
95), and cerebellum (see Section 3.2.1). In contrast, the sensorimotor
and parietal-occipital areas are enlarged, and the white matter volumes
of the left cuneus and precuneus are the most robust, and extending to
the inferior parietal regions in some cases (152, 303, 323). The inferior
parietal lobule, which includes the angular gyrus (Brodmann area 39),
is important for problem-solving through visual imagery, and is
enlarged in mathematicians (107) and artists, especially in the non-
dominant hemisphere (106). This region is responsible for connecting
bodily sensations to spatial self-images. Stimulation of the angular
gyrus induces out-of-body sensations, as is often observed in ASC,
schizophrenia, and dissociative disorders (324).
It has been assumed that the blockage of language development
and general intelligence might be complemented by other routes of
information processing and outlets, as reported in the early cases of
savants excelling in dancing or music (183). Well-known examples
of paradoxical functional facilitation include acquired damage to
the left hemisphere, resulting in savant-like abilities, including
temporal lobe epilepsy, stroke in the dominant hemisphere, and
frontotemporal dementia (287). It has been implied that damage to
the frontal lobes enhances the function of the sensory areas in the
posterior part of the brain (325
).
A decrease inﬁne motor skills and visual-motor integration is
also manifested in KS and XYY (53), and is ameliorated by androgen
supplementation (142), which is probably also associated with
improvements in verbalﬂuency. As observed in ASC, individuals
with KS are weak at working memory (152), and they make more
errors when presented with visual patterns that are difﬁcult to
discriminate, especially when presented sequentially (87). These
phenotypes underlie the difﬁculties in language manipulation.
Autism spectrum conditions and predisposing syndromes of ASC
often include a history of epilepsy (ASC: 4–46%, KS: 5–17%). Epileptic
seizures alter neurotransmitter efﬁciency; however, only a few cases of
acquired savants are directly attributable to epileptic seizures (325).
Instead, endophenotypes that induce ASC, savant, or gifted
individuals, in addition to syndromes with chromosomal
abnormalities (326) and hypogonadism, should be considered to
share a predisposition common to epilepsy. Atrophy of various
brain regions has been observed in individuals with a long history
of epilepsy (327). Epilepsy is caused by neuronal hyperexcitation, and
astrocytic abnormalities are among its main factors. Sex steroid
concentrations affect the severity and frequency of epileptic seizures.
Notably, an overdose of estrogen aggravates neural overexcitation
Sakaguchi and Tawata 10.3389/fendo.2024.1343759
Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org15
(328). Additionally, valproic acid, a major antiepileptic drug whose
intake by the mother induces ASC in the fetus, disrupts the fetal HPG
axis and causes autoimmune diseases in males (329).
3.3 High sensitivity to social cues, shyness,
and impulsivity
3.3.1 Shyness and high social anxiety, weaker
interoception network, and alexithymia lead to
insufﬁcient communication skills
Contrary to the impression tha t individuals with autistic
tendency are “mind-blind” and inattentive to social cues, the
narrative of affected individuals support the view that they shut
down the ﬂow of social information, because they are afraid of
getting panicked by emotional disturbance caused by involvement
with others and their gazes (330). Individuals with KS (128) and at
least subsets of ASC (331, 332) show increased physiological arousal
in response to social cues, such as the human eye and mouth, but
less activation of the amygdala and insula (333). It is difﬁcult for
them to assess and label affective responses, that underlies
alexithymia (128). This makes them easily panicked by social
stimuli; thus, they avoid them.
When individuals perceive their own emotions, information
from the peripheral nerves inside the body, including visceral
sensations such as heartbeat and temperature, are input via the
insular cortex to the cingulate gyrus or the ventral medial frontal
cortex. Conscious access to in ternal receptive sensation
(interoception) is carried by th e anterior insula and anterior
cingulate gyrus, and is central to simulating the emotional states
of others (143), thereby enabling to empathize with others.
Alexithymia does not necessarily mean that affected individuals lack
an interoceptive sense or emotion; however, it makes it more difﬁcult to
explicitly identify emotions and communicate one’sf e e l i n g st oo t h e r s ,
thereby reducing the capacity to empathize with others (28, 143, 332).
The insular cortex and cingulate gyrus are atrophied in KS (334), which
corresponds to difﬁculty in social interaction and language development.
Insular volume in ASC is not different from that in TD, whereas
hypoactivation in emotional empathytask corresponds to higher levels
of alexithymia (36). For KS (333)a n dA S C(36), the identiﬁcation of
stimuli with negative emotional valence is difﬁcult or hypoactivates
brain areas for processing emotions, which might also correspond to a
reduction in amygdala volume. To complicate the interpretation, the
insula in ASC shows hyperactivati o ni nd i f f e r e n tt y p e so ft a s k s .
The most robust cognitive pro ﬁles in KS are shyness,
unassertiveness, withdrawal, impulsiveness, and anxiousness (306).
That is similar to that of ASC (335). Androgen replacement therapy
for KS improves verbal IQ, and evidence suggests that this is largely
due to reduced social anxiety (208). The reasoning is opposite to
general human population, whose right anterior insula is overactivated
in generalized anxiety disorders and in cases with high neuroticism,
and these individuals showhigh interoceptive sensitivity (147).
In contrast to the fear of evolutionarily relevant stimuli, which is
adaptive, anxiety is a high-vigilance response to undeﬁned threats.
Oxytocin acts to reduce anxiety in humans and animals, which
helps to discriminate between actual danger and safety (336), and
the candidate for its major activation site is bed nucleus stria
terminalis (220, 337, 338). In TD participants, intranasal oxytocin
administration during imaging social embarrassment situation
experienced by self or others reduced physiological arousal and
activation in the right amygdala and insula, especially among
participants with high trait anxiety. This also increases the
empathic ratings of others ’ embarrassment and their own
embarrassment, supporting the idea that attenuation of
maladaptive vigilance to social stimuli attenuates alexithymia and
helps empathy with others (144). Although it is debatable how
circulating oxytocin levels correspond to its activity in the brain,
those with high concentrations of salivary oxytocin experience
stronger body ownership during the rubber hand illusion,
suggesting that oxytocin facilitates to joint top-down model of
self and interoceptive awareness of one’s own body (29, 30).
Oxytocin receptors exist in the insula, but their numbers are not
large, and their expression corresponding to social behaviors is
more apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala (339,
340). With regard to control by sex steroids, although ERs are
relatively sparse in the insula, estrogen directly facilitates
descending sympathoexcitatory information transfer by affecting
GABAergic neurotransmission (145). In the majority of oxytocin
receptors in the brain, such as in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN),
the receptors are co-expressed with ERb and facilitated by estrogen
action (220). Additionally, the dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5
-androstane-3,17 -diol (3 -diol), also activates the oxytocin
promoter through action on ERb (221). This could explain the
pathway by which androgen supplementation in KS reduces anxiety
and improves verbal ability.
3.3.2 Steroid deﬁciency decreases impulsive
action, but increases impulsive choice
Impulsivity and aggression are generally considered greater in
males and male prevalent NDD. Androgens are known to function
in the limbic system to regulate reproductive function, aggressive
behavior, and homeostasis. Speciﬁcally, AR is expressed in the brain
reward system, which includes the mesocorticolimbic ventral
tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, as well as the medial
prefrontal cortex, in male and female rodents, non-human
primates, and humans. Steroid hormone concentrations in the
mesocorticolimbic system are more than double those in the
circulatory system, and are still present six weeks after
gonadectomy, indicating an important role for local androgen
synthesis in the central nervous system (341). Androgens enhance
perseverance toward activities for greater rewards and risk-oriented
behaviors. Testosterone enhan ces tolerance to large uncertain
rewards. In contrast, the predominant personalities of KS and
ASC are shyness, social withdrawal, and clumsiness, and their
impulsivity is the opposite of that of bold risk seekers.
Several theories have attempted to dissect the conceptualization
of impulsivity. Sensation seeking by Zuckerman concerns the
inclination toward reckless beha vior to increase reproductive
chances, and is higher in males (157), culminating in adolescence,
and then decrease (154). The sensation-seeking behavioral list
matches “masculine” risk-seeking behavior, and is suggested to be
more strongly connected to reward processing than impulsivity
Sakaguchi and Tawata 10.3389/fendo.2024.1343759
Frontiers inEndocrinology frontiersin.org16
(158). In contrast, impulsivity refers to a lack of self-control or
deﬁciencies in response to inhibition. Impulsivity linearly decreases
with age in the general population from approximately 10 years of
age (154). Deﬁcits in inhibitory executive function are commonly
observed in patients with KS, ASC, ADHD, and gifted individuals.
Typically developed males undergoing androgen deprivation
therapy experience emotional lability and impulsivity (low
inhibition) (156); a decrease in volume and neural activity in the
prefrontal cortex likely underlies this effect (153).
In the experimental paradigm, impulsivity is measured separately
using impulsive actionand impulsive choicetasks (342). Both link to
the dopamine system; impulsive action is assessed with stop signal
and go/no-go tasks, which measure the reaction time that subjects
must respond to‘go’stimuli, while inhibiting responses to occasional
no-go/stop signals. In animal models, impulsive action is stronger in
males (159) and impulsive action in females is positively correlated
with circulating estradiol levels (160).
In contrast, impulsive choice concerns delay discounting,
corresponding to a skew toward choosing an immediate small
reward, in contrast to a delayed or uncertain larger reward. This is
a model of ADHD and addiction, in which impulsive choices are
stronger in females. This type of disinhibition is a model of
impulsivity observed in syndromes with hypogonadism and male-
prevalent NDD, and is attenuated by sex steroids. In laboratory
animals, orchiectomy increases, and supraphysiological testosterone
administration decreases impulsive choice in males (161). Although
ovariectomy and estrous cycle do not affect the performance in
female animals, women show a decrease of“now” bias in follicular
phase, indicating dopamine signaling facilitated by estradiol rise,
which speeds up subjective time perception and decrease impulsivity
(164). In other words, the results suggest that estradiol deﬁciency
affects frontoparietal circuits supporting working memory, and
makes the subject feel that the passage of time is slower, combined
with the effect on the hippocampus that is linked to discounting
behavior, leading to impatient decision-making.
The developmental theory of ADHD also suggests that insufﬁcient
estradiol at the developmental stage leads to a hypofunctioning
mesolimbic dopamine system and inef ﬁcient reinforcement,
inducing the affected person to seek stronger stimulation (162). The
authors suggested that suboptimal estrogen and dopamine activity
decreases the opening time of NMDA receptors and hinders the
development of association and behavioral learning.
4 Mismatch between top-down
expectation and bottom-up
perceptive input leads to
unstable identity
4.1 Blockade of interoception leads to
hallucination and diffusion of
self-boundaries
The similarity between reports of unusual sensory/spiritual
experiences and visual thinking of savant-gifted individuals was
noted early in Gastaut–Geschwind syndrome (112, 116, 117). The
inclination toward mysticism and excessive religiosity, which have
often been seen in great individuals with special talents, are also
characteristic of temporal/frontal lobe epilepsy, and some have
suggested that these are features of ASC (68, 343–346). There is a
category named the “hard-to-explain, paranormal sensations ”
among savant abilities (287), and gifted children show a tendency
to have a precocious interest in self-transcendent questions and
report hard-to-explain experiences (347).
As described in 3.3.1, KS and ASC show atypical activities of the
insula and cingulate cortex, that joint internal perception
(interoception) and the top-down concept of self, and constituting
the Salience Network, which switches attention between executive
function and internal mind-wandering. A decrease in activity in
these regions has also been obs erved in individuals with
schizophrenia, with an increase inthe severity of hallucinations and
heightened functionalconnectivity between the DMN and the Central
Executive Network (37)(Figure 1). This implies that failure to switch to
the executive network while attending to external stimuli constitutes
the core mechanism that induces positive symptoms in schizophrenia
(30, 348). In a typical conscious state, the projection pathway of
interoceptive perception works independently of the neural pathways
from the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional coupling between
these factors using the hallucinogen, psilocybin, is a model of the
unique perceptual experiences of savant-gifted individuals (118–120).
Bioactive compounds which work as psychedelics, such as
serotonin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and
dimethyltryptamine (DMT), act on the serotonin receptor, 5-HT2A,
and mainly induce visual hallucinations and mystical feelings.
Cortical hyperactivation of 5-HT2A has been suggested to disrupt
the thalamic gating of sensory and cognitive information (349, 350).
Approximately one-third of the autistic population show 50–70%
increase in blood serotonin levels ( 351, 352), which is called
hyperserotonemia . Hyperserotonemia is more prevalent in the
prepubescent and male populat ions. The density of serotonin
transporters and 5-HT2 is decreased in adult ASC brains, especially
in the anterior cingulate cortex ( 353, 354), suggesting the
dysregulation of serotonin function. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors work on subsets of individuals with ASC to ameliorate
adverse behaviors (352). Serotonin dysregulation is also observed in
individuals with FXS (355). A delay in GABA shift disturbs the shift
from serotonergic to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 2).
While individuals with schizophrenia experience
depersonalization feeling and the sense of being manipulated by
others, ASC has the sensory peculiarity as “difﬁculty in
understanding the boundaries between self and others” (149). The
central area that generates the subjective awareness of“self” as a
reference to the surrounding environment is the cortical
mediomedial structure within the DMN, which is active during
self-resuming mind wandering (148). Activity in the DMN (medial
prefrontal cortex, anterior/medial cingulate, and inferior parietal
lobule), while performing self-referential tasks was consistently
lower in the ASC in various experimental paradigms, suggesting
that the highest-order self-concept is difﬁcult to form (150).
The Bayesian brain model based on the free energy principle
suggests that disruption of the interoception/Salience Network

results in overfocusing on sensory input, and vice versa (28, 40, 41),
which manifests as sensory oversensitivity in various NDDs and
savants/gifted individuals (155). At the same time, the failure to
select and hand over that external information to internal
references, that form the concept of the world and self, results in
a conscious state similar to th at under the effect of sensory
deprivation and hallucinogens.
5 Discussion and future direction
In this paper, we reviewed the evidence supporting that ASC is
likely to co-occur with atypical sex differentiation, androgyny,
contrary to the prediction by the EMB. We discussed its
physiological factors and speci ﬁcity of perceptual processing
shared by savants and gifted individuals, with reference to the
conditions of various sex differentiation diversities.
Although different neurosteroids affect the regulation of GABA
shift (Figure 2) and subsequent behaviors in a unique manner (257),
estradiol and ERb seem to be among the main upstream factors that
control early neural cell development and distribution, and the
maturation timing of the developing brain. Theoretically, excess
estrogen during early development can delay this shift; however, the
observation of syndromic NDD cases and emergence patterns of
giftedness suggest that hypogonadism is a more prevalent cause of
such atypicality. Apparent hyperandrogenism can be explained by a
reﬂection of deﬁciency in estrogen regulation in animal studies and
human clinical cases. Combining the neurodevelopmental
hypothesis with the psychological EPF model, we suggest a new
paradigm to explain putative sex differences in strength/weakness in
cognitive traits. They might be inﬂuenced by the balance of steroid
actions, but not in a simple dichotomized manner, such as male-
favor/female-favor. As it is indicated by strong neurosteroid
function of estradiol, many apparent “male-favor ” cognitive
function is likely to be affected by estrogen or ERb action (Table 1).
Variations in the endophenotypes of NDDs can be explained by
alterations in shift timing and weight differences in each neural
factor, caused by genetic and environmental in ﬂuences. For
example, the same SCA states show diverse manifestations of
symptoms, ranging from none to ASC, schizophrenia, ADHD,
and their combination. The insufﬁcient functionality of androgen
and estrogen is known to hinder the typical function of ASC-related
genes, such asFOXP2 and SHANK3, which can lead to an ASC-like
phenotype. If only EPF is apparent, dif ﬁculties in language
processing and symptoms of dyslexia may be more pronounced.
If the imbalance between disinhibition of neural activity, control of
executive function, and attention switching is more pronounced, it
would lead to more ADHD-like features than ASC (356).
In humans, the critical period for the GABA shift extends
postnatally to the ﬁrst 12 months. The primary cause of shift
delays and various NDDs is considered to be the downregulation
of Potassium Chloride Cotransporter 2 (KCC2) ( 194). Steroid
regulation of the shift varies across brain areas and with the
subject ’s sex, requiring a thorough examination of each
endophenotype. Sex differences appear even before the peak of
androgen secretion from the testes, suggesting a genetic background
that affects endocrinological inﬂuences. Additionally, toxicological
analysis has shown that the primary critical period for ASC is very
early, starting from the time of neural tube closure to the end of
second trimester. This occurs slightly later in schizophrenia,
culminating between ﬁrst and second trimesters (357). The risk
periods extend to over three years of age for ADHD (357). Theﬁrst
and second trimesters are time windows for neurogenesis and
neuronal migration (358). If estrogen deﬁciencies are critical in
deriving NDD endophenotypes in hypogonadal individuals, as we
suggested, the primary factor to produce ASC-like symptoms would
be the insufﬁciency of ERb functions in neural cell development,
while each manifestation type will be later modi ﬁed by the
maturation shift in each neural system for individual timing.
The free energy principle suggests that in ASC, sensory
perception is too precise, while top-down inference is weak,
inducing a large Bayesian surprise at every time of perception,
requiring recalculation (41). In contrast, perceptive information is
less precise in schizophrenia, allowing inner models to go astray and
elude from correcting inferences (359). Further studies are required
to clarify when and how receptive precision diversiﬁes across these
two conditions.
The formation of an inner image and its extension to an atypical
sensation, such as a feeling of dissociation or synesthesia, is a cue for
understanding underlying mechan isms. Pharmacologically and
epidemiologically, serotonergic hyperactivation of 5-HT2A induces
a mismatch between top-down self-image inference and bottom-up
perception, transcending the boundaries of input source areas,
leading to deep hallucinations, including ego dissolution (119).
Thus, ASC and gifted individuals, not only those with
schizophrenia, tend to have un usual beliefs. Serotonergic
regulation is disrupted in ASC, while intracellular concentration
of 5-HT is high in many of them. The extended immature phase
before the GABA shift may be the cause of the atypicality of the
serotonergic pathway; however, its interaction with steroids and
oxytocin function is yet to be elucidated.
Recent progress in the therapeutic use of psychedelics is likely to
open the way for answering this question. A drug called‘ecstasy,’
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) promotes
afﬁliative feeling toward others. While MDMA does not bind to
the 5-HT
2 receptor, it induces the release of serotonin and oxytocin.
This drug is effective in alleviating anxiety in individuals with ASC
or post-traumatic stress disorder, opening a critical period for social
reward learning neural circuits for reinnervation (360). A rodent
study demonstrated that the critical period opening characteristic is
not limited to MDMA, but is shared with LSD and psylocibin,
which worked on 5-HT2 (361). Psychedelics with various activating
targets result in the modulation of extracellular matrix, such as
ﬁbronectin, receptors, and proteases, allowing the re-wiring of the
social reward learning system. The extent to which such after-
corrections have a durable effect in individuals with altered
endocrinological environments, such as hypogonadism, requires
further investigation.
