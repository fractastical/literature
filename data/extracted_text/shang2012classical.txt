A common property of many, though not all, massive real-world networks, including the World-
Wide Web, the Internet, and social networks, is that the connectivity of the various nodes follows
a scale-free distribution, P(k) ∝ k−α , with typical scaling exponent 2≤α ≤3. In this letter, we prove
that the Erd ˝os–R´enyi random graph with unbounded expected degrees has a scale-free behaviour
with scaling exponent 1/2 in a neighbourhood of expected degree ⟨k⟩. This interesting phenomenon
shows a discrepancy from the Erd˝os–R´enyi random graph with bounded expected degree, which has
a bell shaped connectivity distribution, peaking at ⟨k⟩, and decaying exponentially for large k.

The study of complex networks, albeit relatively
new, has spanned diverse domains including economy,
biology, engineering, physics, and even entire human
societies [1 – 3]. An intriguing line of work in the last
decade reveals that a common property of a num-
ber of massive real-life networks, such as the World-
Wide Web [4 – 6], the Internet [7], the call graph [8],
and social networks [9, 10], is that the connectivity
of the various nodes exhibits a scale-free distribution,
P(k) ∝ k−α . That is, the fraction of nodes of degree k
is proportional to k−α , where the scaling exponentα is
typically in the range 2≤α ≤3. On the other hand, the
classical random graph model of Erd˝os and R´enyi [11]
and Bollob ´as [12] with bounded expected degree ⟨k⟩
has a connectivity distribution which follows a Poisson
distribution peaked at ⟨k⟩and decaying exponentially
for k ≫⟨k⟩. This property of degrees is shared by some
other random graph models, see e.g. [13 – 15].
In addition to the discrepancy in their connectivity
distributions, the two canonical models of networks
show a quite different performance under error and
attack. For example, Albert et al. [16] studied the ro-
bustness of networks against two types of attacks: ran-
dom failure, where nodes are sequentially removed
with equal probability, and intentional attack, where
hubs (i.e., nodes with large degrees) are preferentially
removed. They showed that scale-free networks are
highly robust against the random failure in the sense
that almost all nodes have to be removed to disinte-
grate a scale-free network while are fragile to the inten-
tional attack in the sense that the network is destroyed
if a small fraction of hubs are removed. In contrast to
scale-free networks, the classical random graphs dis-
play a low degree of tolerance against both random
failure and intentional attack. Further results pertain-
ing to the discrepancy of robustness between these two
classes of networks can be found in [17 – 19]. A rig-
orous mathematical analysis of scale-free graphs, in-
cluding a coupling with classical random graphs, is
contained in [20, 21]. For a brief history and a gen-
eral overview of scale-free random graphs and re-
lated issues, we make a reference to the extensive sur-
vey [22].
In this letter, we will show that the gap between
scale-free network and classical random graph is not
impassable in the sense of connectivity distribution.
We prove that (see Theorem 1 below) a Erd ˝os–R´enyi
random graph with unbounded expected degrees has
an approximate scale-free behaviour with scaling ex-
ponent 1/2, i.e., P(k) ∝ k−1/2, in a neighbourhood of
expected degree ⟨k⟩. Numerical simulations are per-
formed to validate our theoretical ﬁndings. The ad-

vances prompt us to wonder how network topology af-
fects a system’s survivability.
To begin with, we ﬁx some notations. Let
G(n,λn/n) be a classical random graph containing n
nodes and with edge probability λn/n. Throughout the
letter, we assume thatλn →∞ as n →∞. Therefore, the
expected degree of any vertex is⟨k⟩∼λn, which is un-
bounded. For k = 0,1,2,···, denote by dk the number
of vertices in G(n,λn/n) of degree k. It follows that the
connectivity distributionP(k) =dk/n. We will need the
following lemma, whose proof is straightforward and
hence omitted.
Lemma 1. For any 0 < x < y and y > 1,
(
1 + x
y
)y
< ex and
(
1 −x
y
)y
< e−x. (1)
The result for connectivity distribution P(k) is es-
tablished as follows.
Theorem 1. In a Erd ˝os–R´enyi random graph
G(n,λn/n) with λn →∞ as n →∞, for any 0 < ε < 1,
P
(
P(k) ≤(1 + ε)√
2π k−1/2
)
→1, (2)
as n →∞, for all k such that k > λn/2. Furthermore,
P
((1 −ε)√
2π k−1/2 ≤P(k) ≤(1 + ε)√
2π k−1/2
)
→1, (3)
as n →∞, for all k such that |k −λn|= o(√λn).
Theorem 1 implies that the tail of the connectivity
distribution P(k) (when k > ⟨k⟩/2) is upper bounded
by a power-law with exponent 1/2, and the bound is
tight in a (possibly inﬁnite) neighbourhood of ⟨k⟩.
Proof. We start with the proof of (2). Given 0< ε < 1,
by Theorem 3 in [20], we have for all k
P
(
(1 −ε) λk
n e−λn
k! ≤P(k) ≤(1 + ε) λk

as n →∞. In view of the Stirling formula and the fact
that λn →∞ as n →∞, we obtain

k! = (1 + o(1)) λk

For λn/2 < k ≤λn, by using Lemma 1 and (5),

for sufﬁciently large n. For k > λn, we similarly have

= 1√

(7)
for sufﬁciently large n. Hence, It follows from (4), (6),
and (7) that (2) holds.
Next, we turn to the proof of (3). Note that the as-
sumption |k −λn|= o(√λn) implies that k > λn/2.
Therefore, from the above arguments, it sufﬁces to
show
P
((1 −ε)√
2π k−1/2 ≤P(k)
)
→1 (8)
for all k satisfying |k −λn|= o(√λn).
If k ≤λn, via (5) and Lemma 1, we obtain for any
0 < δ < 1

for sufﬁciently large n. Combining (9) and (11) with
(4), we then obtain (8), which ﬁnally concludes the
proof of Theorem 1. □
To illustrate our result, we perform simulations on
a classical random graph G(n,λ(i)
n /n) for i = 1,2 with
n = 105 and λ(1)
n = lnln n and λ(2)
n = 2ln n, respec-
tively. We plot the connectivity distribution P(k) in
a neighbourhood of expected degrees⟨k⟩≈3 and ⟨k⟩≈
28 in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. Note that,
almost surely, the random graph G(n,λ(1)
n /n) is not
connected while G(n,λ(2)
n /n) is connected [12]. From
Figure 1a and Figure 1b, we see that the simulation
results agree with their analytical counterparts in the
neighbourhood of ⟨k⟩in both cases. In addition, the
curve 1/
√
2πk turns out to be the upper bound ofP(k),
as indicated in Theorem 1.
To conclude, we have shown that a classical Erd˝os–
R´enyi random graph can also have a scale-free con-
nectivity distribution (although not globally). Specif-
ically, a Erd ˝os–R´enyi random graph with unbounded
expected degrees has a scale-free connectivity distri-
bution with scaling exponent 1 /2 in an inﬁnite neigh-
bourhood of expected degree. Our results towards local
scale-free shed light on the discrepancy in the surviv-
ability of scale-free networks and random graphs. The
research focus in the present letter is on the connectiv-
ity distribution, for future study, it is desirable to inves-
tigate the robustness of networks with local scale-free
behaviour under random failure or intentional attack.
The usual connectivity measure and /or spectral mea-
sure [23] may be applied. In addition, the robustness of
scale-free networks with an exponent less than 1 is an-
other interesting future work. Are there other network
models having local scale-free property? Is it inherent
to the topologies? One reviewer mentioned a relevant
local scale-free distribution in some subsets of vertex
set in networks [24]. Can we quantify the topological
characteristics of these types of networks when com-
pared with global scale-free networks?
