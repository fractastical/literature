7.1. INTRODUCTION 
The renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry in the 1950's brought with it a 
quantitative approach to reactions which had been enjoyed by Organic 
Chemistry. for some thirty years. Concepts of reaction mechanism were 
expressed in the terminology used by organic chemists, and linear free energy 
relationships were employed as a tool to explore reaction mechanisms. The 
reactions studied by LFER were those nearest to organic reactions-those 
with an organic group attached to an inorganic reaction centre. They in­
cluded those of transition-metal complexes (with organic sul;>stituents in the 
ligands), and the organic derivatives of the transition metals and main-group 
elements. The information which has been obtained by the use of LFER for 
inorganic systems has usually confirmed previous ideas, and has seldom led 
to new theories. 
In this article the term 'Inorganic Chemistry' has been taken to mean the 
chemistry of the metallic elements, and of the organic derivatives of the 
elements in main-groups III to V (excluding carbon and nitrogen). The 
chemistry of the organic derivatives of the elements in main-groups VI and 
VII is usually regarded as organic chemistry. It is not possible in the space of 
this article to give all the examples of inorganic LFER which are in the 
literature. An attempt has been made to discuss any theoretical work which 
has been developed for inorganic systems, and to give a few illustrations of 
each of the areas in which LFER have been used.
