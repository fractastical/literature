Introduction
Several psychiatric disorders are characterized by mal­
adapt ive patterns of behaviour during approach–avoidance 
conflict (AAC); that is, when both positive and negative 
 outcomes may result from the same choice. 1 This includes 
maladaptive avoidance behaviours in individuals with 
 depression/anxiety, which are thought to maintain symp­
toms and are often targeted in psychotherapy, 2 as well as 
drug­seeking behaviours in those with substance use disor­
ders who sacrifice quality of life to avoid uncomfortable 
withdrawal states and/or seek out reinforcing sensations or 
ex periences.3 Understanding the cognitive and computa­
tional processes leading to these patterns of maladaptive 
choice is an important research direction that could point 
toward novel therapeutic targets.4
Various tasks have emerged to investigate the resolution of 
AAC using computational modelling. This approach can 
measure distinct information processing mechanisms during 
decision­making. From a computational perspective, impair­
ments in AAC decision ­making might be attributed to a 
range of mechanisms, including suboptimal reinforcement 
learning, outcome/action valuation, uncertainty, inference or 
planning processes, among others. As such, an effective way

Background: Decision-making under approach–avoidance conflict (AAC; e.g., sacrificing quality of life to avoid feared outcomes) may 
be affected in multiple psychiatric disorders. Recently, we used a computational (active inference) model to characterize information pro-
cessing differences during AAC in individuals with depression, anxiety and/or substance use disorders. Individuals with psychiatric disor-
ders exhibited increased decision uncertainty (DU) and reduced sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli. This preregistered study aimed to deter-
mine the replicability of this processing dysfunction. Methods: A new sample of participants completed the AAC task. Individual-level 
computational parameter estimates, reflecting decision uncertainty and sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli (“emotion conflict”; EC), were ob-
tained and compared between groups. Subsequent analyses combining the prior and current samples allowed assessment of narrower 
disorder categories. Results: The sample in the present study included 480 participants: 97 healthy controls, 175 individuals with sub-
stance use disorders and 208 individuals with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Individuals with substance use disorders showed 
higher DU and lower EC values than healthy controls. The EC values were lower in females, but not males, with depression and/or anx-
iety disorders than in healthy controls. However, the previously observed difference in DU between participants with depression and/or 
anxiety disorders and healthy controls did not replicate. Analyses of specific disorders in the combined samples indicated that effects 
were common across different substance use disorders and affective disorders. Limitations: There were differences, although with 
small effect size, in age and baseline intellectual functioning between the previous and current sample, which may have affected replica-
tion of DU differences in participants with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The now robust evidence base for these 
clinical group differences motivates specific questions that should be addressed in future research: can DU and EC become behavioural 
treatment targets, and can we identify neural substrates of DU and EC that could be used to measure severity of dysfunction or as 
neuro modulatory treatment targets?

to understand maladaptive choices across clinical popula­
tions is empirical application of these models. To this end, 
 recent studies applying this approach have investigated how 
both initial choice biases and rates of evidence accumulation 
are associated with depression, threat and their neural 
 basis;5,6 other studies have highlighted links between out­
come value and peripheral physiology, as well as neural cor­
relates of competing action values.7,8
In a recent study of AAC behaviour in individuals with 
 depression/anxiety or substance use disorders, 9 we used a 
Bayesian computational (active inference) model to distin­
guish 2 components of decision­making: decision uncertainty 
(DU) and emotion conflict (EC). This transdiagnostic sample 
was examined because AAC has particular relevance for both 
emotional and substance use disorders. Given their high co­
morbidity, it also provided the opportunity to examine pos­
sible dimensional and transdiagnostic effects, as well as 
 assess differences that could be specific to some disorders 
and not others. Relative to healthy controls, both patient 
groups showed greater DU (associated with more inconsis­
tent choice). Those with substance use disorders also showed 
reduced EC (associated with less avoidance of negative 
affect ive images/sounds when paired with various levels of 
reward), with the depression/anxiety group showing a simi­
lar pattern only in females (this difference in EC between the 
 depression/anxiety and healthy control groups was also 
stronger when accounting for 1­year follow­up data10). While 
potentially important, the generalizability of these results 
was unclear, and a replication study with a new sample was 
warranted. In this report, we replicate our prior study in a 
new sample of patients meeting criteria for the same cat­
egories of mental health disorders, using the same computa­
tional model and the same AAC task. We show which find­
ings replicate and which should be afforded less confidence. 
We also investigated whether results differed between spe­
cific substance use disorders and affective disorders, or 
whether a similar pattern held across diagnoses.
Methods
Participants
Participants for this preregistered analysis (preregistration at 
https://osf.io/7c96t) were identified from the confirmatory 
subsample (n = 550) of the Tulsa 1000 (T1000) study11 — a nat­
uralistic longitudinal study recruiting both healthy individ uals 
and individuals expressing elevated psychiatric symptoms 
based on the dimensional National Institute of Mental Health 
Research Domain Criteria framework. The T1000 study in­
cluded a community­based sample of 1050 individ uals re­
cruited through radio, electronic media, treatment centre refer­
rals and word of mouth. Participants were 18–55 years of age, 
screened on the basis of dimensional psycho pathology scores: 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ12) ≥ 10, Overall Anxiety 
 Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS 13) ≥ 8, and/or Drug 
Abuse Screening Test (DAST­1014) score ≥ 3. Healthy controls 
did not show elevated symptoms or psychiatric diagnoses. 
Participants were excluded if they tested positive for drugs of 
abuse; met criteria for psychotic, bipolar, or obsessive–  
compulsive disorders; or reported history of  moderate to 
 severe traumatic brain injury, neurologic disorders, or severe 
or unstable medical conditions, active suicidal intent or plan, 
or change in medication dose within 6 weeks. Full inclusion/
exclusion criteria have been described previously.11 The study 
was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. All 
participants provided written informed consent before com­
pletion of the study protocol, in accord ance with the Declara­
tion of Helsinki, and were compensated for participation 
 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: #NCT02450240). Previous studies 
have been published from the larger T1000 data set. 15–26 Our 
prior publications on the AAC task used data collected from 
the first 500 participants of the T1000 study, whereas the pres­
ent study focuses on the confirmatory data set from the latter 
550 participants.
As done in our previous study, after initial data quality 
control, participants were divided into 3 transdiagnostic 
groups: major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or comorbid 
anxiety disorders (social anxiety disorder [SAD], generalized 
anxiety disorder [GAD], panic disorder and/or post­
traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); substance use disorders 
(recreational drugs excluding alcohol and nicotine, with or 
without comorbid depression and anxiety disorders); and 
healthy controls with no mental health diagnoses. Figure 1 
provides detailed information about the proportions and co­
morbidities across specific diagnoses and compares these to 
the previous sample. Diagnosis was based on DSM­IV or 
DSM­5 criteria using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (MINI).27 These categories were developed before 
the present analyses and have been discussed in previous 
 papers.15 While the T1000 study also included individuals 
with eating disorders, they were excluded here owing to 
small sample sizes. Depression/anxiety disorders were cat­
egorized together for our analyses owing to the high rates of 
overlap in these diagnoses and to there being very small sam­
ple sizes for anxiety disorders if separated (Figure 1).
Data collection procedure
T1000 participants underwent an intensive assessment for 
demo graphic, clinical and psychiatric features, with a focus on 
negative and positive affect, arousal and cognitive functioning. 
The complete list of assessments and references supporting 
their validity and reliability have been reported previously.11 
For this study, as in our prior paper, we included scores on the 
Wide Range Achievement Test reading subtest (WRAT 28), 
which approximates baseline intellectual functioning.
Approach–avoidance conflict task
The AAC task29,30 is described more extensively in our prior 
arti cle9 and in Figure 2 and Appendix 1 (available at www.jpn.
ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/jpn.220226/tab­related­content). The 
task has 5 trial types. In each trial type, participants can choose 
to approach or avoid 2 outcomes, corresponding to combina­
tions of either negative or positive affective stimuli and either 
0, 2, 4 or 6 reward points. The trial types were as follows:
Transdiagnostic uncertainty and reduced avoidance
 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E219
• “Avoid­threat” (AV), in which 0 points were offered for 
both possible stimulus outcomes and, thus, the only explicit 
motivation was to avoid the negative affective stimulus.
• “Approach­reward” (APP), in which 2 versus 0 points 
were offered, each with positive affective stimuli. For this 
condition, the only explicit motivation was to approach the 
rewarded outcome.
• Three levels of “Conflict” in which the negative affective 
stimulus was presented in addition to winning either 2 
(CONF2), 4 (CONF4) or 6 (CONF6) points, while 0 points 
were offered for the other possible outcome, in which a 
positive affective stimulus would be presented.
As in previous administrations of the task,29,31 points did not 
correspond to monetary reward. That is, participants did not re­
ceive additional monetary compensation based on the number 
of points they earned. Points were therefore assumed to be re­
warding in and of themselves within the context of the task. 
 Notably, previous research has shown that paradigms involving 
 either non­monetary or monetary reward elicit similar neural 
activation patterns in reward­sensitive brain regions,32,33 which 
could suggest similar motivational influences. Previous studies 
using this task with and without monetary compensation have 
also found similar patterns of behaviour.29,34
Descriptive behavioural variables consisted of average 
chosen runway position, within­subject standard deviation in 
chosen runway position, and response times (RTs; i.e., time 
to initial button press) during each trial.
After completing all trials, participants filled out a short 
Likert scale questionnaire about their experiences/behaviours 
during the task.

Computational modelling
The generative model of the AAC task and active inference 
scheme used for computational analyses has been described 
in detail in our previous articles; 9,35 for a detailed tutorial 
cover ing the general structure and mathematics of this class 
of models, see Smith and colleagues.36 A description of each 
element of the generative model is provided in Table 1. The 
model afforded estimation of parameters reflecting the sub­
jective aversiveness of the negative image–sound combina­
tions relative to the value of the points (“emotion conflict”; 
EC) and the level of uncertainty in decision­making, where 
greater uncertainty promotes less consistent choices within 
each trial type (“decision uncertainty”; DU). Considerations 
of parameter recoverability and alternative models have been 
described previously.9
Estimates of the DU and EC parameters were optimized to 
match the choice behaviour of each participant, where the 
resulting parameter values could then be used as individual 
difference measures capturing regularities in their decision 
processes. Technically, this involved searching over combin­
ations of DU and EC values to maximize the likelihood of 
each participant’s choices across trials, which was accom­
plished using a standard variational Bayesian approach 
called Variational Laplace.37
Statistical analysis
Our main analyses focused on replicating those used in our 
previous study.9 These analyses were conducted using the R 
statistical package (2018; www.R­project.org/). We first calcu­
lated a model accuracy score reflecting the average percentage 
Figure 2: Diagram representing the approach–avoidance (AAC) task. On each trial, participants choose to move an avatar to 1 of 9 positions 
on a runway. Pictures are shown on each side of the runway, indicating the types of stimuli that could be presented at the end of the trial. A 
sun or cloud represented potential positive or negative affective stimuli, respectively (each being an image–sound combination), while the 
height of the red fill in a rectangle signified the number of points that would be received in conjunction. Participants were told the ending pos-
ition of the avatar determined the probability of each of these outcomes occurring (in increments of 10%, from 90% to 10% with each step 
away from the associated stimulus indicator images). (Left) Example trial, in which the negative stimulus and 2 points were presented based 
on the probabilities associated with the chosen runway position. (Right) The 5 trial types and associated probabilities of each outcome at each

in the computational model matched the true action chosen 
by participants (i.e., under the parameter values estimated for 
each participant). We then examined correlations between 
model parameters and RTs, with the expectation that compu­
tational measures of greater EC and DU would both be associ­
ated with slower RTs. We then conducted further correlation 
analyses to examine whether each parameter could predict

1.  Observed position on the runway (10 possible observations, including a “starting” position 
and the 9 final positions on the runway that one could choose
2.  Cues indicating trial type (5 possible observations, corresponding to the 5 trial types)
3.  Stimuli observed at the end of each trial. This included 7 possible observations 
corresponding to a “starting” observation, the unpleasant stimulus with 0 points, the 
pleasant stimulus with 0 or 2 points, and the unpleasant stimulus with 2, 4 or 6 points.
sτ Hidden states at time Hidden state factors correspond to vectors encoding:
1.  Possible positions on the runway (10 possible states with an identity mapping to the 
observations in outcome modality #1)
2.  Possible trial types (5 possible states with an identity mapping to the observations in 
outcome modality #2)
p(oτ | sτ) A set of matrices encoding beliefs about the association 
between hidden states and observable outcomes (i.e., 
the likelihood that specific outcomes will be observed 
given specific hidden states)
Encodes beliefs about the association between position on the runway, the trial type and the 
probability of observing each outcome, conditional on beliefs about the trial type. The model is 
constructed such that cues provide complete certainty about the trial type and runway position 
(i.e., only the outcomes under different combinations of runway positions and trial types are 
probabilistic). In these matrices, columns (states) from left to right indicate the starting state 
followed by possible final position states 1 through 9. Rows from top to bottom indicate the 
possible observations in modality #3 above (outcome stimuli). This includes the starting 
observation (“no stimulus”), followed by observations of: unpleasant stimuli, pleasant stimuli, 
pleasant stimuli + 2 points, unpleasant stimuli + 2 points, unpleasant stimuli + 4 points, and 
unpleasant stimuli + 6 points. For an explicit depiction of these matrices, see Appendix 1, 
available at www.jpn.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/jpn.220226/tab-related-content
p(sτ+1 | sτ, π) A set of matrices encoding beliefs about how hidden 
states will evolve over time (transition probabilities) 
under each possible action sequence or policy (π)
Encodes beliefs about the way participants could choose to move the avatar, as well as the 
belief that the trial type will not change within a trial. These simply indicated that:

p(oτ | C) A matrix encoding the degree to which some observed 
outcomes are preferred over others at each time point τ 
(where a higher probability value corresponds to being 
more preferred). Preferences at each time point are 
encoded in a vector C and then normalized with a 
softmax operator (σ)
Encodes stronger positive preferences for receiving higher amounts of points, and negative 
preferences for the unpleasant stimuli (both relative to an anchor value of 0 for the “safe” 
positive stimulus). The EC parameter encodes the estimated value of participants’ preferences 
against observing the unpleasant stimuli as follows (with each element corresponding to the 
respective rows within p(oτ | sτ)):
p(oτ | C) = σ([0 –EC 0 2 –EC + 2 –EC + 4 –EC + 6]T)
p(s1) A set of vectors encoding beliefs about (a probability 
distribution over) initial hidden states for each state factor
The simulated participant always begins in the initial starting state with p = 1, and each trial 
type is equally likely (before observing the trial type cues).
G(π) This is the EFE of a policy (π), which is used to evaluate 
which policies are better than others:
G(π) = 
–Eq(o,s|π)[lnq(sτ|oτ, π) – lnq(sτ|π)]
–Eq(o|π)[p(oτ|C)]
The first term on the right of the equation motivates 
decisions that will seek out information to reduce 
uncertainty about states. The second term motivates 
decisions that are expected to maximize the probability 
of preferred observations (encoded in C). Note that q 
denotes an approximate posterior distribution (reflecting 
a best guess about the associated probabilities).
In this case, the value of the EC parameter within p(oτ | C) determines the magnitude of the 
negative preference for observing the unpleasant stimuli, which motivates the selection of 
policies that will favour only observing points that have greater values than EC. Note that, as 
there is no uncertainty about current trial type or runway position in this task, the information-
seeking term within G(π) does not play a crucial role in this context. An alternative 
decomposition of the expected free energy — into terms often referred to as “risk” and 
“ambiguity” — also implies that, in the absence of any ambiguity (as in the present task), 
participants will aim to minimize the divergence between predicted and preferred outcomes 
(i.e., risk).
β The prior on EFE precision (β) is the “rate” parameter of a 
γ distribution, the expected value of which is γ. Assuming 
a “shape” parameter value of 1, γ = 1 ÷ β. This term is 
used as a scalar that modulates the precision of the EFE 
distribution over policies. A policy with lower EFE entails 
a higher probability of generating preferred outcomes 
under the model (see entry for G(π) above).
When β is high (reflecting low confidence about the best decision), policy selection becomes 
less deterministic. Higher β values therefore encode participants’ decision uncertainty during 
the task. This β value was estimated for each participant. In the main text, we refer to this as 
the DU parameter.
q(π) An approximate posterior distribution over action 
policies (π) encoding the probability of selecting a 
particular policy, based on its EFE:
q(π) = σ(–γG)*
The γ term is described in the previous entry.
Allowable policies included the decision to transition from the starting state to each of the 9 
possible positions on the runway. Policies with lower EFE have a higher probability of being 
selected.
DU = decision uncertainty; EC = emotion conflict; EFE = expected free energy.
*Here, σ indicates a softmax operator that converts a vector of values into a proper probability distribution (with non-negative values that sum to 1).

subsequent self­reports on post­task Likert scale questions 
(i.e., identical to those used in our previous study). We ex­
pected EC would be associated with self­reported avoidance 
motivation and anxiety, and that DU would be positively as­
sociated with self ­reported difficulty making decisions and 
self­reported avoidance motivation.
We conducted type 2 analyses of variance (ANOVA) to 
identify possible group differences in each parameter. Type 2 
analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were then completed to 
confirm that these differences remained significant after ac­
counting for individual differences in age and sex, and the 
inter action between group and each of these factors. To inter­
pret significant results, post hoc contrasts were carried out 
using estimated marginal means with proportional weight­
ing. JZS Bayes factor analyses (with default prior scales; 
“Bayesfactor” package 38–40) were also carried out to assess 
which combination of possible predictors/covariates best 
 accounted for variance in each model parameter. As in our 
previous report, we also planned to include main effects and 
interactions with WRAT reading scores in these ANCOVAs 
to assess whether group differences in task behaviour could 
be accounted for by differences in baseline intellectual func­
tioning. However, owing to issues that arose in data collec­
tion, 85 participants did not have WRAT reading scores 
(12 healthy controls, 22 depression/anxiety, 51 substance use 
disorder). Thus, identical analyses were instead run with and 
without WRAT scores as a covariate to avoid removing these 
85 participants from all primary analyses. We expected to ob­
serve greater DU parameter values in the depression/anxiety 
and substance use disorder groups than in healthy controls. 
We also expected greater EC in people with substance use 
disorders than in healthy controls.
As complementary secondary analyses, we also conducted 
identical ANOVAs/ANCOVAs to those described above 
with standard descriptive task variables as the dependent 
variables, including mean and within­subject standard devia­
tion in chosen runway positions, and RTs during the differ­
ent task trial types. Based on our prior results,9,10 we expected 
to observe slower RTs in the clinical groups than in healthy 
controls, less approach behaviour (in mean runway position) 
in healthy controls than in the clinical groups, and greater 
within­subject choice variance in the clinical groups than in 
healthy controls. As all analyses aimed to replicate prior sig­
nificant results, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.
In our previous study, exploratory analyses indicated that 
the group differences in EC were present in females and not 
males when examined separately. In contrast, the group dif­
ferences in DU were present in males but not females when 
examined separately. Analyses conducted to test whether 
these results would replicate are described in Appendix 1.
Group differences in WRAT reading scores (lower scores 
in the substance use disorder group than in the other groups) 
were anticipated based on the representative demographics 
within these clinical populations (e.g., see41–48). As in our pre­
vious study, we planned to use the fullmatch function within 
the optmatch 1 R package (https://www.rdocumentation.
org/packages/optmatch/versions/0.9­10/topics/fullmatch) 
to propensity­match groups based on WRAT reading scores 
and then perform the same analyses described above with 
the propensity­matched subsamples. In our prior study, we 
also propensity­matched on age (propensity­matching on sex 
was also attempted but was unsuccessful, and so sex was in­
cluded as a covariate in those analyses). The present sample 
did not have significant differences in age, which precluded 
the need for matching on this variable. Unfortunately, the 
composition of the present sample led to an inability to suc­
cessfully propensity­match on WRAT reading scores when 
the matching algorithm was applied (i.e., significant group 
differences could not be removed owing to insufficient over­
lap). This reflected the significantly lower WRAT reading 
scores in the current substance use disorder sample com­
pared with that of our previous study (Appendix 1). As such, 
we report only analyses on the full sample. We include re­
sults both with and without age, sex and WRAT reading 
score as covariates.
Disorder-specific analyses in combined samples
After completing all preregistered replication analyses, we 
examined potential differences between individuals with 
specific disorders by combining the exploratory and con­
firmatory samples (as sample sizes in the exploratory sample 
alone did not permit this in our prior study). Using logistic 
regressions, we first examined whether model parameters 
could predict the presence of specific substance use or affec­
tive disorders relative to healthy controls. These regression 
models included both parameters (and their interactions with 
age and sex) as predictors of diagnostic status (i.e., coding 
healthy controls = 0 and those with the specific disorder in 
question = 1, removing all other participants). When possible, 
we also examined those with no comorbid disorders; how­
ever, rates of comorbidity were too high to do this in most 
cases. To further investigate potential effects of specific diag­
noses, we then performed analogous logistic regressions to 
evaluate whether model parameters could predict the pres­
ence of a given disorder relative to all other disorders (i.e., re­
moving healthy controls and coding those with v. without 
the specific disorder in question equal to 1 v. 0, respectively). 
Each of the logistic regressions above were performed separ­
ately for the depression/anxiety group and the substance use 
disorders group. We also used t  tests to evaluate whether 
 parameter values might differ in those with current com­
pared with remitted MDD or in those with MDD with and 
without comorbid anxiety disorders.
Results
The sample in the present study included 480 participants: 
97 healthy controls, 175 individuals with substance use disor­
ders and 208 individuals with depression and/or anxiety dis­
orders. Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical 
measures are shown in Table 2. Mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) values for each of the parameters were as follows: DU 
4.51 ± 5.06 and EC 2.62 ± 2.91. By group, these values were as 
follows: DU 3.96 ± 4.65 and EC 3.53 ± 3.57 in healthy controls, 
DU 4.14 ± 4.57 and EC 2.97 ± 3.06 in the depression/anxiety 
group, and DU 5.26 ± 5.73 and EC 1.70 ± 1.95 in the substance

use disorder grroup. For further analyses testing for potential 
differences in demographic/clinical variables between the pre­
vious and current samples and further information about the 
association between model parameters and demographic/
clinical variables, see Appendix 1. The only demographic 
and clinical differences found between samples (all of small 
effect size) were that the previous depression/ anxiety sample 
was older and had higher DAST scores than the current 
 depression/anxiety sample and the previous substance use 
disorder sample had higher WRAT reading scores than the 
current substance use disorder sample.
The EC and DU parameters were correlated at r = 0.24, p < 
0.001. As in our prior study, because the parameters were not 
normally distributed, they were log­transformed for all sub­
sequent analyses using the R package optLog (https://
github.com/kforthman/optLog) to find the optimal log­
transform that minimizes skew. This resulted in the follow­
ing log­transformed values: DU 0.91 ± 0.97 and EC 1.02 ± 
0.79 in healthy controls, DU 0.95 ± 1.02 and EC 0.86 ± 0.79 in 
the depression/anxiety groups, and DU 1.19 ± 1.01 and EC 
0.44 ± 0.68 in the substance use disorder group.
Face validity: task-related self-report and behaviour
Averaging across participants, the model was accurate at pre­
dicting behaviour in 75% (standard error 1.1%) of trials 
(chance accuracy 1/9 = 11%). Table 3 shows significant cor­
rel ations between model parameters and each of 8 items (Q1–
Q8) on the post­AAC task questionnaire. Notably, EC cor­
related most strongly with self­reported motivations to move 
toward reward points (Q4; r  = –0.73, p  < 0.001) and motiva­
tions to move away from negative images/sounds (Q5; r  = 
0.72, p < 0.001). As observed in our previous study, higher EC 
also corresponded to higher self­reported anxiety during the 
task (Q2; r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Also as observed previously, DU 
correlated most strongly with self­reported difficulty making 
decisions on the task (Q3; r = 0.41, p < 0.001) and motivations 
to move toward reward points (Q4; r = –0.46, p < 0.001). Indi­
viduals with longer RTs across all trials also showed higher 
EC (r = 0.22, p  < 0.001) and DU values (r  = 0.57, p  < 0.001). 
Analyses of RTs within specific trial types showed similar re­
sults (EC: 0.22 ≤  r ≤ 0.31; DU: 0.30 ≤  r ≤ 0.55; Appendix 1, 
 Figure S1), with the exception of the AV condition, where

RTs were faster in those with greater EC (r = –0.21, p < 0.001), 
as expected (i.e., more confident avoidance would be ex­
pected in the absence of any points on offer). Several of these 
correlations are illustrated in Figure 3.
Clinical validity: diagnostic effects
With respect to DU, an initial ANOVA revealed a significant 
main effect of clinical group (F2,477 = 3.52, p = 0.026; Figure 4). 
Post hoc t  tests indicated that this effect was due to higher 
DU in the substance use disorder group than in healthy con­
trols (t 270 = 2.20, p  = 0.029, d  = 0.28) and the depression/  
anxiety group (t381 = 2.31, p = 0.022, d = 0.24), but a nonsignifi­
cant difference between healthy controls and the depression/
anxiety group (t 303 = 0.29, p  = 0.771, d  = 0.04). As shown in 
 Table 4, this effect remained significant in an ANCOVA in­
cluding possible main effects and interactions with age and 
sex. Decision uncertainty was also positively associated with 
age, and there was an interaction with group indicating a 
stronger relationship between age and DU in the substance 
use disorder group than in healthy controls. While there was 
not a sex ×  group interaction, preregistered supplementary 
analyses testing effects in each sex separately suggested 
group effects were more driven by males, a result qualita­
tively similar to that in the previous sample (Appendix 1, 
Figure S4). Bayes factor analyses testing evidence for models 
that did or did not contain main effects of age and sex, and 
their respective interactions with group, found the most evi­
dence for a model that included only an effect of age (BF > 
100 relative to an  intercept­only model); the second­best 
model added an effect of group (BF >  100 relative to an 
 intercept­only model; BF = 0.56 relative to the winning 
model). When including only participants with WRAT read­
ing scores and adding possible main effects and interactions 
with WRAT reading scores into the ANCOVA model above, 
the effect of group was no long er significant (Appendix 1).
With respect to EC, an initial ANOVA revealed a significant 
main effect of clinical group (F2,477 = 23.83, p < 0.001; Figure 4). 
Post hoc t tests indicated that this effect was due to lower EC in 
the substance use disorder group than in healthy controls (t270 = 
6.46, p < 0.001, d = 0.82) and the depression/anxiety group (t381 = 
5.57, p < 0.001, d = 0.57), but a nonsignificant difference between 
healthy controls and the depression/anxiety group (t303 = 1.67, 
p = 0.095, d = 0.21). As shown in Table 4, this effect remained 
significant when accounting for possible effects of age and sex, 
and their interactions with group. When accounting for the 
other predictors in this model, post hoc contrasts also indicated 
that the difference between healthy controls and the 
 depression/anxiety group became significant (i.e., greater EC 
in healthy controls; t471 = 2.33, p  = 0.020, d  = 0.29). However,

also differed from healthy controls on emotion conflict (EC). Note that EC and decision uncertainty (DU) are shown in log-space.

there was a notable interaction between sex and group, indi­
cating that all 3 groups differed significantly among females 
(healthy controls > depression/anxiety > substance use disor­
ders), while no group differences were present in males (effect 
sizes for post hoc contrasts in females: healthy controls > 
 depression/anxiety, d = 0.42; healthy controls > substance use 
disorders, d = 1.15; Table 4). Figure 5 shows a direct compari­
son between the previous and current samples (Appendix 1, 
Figure S4 shows an analogous plot for DU). Bayes factor 
analy ses testing evidence for models that did or did not con­
tain main effects of age and sex, and their respective interac­
tions with group, found the most evidence for a model that in­
cluded only the effect of group and the sex × group interaction 
(BF > 100 relative to an intercept­only model). In subsequent 
analyses including only participants with WRAT reading 
scores and adding possible main effects and interactions with 
WRAT reading scores into the ANCOVA model above, the ef­
fect of group remained significant (F2,383 = 19.17, p < 0.001), as 
did the sex × group interaction (F2, 383 = 5.11, p = 0.006). There 
was also a group × WRAT interaction (F2, 383 = 6.60, p = 0.002), 
reflecting a stronger positive association between WRAT score 
and EC in the depression/anxiety group than in the substance 
use disorder group (t383 = 3.63, p < 0.001; Appendix 1).
Exploratory t tests comparing those with depression with 
and without comorbid anxiety found no significant differ ­
ences in any study variable, with the exception of RTs in the 
APP condition (t 194 = –2.08, p  = 0.04, d  = 0.32), indicating 
slower RTs in those without comorbid anxiety. Correlation 
analyses reported in Appendix 1 revealed some notable posi­
tive associations between DU and anxiety in the depression/
anxiety group; however these findings should be treated 
with caution, as they were not found in our prior study.
Secondary analyses of descriptive measures
Descriptive statistics for all model­free measures, as well as 
their correlations with model parameters, are provided in 
Appendix 1, Tables S1–S4 and Figures S1–S3. Results of 
Figure 4: Raincloud plots (including densities, boxplots, means and standard errors [SEs], and individual data points) and bar plots (means 
and SEs) showing differences between healthy controls (HC) and clinical groups in 2 measures of avoidance (top row) and 2 measures of un-
certainty (bottom row) in which values were significantly different in the substance use disorder (SUD) group compared with the other groups: 
The emotional conflict (EC) model parameter, reflecting expected aversiveness of negative stimuli relative to reward; a self-reported emotion 
regulation strategy (Q6 in Table 3; lower values indicate individuals closed their eyes more often to avoid the negative stimuli); the decision 
uncertainty (DU) model parameter, reflecting indeterminacy in choice; and response times (RTs) in seconds in the avoid condition. The 
 depression/anxiety disorder group (D/A) also differed from healthy controls on EC. Note that EC and DU are shown in log-space.

ANOVAs/ANCOVAs on descriptive measures are also de­
scribed in Appendix 1, Tables S5–S8. These results largely 
replicated those in our previous paper and were consistent 
with the differences found in model parameter values, in­
cluding group differences in average chosen runway position 
in each task condition except APP (greater avoidance in 
healthy controls than in 1 or both clinical groups); choice SDs 
in the AV and APP conditions (greater in the substance use 
disorder group than in the other groups); RTs in the AV con­
dition and marginally in the APP condition (slower in the 
substance use disorder group and females in the depression/
anxiety group than in healthy controls; Figure 4); and several 
self­reported task responses (greater self­reported avoidance 
and use of emotion regulation strategies in healthy controls 
than in the substance use disorder group; Figure 4).
Disorder-specific effects in combined cohorts
Descriptive statistics for model parameters in the combined ex­
ploratory and confirmatory sample, when grouped by specific 
disorder, are presented in Appendix 1, Table S9. Full results of 
logistic regression models, which either differentiated healthy 
controls from those with specific disorders or differentiated one 
disorder from others, are shown in Figure 6 and in Appendix 1, 
Tables S10–S13. In the substance use disorder group, both DU 
and EC could differentiate healthy controls from those with 
each specific substance use disorder (DU: Wald z = 2.48 to 4.54, 
p < 0.001 to 0.013; EC: Wald z = –7.01 to –2.43, p < 0.001 to 0.015), 
as well as those with most affective disorders (Figure 6, middle 
panels, and Appendix 1, Table S10). Both DU and EC could also 
differentiate healthy controls from stimulant users without co­
morbid disorders (Wald z = 2.96 to –4.56, all p < 0.001; Figure 6, 
bottom panels). Sample sizes were too small to assess other 
substance use disorders without comorbidities (Figure 1). 
 Analogous logistic regressions were unable to differentiate spe­
cific substance use disorders from one another.
In the depression/anxiety group, EC could differentiate 
healthy controls from those with each specific affective disor­
der (Wald z  = –3.97 to –1.99, p  < 0.001 to 0.046), while DU 
could only differentiate healthy controls from those with 
MDD (Wald z = 2.12, p = 0.034; Figure 6, top panels). When 
restricting analyses to those without comorbidities, EC could 
differentiate healthy controls from those with MDD alone 
(Wald z = –3.50, p < 0.001), while DU could only differentiate 
individuals with MDD who also had comorbid anxiety 
(Wald z = 1.96, p = 0.050; Figure 6, bottom panels). However,

the qualitative pattern was similar for MDD alone (and this 
group had a notably smaller sample size). In analogous logis­
tic regressions removing healthy controls, DU was able to 
differentiate social anxiety disorder from other affective dis­
orders (i.e., lower DU values than other disorders; Wald z  = 
–3.11, p = 0.002; Figure 6, top right panel), while EC could not 
differentiate between affective disorders.
Notably, significant interactions were present between sex 
and EC, reflecting greater effects in females for MDD alone 
(i.e., without comorbidities), but not for other depression/  
anxiety subgroups (Appendix 1, Figure S5–S6). In contrast, 
these interactions were present for most specific substance use 
disorders, with the exception of sedative and hallucinogen use 
disorders (the sample size for hallucinogen users was espe­
cially small; Appendix 1, Table S10). Interactions with sex were 
not observed when removing healthy controls and attempting 
to differentiate between disorders (Appendix 1, Table S11).
No differences were found for either parameter when com­
paring current and remitted MDD (n  = 286 and 38, respect­
ively; DU: t322 = 0.41, p  = 0.68; EC: t 322 = –0.83, p  = 0.405), or 
when comparing MDD with and without comorbid anxiety 
(n = 298 and 128, respectively; DU: t 424 = –0.76, p  = 0.45; EC: 
t424 = –0.33, p = 0.745).
Discussion
In this study, we found confirmatory evidence for both 
greater DU and reduced EC in people with substance use dis­
orders relative to healthy controls (with small to moderate 
and large effect sizes, respectively), as well as consistent pat­
terns of greater approach behaviour during conflict, and less 
avoidance, greater choice variability, and slower RTs in the 
absence of conflict. Females, but not males, in the depression/
anxiety group showed a similar pattern of reduced avoidance 
(i.e., lower EC than healthy controls), but did not show ele­
vated DU as in our prior sample. Follow­up analyses in spe­
cific disorder subgroups across the prior and current samples 
also provided further evidence that these effects were trans­
diagnostic and not specific to 1 substance use disorder or 
 affective disorder.
Findings in substance use disorders are consistent with 
other computational work reporting lower levels of action 
precision (i.e., greater choice inconsistency) and slower 
learning from negative outcomes in this population; 49,50 
they could also relate to previously observed blunting of 
brain and behavioural responses to affective stimuli 51,52 
and lower self­reported sensitivity to punishment. 53,54 This

Red asterisks indicate that, in logistic regressions, model parameters could predict whether individuals were healthy controls or had a specific 
disorder (i.e., removing individuals from analyses without the disorder in question), either including comorbidities (top 2 rows) or in individuals 
without comorbidities (bottom row; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Individuals with depression and comorbid anxiety (Anx. MDD) have 
also been included in the bottom plots to compare with those with depression (MDD only) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD only) alone. 
Blue asterisks indicate that model parameters could further predict whether an individual had one disorder relative to other disorders (i.e., re-

could therefore be part of a broader pattern of vulnerability 
in which drug­seeking behaviour is not deterred by  either 
its anticipated or experienced negative consequences.
Findings in the depression/anxiety group provide sup­
port for a consistent (small to moderate effect size) reduc­
tion in avoidance drives (lower EC) among females, but 
they do not support the differences in DU suggested by our 
prior findings. However, the previous depression/anxiety 
sample was slightly older than the current sample, and 
there was also a positive association between age and DU. 
This age difference might therefore have contributed to 
lower DU values in the current sample. In addition, follow­
up analyses in the combined sample suggested that social 
anxiety disorder was associated with lower DU than other 
affective disorders. As the proportion of individuals with 
social anxiety was higher in the current sample (Figure 1), 
this might also help explain differences in DU between 
 depression/anxiety samples.
For EC, both this and our previous study found that dif­
ferences were driven by females (i.e., only female healthy 
controls showed elevated avoidance relative to female 
 depression/anxiety and all male groups, similar to previ­
ous work 55). The replication of this sex difference suggests 
certain mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision­ 
making under AAC may be more common in females. It 
also raises the possibility that such mechanisms could 
bene fit from distinct interventions. The broad range of EC 
and DU scores seen in substance use disorders similarly 
suggests that different mechanisms (and therefore treat­
ment targets) may be most relevant in different individ­
uals. For example, cognitive bias modification methods that 
train increased avoidance in response to drug cues might 
be more helpful for those with low EC values, 56 while 
psycho therapeutic inter ventions focused on increasing 
treatment motivation or self­efficacy might be more helpful 
at decreasing DU in those with high DU values. Interven­
tions that focus on enhancing awareness of one’s actions 
and associated  outcomes/consequences (i.e., interventions 
focused on mindfulness, planning or future thinking) 
might also be  expected to selectively target DU in a similar 
manner (e.g., see57–60).
In repeating all analyses performed in our prior report, 
some findings that were not significant in the original study 
did show significant results in this sample. Most prom­
inently, some significant differences in self ­report measures 
seen here were not present in the prior sample, despite being 
highly consistent with the broader pattern of behavioural re­
sults. This could indicate differences in awareness or atten­
tion to task experiences between the current and previous 
samples. Future work might include measures of metacogni­
tive awareness to further assess this possibility. However, as 
these findings were not present in both samples, they should 
be afforded less confidence until this ambiguity is addressed 
in future work.
It is worth highlighting that our computational pheno­
typing of these clinical cohorts was based on an active in­
ference account of choice behaviour under uncertainty. 
This can be contrasted with simply testing for differences 
in choice behaviour or response times. For example, be ­
cause one can explain differences in observable behaviour 
in terms of subjective (Bayesian) beliefs and preferences, 
this allows response time differences among participants 
to be linked to DU and associated belief updating. This fol­
lows because active inference implies that decision pro­
cesses are approximately Bayesian, under particular 
 (participant­specific) prior beliefs. 61,62 Notably, this class of 
models has a proposed, biologically plausible process 
 theory that could afford examination of predicted neural 
correlates in future work. For example, DU rests on a prior 
precision parameter that has been associated with dopa­
minergic signalling on both theoretical and empirical 
grounds. 63,64  This may be interesting in relation to sub­
stance use disorders owing to the known links between 
drugs of abuse and dopamine dysfunction. 65 For example, 
based on prior fMRI studies using active inference, 63 one 
might expect altered activation within the midbrain and 
several striatal and cortical regions (e.g., dorsolateral pre­
frontal cortex) modulated by dopamine. Consistent with 
this, recent work has shown that our AAC task engages 
similar striatal and cortical regions. 34 However, it remains 
to be seen how this activation relates to individual differ­
ences in DU or how this activation is altered in substance 
use disorders.
Similarly, the EC parameter is defined in terms of the pre­
cision of preferences for affective stimulus outcomes, and 
this precision is also expected to be encoded by neuro­
modu latory processes. However, the specific neural circuits 
that modulate preference precision are not well­established, 
and our modelling approach could be used to help identify 
these circuits in future fMRI studies. Characterization of 
brain–body interactions contributing to attenuated affective 
avoidance drives may also be important, given previous 
work suggesting computational dysfunction in such pro­
cesses (e.g., promoting reduced responsiveness to afferent 
signals) within both affective and substance use disorders 
(e.g., see 18,66,67). This represents an important next step in 
 establishing neurobiological mechanisms that could act as 
novel treatment targets.
Limitations
Some study limitations arose from our inability to perform 
planned analyses in propensity ­matched subgroups, and 
from the substantial missing data on WRAT reading scores 
estimating baseline intellectual functioning. Most results 
remained significant in the subsample with WRAT reading 
scores, but we remain limited in our ability to determine 
the degree to which baseline intellectual functioning ac­
counts for individual differences in some results. A related 
limitation is that WRAT reading scores differed between 
the previous and current samples. However, it is import­
ant to highlight that, even if baseline intellectual function­
ing relates to computational mechanisms, our results 
nonetheless highlight decision processes that may have 
more proximal explanatory power and/or clinical rel­
evance (e.g., if DU and EC were more easily modified than 
Smith et al.
E230 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)
general intellectual functioning). A final issue worth men­
tion is that, despite significant differences, there was still 
considerable overlap between groups in the distributions 
of DU and EC scores. This could indicate measurement 
 error or important unmeasured influences on parameter 
 values. However, it could also indicate heterogeneity 
within diagnostic groups (i.e., that different underlying 
processes may contribute to similar symptom profiles in 
different individuals). These considerations further high­
light the importance of identifying the biological basis of 
these computational mechanisms as well as other import­
ant influences on their variation.
Conclusion
We successfully replicated and extended our previous find­
ings in a second large community patient sample, providing 
further evidence for transdiagnostic effects. Reductions in EC 
were especially notable (and of potential clinical relevance) 
given their large effect size. As other studies have instead 
found evidence of increased avoidance in affective disorders 
(e.g., see68), it will be important to identify what the relevant 
differences are between the associated decision contexts. It 
will also be important for future studies to assess the degree 
to which EC and DU can be modified therapeutically in both 
affective disorders and substance use disorders for the pur ­
pose of achieving symptom improvement.
