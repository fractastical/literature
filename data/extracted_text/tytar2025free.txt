Problem statement . One of the most ambitious concepts in modern 
neuroscience is the Free Energy Principle [1; 2], which attempts to explain the 
functioning of the brain, and more broadly, of organisms in general, as a process of 
minimizing the predicted entropy or “free energy”. According to this the ory, any 
biological system exists only to the extent that it is able to predict changes in its 
environment and adapt to them by updating its internal models of the world. 
In this sense, the Free Energy Principle becomes not just a neurophysiological 
hypothesis, but a metaphysical doctrine [3; 4]: life is a process of maintaining order 
in conditions of chaos, and truth is the correspondence between the predictive 
model of the brain and the dynamics of the external world. 
The goal is to consider the Free Energy Principle from the point of view of 
philosophical anthropology, to identify new perspectives of axiology from the point 
of view of the further development of neuroscience. 
Presentation of the main material and the obtained scientific results of 
the study. An important philosophical turn is the attempt to apply this model to 
the assessment of values, that is, not only cognitive, but also ethical, aesthetic and 
existential processes. In the theoretical developments of Pezzulo (2015) [7] and 
Joffily & Coricel li (2013) [3] it is postulated that values are predictive patterns that 
allow reducing entropy in behavior, and emotions are “biological signals” about the 
correspondence or inconsistency of expectations and experience.

Therefore, moral assessments, within the framework of this theory, arise as 
adaptive heuristics of minimizing surprise or “surprise”. 
Thus, a person in such a model is not only a subject of cognition, but also a 
subject of value prediction: we learn not just to act effectively, but to act in such a 
way as to reduce the internal conflict between the expected and the actual. 
Philosophically, this model is close to the ideas of functional teleology: the goal of 
the organism is not set externally, but arises from self -regulation aimed at survival 
through the preservation of internal order. Such views bring the Free Energy Principle 
closer to neuroethics [9] and existential biophilosophy [4], where morality is not an a 
priori system of norms, but rather an evolutionary strategic function. 
However, this approach raises a number of questions: is it possible to reduce 
values to neurocomputations, and vice versa - are ethically justified decisions 
possible that reduce entropy but violate humanistic norms. 
For example, in the context of social neurosciences [2; 6] it is argued that 
strategies for avoiding cognitive dissonance can explain political or ethical 
decisions of individuals. However, such a model risks justifying behavior not by its 
content, but only by its “predictive stability”. 
Thus, the Free Energy Principle opens a new horizon of integration of the 
cognitive and the ethical, but requires careful philosophical interpretation, so as not 
to reduce values to statistical advantages. Values such can have irrational or 
transcendent sources that go beyond the predictive algorithm. 
Here are two examples of the application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in 
the field of ethics of artificial intelligence and ethics of digitalization, focusing on 
how this model interprets or distorts classic ethical dilemmas. 
In the first example, we analyze the use of artificial intelligence in the field of 
healthcare. 
An intelligent system (for example, an artificial diagnostic assistant) uses an 
FEP-like architecture to predict diagnoses and suggest solutions [5]. The system is 
trained on a huge data set and seeks to minimize the "prediction error", that is, to 
predict the patient's condition as accurately as possible based on symptoms. 
For example, the system suggests an aggressive treatment with a high chance 
of success, but with side effects that the patient judges to be morally unacceptable 
(e.g., the risk of complete loss of fertility). 
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that the system chooses the action 
that minimizes the entropy in the medical prognosis, ignoring the personal value 
of forgoing the side effects. The patient’s values are not encoded as part of the 
entropy landscape unless they are explicitly built into the model. A FEP -oriented 
system is capable of high accuracy, but it lacks normative sensitivity. Its goal is 
statistical consistency, not respect for autonomy or dignity, so it is necessary to build

in moral modeling modules, where the “prediction error” also covers moral 
scenarios, not just physiological ones. 
For example, let’s also look at personalization algorithms in social networks [8]. 
The algorithm of a social media platform uses the calculation of “expected free 
energy” to increase user engagement by displaying content that is most likely to 
cause a reaction, comment or repost. The algorithm forms an “information bubble”, 
reinforces bias, or even pushes towards polarization, as this reduces the user’s 
cognitive uncertainty (entropy) and increases reactivity. 
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) proposes the task of minimizing cognitive 
tension, but at the cost of deepening social conflicts. 
A person turns into a closed cognitive agent, avoiding information that 
contradicts internal models. 
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) here supports adaptation without truth, 
people become less open to new or complex information, because the model only 
assumes confirmation. It is necessary to create models of the ethical Free Energy 
Principle (FEP), which t ake into account the values of openness, pluralism and 
epistemic honesty as part of the computable "free energy". 
The Free Energy Principle can become the basis for intelligent systems, but 
without a philosophical understanding of the value dimension, such systems risk 
optimizing efficiency to the detriment of humanity. In this regard, there is a need 
for a hybrid mod el that combines entropic economics with normative ethics (for 
example, Kantian, personalist or dialogic). 
The Free Energy Principle can also be applied to adaptive digital learning [9]. 
Adaptive learning systems are actively implemented in modern educational 
platforms, which analyze the behavior of the student and adjust the educational 
content to his cognitive profile. Such systems are increasingly based on models 
close to active inferen ce and the Free Energy Principle [6], where the goal is to 
minimize the cognitive uncertainty of the student, reducing the gap between 
knowledge and the expected level of complexity. 
Let us carry out a comparative analysis of the concept of the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP) as interpreted by Carl Friston (neuroscience, computational theory 
of cognition) [1; 2] and Michael A. Peters and Tina Besley (philosophy of education, 
critical theory of artificial intelligence) [5; 6]. Friston describes neurophysiological 
adaptation in terms of homeostasis [1]; Peters & Besley [5] social adaptation in 
conditions of digital control. The Free Energy Principle is not a biological, but a 
political technology of thinking. For Friston, knowledge is an adaptation, for Peters 
& Besley [5] it is the result of a powerful data architecture. Both concepts emphasize 
processivity, but the philosophical core is different: Friston [1] is biological, Peters & 
Besley [5] is philosophically critical-social.

Friston [2] proposes an ethics without norms: to act in a way that reduces 
chaos. Peters & Besley [5; 9] propose an emancipatory ethics that question the very 
definition of "predictive education". 
The development of artificial intelligence should go towards the creation of 
not only intelligent systems, but also those that can emotionally interact with users. 
This applies in particular to chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommendation 
systems that not only perform tasks, but also respond to the emotional state of the 
user, offering support and motivation. 
Technologies should not only provide specific solutions or services, but also 
contribute to the development of personal skills, creativity, the ability to self -
knowledge and self-expression, supporting neotenic qualities in adults. 
Technologies built on the principles of neoteny will not only be designed to 
meet immediate needs but will focus on the long -term development of the 
intellectual and emotional resources of users. This will ensure the sustainability and 
adaptability of digital technologies to future changes: 
Technologies that encourage continuous learning and change will be able to 
better adapt to new challenges. They not only optimize tasks, but also support the 
development of new ideas, which allows for the creation of more sustainable and 
flexible systems. 
The digital technology system must be ready for self -correction and ethical 
feedback, where technologies can not only optimize their work, but also adapt to 
moral and social changes, which will prevent the risks associated with the 
monopolization of technologies or ethical biases. 
The basis of neoteny ethics is the preservation of creativity and 
unpredictability, which are traditionally distinctive features of human nature. In 
digital technologies, this means that: 
Artificial intelligence can become a partner in the creative process, and not 
just a tool for performing tasks. Algorithms can help people develop new ideas, 
explore unknown paths, generate concepts, and be part of the creative process. 
Technologies such as neural networks and augmented reality can become 
platforms for collaborative thinking, where humans and machines do not just 
interact, but actively co-create new realities. 
The neotenic model also has a significant impact on the digitalization of 
education. The creation of educational platforms that integrate these principles will 
allow for effective teaching, learning through active discovery, surprise and 
creativity, and not just through the assimilation of knowledge. Digital platforms can 
be built so that they encourage students to deeper mutual understanding and co-
creation. The use of artificial intelligence to adapt the educational process to the 
needs of each student, t aking into account his emotional state and cognitive 
flexibility, will make such technologies effective.

Conclusions. A significant drawback of the Free Energy Principle is that in the 
process of adaptation, the education system offers only the content that is most 
comfortable for perception, avoiding more complex, conceptually significant or 
ideologically contradictory topics. 
The student begins to study only "already familiar", reducing the ability to 
critical thinking, doubt, reflection. Digital education based on the Free Energy 
Principle FEP programs the student as a “predictable system” that does not seek 
truth, but only confirmation of their knowledge. This contradicts the classical 
understanding of education as going beyond the known (I. Kant, E. Husserl), it is a 
“comfortable adaptation”, not a transformation. 
Education that fully adapts to models of uncertainty minimization risks 
becoming “anti -education”, convenient, effective, but without conceptual depth 
and transformative power. It is necessary to integrate the philosophical and 
anthropological dimension, a nd therefore education should form not only 
knowledge, but also subjectivity. 
So we can conclude only about the partial use of the Free Energy Principle in 
the education system, and instead it is necessary to emphasize the development of 
critical thinking and methodological doubt, which will help students navigate in all 
situations of cognitive and life uncertainty.
