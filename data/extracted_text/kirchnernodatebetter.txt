AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
1. Depression: a social disorder 18 
Since Coyne's (1976)  influential characterization of depression as an interactional 19 
disorder, there h as been a large body of research on the social factors involved in the 20 
development and maintenance of depressive symptoms.  By now, there is broad consensus that 21 
individuals with depression show marked distortions in the anticipation, perception, and 22 
processing of social information, as well as in their social behavior. For example, depressed 23 
individuals are more sensitive to rejection (Gao et al., 2017)  and perform considerably worse 24 
at tasks measuring theory of mind (Nestor et al., 2022); they also reveal poor social problem -25 
solving when interacting with others (e.g., Hames et al., 2013). 26 
While social impairments are well described in depression (for reviews, see Bird et al., 27 
2018; Hames et al., 2013; Kupferberg et al., 2016; Segrin, 1990, 2000; Starr & Davila, 2008; 28 
Tse & Bond, 2004; Weightman et al., 2014) , a computational account is lacking of how these 29 
impairments differ from healthy social functioning and why they develop, are maintained, and 30 
manifest in such different ways (Smith, Badcock, et al., 2021) . Because of its high degree of 31 
formalization and flexibility, a computational model of these processes would enable 32 
researchers to functionally link heterogeneous social symptoms in depression to various biases 33 
in patients’ internal social belief systems, which would have important implications for 34 
diagnostics, etiology, and tailored interventions (Kirchner, Eckert, et al., 2022; Schwartenbeck 35 
et al., 2015; Smith, Badcock, et al., 2021).1 In this paper, we describe the basic architecture of 36 
the model we have in mind – and focus on its motivation and functional form (as opposed to 37 
presenting numerical analyses with a particular example).  Possible application and 38 
operationalization ideas will be described in the "Implications and Future Research" section. 39 
  From an etiological perspective, research from developmental and clinical psychology 40 
suggests a bidirectional vicious cycle between depressive symptoms and impaired social 41

functioning (e.g., Beeson et al., 2020; Kirchner et al., 2022) , with social trauma, such as peer 42 
rejection, childhood maltreatment, and lack of social support as common antecedents and risk 43 
factors (Gariépy et al., 2016; Nanni et al., 2012; Platt et al., 2013) . In this view, social trauma 44 
and the lack of social support can lead to socially maladapted perception (e.g., reject ion 45 
sensitivity, Zimmer‐Gembeck, 2016) , informational processing (e.g., interpretation biases, 46 
Everaert et al., 2017)  and behavior (e.g., maladaptive interpersonal styles, Bird et al., 2018; 47 
Evraire & Dozois, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012) , which leads to the generation of 48 
interpersonal stress (e.g., rejection, Starr & Davila, 2008)  that eventually promotes depressive 49 
symptoms by impairing social imperatives (e.g., sense of belonging and social connectedness, 50 
Bishop et al., 2022; Cruwys et al., 2014). Depressive symptoms, in turn, can lead to worsening 51 
social skills (e.g., as a result of social withdrawal, Trew, 2011) , which can in turn result in 52 
negative social interactions and new social trauma, or in losing social support (e.g., Dobson et 53 
al., 2014).2  54 
Concerning the functionality of the (social) symptoms of depression, evolutionary 55 
psychologists suggest that depressive symptoms may represent entirely adaptive res ponses to 56 
exceptionally aversive social contexts (at least in the short term), which minimize uncertainty 57 
in the social environment (e.g., "better -safe-than-sorry", Badcock et al., 2017) . Adaptive 58 
processes like the mobilization of social support may be triggered (Watson & Andrews, 2002). 59 
However, when  applied in the long term and regardless of changes in the social context, these 60 
strategies become maladaptive (Rantala et al., 2018) , with serious consequences for those 61 
affected (e.g., suicidality, Stellrecht et al., 2006). 62 
                                                 
2 Note that this aetiological model is particularly applicable to chronic forms of depression, 
where interpersonal trauma and interpersonal problems are core characteristics (Schramm et 
al., 2020).

2.  On the maintenance of social symptoms in depression 63 
One important question is why social perception and behavior do not normalize when 64 
the social context improves. Explanations from general and clinical psychology suggest several 65 
mechanisms are involved in this phenomenon - for example, learned helplessness (Seligman, 66 
1972), neurobiological dysfunction (Porcelli et al., 2019), greater neural effort processing social 67 
cues (Suffel et al., 2020), pre-operational thinking (J. P. McCullough, 2003), dysfunctional core 68 
beliefs (Beck, 1963, 1964), negative relational schemas (Baldwin, 1992), increased elaboration 69 
of negative information (Kasch et al., 2002), blunted elaboration of positive information (Chen 70 
et al., 2015), persistent negative expectations (Kube et al., 2020; Roepke & Seligman, 2016) , 71 
and cognitive immunization (Rief & Joormann, 2019). 72 
Although we believe all these factors play an important role, we suggest that it is 73 
primarily how (and by what model  of the social world) individuals with depression infer the 74 
characteristics of social contexts through social  action (e.g., social decision making) that 75 
contributes to the maintenance of these symptoms (compare with “assimilation”, Panitz et al., 76 
2021). Thus, clinical observations indicate that individuals with depressive symptoms (and 77 
specifically those with a social -trauma history) reveal distortions in exploring their 78 
interpersonal context before making social decisions (e.g., choosing to withdraw from a social 79 
situation). Instead, they stick to schema -congruent social strategies (e.g., "better -safe-than-80 
sorry", Badcock et al., 2017) that prevent new learning and promote “fitting” schema-congruent 81 
experiences ("As I said, no one talked to me at the party"). This notion is supported by research 82 
linking depression to social withdrawal (e.g., Seidel et al., 2010) , highly inhibited behavior 83 
(e.g., Kasch et al., 2002), low social information seeking, passivity and social avoidance (e.g., 84 
D’Iuso et al., 2018) , as well as higher levels of distrust, shame, and disappointment in social 85 
situations (e.g., Fernández-Theoduloz et al., 2019). There is also evidence that depressed people 86 
have difficulty drawing the right conclusions from social interactions (for an overview, see 87 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
Weightman et al., 2014) , and demonstrate aberrant patterns of reward learning and decision 88 
making in social contexts  (Safra et al., n.d., 2019). 89 
Clinicians from different theoretical backgrounds are well aware of this problem, and 90 
try to improve the inference of social contexts through psychoeducation (e.g., Cuijpers et al., 91 
2009), interpersonal context discrimination training (e.g., McCullough et al., 2014; 92 
McCullough, 2006a), behavioral activation (e.g., Uphoff et al., 2020), experiential and emotion-93 
focused techniques (e.g., Renner et al., 2013; Roediger et al., 2018), role disputes (e.g., Klerman 94 
& Weissman, 1994) , training new interpersonal skills (e.g., Bellack et al., 1996; Lipsitz & 95 
Markowitz, 2013), repeated social exposure (e.g., Muñoz et al., 2000) , disciplined personal 96 
involvement (e.g., McCullough, 2006b), and behavioral experiments (e.g., Bennett-Levy et al., 97 
2004). A systematic review by Nagy and Moore (2017) found that 17 of 24 studies which used 98 
interventions that facilitated social interaction (i.e., the sampling of social context information) 99 
reduced levels of depressive symptoms successfully. 100 
Moreover, the literature from attachment and developmental psychology suggests that 101 
the maladaptive attachment styles that can develop as a result of social trauma can trigger 102 
pathological patterns in inferring social context s in depression (Bifulco, Moran, Ball, & 103 
Bernazzani, 2002; Bifulco, Moran, Ball, & Lillie, 2002; Brophy et al., 2020; Mikulincer & 104 
Shaver, 2012; Murphy & Bates, 1997; Pettem et al., 1993; Sloman, 2003; Spruit et al., 2020) . 105 
This might be because children develop internal “representations of attachment” with  their 106 
attachment figures that serve as “templates” for interpreting and predicting behavior in later 107 
relationships (Bifulco, Moran, Ball, & Lillie, 2002, p. 60) . From this perspective, it seems 108 
plausible that depressed individuals with a primarily avoidant attachment style would seldom 109 
process social information to avoid being hurt. Vice versa, depressed individuals with a more 110 
anxious attachment style may init ially exhibit excessive attachment behavior to cope with 111 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
thwarted needs to belong, but quickly respond with anger or resignation when there is no 112 
response (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012).  113 
As we illustrate below, our computational model of biased social inference in depression 114 
offers a new  operationalization of various attachment styles in terms of concrete social 115 
interactions that extends existing computational approache s (for more details, s ee Figure 2; 116 
Cittern et al., 2018; Constant et al., 2021). 117 
To summarize: individuals with depression seem to exhibit aberrant processing of 118 
various types of social information. A multitude of empirical findings suggests biases in how 119 
they interpret social cues and problem -solving in interpersonal contexts (Bird et al., 2018; 120 
Hames et al., 2013; Kupferberg et al., 2016; Segrin, 1990, 2000; Starr & Davila, 2008; Tse & 121 
Bond, 2004; Weightman et al., 2014) . These problems often seem to persist and exacerbate 122 
negative social beliefs acquired via early -life social trauma or lack of s ocial support. 123 
Meanwhile, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly elusive. In the following paragraphs we 124 
demonstrate how recent developments in computational neuroscience can be applied to (a) 125 
unify a variety of empirical findings on social impairments in depression under a common 126 
theoretical framework, (b) improve the operationalization of social impairments in depression, 127 
(c) shed light on the elusive computa tional mechanisms underlying these impairments (e.g., 128 
why they develop, are maintained, and manifest in different ways), and (d) functionally link 129 
heterogeneous social phenomena in depression to different biases in patients’ internal social 130 
belief systems.  131 
3. Modelling biased inference of social contexts in depression  132 
3.1 Active inference  133 
In the past decades, emerging computational theories have changed the way/how we 134 
think about the mind in health and disease. In cognitive and computational neuroscience , the 135 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
active inference framework enables us to unify complex processes like perception, learning, 136 
action, and decision making under a Bayesian decision-theoretic umbrella (for a synthesis, see 137 
Da Costa et al., 2020; for decision -theoretic underpinnings, see Huys et al., 2015) . Central to 138 
active inference is the notion of the mind as an elaborate inference engine, trying to make sense 139 
of its environment from noisy, ambiguous, and partial sensory information (Friston et al., 2017).  140 
The “reality” of the external world is not directly accessible to the agent – the state of these 141 
hidden factors needs to be inferred with the help of an agent’s internal, generative model (Heins 142 
et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022b). The generative model contains the agent’s beliefs about how 143 
certain sensory information relates to an environmental factor.  In other words, how latent 144 
factors or states cause observable (sensory) consequences. This probabilistic model of the world 145 
must be continuously updated (i.e., “optimized”) by sensory input to ensure the correct 146 
inference of hidden states and for maintaining physiological – and psychosocial - homeostasis. 147 
It is matched with an agent’s prior beliefs about certain hidden states or observations (Friston 148 
et al., 2016; Smith, Badcock, et al., 2021) . Accurate priors and generative models are crucial 149 
for the agent’s survival and for maintaining physiological homeostasis (for further information, 150 
see Da Costa et al., 2020).  151 
A final component of active inference is action. By performing actions or action 152 
sequences (i.e., policies), the agent exerts an influence on hidden factors (Heins et al., 2022) . 153 
Inferring policies allows the agent to select action sequences that lead to desired or preferred 154 
sensory information, that is, actions minimize surprise in the long term. In the context of active 155 
inference, we can therefore speak of “Predictions, not Com mands” (Adams et al., 2013) : the 156 
motor system executes actions that lead to the  expected sensory information. This basic view 157 
of sentient behavior can be summarized as choosing courses of action or plans that bring about 158 
predicted consequences. This basic idea operates at the level of simple reflexes, through to 159 
social narratives. In  terms of simple movements, our actions can be viewed as fulfilling top -160 
down predictions of a proprioceptive sort that supply setpoints or equilibrium points (Feldman 161 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
& Levin, 1995). This is very reminiscent of ideomotor theory in the 19th-century (Wiese, 2017). 162 
When applied to social behaviors and decision -making, this is often cast as planning as 163 
inference (Attias, 2003; Botvinick & Toussaint, 2012; Kaplan & Friston, 2018); in other words, 164 
committing to those courses of action that minimize the deviation from predicted or expected 165 
outcomes. 166 
Mathematically speaking, we can approximate the minimizing of “surprise” by 167 
minimizing a quantity named “free energy” (FE). In the context of active inference, minimizing 168 
FE should lead to “optimal” perceptions and actions (for further information, see Friston, 2010). 169 
More generally, actions or policies are selected that minimize  expected free energy (Da Costa 170 
et al., 2021). Technically, expected free energy subsumes two kinds of (Bayes) optimality. The 171 
first reflects the propensity to bring about preferred outcomes (e.g., being at home), which are 172 
just those ‘states of being’ that characterize the decision maker or person in question. 173 
Mathematically, this preference -seeking can be read as maximizing expected value, where 174 
value is just the (log) probability of being in a characteristic state. The other part of expected 175 
free energy underwrites information -seeking and the resolution of the uncertaint y inherent in 176 
minimizing expected surprise. Mathematically, this is usually expressed as expected 177 
information gain. In short, active inference entails a joint commitment to optimal Bayesian 178 
decisions (via maximizing expected value) (Berger, 2011) while, at the same time, complying 179 
with the principles of optimum Bayesian design (via maximizing expected information gain) 180 
(Lindley, 1956; MacKay, 1992) . In effect, this accommodates the exploration -exploitation 181 
dilemma by placing epistemic and pragmatic imperatives on the same footing (Schwartenbeck 182 
et al., 2019). 183 
As a simplified example, consider a man who needs to infer his physical location in a 184 
town. He has no direct access to this information (hidden factor), but needs to infer it from the 185 
visual, auditory, and olfactory information his sensory organs take in from his environment. 186 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
The agent’s observation model contains his specific beliefs about how certain sensory 187 
information relates to a certain neighborhood or location in space (e.g., a sign to a specific area). 188 
The agent implicitly forms “hypotheses” about where he is located given his latest sensory 189 
information (the likelihood). Given such sensory information, the hypothesis with the highest 190 
posterior probability wins. Furthermore, his previous actions (i.e. walking down an avenue, 191 
then turning right, etc.) provide information about  his location in space. Future actions or 192 
policies are selected so that the agent’s desired sensory information is acquired. If the agent 193 
wants to go home, only those policies will be chosen that will lead to the expected visual, 194 
auditory, and olfactory information usually experienced while living at home.  195 
From an evolutionary psychology perspective, active inference constantly involves 196 
making a trade-off between seeking new information through action (in this example, exploring 197 
the city) and maximizing access to known rewards (returning home quickly) in order to survive 198 
in an ever-changing environment (explore vs. exploit dilemma, Gopnik, 2020; Kouvaris et al., 199 
2015). Agents failing to engage in any exploratory behavior who only seek to maximize known 200 
rewards “over -fit” their environmen t, and run the risk of being incapable of adapting to 201 
environmental changes (i.e., not finding home when the cityscape changes). Conversely, 202 
“under-fitting” agents who engage in a lot of explo 203 
atory behavior and show little reward maximization run the risk  of failing to exploit 204 
resources and rewards in order to maintain their fitness (i.e., never find home). 205 
In mental health terms, active inference suggests that mental disorders, like depression 206 
are the result of biased inference of hidden states of the wor ld (although it is probably not the 207 
inference algorithm itself that is biased, but rather the generative model to which it is applied; 208 
Schwartenbeck et al., 2015) . In this context, Bayesian formulations have proved useful in 209 
accounting for diff erent symptom domains of MDD (Chekroud, 2015; Consta nt et al., 2019; 210 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
Smith et al., 2018). Smith and colleagues (2018), for example, suggest that depressive schemas3 211 
may act as precise, internalized priors in patients with depression. Given a certain set of sensory 212 
information, the interpretation, or “hypothesis”, with the highest posterior probability is 213 
selected to explain the sensory information.4 In depression, this may be the depressive schema. 214 
Moreover, they suggest that the core symptom of psychomotor slowing and loss of energy may 215 
result from biased beliefs regarding an action’s utility in achieving a desired  sensory state 216 
(Smith et al., 2018); implicitly, the mind may infer that the cost of a certain action outweighs  217 
its utility, thus reducing an agent’s motivation for action so that the depressed person feels 218 
compelled not to leave their bed. Particularly when processing social information (Suffel et al., 219 
2020), these costs may actually be high, presumably because positive social cues are less 220 
expected. 221 
3.2 Active inference of social contexts in depression 222 
Human social interactions are marked by tremendous complexi ty. In an everyday 223 
conversation, noisy verbal - and non -verbal information needs to be considered alongside 224 
ambiguous cultural, contextual, and situational factors, all evolving very dynamically and 225 
sometimes unpredictably over time. From a Bayesian perspec tive, the social agent needs to 226 
process highly uncertain information and react appropriately in real time, a skill that most 227 
humans surprisingly master with relative ease. In depressed individuals, however, interpersonal 228 
problems are highly prevalent. We propose here that the distorted interpersonal perception and 229 
behaviors in depression are due to various biases in their generative model of the social world’s 230 
hidden states (i.e., their prior beliefs about how certain sensory information from the social 231 
                                                 
3 Here defined as “(…) maladaptive, pessimistic sets of beliefs/exp ectations that bias 
perceptual/conceptual interpretations of new sensory input, as well as the subsequent 
predictions, judgments, and decisions these interpretations inform (…)” (Smith et al., 2018, p. 
2) 
4 Please note that this inferential process is often implicit. 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
environment relates to certain characteristics of social contexts). For example, imagine a party 232 
where you only know a few people. A healthy person might go to this party with the prior belief 233 
that most of the guests will be kind, and that friendly conversati ons might ensue (prior belief 234 
that the social context will probably be positive). She will interpret the smile of someone sitting 235 
next to her as an expression of sympathy (belief that the observation “smile” is highly probable 236 
in a positive social context, and less likely in a negative social context) and would expect that 237 
she can enhance her social environment’s positive state more by starting a conversation (belief 238 
that choosing the “start a conversation” policy would likely transform the current state of  the 239 
social context into an even more positive one).  240 
In contrast, a depressed person would go to this party with the prior belief that most 241 
people will show no interest in her and that probably no one will talk to her (prior belief that 242 
the social context is likely to be negative). She will interpret the smile of the person sitting next 243 
to her as an expression of pity (belief that the “smile” observation is less probable in a positive 244 
social context, and more probable in a negative social context) and woul d expect that she can 245 
improve her social environment’s state by withdrawing socially and by not attracting attention 246 
(belief that choosing the policy “social withdrawal” would likely transform the social context’s 247 
current state into a less negative one). O n the one hand, this could bias further the social 248 
context’s inference, since the "social withdrawal" policy enables very little sensory input (e.g., 249 
the depressed person gets no information about whether they have common interests or passions 250 
with other p arty guests). This can then lead to this person's internal belief system becoming 251 
stabilized (e.g., “immunization”, Kube et al., 2020, or, “learned helplessness” Seligman, 1972). 252 
On the other hand, as a kind of self -fulfilling prophecy, this strategy could encourage the very 253 
experiences that the depressed person already feared, such as being largely ignored by other 254 
people, which could also cause the generative model to become entrenched. As a consequence, 255 
the biased inference of social contexts can trigger a self-reinforcing vicious cycle in depression 256 
that can result in increasing discord between the social environment and interpersonal behavior.  257 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
Practitioners know that abnormalities in social perception and social behavior can be 258 
very heterogeneous in depressed individuals (e.g., more avoidant vs. more hostile/suspicious 259 
interpersonal styles). We believe this can be attributed to different forms of biases within these 260 
patients’ given generative models. 5 The flexibility inherent to t he active inference approach 261 
enables us to characterize these different “phenotypes” of pathological inference in depression 262 
as well as more “healthy” forms of social inference within the same framework (see Figure 2). 263 
We elaborate on this idea in the following sections. 264 
3.3 Creating a formal model 265 
Clinical applications of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models 266 
have been described (e.g., Smith et al., 2020, 2022) . We describe here the key concepts and 267 
parameters briefly again and apply them to the active inference of social contexts during brief 268 
social interactions. Agents have beliefs about the state of a social context ( s) and about their 269 
possible action sequences in that context ( 𝜋). Agents make observations (o) mediated by their 270 
senses. Furthermore, agents have beliefs about the probability of being in a particular social 271 
context (sT) when making a particular observation ( oT). This is the agent’s observation model, 272 
which is represented by a probability distribution  p(oT|sT), containing information about how 273 
                                                 
5 In fact, any social experience and behavior must be expressed as deviations of some form in 
the probability distributions that constitute the generative model. This truism is known as the 
complete class theorem (Brown, 1981; Wald, 1947), which says that for any pair of behaviors 
and value functions, there exists some prior beliefs that render the behavior Bayes optimal. In 
short, the ideal Bayesian assumptions inherent in active inference (please see above) means 
that one can describe any behavior in terms of the agent’s prior beliefs. This is one of the 
main motivations for computational phenotyping of the sort that characterizes a patient's 
choice behavior in terms of their underlying prior beliefs (Smith, Kirlic, et al., 2021). 
 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
probable it is that states will bring about certain observations. Further, the agent entertains 274 
beliefs about the probability of transitioning from one state to another, possibly influenced by 275 
their own actions. This is represented by a probability distribution p(sT+1|sT, 𝜋). Finally, agents 276 
may possess initial beliefs about the hidden nature of a social context p(s1). 277 
[Figure 1] 278 
From the perspective of this model, social experience and behavior in depression might 279 
be attributable to deviations from healthy participants in the probability distributions mentioned 280 
above. As previously discussed, there is evidence that patients with d epression tend to have 281 
more negative beliefs about the hidden nature of social contexts. This could be modelled as a 282 
prior over the initial hidden social state ( p(s1)) – where a negative, hostile state is assigned 283 
higher prior probability than a benevolent  one at the onset of the social interaction (e.g. „they 284 
won‘t like me“). Patients may furthermore reveal biased beliefs about how likely certain 285 
observations are to occur in a given social context. For example, a patient may carry high 286 
expectations that a stranger will initiate a conversation with them if they are liked, otherwise 287 
inferring a hostile social state, i.e. that he or she is not liked by the other („if they liked me, they 288 
would approach me and start a conversation“). This factor concerns the pat ient’s observation 289 
model p(oT|sT). Patients may differ still more from non -depressed individuals in their 290 
pessimistic beliefs about how likely certain action sequences will alter the social context – 291 
socially learned helplessness would dictate that the patient’s actions would have no measurable 292 
consequences in the patient’s prediction („it wouldn‘t change anything if I smile at them“). This 293 
relates to transition-probabilities p(sT+1|sT, π).  294 
Depression is a very heterogeneous disorder which active inference  could account for 295 
by allowing for variations within the generative model. This may vary from patient to patient, 296 
depending on the individual’s learning history. For example, depressed individuals whose early 297 
attachment figures were highly impulsive and am bivalent may reveal great uncertainty about 298 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
their present social context (which would correspond to imprecise priors on initial hidden 299 
states). In contrast, depressed individuals affected by devaluing and punishing attachment 300 
figures would predict with great certainty that they find themselves in a negative social context 301 
when encountering a social situation in the present (this would correspond, in turn, to very 302 
precise priors of negative hidden states). In addition to changes in parameter p(s1), changes in 303 
our model’s other parameters lead to potentially additional problems in the inference of social 304 
contexts. For a brief outline, see Figure 2. 305 
[Figure 2] 306 
5. Implications and future research 307 
Our approach enables a new  formalization of the active inference of social context 308 
characteristics in mentally healthy and ill individuals, which allows researchers to functionally 309 
link heterogeneous social phenomena in depression to different biases in patient’s internal 310 
social belief systems. In consequence, it offers new perspectives for both etiological research 311 
in depression as well as improved diagnostics and treatment. Knowing how social trauma or the 312 
lack of social support affects certain parameters of the generative model and which parameters 313 
(or parameter configurations) are predestined for certain social experiences and behaviors has 314 
profound implications for prevention and treatment -selection, since treatment strategies affect 315 
the patient’s generative model’s parameters differently. To stay with the above -mentioned 316 
example: Individuals with "too low" and barely deviant scores on parameter p(s1) (i.e., with 317 
great uncertainty about which social context they will enter), are likely to benefit most from 318 
interventions that reduce social safety behaviors and provide consistent reinforcement schedule 319 
within the therapeutic relationship, since these interventions foster beliefs in the predictability 320 
of social contexts in the long term. Conversely, individuals with a strong negative  prior (i.e., 321 
who are deeply convinced they will enter a negative social context in the future) are more likely 322 
to benefit from reparenting techniques and interpersonal discrimination training, as they 323 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
improve social context discrimination. This example il lustrates that different parameter 324 
specifications in the generative model can lead to various treatment implications. Moreover, it 325 
illustrates how the treatment of depressive disorders can be individualized by our 326 
conceptualization, even when different distortions in the same parameter are involved.  327 
In a similar way, the approach we suggest could deepen our understanding of the neural 328 
implementation of related processes. While the literature has yielded quite heterogeneous 329 
findings on the neural correlates  of depression (Gray et al., 2020)  a better description of 330 
impairments on a computational level might reduce variability across studies and reveal more 331 
suitable approaches for tailored interventions (e.g., brain stimulation, Brunoni et al., 2017). 332 
Finally, our conceptualization of social biases in depression sheds light on the issue of 333 
treatment-resistant depression (Schramm et al., 2020). It seems plausible that the interventions 334 
these patients undergo often fail to address the “right” parameters in the respective generative 335 
models. For example, no matter how many positive social experiences a depressed patient may 336 
have with other people during ther apy, if he or she believes that positive social cues are 337 
unrelated to the social context’s actual nature (concerns the observational model p(oT|sT)), then 338 
these experiences have no impact on the generative model.  339 
From an etiological and developmental pers pective, research should examine further 340 
which social experiences affect model parameters over the life span. This would also constitute 341 
a thorough test of complex interpersonal theories on the development of depressive disorders, 342 
such as those assumed in attachment theory, schema therapy or the Cognitive -Behavioral 343 
Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP). In this context, we assume that our model can 344 
also be applied to interpersonal experience and behavior in other mental disorders like 345 
personality disorders or social phobia (e.g., Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012).  346 
Furthermore, research should focus on accurately diag nosing patient’s generative 347 
models, linking them to concrete treatment recommendations. From the practitioner's 348 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
perspective, the relevant questions are (a) how to diagnose generative models in practice and 349 
(b) which interventions are most suitable to influ ence certain model parameters. These 350 
recommendations could be followed in turn to better tailor the treatment of depressive disorders. 351 
In this context, we suggest adapting experimental paradigms from social psychology (e.g., 352 
Wirth, 2016)  or game theory (e.g., Wang et al., 2015) , as these paradigms require social 353 
decisions based on inferences about social contexts and can be easily applied in practice as well 354 
as formalized in terms of the model above (cf. Smith et al., 2022). For example, social decision 355 
making in cooperative games that require inferences about social contexts (e.g., evaluating a 356 
co-players "trustworthiness"; cf. Wang et al., 2015)  could be used to estimate the generative 357 
model of depressed patients and systematically compare it to the model of healthy controls.  In 358 
clinical practice, the availability of behavioral data throughout the diagnostic process could 359 
provide clinicians with a concrete idea of their patient's implicit internal models of their social 360 
environment. This could be exploited, again, to individualize therapies. 361 
Our proposed research agenda is in line with a broader trend away from fixed clinical 362 
categories towards a more multidimensional perspective on diagnosing mental disorders (Insel 363 
et al., 2010). Multidimensional approaches can account for heterogeneity in patient populations 364 
and shed light on shared mechanisms in what have been assumed to be distinct disorders. In the 365 
future, computational markers of depression may prove to be beneficial in arriving at a precise 366 
description and selecting optimal treatment strategies. These formalizations could objectify the 367 
diagnostics of mental disorders in general, and strengthen research on shared mechanisms. 368 
From a methodological perspective, future research should – as the first step – specify 369 
several prototypes of generative models that describe the active inference of social contexts in 370 
healthy vs. clinical samples, as well as between different "phenotypes" of the disorders under 371 
investigation. These models should be guided by theories regarding different etiologies of each 372 
disorder. As the second step, these generative models could serve to simulate behavior, and 373 
AN ACTIVE INFERENCE ACCOUNT TO SOCIAL INFERENCE IN DEPRESSION 
then matche d to empirical data from healthy and clinical samples. For example, parameter 374 
estimates could be obtained from (social) decision behavior (Smith et al., 2022b)  in standard 375 
experimental paradigms (e.g., game theoretical tasks, Wang et al., 2015) . In the final step, 376 
researchers should identify those generative models that yield the best model fit and work on 377 
interventions to optimize their parameters with respect to mental health.  378 
Finally, another important step would be to develop a model applied to describe the 379 
interaction of multiple agents with different generative POMDP models. This would enable 380 
researchers to study dynamic interaction patterns in health and disease, and their effects on the 381 
corresponding generative model of the agents involved.  382 
6. Conclusion 383 
There is broad consensus that social functioning, i.e., the anticipation, perception, and 384 
processing of social information, as well a s social behavior, is impaired in depression. We 385 
attribute these impairments primarily to deviations in patients' internal models of their social 386 
environment, leading to biased inferences about social contexts in the present. Formalizing 387 
these biases within the active inference framework and operationalizing them in the context of 388 
experimental paradigms that involve social inferences (e.g., socioeconomic decision tasks) can 389 
shed light on the wide heterogeneity of depressive symptomatology and provide insigh ts into 390 
the underlying mechanisms and configurations of patients' internal models of their social world. 391 
Determining the generative model of patients in social contexts would improve both diagnostics 392 
and research, as well as facilitate treatment selection for mental disorders. 393
