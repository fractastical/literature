Abstract: In this manuscript, we highlight the evolutionary origins of mitochondria from
bacterial endosymbionts and explore their contributions to health, energy metabolism, and
neural–immune communication. Mitochondrial adaptability and the roles played by these
organelles in promoting oxygen-dependent ATP production provide critical regulation of
cognition, motivation, and inflammation. Hypoxia has been identified as an important
initiator of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial dysfunction, emphasizing
the overall importance of oxygen homeostasis to health and well-being. The Behavior,
Exercise, Relaxation, and Nutrition framework highlights these observations as tools that
can be used to optimize mitochondrial efficiency. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction
may also be linked to psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), a hypothesis that focuses
on energy dynamics, a proposal that may extend our understanding of these disorders
beyond traditional neurotransmitter-focused concepts. Collectively, these perspectives
underscore the critical contributions of mitochondria to health and disease and offer a novel
framework that may help to explain the connections featured in mind–body medicine.

1. Introduction
The presence of an evolutionarily conserved set of signaling molecules across diverse
life forms strongly suggests the existence of a broad intermediate metabolic profile that
relies on the high output of mitochondrial ATP [ 1]. Interestingly, the presence of salt
minerals, amino acids, and all five DNA and RNA nucleobases on asteroid (101955) Bennu
suggests that Earth may have been seeded with the essential building blocks for life, poten-
tially supporting the planet’s biological evolution [2,3] (Figure 1). Established mechanisms
of bidirectional neural–immune communication [4–6] observed in both invertebrate and
vertebrate species require shared anatomical and biochemical substrates that contribute
to both energy production and mitochondrial integrity. Within this interconnected net-
work, tissue-specific disruptions can have profound and far-reaching effects on several
associated systems (e.g., the central nervous system [CNS]). Given the need for a consistent
oxygen supply, the primary trigger for physiologically dysfunctional responses might be

a comparatively simple hypoxic event [ 1,7,8]. While brief fluctuations in oxygen levels
can be tolerated, unresolved hypoxic events may initiate a cascade of self-amplifying
pro-inflammatory responses [1] (Figure 1), notably, increased levels of circulating hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, and C-reactive protein [9–11].
Interestingly, a state of excess oxygen, or hyperoxia, can also induce an inflammatory
response [12].
Interestingly, hypoxia has emerged as a potentially effective treatment for neurodegen-
eration associated with Leigh’s syndrome, an inherited disorder resulting from deleterious
mutations in the mitochondrial electron transport chain [ 13,14]. Jain et al. [ 15] reported
that chronic hypoxia led to prolonged survival and improved locomotion of Ndufs4-/-
Leigh syndrome mice and that the biochemical HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, FG-4592,
stabilized HIF-1-mediated transcription in several antimycin- or oligomycin-treated human
cell lines and genetically engineered zebrafish embryos maintained under normoxic condi-
tions. Results from a subsequent study by Ferrari et al. [16] confirmed that chronic hypoxia
prolonged the survival of Ndufs4-/- mice and could reverse parenchymal inflammation
and atrophy characteristic of late-stage disease. While the mechanisms underlying these
pathways await future study, there is already some evidence linking Leigh syndrome to the
pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease [17,18]. Although at first glance contradictory, this
provides further evidence of the important and fine-tuned interplay between mitochondria
and the cellular microenvironment under altered oxygen conditions, promoting oxygen
homeostasis and reciprocal protection.
Figure 1. Evolutionary events that unfolded during the earliest stages of the Universe laid the
foundations for life on Earth. Evidence of these events remains in the form of primordial molecules
that have been detected on asteroids traveling in our solar system. Our current understanding
suggests that the Earth maintained uniquely stable and hospitable thermodynamic conditions that
facilitated further growth. Alkaline thermal vents provided the necessary energy needed by molecular
fragments (for example, early nucleic acids) to combine and evolve. Environmental phase differences
facilitated the formation of coacervate-like droplets containing RNA and environmental DNA (eDNA,
i.e., extracellular DNA that can be detected in the environment), eventually giving rise to primitive
membranes. Membrane development represented a critical advance, as these structures promote
molecular stability and thus may facilitate efficient and rapid evolution, leading to the emergence of
viral and prokaryotic life forms. Oxygen, a highly reactive and potentially toxic molecule, became
a central focus after the development of organisms capable of photosynthesis. Ultimately, several
bacterial species evolved the capacity to metabolize oxygen via pathways that simultaneously reduced
the toxicity of this molecule and harnessed it for energy production. Endosymbiosis was a clear next
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 3 of 14
step after this pivotal adaptation. Early pre-eukaryotic cells were “infected” and eventually incorpo-
rated/infected the oxygen-metabolizing bacteria that ultimately evolved to become mitochondria
and mitochondria-related organelles (MROs), which are simpler versions of mitochondria found in
eukaryotes living in low-oxygen environments. Over time, this relationship led to a refined version
of intracellular communication. The mitochondria were tasked with oxygen detoxification, which at
the same time provided energy and supported various metabolic functions in the host cell. Oxygen
remains a fundamental regulator of mitochondrial activity. The evolutionary constraints in response
and sensitivity to environmental pressures that led to the emergence of eukaryotic single cells even-
tually gave rise to multicellular organisms that were shaped by cell-to-cell interactions. Of note,
although mitochondria are capable of counteracting oxygen toxicity, they eventually succumb to the
long-term effects of their own metabolic byproducts. Over an organism’s lifetime, mitochondrial
metabolic imbalance can disrupt energy homeostasis. This response gradually harks back to the
initial infectious nature of mitochondria that was once obscured by their perceived symbiotic role.
Modified from [19].
Mitochondria evolved from an ancestral bacterial species that established a symbiotic
relationship with an early pre-eukaryotic cell [20–22] (Figure 1). This partnership likely per-
sisted because the bacteria provided the eukaryotic cell with the capacity to detoxify oxygen
generated by photosynthesis while boosting cellular energy production [21,22]. Although
mitochondria were traditionally not considered “alive” because they were believed to be
incapable of surviving independently, more recent findings reveal that mitochondria have
their own DNA and can replicate autonomously within host cells. Functional mitochondria
can also exist in the extracellular space [23], where they regulate cell-to-cell communica-
tion, tissue regeneration, and immune responses [24–26] and have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of CNS disorders [27].
Mitochondria exhibit remarkable evolutionary plasticity, with the capacity to support
anaerobic metabolism via transformation into hydrogenosomes, mitosomes, and interme-
diate forms collectively known as mitochondrion-related organelles [20]. These findings
underscore the multifaceted roles played by mitochondria in both energy metabolism and
as a force promoting the complexity of eukaryotic life [21,28]. Mitochondrial adaptability
to diverse environments and the selective pressures that they impose have been pivotal in
the origin and ongoing maintenance of eukaryotic cell complexity [28].
Mitochondria are uniquely positioned at the intersection of bioenergetics, redox sig-
naling, and neuroimmune regulation. Thus, a specific focus on mitochondrial biology and
function will provide mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of cognitive and psychi-
atric disorders beyond what is offered if one maintains a singular focus on protein synthesis
or membrane transport. In contrast to these processes, which are frequently downstream
or compartmentalized, mitochondrial function directly governs neuronal excitability, neu-
rotransmitter synthesis, synaptic plasticity, and stress responsivity by tightly coupling
ATP production, calcium buffering, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) to
meet cellular demands [29,30]. Mitochondria are especially critical in the brain due to the
high and fluctuating energy demands of synaptic transmission and plasticity, processes
that are foundational to learning, memory, and emotional regulation [31]. Mitochondria
also modulate neuroinflammation through redox-sensitive pathways and the release of
damage-associated molecular patterns. For example, mitochondrial DNA released from
cells can activate innate immune sensors such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, providing a
direct link between mitochondrial distress and psychiatric symptoms [32,33]. Furthermore,
psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) are increasingly
associated with altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and
mitochondria–nuclear communication imbalances—features that are not readily explained
by disruptions in protein synthesis or membrane function alone [ 31]. Moreover, recent
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 4 of 14
evidence suggests that mitochondrial-targeted interventions (e.g., NAD+ boosters, antiox-
idants, and lifestyle factors/activators of mitochondrial biogenesis) can modulate both
mood and cognitive outcomes [34,35]. Therefore, mitochondrial biology offers a multi-scale,
integrative framework for understanding how stress, metabolism, and immunity converge
to promote brain dysfunction.
Here, we begin by reviewing earlier findings on the impact of biological stresses
(notably, hypoxia and inflammation) on mitochondrial function and the overall efficiency
of energy production. We then go on to consider the contributions of these phenomena to
our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying mind–body medicine and the
pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease.
2. Molecular Mind–Body Platform
Behaviorally mediated practices eliciting the relaxation response [ 36] likely func-
tion effectively because they support the synchronization of the peripheral nervous sys-
tem and the CNS [ 7,8]. The results of several studies suggest that controlled breathing
exercises may promote reductions in respiratory rate, heart rate variability, and blood
pressure [37–39]. Taking this one step further, we hypothesize that the neurocognitive
pathways associated with pain, pleasure, and motivation may rely on the synchroniza-
tion of energy metabolism based on a shared dependency on common networks and that
synchronized energy metabolism is likely critical for the effective functioning of neurocog-
nitive pathways associated with pain and pleasure (and likely others). While pain and
pleasure pathways are linked mechanistically by shared neurotransmitter signaling (as
reviewed in [40]), the CNS as a whole is critically dependent on mitochondrial function in
neurons as the main source of ATP [41]. ATP is needed to maintain membrane potentials,
synthesize neurotransmitters, and regulate synaptic activity [ 31]. We hypothesize that
the mitochondrial activity must be synchronized across these shared circuits to ensure a
balanced energy supply [42]. Disruptions in mitochondrial function secondary to changes
in physiologic parameters and oxygen availability create a bioenergetic imbalance that may
interfere with the balanced functioning of these pathways and thus contribute to conditions
such as chronic pain, anhedonia, and mood disorders [43,44].
The central mediators of neurocognitive responses include the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC); others include the an-
terior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, somatosensory cortex, lateral prefrontal
cortex (LPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), frontal eye fields, posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (Figure 2). As a group, these central
structures exhibit significant overlap and interdependence with respect to their roles in
supporting cognition, pain, pleasure, and motivation [45–49], relying on integrated neural
networks in which each region contributes specialized tasks to produce coherent experi-
ences and behaviors. For example, the mesolimbic pathway [50] (which includes the VTA
and the NAc) links pleasure and motivation, with dopamine release in the NAc modulated
by cognitive input from the PFC, i.e., mesocortical system. The salience network [ 51]
(including the ACC, insula, and thalamus) balances pain, emotional significance, and
motivation (Figure 2). Additionally, the default mode (the dmPFC and PCC) and executive
control networks (including the PPC and LPFC) collaborate to support goal maintenance
and adaptive responses. For example, a motivational response to a challenge begins with
sensory inputs processed in the thalamus and somatosensory cortex, evaluated by the
insula and ACC, reinforced by reward signals from the VTA and NAc, and culminating in
goal-directed planning in the PFC [52]. Importantly, pain perception and emotional valence
are processed, in part, by interoceptive signaling [53]. In this pathway, the ACC has a role
in generating the emotional and evaluative components of pain [54]. The somatosensory
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 5 of 14
cortex is responsible for detecting and localizing pain stimuli, and the thalamus relays
these sensory inputs to higher-order regions of the brain. Meanwhile, the PFC modulates
the cognitive appraisal of pain, including coping strategies [55].
Figure 2. Mitochondria contribute to both energy production and oxygen detoxification processes
that support the evolution of diverse eukaryotic cells as well as complex multicellular organisms.
Energy availability, a critical factor leading to the evolution of complex life forms [56,57], most likely
facilitated the development of interconnected neural networks that shape behaviors and responses
essential for survival, including pleasure, pain perception, and cognition. These networks include the
Reward Network, a CNS pathway that includes the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and
prefrontal cortex), the Pain Network (including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, and
somatosensory cortex), and the Executive Network (including the lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior
parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Interactions between these
networks provide multicellular organisms with functional advantages when novel adaptive behaviors
and survival strategies are needed.
A sustained oxygen supply is essential for cellular and systemic health. Hypoxic
events can disrupt this balance, triggering inflammatory cascades and potentially leading
to neurodegeneration and other systemic pathologies [1]. Perturbations in one area, such
as mitochondrial dysfunction or tissue-specific inflammation, can have cascading effects on
other interconnected systems, particularly the nervous system. Furthermore, prolonged or
unresolved hypoxic events can activate and amplify pro-inflammatory pathways, leading
to biological senescence (i.e., aging at the cellular level), energy deficits, and systemic
decline.
Neural circuits have significantly different metabolic demands, and this variability
contributes to their differential sensitivity to oxygen deprivation. Executive networks, such
as the prefrontal cortex, and reward-related areas such as the ventral striatum and midbrain
dopamine system, are among the most energy-demanding circuits in the brain due to their
high synaptic activity, dense connectivity, and reliance on oxidative metabolism [31,58].
The prefrontal cortex, in particular, demonstrates elevated glucose utilization and oxidative
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 6 of 14
phosphorylation rates (i.e., functions tightly coupled to mitochondrial ATP production)
when engaged in tasks that require sustained attention, working memory, and decision
making [59]. Similarly, midbrain dopamine neurons involved in reward signaling exhibit
high basal firing rates and are especially vulnerable to hypoxic and oxidative stress due
to their large axonal arborization and pacemaking activity [31,60]. The results of several
experimental studies revealed that these regions exhibit early functional impairment during
hypoxia or ischemia; by contrast, lower-order sensory areas exhibit greater resilience [61,62].
Thus, the selective vulnerability of executive and reward circuits to hypoxic conditions
appears to be closely linked to their intrinsic energy demands and limited metabolic reserve.
Further comparative metabolic studies will be needed to provide detailed support for the
apparent differential oxygen sensitivity.
The Behavior, Exercise, Relaxation, and Nutrition (BERN) mind–body operational
framework for healthy living [ 63] is based on many of these aforementioned principles
(Figure 3) [64,65]. Different BERN techniques designed to promote health behavior change
may act via shared autoregulatory CNS reward and motivation circuits [66]. Mind–body
processes emphasize the links between health, energy regulation, and neural integrity. As
noted above, the neural and immune systems are linked to one another and share both
anatomical and biochemical feedback pathways [67,68]. This communication ensures coor-
dinated responses to environmental and physiological changes and highlights mechanisms
that include integrated defense, repair mechanisms, and energy sharing. Taken together,
these findings lead us to conclude that supporting appropriate mitochondrial function,
maintaining oxygen homeostasis, and mitigating inflammation are all strategies that might
be used to sustain mind–body health and prevent pathophysiological outcomes.
Figure 3. Mitochondria are integral protective and energy-generating cellular components that
function continuously and consume oxygen (O2), thereby also reducing oxygen-related toxicity (i.e.,
oxidative stress); their capacity to sense and respond to O2 is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic life.
Chronic disorders arise, at least in part, when mitochondria become incapable of efficient oxygen
metabolism. HIF-1-mediated hypoxia is a critical trigger of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and
mitochondrial dysfunction [69,70]. These broad-reaching observations reinforce the essential role
of oxygen homeostasis in maintaining health and well-being. The Behavior, Exercise, Relaxation,
and Nutrition (BERN) framework highlights several essential tools that may be used to optimize
mitochondrial efficiency and resilience. Life is typically defined by an organism’s ability to grow,
reproduce, respond to stimuli, metabolize, and maintain internal stability. Both viruses and mitochon-
dria display many of these traits, extending the definition of what might be considered truly alive.
Viruses can replicate under specific conditions, influence cellular metabolism, and evolve rapidly
by adapting to their environments. Likewise, although they are now integrated within eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria originated from free-living bacteria and still retain some independence, including
the ability to function outside the cell. Both entities likely emerged from early life-like systems, for
example, coacervates, which are droplets rich in genetic material(possibly environmental DNA) that
facilitated rapid mutation and adaptation. While mitochondria are essential for energy production
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 7 of 14
and oxygen regulation in cells, prolonged activity can lead to damaging byproducts, including ROSs,
which are linked to aging and disease [19]. Further information on the theoretical framework of BERN
as well as its scientific evidence and clinical mind–body medical applications, i.e., their empirical and
practical validation, can be found in [63,71–86] and references within.
The BERN process recognizes the need to balance energy, oxygen, and communication
within the body and emphasizes the importance of maintaining equilibrium as a means
to support long-term health and resilience. The BERN framework is based on mind–body
practices that focus on cellular and molecular processes that have evolved for over two
billion years to promote health and longevity.
Mitochondrial function plays a central role in sustaining mind–body health by inte-
grating metabolic energy production with cellular signaling pathways that regulate stress
responses, inflammation, and oxygen sensing. As the primary site of oxidative phosphory-
lation, mitochondria are responsible for generating the ATP needed to support neuronal
activity, hormonal regulation, and immune competence, processes that are fundamental
to both cognitive and physiological well-being [ 87]. Mitochondria also serve as oxygen
sensors by helping to maintain oxygen homeostasis by regulating ROSs and stabilizing
hypoxia-inducible factors, which coordinate adaptive responses to stress and low oxygen
availability [88]. Disruptions in mitochondrial respiration or redox signaling can impair
one or more of these compensatory mechanisms. This can lead to chronic inflammation, ox-
idative stress, and metabolic dysfunction, all hallmarks of many diverse pathophysiological
states, including depression, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration [ 89]. Anti-
inflammatory signaling mediated through mitochondrial pathways, including activation
of sirtuin 3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, and
mitophagy, contributes to the resolution of systemic inflammation and promotes resilience
in both brain and body systems [90].
3. Psychiatric Ramifications
Mitochondria and their contributions to oxygen/energy processing may have a pro-
found albeit incompletely understood role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disor-
ders [90,91]. Among the many examples, Andreazza and colleagues [92] reported increases
in protein oxidation and nitration in association with diminished mitochondrial complex
I activity in a series of postmortem samples of frontal cortex from patients diagnosed
with bipolar disorder. Scaini and colleagues [ 93] reported differential gene expression,
suggesting mitochondrial fragmentation in leukocytes from patients with major depressive
disorder; more recently, Ye and colleagues identified circulating mitochondrial DNA as a
biomarker for this disorder [94]. In 2022, Roberts [95] published a comprehensive review
on mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia, highlighting deficits in mitochondrial
gene expression, electron transport chain components, as well as diminished numbers of
mitochondria in axon terminals and oligodendrocytes throughout the cerebral cortex.
Mitochondria are far more than cellular powerhouses; they are sensitive, adaptive hubs
that facilitate internal communication and cellular responses to their environment. Their
ability to sense changes in oxygen levels, energy demand, calcium levels, and stress allows
them to adjust energy production in real time, support survival, and initiate protective
responses when needed [ 96]. These properties, collectively defined as mitochondrial
sensitivity, are especially vital in energy-demanding tissues such as the brain, where the
precision of neuronal signaling depends on the availability of a constant, well-regulated
energy supply. Here, mitochondria provide energy to processes such as neurotransmitter
release and network synchronization, which are essential for memory, attention, and
perception [31,58]. The link between energy production and communication illustrates the
concept of energy-based information exchange, which is the idea that living systems use
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 8 of 14
energy not just to function, but to carry and process information. When mitochondrial
function is disrupted, energy–information coupling breaks down, contributing to cognitive
decline and disease [ 97]. Thus, mitochondria play a unique and dynamic role in both
sensing internal conditions and enabling cells to communicate through energy processing.
In addition to our current understanding of the outcomes of mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, the predictive processing hypothesis offers a novel framework for understanding
psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia [98]. The predictive processing hypothesis sug-
gests that the disturbed neuronal communication characteristic of this disorder arises from
perturbations in energy-based information exchange. Energy-based information exchange,
which focuses primarily on learned stimulus thresholds (i.e., experience), operates in a
top-down manner with external sensory inputs undergoing constant evaluation. In this
process, external sensory signals are constantly adjusted to match the expectations and
ultimately transferred together with unresolved noise (i.e., prediction errors) to deeper
neural structures in which information is processed based on one’s recognition of the
stimulus (i.e., signal) and its similarity to earlier experiences. Initially unmatching stimuli
(i.e., signals that are not recognized) will cause disruptions in communication and an
increase in free energy (or entropy). The excess free energy generated by communication
disruptions must be reduced if the system is to regain equilibrium and restore healthy
cognitive functioning. Mitochondrial dysfunction may disrupt the pathways involved in
reducing free energy, which may ultimately lead to a mismatch of information processing.
Here, we are referring to the “free-energy principle” as defined by neuroscientists, meaning
the theory that the brain attempts to reduce variational free energy as a way to reduce
uncertainty and maintain a stable state. First introduced by Karl Friston [99], this principle
proposes that the brain maintains homeostasis by reducing variational free energy, which
is a proxy for surprise or prediction error. Based on this principle, neural circuits act as
predictive engines, forming internal models that anticipate sensory inputs and update them
through prediction error signals, thereby conserving energy and optimizing function [100].
The efficient coding hypothesis [101] provides strong support for this concept. This
hypothesis suggests that sensory neurons encode stimuli with minimal redundancy. For
example, retinal and cortical neurons respond more strongly to novel stimuli than to
predictable ones, thereby reducing unnecessary spikes and metabolic load [ 58]. This is
extended by predictive coding models, such as those proposed by Rao and Ballard [102],
that describe cortical hierarchies that transmit predictions. Only mismatched signals
(prediction error) are transmitted upward, a process that facilitates focused and energy-
efficient signaling.
Similarly, results from empirical studies revealed that neurons in the visual cortex
increase their activity when confronted with omissions or other unexpected phenomena.
For example, Keller et al. [103] reported that mice trained in virtual environments displayed
anticipatory neural activity in V1 and heightened responses when expected stimuli were
omitted. These effects are mediated by feedback from higher-order areas, for example, the
anterior cingulate cortex, emphasizing top-down modulation of predictive processing.
Sensorimotor systems are also based on energy-based predictive exchange. Forward
models predict sensory consequences during movement, which dampen the responses to
self-generated stimuli via a mechanism known as sensory attenuation [ 104]. This mech-
anism conserves energy by avoiding redundant processing. In the cerebellum, climbing
fibers encode motor prediction errors and can thus drive adaptation to minimize future
mismatch [105].
Reward-related circuits also illustrate this principle. Dopaminergic neurons encode
reward prediction errors: they fire when outcomes deviate from expectations, thereby
facilitating learning [106]. These phasic signals allocate neural and metabolic resources
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 5491 9 of 14
to stimuli and events that are unexpected, and thus informative. Limbic areas (e.g., the
orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) also generate predictions regarding emotional
and interoceptive states and thus contribute to adaptive allostasis [107].
The term “mismatch” refers to the match/mismatch hypothesis, which posits that
individuals’ responses and behaviors are influenced by the degree of match or mismatch
between their current experiences and their expectations based on past experiences [99,108].
Ongoing stress may further exacerbate these problems, thereby creating false associations
underlying symptoms (e.g., hallucinations) [98]. The principles of the energy-mismatch
model go beyond the limitations of traditional views and provide an approach that may not
depend directly or completely on specific neurotransmitters [98]. For example, the energy-
match model also facilitates cognitive in silico modeling based on neuronal energy transfer
and exchange, rather than remaining limited to the variability of neurotransmitter profiles.
At its core, the energy-mismatch hypothesis is a straightforward and transformative concept
that considers brain function by analogy to a computer operation.
Recent work reinforces these principles through computational modeling and neu-
roimaging. Bakhtiari [ 109] showed that artificial neural networks trained under energy
constraints spontaneously develop predictive coding architectures. Meta-analyses per-
formed by Ficco et al. [110] identified a common prediction-error network across sensory
modalities, including the insula and frontal regions. Taken together, these findings support
the conclusion that neural systems can reduce free energy and optimize energetic efficiency
through predictive processing across sensory, motor, and emotional domains.
4. Evolutionary Efficiency
As described above, specific regions in the CNS perform distinct roles but are also
capable of dynamic interactions that enable the brain to synthesize diverse neural activities
into cohesive human behavior [111]. This shared anatomical and physiological framework
features an evolutionarily economical strategy for survival in which multitasking centers
efficiently mediate complex behaviors. However, ongoing rapid integration of interde-
pendent CNS processes depends on immediate energy availability, primarily through
mitochondrial activity [ 7]. Acute and chronic hypoxia provide critical input to ensure
that neural networks respond appropriately to a given stress [ 112–114]. Thus, it is per-
haps not surprising that mitochondrial sensitivity and dysfunctional responses to hypoxia
might have an immediate impact on cognitive behavior. Tapping into this sensitivity also
manifests itself in various disorders as well as in response to pathological agents, further
highlighting the significance of oxygen for effective signal integration.
5. Conclusions
In summary, mitochondria represent a pivotal evolutionary innovation in which an-
cestral bacteria were transformed into energy powerhouses that provide essential support
for eukaryotic complexity and maintain systemic health. Mitochondria are also critical
features of bidirectional neural–immune communication and adaptive responses that rely
on oxygen-driven ATP production. The interplay between hypoxia-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction and dysregulated energy metabolism has been identified as a critical trigger
of inflammation, which can lead to systemic decline, neurodegeneration [ 115], and dys-
functional neurocognition. The BERN framework focuses on behavior, exercise, relaxation,
and nutrition as a means to optimize mitochondrial efficiency and physiological resilience.
Collectively, these insights underscore the pivotal role of mitochondria in sustaining health
and longevity and offer a fresh perspective on our understanding of mental health and
neuropsychiatric disease.
