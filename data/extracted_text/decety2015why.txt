The past decades have seen an explosion of studies on empathy in various academic
domains including affective neuroscience, psychology, medicine, and economics.
However, the volumes of research have almost exclusively focused on its evolutionary
origins, development, and neurobiological bases, as well as how the experience of
empathy is modulated by social context and interpersonal relationships. In the present
paper, we examine a much less attended side of empathy: why it has a positive impact
on others? After specifying what the construct of empathy encompasses, we brieﬂy
review the various effects of empathy on health outcomes in the domain of medicine.
We then propose two non-mutually exclusive mechanistic explanations that contribute
to explain the positive effects of physician empathy on patients. (1) The social baseline
theory (SBT), building on social support research, proposes that the presence of other
people helps individuals to conserve metabolically costly somatic and neural resources
through the social regulation of emotion. (2) The free energy principle (FEP) postulates
that the brain optimizes a (free energy) bound on surprise or its complement value to
respond to environmental changes adaptively. These conceptualizations can be combined
to provide a unifying integrative account of the beneﬁts of physicians’ empathetic attitude
on their patients and how it plays a role in healing beyond the mere effect of the therapeutic
alliance.

INTRODUCTION
It is widely agreed upon that empathy is a good thing, and
that it should be the basis of attitudes towards patient care,
or should at least play an important role in the doctor-patient
relationship alongside deductive logic, physical examinations, and
treatment. More and more often, medical education underscores
the importance of empathy in medicine, and a growing number of
medical schools have speciﬁc educational programs and initiatives
for their students (Shapiro, 2012). In parallel, during the past
decades, a wealth of studies and theoretical research has examined
the construct of empathy from numerous perspectives including
philosophy, psychology, clinical neuroscience, and affective and
social neuroscience (Farrow and Woodruff, 2007; Decety and
Ickes, 2009; Coplan and Goldie, 2011; Decety, 2012; Coutinho
et al., 2014). However, most of this academic research has focused
on the empathizer (i.e., the person who experiences empathy),
and much less effort has been directed toward proposing a mech-
anistic explanation of why empathy positively impacts the other
(i.e., the person who receives empathy).
In this article, we examine the current knowledge in neu-
roscience to offer an integrative and comprehensive perspective
on the neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms that underlie
the positive role of empathy in medicine. The avenues by which
empathy affects the well-being of the recipient may be very diverse
and include both dispositional and situational factors. We begin
by examining what the notion of empathy comprises. Next, we
brieﬂy review the evidence supporting the positive inﬂuence of
empathy on health outcomes in the context of medicine. We
then propose that two theoretical frameworks, the social baseline
theory (SBT) and the free energy principle (FEP), contribute
in explaining the positive effects of empathy on various health
outcomes, including pain-related variables.
EMPATHY IS ABOUT EMOTION AND CARING
A fundamental assumption of emotion theory is that emo-
tion is an automatic orienting system that evolved to guide
adaptive behavior. Emotion is also, however, a means of inter-
personal communication that evokes responses from other con-
speciﬁcs. Thus, emotions can be viewed both as intrapersonal
and interpersonal states, and the construct of empathy incor-
porates both such dimensions (Decety and Skelly, 2014), and
reﬂects an intersubjective induction process by which positive
and negative emotions are shared, without losing sight of whose
feelings belong to whom (Decety and Meyer, 2008). Empirical

Decety and Fotopoulou Impact of empathy on others in medicine
and theoretical work in developmental science, psychology, and
affective neuroscience converge to consider empathy as a nat-
ural competency that has evolved with the mammalian brain
to form and maintain social bonds, necessary for surviving,
reproducing and maintaining well being, and which comprises
dissociable facets (Decety and Svetlova, 2012; Decety et al., 2012).
These different components include: (1) Affective sharing, the
ﬁrst element of empathy to appear during ontogeny. It reﬂects
the capacity to become affectively aroused by the valence and
intensity of others’ emotions. (2) Empathic understanding, which
entails the conscious awareness of the emotional state of another
person. (3) Empathic concern, which refers to the motivation
to care for someone’s welfare. (4) Cognitive empathy, similar
to the construct of perspective taking or theory of mind is the
ability to put oneself into the mind of another individual and
imagine what that person is thinking or feeling (Decety and
Jackson, 2004; Goubert et al., 2009; Singer and Lamm, 2009;
Derntl et al., 2010; Decety, 2011; Decety and Cowell, 2014).
Given these multifaceted aspects of empathy, there is no sin-
gle region in the brain that underlies this ability. Rather, the
circuits involved in emotional saliency (amygdala, insula and
anterior cingulate cortex), central executive network (dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex), and caregiv-
ing (brainstem, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex) constitute independent and tightly coupled
networks that support the experience of empathy (Decety and
Cowell, 2014). Furthermore, the neural pathways involved empa-
thy and caring are facilitated and modulated by neuroendocrine
mechanisms. In particular, the neuropeptide oxytocin, which
plays a general role in social interactions by reducing stress and
anxiety (Anacker and Beery, 2013; Cardoso et al., 2013), and
as a result enhances cognitive empathy (Rodrigues et al., 2009)
and empathic concern (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2013; Smith et al.,
2014).
In medicine, empathy is generally conceptualized as a commu-
nication competence, as well as a subjective experience between
an observer (the physician) and a subject (the patient or client),
in which the observer, uses various sensory cues (body lan-
guage, prosody, etc.), to identify and transiently experience
the subject’s emotional states (Hirsch, 2007). The physician’s
emotional attunement serves the cognitive goal of understand-
ing patients’ emotions (Halpern, 2012). Additionally, empa-
thy is generally viewed by the patient as the doctor’s ability
to understand how he/she feels and thinks, as well as how
the doctor expresses concern, compassion, and care for the
patient’s own well-being. Both of these aspects contribute to
patient satisfaction. Thus, in the medical context, all facets of
empathy (affective, cognitive, and motivational) are important
and can be adaptively engaged to positively inﬂuence patients’
health.
EMPATHY AND COMPASSIONATE HEALTH CARE
In spite of the conceptual diversity that characterizes the notion
of empathy, this concept is widely used in patient-centered
practices and increasingly prominent in contemporary medi-
cal education (Pedersen, 2010). It is worth noting, however,
that some authors argue that empathy is neither necessary nor
sufﬁcient to guarantee good medicine (Smajdor et al., 2011).
While empathy has always been considered an essential compo-
nent of compassionate care, in the past years, there has been a
veritable tsunami of publications on the importance of empa-
thy in patient care, how it can be improved, and how it can
be taught in medical school. A Google search with “teach-
ing empathy to medical students” gives over 1,410,000 hits
(Figure 1).
There are several reasons why empathy can be valuable in
medical practice, and these explain the surge of interest and
enthusiasm in the concept with regards to patient-physician
relationships. For instance, in the practice of psychiatry and
clinical psychology, an empathetic attitude allows the therapist to
gather invaluable information about the patient and contributes
to building the reliable, trustworthy relationship that lies at the
heart of real safety and growth in therapy. Clinical empathy is
also an important element of quality health care in medicine.
Physicians who attempt to understand what their patients are
feeling, whether they are successful (empathic accuracy) or just
genuinely communicating their concern (empathic concern),
achieve a number of valuable outcomes for their patients (Mercer
and Reynolds, 2002). Moreover, such communication takes place
with both verbal and non-verbal means. For example, a doctor’s
caring touch as opposed to a diagnostic touch is perceived as
conveying clinical empathy and promotes healing (Montague
et al., 2013).
More importantly for the scope of our argument, patient
perception of physician’s empathy is associated with various
improved health outcomes. Patients give fuller histories, disclos-
ing more to physicians who are non-verbally attuned to them
(Halpern, 2012). Empathic communication is associated with
improved patient satisfaction, increased adherence to treatment,
and fewer malpractice complaints, as well as increased physician
health, well-being, and professional satisfaction (Riess et al., 2012;
Gleichgerrcht and Decety, 2013).
Importantly, cognitive empathy can improve patient satisfac-
tion. In a randomized study, student–clinicians who were given
a perspective-taking intervention received signiﬁcantly better
patient satisfaction scores from standardized patients than did
controls (Blatt et al., 2010). Several empirical studies reported
that patients’ perceptions of their physicians’ empathy are pos-
itively related to more favorable health outcomes. One study
found that diabetic patients of physicians with high empathy
scores were signiﬁcantly more likely to have good control of
hemoglobin A1c than were patients of physicians with low empa-
thy scores (Hojat et al., 2011). Logistic regression analyses demon-
strated that physicians’ empathy had a unique contribution to
the prediction of optimal clinical outcomes after controlling for
physicians’ and patients’ gender and age, and patients’ health
insurance.
Empathic concern has been strongly implicated in patient
adherence to medical regimens, with research documenting a
direct relationship between patient-perceived physician empathy
and increased satisfaction with and compliance to treatment.
For instance, a large scale study reported that clinician empathy
and caring attitude, as perceived by patients with the common
cold, signiﬁcantly predicted subsequent duration and severity

of illness and was associated with more robust immune system
responses, as measured by levels of inﬂammatory cytokine in
nasal secretions (Rakel et al., 2009). T o explore the factors
associated with patient enablement in general practice consul-
tations, one study of over 3,044, showed that patients’ percep-
tions of the doctors’ empathy was of key importance in their
enablement in general practice consultations in both high and
low deprivation settings individuals (Mercer et al., 2012). In
addition, maximal patient enablement was never found with
low empathy.
In medicine, empathy has important implications, not only
for the patient health outcomes, but also for physician success.
Doctors who show empathy have less malpractice complaints
and better patient satisfaction and compliance (Huntington and
Kuhn, 2003). This ﬁnding is especially notable, as there are areas
in the United States where the cost of malpractice insurance can
be prohibitive, causing physicians to leave medicine (Huntington
and Kuhn, 2003). A meta-analysis, reviewing contextual effects
related to the patient-practitioner relationship in clinical popu-
lations with a physical illness, reported that while there is much
inconsistency regarding the effect of emotional and cognitive care,
physicians who adopt a warm, friendly, and reassuring manner are
more effective than those who keep consultations formal and do
not offer reassurance (Di Blasi et al., 2001). Mindfulness-based
interventions that enhance attention, awareness, and communi-
cation skills, increase empathy and improve the physician’s well
being and emotional stability (Krasner et al., 2009).
While it is true that most studies of the effect of the patient-
clinician relationship on medical outcomes are observational
in nature and therefore cannot assess causality, a recent meta-
analysis of thirteen randomized controlled trials indicates that
relationship factors between physician and patients hold an
important potential that affects health outcomes (Kelley et al.,
2014).
It is important to note that being too empathetic can be
costly for the health care practitioner (Gleichgerrcht and Decety,
2012). However, research suggests that a modicum level of per-
sonal distress (or emotional sharing/attunement), is necessary
for the physicians’ professional quality of life (Gleichgerrcht and
Decety, 2014). Because physicians are exposed to high levels of
negative emotions in stressful environments, they can indeed
develop compassion fatigue and severe emotional exhaustion
(Figley, 2012), which may impede the delivery of quality medical
care and increase the risk of medical errors. Thus, it can be

challenging for health-care professionals to ﬁnd a delicate balance
between over-identiﬁcation with their patients and emotional
detachment. Therefore, emotional regulation skills are critical
for physicians to keep their emotions under control and main-
tain personal stability (Cheng et al., 2007; Decety, 2009; Decety
et al., 2010). Psychological and neuroscience research indicate
that individuals who can regulate their own affective responses
to maintain an optimal level of emotional arousal have greater
expressions of empathic concern for others (Decety and Meyer,
2008; Davidov et al., 2013; Ho et al., 2014; Williams et al.,
2014).
Overall, there is solid and accumulative evidence that all facets
of empathy play an important role in medical practice and have
an impact on both the patient and his/her physician (Figure 2). A
physician’s empathy can improve the patient’s psychological and
physiological adjustment to disease, contribute to healing, and
can inﬂuence the overall well being of the recipient; a fact that
calls for a mechanistic explanation.
THE SOCIAL BASELINE THEORY
Social support is one of the most important functions of social
relationships. Numerous studies indicate that it is essential for
maintaining physical and mental health, and a lack of support
is associated with harmful consequences (Ozbay et al., 2007).
A wealth of evidence suggests that perceived availability of a
signiﬁcant other’s (or family or friends generally) support ame-
liorates stress and is associated with health and well being (Di
Blasi et al., 2001; Taylor, 2007; Reblin and Uchino, 2009). Con-
versely, a lack of support and social isolation are important
predictors of morbidity and major risk factors for psychological
illness (Cacioppo and Hawkley, 2009; Cacioppo et al., 2012),
as well as mortality (Reblin and Uchino, 2009). Based on both
animal models and human studies, the proposed mechanisms
for these “social buffering” effects include the regulation of
stress-related activity in the autonomic nervous system (ANS),
and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Uchino et al.,
1996; Hennessy et al., 2009; for a recent excellent comprenhensive
review, see Hostinar et al., 2014). Social neuroscience research in
humans has long investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms by
which social support inﬂuences physiology and ultimately health.
For instance, in a handful of recent neuroimaging studies, social
support was found to reduce activity in brain regions that are
typically implicated in emotional and homeostatic regulation.
In particular, neuro-hemodynamic changes were detected in the
anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex and midbrain regions (Coan et al., 2006; Eisenberger et al.,
2007).
The social baseline theory (SBT) proposes that organisms are
adapted to social ecology—the presence of other conspeciﬁcs—
more so than any physical ecology. Consequently, the social
proximity to other individuals (characterized by familiarity, joint
attention, shared goals, and interdependence) should be consid-
ered as the default or baseline assumption of the human brain
(Beckes and Coan, 2011; Coan, 2011). The SBT is grounded
in empirical studies that have found that neural pathways and
hormonal stress responses associated with self-regulation of emo-
tion are less active when social support is provided or even
anticipated (Gunnar and Quevedo, 2007; Hostinar et al., 2012).
The neural response to threat cues is minimized when a high-
quality relational partner is on hand. Individuals whose relation-
ships are marked by perceived mutuality and responsiveness are
characterized by decreased self-regulatory effort and by reduced
preparation to respond to threat cues (Coan et al., 2013). Impor-
tantly, animal research demonstrates similar physiological effects.
For instance, one study found that female mice approaching a
dyad member in physical pain led to less writhing from the mouse
in pain (Langford et al., 2010). These positive effects of social
approach were seen only when the mouse was a cage mate of
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 8 | Article 457 | 4
Decety and Fotopoulou Impact of empathy on others in medicine
the mouse in pain and not for a stranger. These results replicate
previous ﬁndings reporting reduced pain sensitivity in mice when
interacting with siblings, but no such analgesic effect when mice
interact with a stranger (D’Amato and Pavone, 1993).
Similarly in humans, when their signiﬁcant other was present,
patients with ﬁbromyalgia (a chronic widespread musculoskeletal
pain, morning stiffness, insomnia, and fatigue) reported less pain
sensitivity and showed diminished hemodynamic response to
the tactile stimulation of a tender point compared to when the
patients were alone (Montoya et al., 2004). In healthy women,
holding their partner’s hand during anticipation of a shock
was associated with a pervasive attenuation of activation in the
neural systems supporting emotional threat response including
the hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (Coan et al., 2006). Finally, it appears that even
a mere photograph of one’s partner is enough to reduce the
perception of experimentally-induced pain and related neural
responses (Master et al., 2009; Y ounger et al., 2010).
The SBT is a useful framework for examining individual
differences in the social baselines of individuals, in particular
regarding their attachment styles. Attachment is an innate biolog-
ical system promoting proximity seeking between an infant and
a speciﬁc attachment ﬁgure in order to increase the likelihood
of survival, and empathy and attachment are interdependent
(Kestenbaum et al., 1989; Mikulincer et al., 2001; Decety and
Svetlova, 2012). Attachment theory offers a compelling platform
for understanding an individual’s capacity to connect with others
and develop supportive relationships including coping resources
(Mallinckrodt, 2000). Studies have shown a mediational rela-
tionship between attachment style and empathy, and have indi-
cated that individuals with secure attachment histories are more
responsive to and caring for others (Weinﬁeld et al., 2010). Inter-
estingly, attachment insecurity has been associated with reduced
pain thresholds and is a prognostic factor for chronic pain
(Meredith et al., 2008). It has been further shown that insecure
attachment may lead to increased perception of experimentally-
induced pain particularly in the presence of empathic observers
(Sambo et al., 2010; Hurter et al., 2014). More generally, attach-
ment style moderates the beneﬁts of social support, such that
insecurely attached individuals report less perceived social sup-
port (Collins and Feeney, 2004) and securely attached individuals
report lower state anxiety levels (Ditzen et al., 2008). Presumably,
individuals that are more insecure in their relationships regard
supportive others as less reliable, rendering them unable to invest
wholeheartedly in their social network (Gross and Profﬁtt, 2013),
and less likely to beneﬁt from social support and empathy (Krahé
et al., 2013).
Empirical work has begun to uncover some of the underlying
neuroanatomical and neurochemical foundations of attachment-
related processes and their relationship with other social behav-
iors. Such research has elucidated a number of neuropeptides
that are clearly involved in an array of attachment-related social
behaviors including opioids, vasopressin, and oxytocin. Stud-
ies in humans have demonstrated that oxytocin infusion can
modulate a number of attachment-related behaviors includ-
ing trust, empathic concern, and empathic accuracy (Graustella
and MacLeod, 2012). Intranasal oxytocin administration has
recently been shown to affect cerebral blood perfusion in critical
areas in the brain circuitry involved in social cognition and
emotional processing, irrespective of any concomitant cogni-
tive, affective, or social manipulations (Paloyelis et al., 2014).
Importantly, oxytocin administration selectively lessens affective
reactions to threatening social stimuli (Norman et al., 2011)
and differentially modulates visual attention toward social sig-
nals of positive approach (Domes et al., 2013). Moreover, it
appears that individuals lacking high quality social connec-
tions show signiﬁcantly decreased responses to oxytocin admin-
istration (Norman et al., 2011), a ﬁnding that may reﬂect
reduced receptor sensitivity in these individuals. Research into
the inﬂuence of genetic variation within the oxytocin recep-
tor has provided converging evidence of the role that oxy-
tocin plays in human social behavior. Polymorphisms within the
oxytocin receptor have been shown to be related to afﬁliative
behavior, dispositional empathy, theory of mind, and perceived
social connectedness (Kumsta and Heinrichs, 2013). Similarly,
genetic variation in the OT receptor is related to decreased
neuroendocrine and autonomic reactivity to social stress, and
interacts with perceived social support to dampen physiologi-
cal reactivity to social-evaluative threat (Kumsta and Heinrichs,
2013).
Overall, there is a growing body of research showing that
emotions provide rapid, embodied information about current
resources and contextual demands, guiding decision making by
modifying the subjective perception of the world (Coan and
Maresh, 2014). Through the establishment and maintenance of
social relationships, the resources of relational partners (parents,
friends, spouses), as well as physicians, come to be viewed as
resources available to the individual. Such processes optimize
energy expenditures, and in the context of medicine play a critical
role in buffering against stress, especially when the physician
is perceived to have a compassionate and caring attitude. The
SBT predicts that computational or metabolic resources devoted
to attention and self-regulation are conserved through social
proximity and interaction. This notion needs to be combined
with the FEP , which accounts for action, perception, and salience
processing on the basis of a single energy optimization principle.
THE FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE
The free energy principle (FEP) can explain how contextual and
social factors, such as a clinician’s empathy, may affect physical
and mental health outcomes. The starting point of the FEP
is that biological systems minimize a free energy function of
their internal states, which rely on beliefs about hidden states
in their environment (Friston, 2010). The signals our sensory
systems receive from the outside world are often ambiguous. Such
ambiguity can have negative consequences for humans and other
animals that need to use their environment to maintain their
bodily homeostasis (e.g., avoid cold climates, eat safe food, etc.).
According to this framework, the brain attempts to deal with the
tension between a variable world and the need for homeostasis
by constructing inferential hypotheses (i.e., “generative models”)
of the hidden causes of sensory input it receives from the envi-
ronment so as to be able to predict the changing world to a
certain extent (Dayan et al., 1995). The brain further uses errors
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 8 | Article 457 | 5
Decety and Fotopoulou Impact of empathy on others in medicine
in the accuracy of such predictive representations to improve its
own models. In other words, the nervous system compares its
predictions with the feedback it actually receives from the physical
and social environments (Friston, 2005). In order to formalize this
kind of inferential self-organization, theoretical neuroscientists
use Bayesian theory and terms from information theory, as well
as neurocomputational schemes such as the predictive coding
hypothesis (Hinton and van Camp, 1993). Sufﬁcient coverage
of the mathematical considerations of these computations is not
possible within the scope of the current paper. Instead, we offer
a psychological translation of this framework and particularly
its application to cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience,
so as to examine the effects of empathy and social support
on human health and disease from the perspective of a wider
framework of mental and brain functioning. In psychological
terms therefore, the framework’s main proposal is that the ulti-
mate goal of the brain is to minimize its prediction errors in
perception (build better models about sensory data) and in
action (sample the world to generate more sensory evidence that
may fulﬁll its predictions). This minimization is thought to take
place by recurrent feedback among hierarchical neural levels. In
each level, higher levels send predictions to lower units, while
such units communicate prediction errors to higher levels of
the hierarchy to improve the organism’s models. Furthermore,
the relative inﬂuence of predictions vs. prediction errors across
several layers in this hierarchical organization is determined by
the weighting (precision) of predictions vs. prediction errors at
each level. Such ‘precision’ is thought to correspond to neural
modulation. For example, in a hungry individual, dopaminergic
action on certain synapses may enhance the weighting of any
prediction errors regarding the availability of food stimuli, so
that the potential presence of food acquires psychological salience
for the individual, no matter how unexpected that presence
may be.
Applying this large-scale theory of brain function to the under-
standing of the communicative and healing facets of empathy is
advantageous as it can provide a mechanistic, uniﬁed account
of the relation between bottom-up (e.g., neurophysiological)
and top-down (e.g., psychosocial) inﬂuences on health. This
approach is compatible with existing biopsychosocial models but
has the advantage of offering direct links between these different
factors, instead of treating them as merely additive variables.
Indeed, this framework is already used to provide a neurobio-
logical explanation of other domains of social cognition such as
the neurocognitive basis of theory of mind (Brown and Brüne,
2012; Koster-Hale and Saxe, 2013), and related psychopatholo-
gies such as autism (Pellicano and Burr, 2012; Lawson et al.,
2014).
Crucially, the FEP has also been used to account for the
mounting experimental evidence regarding the social modula-
tion of pain (Krahé et al., 2013). Primary signals about the
homeostatic state of the organism, including nociceptive sig-
nals, are viewed as represented in the posterior insula (Craig,
2002). There they are integrated with exteroceptive informa-
tion about the body and the environment. Further re-mappings
within the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex are
thought to allow further integrations with social, motivational,
and contextual information. These remappings ultimately give
rise to the conscious experience of emotions and readiness for
action (Craig, 2002). Moreover, the insular cortex is thought
to process interoceptive stimuli on the basis of salience, deter-
mining the balance between bottom-up and top-down informa-
tion about the signiﬁcance of an impending noxious stimulus
(Wiech et al., 2010). Pain can thus be understood as a pro-
cess of perceptual inference. Predictive, top-down signals about
an impending nociceptive stimulus and information about its
homeostatic signiﬁcance in context of other stimuli and con-
ditions in the environment determine the conscious perception
of pain. Furthermore, within the FEP framework, pain can also
be seen as a parallel process of active inference. Self-protective,
motivated actions are performed to change homeostatically-
relevant nociceptive input and update predictions. More gen-
erally, such re-representations of signals about the inside of
the body, its surface and the environment suggest possible,
hierarchical neurobiological mechanisms by which top-down
cognitive and social factors such as empathy can inﬂuence intero-
ception and other signals to give rise to emotions and motivated
behavior.
In this way, the FEP contributes to our understanding of
how empathy may affect pain and other dimensions of physical
and psychological health. When a patient seeks assistance from a
physician, or when she sees a nurse approaching, both bottom-up
sensory input (e.g., eye contact, warm language, gentle touch) and
top-down expectancies (e.g., knowledge of therapeutic intentions
based on verbal interactions and past experiences) are essential
for the ensuing predictive processes of neural inference by which
healing may take place. For example, in the domain of pain, social
variables may affect the conscious perception of physical pain, as
well as subpersonal, physiological reactions to pain (Sambo et al.,
2010), by affecting the precision of impending noxious stimuli
in relation to the precision of top-down predictions of pain.
This balance can be affected in at least two primary ways. First,
others can signal the safety or threat of the impending noxious
stimulus itself and hence increase the precision of bottom-up
signals regarding its salience for the organism. For example,
pain tolerance can increase when a social partner re-interprets
noxious, uncomfortable stimuli as neutral or positive sensations
(Jackson et al., 2005) while socially sharing threatening infor-
mation about the stimulus can decrease pain tolerance (Jackson
et al., 2009). Second, pain and related reactions can be affected
by social signals about the safety or threat of the environment in
which the stimulus occurs. For example, social interactions with a
clear content regarding the provision of safety or support seem
to increase the perception of environmental safety and reduce
the perception of experimentally-induced pain (Brown et al.,
2003).
Importantly, this framework explains both the positive and
negative effects of empathy, as well as the individual differ-
ences in the perception of the physician’s empathy and its
effects on health. For example, it appears that while thinking of
one’s partner during the experience of pain may be beneﬁcial
for nociceptive and stress perception (Y ounger et al., 2010).
Knowing that your partner feels empathy for you during the
experience of pain may lead to increased perception of pain

Decety and Fotopoulou Impact of empathy on others in medicine
and related behaviors (Hurter et al., 2014). It seems that such
empathy is interpreted as signaling that something dangerous
and salient is happening to the individual. In addition, the
particular direction of these effects seems to depend on indi-
vidual traits and strategies used to cope with physical or social
threat. For instance, individuals with higher attachment avoid-
ance, who generally have low trust in others and lower expec-
tations of empathy (Hurter et al., 2014), report more pain in
the presence of others than alone (Sambo et al., 2010). Also,
when anxious and secure individuals perceive greater empa-
thy from their partners, they seem to use increased displays
of pain to seek emotional support. Conversely, avoidant indi-
viduals, who did not expect such a response, seem to behav-
iorally downplay their pain to avoid further emotional and
potentially active support from their partners (Hurter et al.,
2014).
Lastly, under the free energy framework, the perceptual and
motivational aspects of empathy on health can be uniﬁed under
the same optimization principle. Speciﬁcally, during stressful sit-
uations individuals are motivated to act in order to avoid danger.
In the FEP , such motivational aspects can be conceptualized as a
process of active inference, where actions are performed to change
sensory signals related to homeostasis and thus reduce prediction
errors. In a social context, such actions may be directed towards
the environment with the goal of eliciting help from others and
changing sensations via this indirect social channel.
Thus, perceiving others’ empathy may be an important way
to ensure safety, while also preserving resources that may be
needed during illness or bodily threat. Unfortunately, this later
aspect of the effect of empathy on health has not yet received
sufﬁcient empirical attention, and hence these predictions remain
untested.
INTEGRATION OF THE TWO FRAMEWORKS
The two frameworks considered here, namely the SBT, and the
FEP , stem from different theoretical and empirical traditions
and appear quite distinct at ﬁrst sight. The SBT suggests that
social relatedness is the default condition the brain expects the
organism to be, while the FEP seems to describe the constitution
of the human condition as relating primarily to the singular
individual and its body. Nevertheless, at a closer inspection, one
can see how a theoretical integration of the two perspectives is not
only possible, but it may further generate some valuable insights
for both frameworks, as well as for the topic at hand, namely
the importance of empathy and social support for mental and
physical health and disease.
Speciﬁcally, the SBT’s assertion that close proximity to social
resources is the baseline assumption of the human brain can
be also conceptualized as follows: from an FEP perspective one
could argue that at a relatively high level of the neurocognitive
hierarchy, humans have the prediction that they need to maintain
proximity with the caregiver. This prediction, or prior hypoth-
esis in Bayesian terminology, is phylogenetically determined by
the fact that humans are born to a long period of complete
dependency on others for survival. This prior must also be
ontogenetically determined in the sense that the particular history
of such dependency and the parental and social environment
each individual grows up into should inﬂuence the particular
content of such priors. For example, as aforementioned and
consistent with the tenets of attachment theory, someone who
grew up with caring and available caregivers may be more likely
to expect and to accept empathy and support from others than
someone who was taken reared by unavailable or unreliable
parents.
In the SBT it follows that self-regulation may require addi-
tional resources than social regulation, because in the case of
the former the brain cannot rely on social resources for achiev-
ing required regulatory functions, e.g., protecting the organism
from environmental threat. This assertion is entirely compatible
with the predictions of the FEP , but it constitutes only one
facet of the more complex social phenomena that this theory
can explain. Speciﬁcally, from the point of view of the FEP ,
the need to self-regulate would indeed entail greater levels of
prediction error that need to be minimized (free energy or
surprise in the terminology of this theory) in lower hierarchical
levels, because of the aforementioned fundamental (higher-level)
expectation of social attachment and proximity. However, the
FEP also presupposes a more general conﬂict between such social
expectations and other self-serving motivations. For example,
social proximity also requires competition for basic homeostatic
resources and carries the risk of social aggression, attack, or
intrusion (even by pro-social, afﬁliative activities such as birth
or sex). Thus, at any given interaction the organism must bal-
ance the need for social proximity with the needs for homeo-
static stability and bodily integrity. According to the FEP , the
resolution of such conﬂicts relies on neuromodulatory (weight-
ing, see above) functions and corresponding chemistries, e.g.,
neurotransmitters such as dopamine and neuropeptides such as
oxytocin (Fotopoulou, 2013; Krahé et al., 2013; Quattrocki and
Friston, 2014). In the case of labor pains, for example, the release
of oxytocin seems to act to increase the precision of prosocial
predictions about the importance of childbearing and thus reduce
the precision of predictions errors regarding the painful and
bodily threatening experience of birth (see also Krahé et al.,
2013).
More generally, the FEP presupposes a basic conﬂict between
perception and action that also applies to social phenomena. The
organism could easily solve all discrepancies between prediction
and error (e.g., hunger states) by simply changing its predictions
(convincing oneself that one does not need food) and thus
avoiding action (actively reducing prediction errors). This would
of course cause homeostatic danger so the organism solves the
conﬂict by attenuating (under-weighting) the ascending sensory
prediction errors of self-generated actions to enable descend-
ing predictions to be fulﬁlled by peripheral and autonomic
reﬂexes. This interpretation corresponds to the well-established
phenomenon of sensory attenuation, the observation that the
sensory consequences of self-generated actions are perceived as
less intense. This phenomenon has been inﬂuentially illustrated
by the experimental conﬁrmation of the intuitive knowledge that
one cannot tickle oneself (Weiskrantz et al., 1971). Interestingly,
sensory attenuation is associated with the ability to discriminate
between self and other. In the domain of empathy and social sup-
port, the distinction between self and other is almost as important

Decety and Fotopoulou Impact of empathy on others in medicine
as the sense of attachment and social connectedness (Decety and
Lamm, 2007; Silani et al., 2013). For example, when an individual
in pain receives active social support by their partner, or perceives
them to be empathic, perceiving the partner themselves as being
“worried” , or as needing to necessarily act “on behalf ” of the
sufferer (i.e., not differentiating sufﬁciently between self and
other), has been noted to lead to increased perception of pain
(Hurter et al., 2014), decreased feelings of self-efﬁcacy and poor
long-term clinical outcomes in the case of chronic pain (see Krahé
et al., 2013 for review). In other terms, the FEP can explain why
relying on other people’s resources may in certain situations lead
to perceptual distortions (instead of appropriate self-protective
actions) that are not beneﬁcial to health.
In summary, although the two frameworks are highly compat-
ible, the FEP to has a wider scope, accounting for both the positive
and negative effects of social support and empathy.
WHEN PREDICTIONS MEET SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS:
PLACEBO EFFECTS
The use of placebos in medicine, outside clinical trials, may be
ethically and legally controversial, but is in fact quite frequent
(Fässler et al., 2010). Results from a national survey of US
internists and rheumatologists indicates that the prescriptions
of placebo treatments such as vitamins and over the counter
analgesics are commonly employed (Tilburt et al., 2008). Place-
bos are treatments whose beneﬁts derive from positive patient
expectations and not from the pharmacological component itself.
Thus, placebo effects are a good example of how expectations,
beliefs, or hope in patients is derived from the clinical relationship
between the patient and her/his physician (Miller and Rosenstein,
2006). An impressive body of work during the past decade has
elucidated the neurobiological mechanisms underlying placebo
hypoalgesia (i.e., a decrease pain sensation). This hypoalgesia
results from the activation of the opiodergic descending pain
control system (Eippert et al., 2009). Another mechanism has
also been proposed that relies on classical conditioning, consis-
tent with a predictive coding perspective. In addition to their
direct analgesic effects, opioids play a role in signaling top-
down predictions in a generative model, and thus the ascend-
ing system is complemented by a descending system (Büchel
et al., 2014). This descending system, amenable to conditioning
(e.g., when individuals associate hospital with effective treat-
ment and symptom reduction), originates in the rostral anterior
cingulate cortex and anterior insula, and has reciprocal con-
nections with the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (Wager,
2005). A study using functional molecular imaging in healthy
participants found that activation of the nucleus accumbens
dopamine release was observed during placebo administration
and related to its anticipated effects, perception-anticipation mis-
matches, and placebo effect development (Scott et al., 2007). Fur-
thermore, the magnitude of the placebo-induced dopaminergic
response, measured during the expectation of pain, predicted the
subsequent development of placebo-induced analgesia in pain
trials.
While most placebo research has focused on understanding the
underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the patient’s response
to placebos, less effort has been directed to understanding the
physician component of the clinical dyad. One notable functional
MRI study explored brain responses when physicians interacted
with their patients during a treatment or no-treatment condi-
tions. Results showed that brain regions previously implicated
in reward and subjective value (ventrolateral and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortices and ventral striatum) were selectively activated
during the treatment condition (Jensen et al., 2014). In addi-
tion, physician’s ability to take the patients’ perspective predicted
neural response in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, another
region that has been associated with processing of reward.
Finally, this conceptual framework may also help explain why
sometimes the best medicine is simply having someone to care
for you, which seems to be at the core of many alternative
medicines. Studies have shown that alternative treatments such
as acupuncture tend to produce a larger placebo effect than,
for example, handing out sugar pills, presumably because these
alternative treatments involve more ritual, and thus raise patients’
expectations (Freedman, 2011).
CONCLUSIONS
Throughout history, doctor-patient relationships have been
acknowledged as having an important therapeutic effect, beyond
the effects of prescribed drugs and other treatments (Di Blasi
et al., 2001). Although numerous factors inﬂuence patients’
enablement, their perceptions of their doctors’ empathy and
caring attitude are of key importance in contributing to patient
outcomes in clinical practice. The beneﬁcial impact of empathy on
others can be explained by neurocognitive theories that emphasize
the importance of social interactions, support, relations, and
cognitions in health, as well as by neurocomputational theories
which conceptualize the brain as an inferential, self-organizing
machine which constantly makes predictions about the world and
then optimizes them based on what it senses. Further empirical
work at both behavioral and neurobiological levels is needed in
order to test these theories in the context of clinical practice.
However, their theoretical advantage lies in the fact that they sug-
gest speciﬁc neurobiological mechanisms by which psychosocial
variables such as interpersonal therapy can inﬂuence individual
bodily perceptions and health outcomes. Moreover, both theories
account for contextual and dispositional factors by which a clin-
ician’s empathy may affect a patient’s beliefs and experiences and
ultimately their health.
Thus, the beneﬁt of physician’s empathy for a patient cannot
be conceptualized as a mere dodo bird conjecture. Nor should
clinical empathy be considered as a simple subjective humanistic
stance. Furthermore, an empathetic attitude is not opposed to
the objectivity of other medical skills and it can be studied with
the scientiﬁc rigor applied to other biological domains. Speciﬁc
expectations between the patient and her/his physician, when
met and cared for, reduce uncertainty, and play a beneﬁcial and
crucial role in healing. A caring practitioner who takes more
time to bond effectively with patients is an enormous boon to
health. It beneﬁts patients to have a doctor who spends more
time with them and listens carefully. Many patients feel better
simply when practitioners actively try to help them deal with
vague, hard-to-diagnose complaints such as pain and fatigue,
instead of telling them that there is no diagnosis or effective

treatment. In psychotherapies, patients with positive attitudes
who interact with a warm and genuine therapist (a factor known
as the therapeutic alliance) have a better chance of experienc-
ing clinical improvement, regardless of the therapist methods
(Despland et al., 2009).
Empathy is just one of the elements that facilitates treatment
effectiveness, but a powerful one.
