The quantum statistical frame for infinite multi-lattice spin systems is introduced. The thermody-
namic functionals specific internal energy, entropy and free energy are shown to exist on the set of 
permutation invariant states for polynomial mean field interactions by direct estimation methods. 
Their dependence on the relative sizes of the sublattice systems is made explicit. The set of homoge-
neous minimal free energy states is shown to be a Bauer simplex which contains all limiting Gibbs 
states. For the extremal minimal free energy states the self-consistency equations are derived. 
1. Introduction 
The idea of the present work is to provide the quan-
tum statistical frame for infinite multi-lattice  mean 
field models and to use it for the foundation of the 
thermodynamic variational formalism. For this pur-
pose we emphasize those operator algebraic notions 
which are relevant for the macroscopic aspects of the 
considered theory. 
The restriction to lattice systems circumvents many 
technical difficulties inherent in the rigorous theory of 
continuous systems but has, nevertheless, a large vari-
ety of physical applications. The set of possible appli-
cations is even considerably enlarged by admitting a 
sublattice structure, that is, the set of lattice indices 
decomposes into a finite union of subsets, each of 
which becomes infinite in the thermodynamic limit. 
The relative sizes of the sublattices, which should as-
sume well-defined limiting values, are then additional 
thermodynamic parameters. They cause non-trivial 
complications in calculating the thermodynamic func-
tions and seem not to have been considered previously 
within a rigorous discussion in the published litera-
ture. Our approach goes back to the unpublished the-
sis of Fleig [1], where as an illustrative example is 
elaborated a BCS-superconductor with paramagnetic 
impurities. Another class of multi-lattice systems is 
worked out in terms of the present formalism in [2], 
where also more references to the usual literature of 
multi-lattice  mean field theories are provided. (For 
rigorous discussions of one-lattice mean field theories

see also [3,4].) Quite generally it is obvious, that com-
posite macroscopic systems are basic for thermody-
namics and are of even increasing interest with respect 
to their quantum mechanical features. 
Concerning the mean field character of the consid-
ered model class, a systematic foundation may be 
given by admitting only a restricted class of (quantum 
statistical)  states. For the thermodynamic point of 
view only those states seem to be relevant, which are 
not too irregular in their spatial properties. We satisfy 
in the present formalism this requirement in the 
strongest possible way: the selected set of states, which 
is considered as a representative of the thermody-
namic state space consists of those, which are com-
pletely homogeneous in each sublattice. This sublat-
tice permutation invariance should be considered only 
as the starting point of the discussion of long range 
interacting systems. (For some prospective generaliza-
tions see below.) It does not exclude, however, global 
non-equilibrium states. Here it motivates the crucial 
role played by a certain kind of intensive observables. 
These are called here "density observables" (and 
should not be confused with the density matrices of 
the states). They have to be discriminated from the 
other set of intensive variables, the so-called "contact 
variables", [5, 6] as e.g. temperature and chemical po-
tential, which have no microscopic counterparts. The 
density observables are always norm-bounded but are 
elements of the basic C*-algebra of observables only, 
if the space average is carried out over a finite lattice 
region. (Their infinite volume limits have to be per-
formed in a representation-dependent  weak topol-
ogy.) 
Now, any interaction in a finite lattice region is for 
homogeneous states equivalent to a permutation in-

variant one and by this automatically a polynomial of 
the density observables corresponding to the selected 
region. This polynomial may in principle depend for 
itself on the (cardinality of the) finite lattice region. 
Here we consider, however, only models with fixed 
maxima
l degree of the polynomial interaction. 
In order to locate the origin of the macroscopic-
classical features of the considered models we present 
in Sect. 2 the quantum statistical set up in some detail. 
For the operator algebraic notions we refer to [7-9], 
and [10]. We try to elucidate the physical meaning of 
some of the mathematical concepts. The sublattice 
structure allows for the introduction of concentration 
vectors by restricting the family of local lattice regions 
to certain directed absorbing sub-families (which are 
called "funnels"). In this connection some care is re-
quired
 to formulate the notion of a (unique) limiting 
Gibbs state. The whole elaboration gives various ar-
guments for considering the set of all permutation 
invariant states Sf9 as the representative of a funda-
mental macroscopic-classical structure which is inher-
ent in the state space of the quasi-local algebra and 
should be taken into account, also if larger sets of 
states are used. The extremal boundary of Sf9 
leads to the definition of general (not necessarily equi-
librium) pure phase states. 
The specific thermodynamic potentials are intro-
duced in Sect. 3 as functionals on . To prove their 
existence in the thermodynamic limit we use the most 
direct estimation techniques. The sublattice structure 
makes the discussion of the limiting entropy density 
rather involved. The fact that we use the absolute (and 
not the relative) entropy density has some advantages 
in future studies of the low temperature asymptotics. 
In Sect. 4 it is established that the limiting Gibbs 
states minimize the free energy. The total set of equi-
librium states for a given temperature and concentra-
tion vector - consisting of the minimal free energy 
states - is proven to be a stable face of and to 
constitute a classical sub-structure being for itself a 
Bauer simplex. The extremal boundary of this Bauer 
simplex
 is seen to be the intersection of the simplex 
with 9, so that the notion of an equilibrium pure 
phase state is consistent with the general pure phase 
concept. 
In Sect. 5 the necessary self-consistency equations 
for the equilibrium pure phase states are obtained by 
forming the Frechet derivative of the free energy func-
tional (augmented by Lagrange parameter terms). 
Only
 here the effective mean field Hamiltonians may 
be recognized in the local density matrices of the pure 
phase
 states. 
Altogether we obtain in this way a foundation of the 
quantum statistical variational formalism by straight-
forward and typical thermodynamic methods, where 
an arbitrary finite set of concentration parameters is 
incorporated. In the way the concentrations are 
treated here, they describe a preparation of the macro-
scopic subsystems in fixed relative amounts. By vary-
ing the concentrations as external parameters compli-
cated phase diagrams may show up, which often give 
a qualitatively correct picture of the phases of real 
substances, e.g. for metallic alloys. It is of course also 
possible to vary over some (or all) concentration 
parameters in calculating the minimal free energy, 
what,
 would e.g., be useful in the case of hydrogenium 
dissolved in metal. If the sub-systems are not really 
macroscopic but mesoscopic (think of the granules of 
a high Tc superconductor) the values of the concentra-
tion parameters may be subjected to an additional 
statistical distribution. 
There are already developments in the rigorous lit-
erature which transcend the here treated models in 
two decisive respects: on the one hand the polynomial 
interactions for one-lattice systems are generalized to 
continuous functions of the density observables [11], 
which requires completely new mathematical con-
cepts
 for their definition, but many of the here pre-
sented techniques seem still to be applicable. On the 
other hand the limit to an infinite number of subsys-
tems has been worked out for specific models [12]. 
These
 are very interesting limiting cases of the present 
model class and add to the motivation to clarify the 
structure of the latter as much as possible. These fur-
ther structural questions concern, e.g., the following: 
since one has by the mentioned Bauer simplices of 
equilibrium states a concise notion of the classical 
equilibrium properties of a quantum system (also ex-
pressible by a Boolean lattice) one may analyze their 
changes in the course of phase transitions. Another 
point is the connection to dynamical concepts already 
being made available for subclasses of the present 
models in [13-15]. 
2. Quantumstatistical Frame 
for Multi-Lattice Mean Field Theories 
2.1. Quasi-local Algebra 
We treat here the general case of a composite lattice 
system with re N components. Since every lattice vec-

933 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
tor has integer coordinates, each lattice may be de-
scribed by 7Ld, where de N is the dimension of the 
space, or - after a renumbering - by N itself. The 
multi-lattice is then represented by 3/t = J x {1,..., r}, 
where J equals TLd or N and {1,..., r}, is the index 
set to identify the sublattices. With each lattice site 
(i,
 p) e M, ie J, p e {1,..., r}, is attached a finite-di-
mensional quantum system with the observable alge-
bra säip, which is isomorphic to the full matrix alge-
bra :=Jtm(p) (<C) in the Hilbert space Cm(p). As we 
are going to describe, the m(p) e N, p e {1,..., r} char-
acterize the observable algebras of the local and the 
infinite lattices and this may be called "type" of the 
multi-lattice system. In algebraic terms the type may 
be expressed by the tupel 
&: = &x x...x &r. (2.1) 
For a thorough elaboration it is useful to recall the 
construction of the quasi-local lattice algebra. One 
introduces first of all the set if of all finite multi-lattice 
subregions A a the cardinalities of which are de-
noted by \A\. if is then directed by inclusion with the 
inclusion relation A cz A', A, A' e if, and constitutes 
a partial order in if such that for every pair A, A' e if 
there is a A" e if with A a A" and Ä a A". For every 
A e if one has the corresponding observable algebra 
® (2.2) 
(i, p)e A 
In order to exhibit the sublattice structure let us write 
r 
AP'-— {0'P')G^\P — P}- Since then A = (J Ap,ApnAp. 
P= i 
= 0, for p#p', we find \A\= X \Ap|. With this, one 
has P=1 r 
s*A=®s4Ap. (2.3) 
p= i 
For every pair A, A' e if with A c A', one has the 
natural embedding *-isomorphism 
A -> y\a,a{A) = A <g> iA.XA, 
AesäA, (2.4) 
where tA is the unit in säA. It clearly holds for 
A c A' c A": 
RIA",A = LA",A-° 1A\A and RIA>,A(lA) = lA>. (2.5) 
The properties in (2.5) give rise to the C*-inductive 
limit algebra sä (cf. [9,10]), for the infinite system, 
which is an abstract C*-algebra. From the general 
mathematical theory one knows the basic properties 
of sä, where most of them are relevant for the quan-
tum statistical formalism and its physical interpreta-
tion. The quasi-local algebra sä is a minimal form of 
an observable algebra in the thermodynamic limit in 
the following sense. For every A e if the set-up of the 
C*-inductive limit leads to an embedding •-isomor-
phism of the original local algebras 
rjA:säA->sä with rjA(tA) = tesä (2.6) 
and A c= A' implying 
riAW = VA °riA',AW c riA\säA.). (2.7) 
The minimality of sä is now expressed by 
sä= U r,A(^y-\ (2.8) 
i.e., the local observables are dense in sä in the 
strongest possible topology, the ||.||-topology of sä. 
Furtheron sä is a separable so-called UHF-algebra, 
which is simple and thus has a trivial center. The 
"type" ("invariant" in [16]) of sä is given by the prime 
number
 decomposition of the m(p), p e ... ,r}. 
Thus quite different multi-lattice systems may lead to 
•-isomorphic quasi-local algebras. The multi-lattice 
structure is, however, basic for the definition of the 
Hamiltonians and the limiting equilibrium states, and 
will be made explicit throughout the discussion. 
At first sight it seems disappointing that the center 
of sä is trivial, i.e. that only <C-numbers commute with 
all other elements of sä. Observe that this property is 
shared with the algebra of all bounded operators in a 
Hilbert space, which characterizes traditional quan-
tum mechanics for systems with finitely many degrees 
of freedom. The essential new features of the quasi-
local observable algebras are expressed by the techni-
cal term "anti-liminarity"  [9] and are connected with 
the existence of overcountably many disjoint (irre-
ducible) representations. The disjointness is a notion 
which is connected with the closures of the repre-
sented observable algebra in the weak operator to-
pologies of the respective representation Hilbert 
spaces. The in this way extended representation alge-
bras may exhibit non-isomorphic structures and espe-
cially non-isomorphic centers. We illustrate this by the 
following observables, which are basic for mean field 
models. 
Let for every pe {1,..., r} be {ep\ 1 <n<n(p)} with 
n(p) :=m2(p), a selfadjoint basis in If these spin 
observables are placed onto the i-th lattice point and 
considered as part of the total lattice algebra sä they 
are
 denoted by enip-=r\{(itp)](e"p) e rj{^p)](säip) a sä. 

934 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
For a macroscopic observer the density observables 
for every A e if 
™AenP):=r^ I * 
1^1 ieAp 
(2.9) 
are important. Since every x e 0$p is a linear combina-
tion of the ep, 1 < n < n (p), we obtain mA (x) by a linear 
combination of (2.9). Especially we find 
p |A| 
(2.10) 
and the transformation of the embedded product opera-
tors 
®P(1A(
 ® xIP)):=F,PA( ® xP(iA (2.13) V \(i,p)eA J) \(i, p) eA / 
After having verified the well-definedness of (2.13), 
linear extension and norm-closure gives the action of 0P 
on an arbitrary element of stf. 
Th
e assumption that in homogeneous states the 
potential looks as being permutation invariant leads 
to mean field models. The local Hamiltonians are then 
simple permutation covariant expressions satisfying 
In a thermodynamic description A has to tend to 
infinity in a way that the values of (2.10) tend to a 
number
 cp e (0,1). In spite of being norm bounded the 
net (mA(x); A e if) does not converge in the norm 
topology. It may however converge in many represen-
tations in the weak operator topologies, and  the limits 
may
 then indicate disjoint representations. Or, turn-
ing the argument around: The fact that the quasi-local 
algebra si has overcountably many disjoint represen-
tations is the prerequisite for the density observables 
becoming thermodynamic state variables with a con-
tinuum of values in the thermodynamic limit. 
2.2. Local Hamiltonians and Symmetries 
A
 physical interaction of a (multi-)lattice  system 
would not be strictly of a finite range, but would de-
crease
 with large distances. The reasonable potentials 
are described in [8, 17, 18]. From a strict thermody-
namic point of view such an interaction is considered 
in homogeneous states only. The maximal degree of 
homogeneity is permutation invariance. 
Definition 2.1. (i) The group of permutations is given 
by all bijections P of M of the form 
P(i,p) = (Pp(i),p), i e«/, p e {1,..., r} (2.11) 
with the subsidiary condition, that they are equal to 
the identity map outside a region A e if, which depends 
on P. 
(ii
) A representation of by *-automorphisms of si 
is given by the following prescription: Let be (x) xip 
(i. p) e A 
with xip e siip a product operator in siA; then define for 
PeSP the set 
0p(HA) = HA., A' = PA, VP e 
(2.14) 
PA := {P(i, p)|(i, p) e A) (2.12) 
We restrict our discussion to the case that we have 
m-body interactions with finite me N. We are thus led 
to polynomials in the density observables mA(e"p), 
1 < p<r, 1 <n<n{p), of (2.9). The local Hamiltonian 
Ha is in general a sum of different m-body interac-
tions, say for m g {1,..., q}, q e N fixed. According to 
the number of the basis elements in all of the p, 
r 
1 < p<r, we have for every A e if the set of X n(P) 
densit
y observables P=1 
mA :=(mA(e\), mA(e\\•••. mA*"))* (2-15) 
for which we employ the indicated vector notation. 
Then
 a homogeneous polynomial of degree m is de-
fined as 
A r n(p i) 
Qm(mÄ):= I  I  (2.16) 
PI = l «1 = 1 
• • • £ "z ' mC;\:;Z(A) mA(e"p\) ...mA(e"Z). 
PM= 1 NM= 1 
In view of the great number of indices, the notation 
will be made more transparent by using multiindices 
7tm = (p1,... ,pj and vm = (n1?..., nj, where we even 
neglect the index m, if the degree of the homogeneous 
polynomial is known. 
Further we have to choose the local coupling con-
stants mCl(A) in a way, such that Qm(mA) be a selfad-
joint operator in qA(st?A), e.g. 
= e IR, Vs e (2.17) 
ym being the symmetric group of m elements. 
The thermodynamic limit is performed over certain 
subsets of if. Let us call a subset Jf cz if, which is 
again directed by inclusion and absorbing - i.e. every 
A e if is dominated by a A' e Jf - a funnel. A funnel 

935 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
is then indexed by a so-called concentration vector 
r 
c :=(c1,..., cr) with each cpe(0,1), £ CP= U and 
PI = I 
writte
n Jf (c), if for all e > 0 exists a k e N such that for 
all A G^T(C) with \A\>k: 
Mpl 
Ml 
— c. <  s, 1 < p < r. (2.18) 
It is clear, that for a given c there exist many funnels 
JV(C). Let us specify the dependence of the coupling 
constants on A e if and demand that the mCl(A) be 
only dependent on the relative sizes of the sublattices 
in a continuous way, that means in abuse of notation 
= I and that the limit 
VMI Ml. 
lim mC:(A) = mC:(c) 
AeJf(c) 
(2.19) 
exists for all concentrations c, all funnels JV(C) and all 
m, v, n. 
Now we can introduce the Hamiltonian of the sys-
tem as a sum of the m-body interactions, which may 
be
 physically of different type but here are combined 
to one homogeneous polynomial for every m. 
Definition 2.2. (i) Let be Qm (mA) as defined above. 
Then the considered local Hamiltonians are of the form 
A 
HÄ :=\AI Z Qm(rnÄ), VA G if. (2.20) 
(ii) If m G XR y 1R"<P) with components m™, 1 <p<r, 
\<n<n (p) and c a concentration vector, we define 
Q(c, ni) — £ Qm(c1 m\,... ,cr mrn(r)) (2.21) m= 1 
= £ Zzmc;z(c)cplm;[...cpmrn;z, m= 1 Km vm 
where the homogeneous polynomials on the right hand 
side are of the type (2.16) with the mA (ep) replaced by 
cp mp H and the coupling constants in the limit are used. 
We consider (2.21) as a real polynomial, which later 
will appear in expressions for the energy density. 
2.3. States 
The
 mathematical states of are the positive, nor-
malized linear functionals on sä (cf., e.g., [7]). They 
constitute a convex set = which is w*-com-
pact (where the w*-topology is defined by the conver-
gence of the expectation values). That this set is also 
appropriate for the quantum statistical state concept 
may be demonstrated by considering the local restric-
tions 
(r,*(cpy,A>:=W,riA(A)>, 
cp e A e s/A, yl e if. (2.22) 
Here maps w*-continuously onto £f(säÄ). In the 
same way one defines for A a A' the mapping //* A• by 
<1%A'(<Pa'); A}:=((pA.; r\A. A(^)>, 
AesäA,(pA.e^(säA.) (2.23) 
which maps £f(säA.) w*-continuously onto S?(säA). 
From (2.7) it follows 
ia,A-0 n*-((p)=y*(<p)> 
VipeSf and VA, A' e if with A cz A'. (2.24) 
Since säA is a matrix algebra every rj^((p) is associated 
with a density matrix qA G säA. Now there is a bijec-
tion between y and the families {(pA G y(SÄA); 
A G y) which satisfy the compatibility condition 
(2.24), where 7/*(<p) corresponds to (pA, for all A e if. 
In other words: Every (p e is uniquely given by a 
compatible family of local density matrices, and thus 
has a quantum statistical meaning. 
Since sä is separable the w*-topology on y is 
metrizable. The a-algebra of the Borel sets of y (gen-
erated by the w*-open sets) is therefore equal to the 
(7-algebra of Baire sets (generated by the w*-closed Gd 
sets). Hence every Borel probability measure p on y 
is regular in the sense that for every Borel set B 
p(B)
 = sup (p(F) |F 
= inf{p(l/)|J5 < 
B, F w*-closed} 
U, U w*-open}, 
where the first relation will be used in the proof of 
Theorem 4.4. 
If for co G y there is a Borel probability measure p 
on y such that a>= j cp dp(cp) (in the w*-topology), 
then we have a statistical decomposition of co into 
states, which are in suppp, the support of p. If 
supp p c öe y, co is decomposed into pure states, 
which is typically non-unique in a quantum theory. In 
traditional quantum theory supp p is usually a count-
able set, whereas in macroscopic many body theory 
continuous measures are important. 
The richness of the state space of our quasi-local 
algebra manifests itself by the existence of many dis-

936 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
joint states. Formally two states are disjoint, if their 
GNS-representations are disjoint in the sense indi-
cated in Section 2.1. Physically disjoint states are 
globally different from each other, so that the one is 
not obtained by local perturbations from the other. A 
state is called factorial, if it is not decomposable into 
disjoint states in a non-trivial manner, which amounts 
to being macroscopically pure. For every state there is 
a canonical decomposition into pair-wise disjoint fac-
torial states, the so-called central decomposition. In 
traditional Hilbert space quantum theory all states are 
factorial and the central decompositions are, there-
fore, trivial. In the case of a quasi-local algebra the 
central decomposition indicates, which macroscopic 
properties of the system fluctuate in the considered 
state. 
As mentioned before the states of thermodynamic 
significance should have a certain spatial homogeneity 
property. For our present investigation we consider 
the most homogeneous ones, the permutation invari-
ant states. 
Definition 2.3. A state cp e SP is called permutation in-
variant, if 
<(p;
 0P(A)) = <(p; A), VA e si, VF e SP. (2.25) 
The set of permutation invariant states is denoted by 
SP
9. 
From the definition it is easily seen, that SP9 is 
convex and w*-closed, hence w*-compact. 
Proposition 2.4. (i) SP9 is a Bauer simplex. More pre-
cisely it holds that every co e SP9 has a unique decompo-
sition 
OJ= j (p dp(cp) (2.26) 
where p is a probability measure on SP with support in 
deSP9, and deSP9 is w*-compact. The correspondence 
(2.26) defines an affine w*-vague-continuous mapping 
between SP and the set of probability measures on de SP9 
(the latter being denoted by Jt\ (deSP9)). 
(ii) The extremal measure p of (2.26) coincides with 
the central measure of co. 
(iii) A state co e SP9 is in deSP9 iff it is a product 
state. That is, iff it satisfies 
(co;qA( <g> X(\\ = n <o; *«!.,»(*»,)> (2-27) 
\ \(i, p) eA // (i.p)eA 
for all product operators in siA and all A e SP. Because 
of permutation invariance the density matrices corre-
sponding to q*i p)}(co) depend on p only. 
Proof: For one lattice (r=l) the assertions (ii), (iii) 
and the simplex property of SP9 follow from [23]. That 
this simplex has a w*-compact extreme boundary 
deSP9 is obtained by parametrizing it by the state 
space of the one lattice point algebra. 
If r e N is greater than 1, the group of permutations 
2P is slightly smaller than the group of all finite permu-
tations of the multilattice 01. Nevertheless, one can 
show that SP acts via the automorphisms 0P, P e SP, in 
a norm asymptotically abelian manner on si. Then 
Stormer's proof can be taken over with only minor 
modifications. • 
From Proposition 2.4 it follows that SP9 is affinely 
isomorphic to the classical state space M+(deSP9) 
which belongs to the commutative C*-algebra 
(€{deSP9) of all continuous complex functions on 
deSP9 (equipped with the induced w*-topology). The 
radical procedure of making the states spatially ho-
mogeneous discloses this classical structure - typified 
by the Boolean lattice of all subsets on deSP9 - in the 
easiest manner. A more subtle analysis reveals that 
also the set of all local perturbations of SP9, which is 
mathematically the smallest norm-closed split face 
2F9 containing SP9, represents the same classical 
structure. Most of the following considerations could 
be extended to , but we stick for simplicity to SP9. 
In this sense SP9 is considered as set of those quan-
tum statistical states which are of relevance for the 
thermodynamic point of view. The elements of deSP9 
are then to be interpreted as the pure phases (not 
necessarily in equilibrium) of the system. The equilib-
rium states are singled out in the following by the 
variational principle to be established. 
Of special importance are the canonical equilibrium 
states. 
Definition 2.5. (i) For Ae SP and for given local Hamil-
tonian Ha of (2.20) the local Gibbs state coßA e SP(siA) 
is defined by 
((OßA; A}:=trA(E-^-ß"A A), AES/A, (2.28) 
where £A e IR is determined by the normalization condi-
tion. 
(ii) A state o/ e SP is called a limiting Gibbs state (of 
temperature ß and concentration vector c) if there is a

(iii) The system (specified by (H A; A e SP)) is said 
to have a unique limiting Gibbs state for given ß and c 
if every JP( C ) leads to a limiting Gibbs state in the sense 
of (ii) and all these limiting Gibbs states coincide. 
One can show that for a given family of local 
Hamiltonians there always exist limiting Gibbs states 
for all ß G (0, + oo) and all concentration vectors c due 
to the compactness of SP and that these are elements 
of SP9. The limit on the right hand side of (2.29) - if it 
exists - defines by the w*-continuity of the restriction 
map and by (2.24) automatically a compatible family 
of local states and thus is a constructive method for 
finding the limiting Gibbs states. The question, which 
of the considered mean field interactions lead to 
unique limiting Gibbs states is far from being solved. 
Let us end here our sketch of the quantum statisti-
cal frame for multi-lattice mean field theories, which 
has indicated that the following attributes are inti-
mately connected with each other: the anti-liminarity 
property of the quasi-local algebra si, overcountably 
many disjoint representations of si, overcountably 
many values of the limiting density observables mA (x), 
xel, and a non-trivial classical structure of the set of 
homogeneous states SP9, which will be taken as the 
quantum
 statistical representative of the thermody-
namic state space. Thus, the choice of the algebra of 
observables decides already over the triviality of the 
thermodynamic aspects. Consider, e.g., the case 
m(p) = 2 for 1 < p<r, so that si is isomorphic to the 
CAR-algebra, and represent it in the Fock space. If 
one would incautiously choose the weak closure of 
this operator algebra as algebra of observables, one 
would arrive at a post-liminary algebra (in an irre-
ducible representation). Then all other irreducible rep-
resentations of it would be unitary equivalent to each 
other [9], 
3. Thermodynamic Functional 
In this section the fundamental thermodynamic 
functional entropy, energy, and free energy are intro-
duced. These quantities are first defined on a finite 
region of the lattice; then the infinite volume limits of 
the specific quantities are calculated and some funda-
mental properties discussed. The thermodynamic limit 
shows an essential dependence of the funnel JV(C). 
Definition 3.1. (Local Internal Energy). Let coe SP and 
A G SP. Then the local internal energy of the lattice is 
defined as 
Ua(CD):=<CO;HA>. 
Proposition 3.2. (Specific Internal Energy). Let c be a 
concentration vector with the funnel JP(c), 
(coA G SP9{A); AEJV(C)) with toA^taeSP9. Then 
the following limit exists: 
Ua(COa) 
u(c, co):= lim 
AejT(c) Ml 
(3.1) 
This limit is called the specific internal energy and is a 
w*-continuous affine functional on SP9. 
Proof: We may reduce our calculation to a monomial, 
since UA is linear. Further we will assume that the set 
{1,..., m} is part of each Ap if \A \ is large enough.  If 
this
 is not fulfilled, one can choose a new enumeration 
of the lattice points. Now we calculate 
<<oA;mA(e;\)...mA(e^)'> 
«— I I icoA,e1[Pl...e1Zpmy. 
By permutation invariance and an easy combinatoric 
calculation one can check, that 
lim <c^;m^)...m>£)>

In general the desired limit is

The continuity and affinity in co G SP9 is clear by in-
spection. • 
Observation 3.3. Use the notation of the last proposi-
tion. If cos deSP9, set m"p := <co; e\p) and find by the 
product property: 
u(c, co)= £ Qm(cl m\,... ,cr w"(r)) = Q(c, m).

3.2. Entropy 
For quantum spin systems the connection of states 
of the infinite system with a family of local density 
matrices as described in Sect. 2.3 leads to a natural 
definition of an absolute thermodynamic entropy den-
sity (and not only to a relative one). 
Definition 3.4. (Local Entropy). Let COE Y. Then the 
restriction r]%(co) of co to s4A is a state on stfA with a 
density matrix QA E stfA, such that for all A E srfA 
<tlU<o);A> = tiA{ßA A). 
Now, we can define the entropy functional SA on s4: 
SA • Sf - R : o> - SA(CO) := -TIA(EA In QA). 
In the case, that there exists an eigenvalue / = 0 of Qa, 
one uses the continuity of t -» — t In / at t = 0. 
A consequence of this definition is the subadditivity 
of the local entropies, (cf., e.g. (6.2.24) in [8]). That is, 
we have for all A, fi e if with A n £2 = 0 and arbitrary 
co
e Sf\ 
S^ß M < S,, (co) + Sfi (co) • 
Lemma 3.5. Let che a concentration vector with funnel 
Jffc). For all e>0, there exists a number k e N, such 
that for all QeJf(c) with \Q\>k holds: there is a 
A E JV(C), such that for all A E ^V(c) with A ^ A and 
arbitrary co E Y9U) the following estimation is valid: 
1 1 
— S/1(co)< — So(0)) + e. 
\A
 | |fi| 
Proof: The main task is an estimation of the size of 
regions in a funnel Jf(c). The proof, therefore, is a 
very complicated juggling with the sizes of A, Ap,... 
and is elaborated in the appendix A.l. 
Proposition 3.6 (Specific Entropy). Let c be a concen-
tration vector with funnel Jf(c). For all coEy9, the 
limit 
SA(co) s{c,co):= lim 
AeS(c) Ml 
permutation Pe^ with P(C2) = A. By invariance of 
the entropy under a permutation, if co E Y9, we have 
S4(co) = Sfi(a>). By the subadditivity of the entropy one 
calculates for co e Y9(A) (and therefore for all co E 
that 
0<SA(co)< £ Z S«,.,»(«) = £ MP|S{(p,p)}(co). 
p = 1 ieAp p= 1 
Sinc
e the entropy is bounded on a lattice point, we 
have the relation: 
exists. This limit (the specific entropy) is a w*-contin-
uous, affine functional on y9. 
Proof: (i) Let A E if. If there is another finite region 
fie if, with the same size of the subregions fip, as 
that of the Ap for P e {1,..., r}, then there exists a 
0 SA(co) Vco e y9(A). 
\A\ 
(3.3) 
(ii) Now it is possible to define the following proper-
SA(co) . ties, since 
Ml 
is bounded: 
sA(c, a>):= inf= A'eJT(c) 
f SA.(a>) sA(c,co) := sup|-|-^-M c A'ejr(c) 
and 
s(c, co) := lim s4(c, co) < lim s^c, co) =:s(c, co), 
Ae^(c) AejV(c) 
(iii) With given e>0, use Lemma 3.5 for all A ^ A; 
we conclude: 
1 
s4(c,co)< —Sß(co) + e VA, fi e ^F(c) 
with A c A and \Q\>k. 
Now let us take that limit for A E ^T(c), which ex-
ists, and we obtain 
1 
s(c, co)<-Sn(co) + e. 
The same procedure can be carried through with the 
right hand side, since there is only the condition that 
QEJ^(C) with \Q\>k. 
s(c,co) < sn(c,co) + e VQEJV{C) with \Q\>k 
(3-2) and 
s(c, co) < s(c, co) + e. 
Since e > 0 is arbitrarily small, the existence of the limit 
(3.2) is proved. 
(iv) The affinity is a consequence of two well known 
convexity and concavity relations for the local en-
tropy, see (6.2.25) in [8].

The continuity is calculated with the help of the 
central decomposition of a state co e Sf9 (Theorem 2.4) 
and the following observation 3.7 (cf. [19], [1]). •

4. Minimum Principle for the Free Energy Density 
The minimum principle of the free energy for limiting 
Gibbs states in our context is based on the minimum 
principle of the local free energy for local Gibbs states 
and the convergence of the net 03 ; AeS£ \. 
\ Ml 
This last statement is very specific for the free energy 
density and is not provable for the two other thermo-
dynamic functionals in general. 
Lemma 4.1. Let A e if. Then the following minimum 
principle is valid: 
3.3.
 Free Energy 
Definition 3.8. (Local Free Energy). Let coe Sf, 
A e if and ß e (0, + oo). Then the local free energy of 
the lattice is defined as 
FÄ(ß, OJ):=Ua(co)-~Sa(CO). 
By means of the forgoing section, the next proposition 
follows at once: 
Proposition 3.9. (Specific Free Energy). Let c a con-
centration with funnel J/~(c). For all w e SP9, the limit 
f(c,ß,co):= lim Fyi= u(c, co)- \ s(c, co) (3.5) 
AeS(c) \A\ p 
exists and is called the specific free energy. This limit is 
a w*-continuous, affine functional on y9.

with a tupel of density matrices q=(q1, ... , Qr) e 8S 
and as specific free energy it results 
F
A(ß,coßA)= inf {FA(ß,cp)}. 
tpeSf 
(4.1) 
Proof: The proposition is a consequence of well 
known properties of the free energy in traditional 
quantum statistics, cf., e.g., (6.2.21) in [8]. • 
Lemma 4.2. We define the density of the local free en-
ergy with the corresponding local Gibbs state for an 
arbitrary finite region A e if as 
Uß)-= 
FM O

(4.2) 
Now let c be a concentration vector with funnel Jf(c). 
Then choose a monotone and absorbing sequence 
(A„)„eN^Ar(c) with lim £An(ß) = £{c, ß) and lim (oßAn = 
n -» oo n -»ao 
co e y9. Then it holds 
f(c, ß, co)<£(c, ß). 
Proof: We will give the proof in three steps, dividing 
the specific free energy in the parts of internal energy 
and entropy: 
(i) By convergence, calculated as in Theorem 3.2, we 
have for a fixed E > 0, the existence of a n0 e N such 
that for all n>n0 holds

u(c, C0)< f— +£. MJ

(ii) In order to treat the entropy, we choose for the 
given £ the k from Lemma 3.5. Then there exists by 
definition of 5(c, co) a nx e N and \Ani\>k such that 
w SAni(co) 
s(c, eo)> -e.

That this holds for all n>n2 follows from the monot-
ony of the sequence (A„)NEN. Now use Lemma 3.5. 
This is possible, since we have chosen n>k with k 
from this lemma. Therefore, it exists a n3>n2,  such

m and Definition 4.3. Let c be a concentration

AejT(c) tpeS''1' 
f (ß, c) is the minimal free energy density. 
Note, that this theorem gives the minimum of  the 
free
 energy density with the help of the original local 
Gibbs states! 
Proof: This proof is a consequence of the foregoing 
propositions. With Lemma 4.1., we know, that for an 
arbitrary cp e 
lim sup (ß) < lim sup ——— = lim 
/le^(c) Ae^(c) \A\ AejV(c) \A\

clude

• 
The foregoing considerations involve direct estima-
tions and rather modest mathematical techniques. 
They imply, however, results, of principal physical im-
portance and structural interest. 
As external thermodynamic parameters, we have 
introduced explicitly the temperature ß and the rela-
tive concentrations (cl,...,cr). Implicitly, certain 
parameters in the Hamiltonians HA may have the 
same physical status, especially in the linear part of the 
Ha may appear external field variables (cf., e.g., 
[2, 19]). In the present discussion we fix the family of 
local Hamiltonians and consider as thermodynamic 
equilibrium states those homogeneous states (in Sf9), 
which minimize the free energy density for given val-
ues of c and ß, i.e., we introduce 
Sf{c,ß):={cpeSf9\f (c, ß, cp) = f(c, ß)}. (4.10) 
Observe that we are transforming here intuitive ther-
modynamic notions into rigorous mathematical con-
cepts within a certain class of models, where every 
interpretational  step can and must be thoroughly 
tested. Thus it is to be investigated if all mathematical 
states in Sf{c, ß) correspond in fact to physical equi-
librium states. A more cautious formulation would be 
to consider as such only the accumulation points of 
the net (coA)AeJy{c) together with the components in 
their central decomposition, since this structure arises 
directly from the coßA. In which way both notions are 
related to each other is partially clarified by the fol-
lowing results. 
Theorem 4.4. Let be c an arbitrary concentration vector 
and ß e (0, + co) an arbitrary natural temperature. 
Then
 it holds: 
(i) Sf(c,ß) is a compact stable face of Sf9: 

941 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
(ii) y(c,ß) is a Bauer simplex with extreme 
boundary 
6eSf(c, ß) = dtSf* n&(ct ß); 
(iii) Every accumulation point of ((lies in 
y (c, ß) and its central decomposition is equal to its 
unique extremal decomposition in y (c, ß). 
Proof: (i) Since / (c, /?,.) is affine, y(c, ß) is convex and 
since / (c, ß,-) is w*-continuous, y(c, ß) is w*-closed, 
hence (as a subset of the compact set Sf) w*-compact. 
If 
y(c,ß)s co = J (pdp(cp) 
for some probability Borel measure on y9, one has 
f(c,ß) = f(c,ß,a>)= j f{c,ß,q>)dp(cp). (4.11) 
If supp(/z) would not be contained in y(c, ß), there 
would be a compact set Jf c= y9 with p(jf)>0 and 
Jf ny(c, ß) = 0. Then it would hold: min{/(c, ß, tp); 
(pe Jf] > f(c, ß), which could not be compensated by 
the values / (c, ß, cp) e y9\JT and thus would contra-
dict (4.11). Thus we must conclude, that 
supp(p) c y(c, ß), which is the characterizing prop-
erty of a stable face. 
(ii) According to section 2.3, there is an affine w*-
vague-continuous bijection between the states co e y9 
and the probability measures p^e M\(dey9). If 
co G y{c, ß) <= y9, then supp(//J c0/n y(c, ß) 
according to (i). Thus the mentioned bijection reduced 
to y(c, ß) induces an affine, w*-vague-continuous map-
ping onto Ml+ (dey9 n y(c, ß)), where the latter is a 
Bauer simplex according to [20], §4. Since the 
extreme boundary of M\ (dey9 n y(c, ß)) consists 
of the point measures on the w*-compact set 
Sey9 n y(c, ß), the latter constitutes the extreme 
boundary of y (c, ß). 
(iii) If co is an accumulation point of (copA)AeJr(c), then 
we have a convergent subnet of (coA)AeJ^(c), which may 
be chosen as a sequence, since y is separable in the 
w*-topologie. Now, we can employ Lemma 4.2. and 
Theorem 4.3. to show, that co has minimal free energy 
and thus is in y (c, ß). According to (ii) and (i) the 
unique extremal decompositions of co in y (c, ß) and 
in y9 coincide, where the latter is just the central 
decomposition. • 
The results of Theorem 4.4. justify to consider the 
elements of 3ey(c, ß) as the pure equilibrium phase 
states:
 first of all they are factor states and thus macro-
scopically pure and second every mixed phase state 
co G y(c, ß) decomposes into them in a  unique man-
ner.
 Therefore, in order to know all of y (c, ß) it is 
sufficient to determine dey (c, ß) what will be done in 
the next section. It is an interesting open  problem 
whether
 the union of the central components of the 
accumulation points equals all of dey (c, ß). 
In this context it is also important to note that the 
free energy minimum principle may be restricted to 
macroscopically pure states only. 
Corollary 4.5. (Minimum Principle in de y9) For every 
choice of c and ß it holds 
dey(c, ß) = {co G dey*\f(c, ß, co)=f(c, ß)}. (4.12) 
Proof: This follows directly from the  fact that 
de
y(c, ß) a dey&, which holds by Theorem 4.4. (ii). 
• 
Now we have sufficient information to develop a 
calculation procedure for the pure equilibrium phases. 
5. Selfconsistency-Equations 
By the results of the last section, we deduce the well 
known selfconsistency equations as a consequence of 
the minimum principle of the specific free energy. For 
this, we need 
Lemma 5.1. Let be ß e (0, oo),ca concentration vector 
and a) e dey (c, ß) a pure phase equilibrium state with 
the tupel
 of density matrices (qx ,... , gr) e Then  we 
have 0
 a (qp) Vp G 1,... ,r. 
Proof: See Appendix A.2. • 
Note that the set of all density matrices in a matrix-
algebra with non-zero eigenvalues is an open set in the 
norm-topology. The minimizing states of Lemma 5.1. 
are not in the boundary of the states on 88p. This is 
important for calculating the derivatives of the 
thermodynamic functionals on the space of extremal 
permutation invariant states. Let us begin with the 
specific entropy on the extremal permutation invari-
ant states, which can be reduced to the entropy of a 
finite dimensional matrix-algebra: 
Lemma 5.2. Let Mn the algebra of nx n-matrices and 
U={Q G M„\ Q selfadjoint and a (Q) A (0,1)}. 
Now take the functional s : U IR., q -+s (q) = — 

942 Th. Gerisch and A. Rieckers • The Quantum Statistical Free Energy 
tr (Q In (Q) ). Then we have for self adjoint h e Mn, such 
that Q + h e U: 
s(ß
 + h) = s(ß) + s'Ah) + *(\\h\ (5.1) 
with the rest term o(\\h\\), vanishing more rapidly than 
first order in || h || and the linear functional se : M™ -* ]R 
where
 the quantity sQ is called the total derivative of s 
with respect to Q. 
Proof: See Appendix A. 3. • 
Now we deal with the derivative of the multi lattice 
specific energy in the following lemma, the proof of 
which requires only differentiation rules for numerical 
polynomials Q : IR" -> R. 
Lemma 5.3. Take an element ß e W x...x Wr 
with each Wp equal to the U from Lemma 5.2. Then 
define the functional ü(c, ß) on W with a fixed concen-
tration vector c as 
u(c, ß):=Q{c,m{ß)) 
= Q(c, tr^! <?}),-.., trr(er e"r{r)), 
where (2.21) and (3.6) has been employed. Then we 
have for h := (hlt... ,hr) with each hp self adjoint 
and ßp + hpe Wp 
ü(c, {ß
l+h1,...,ßr + hr)) 
= ü{c, ß) + ü'e{h) + #(\\h\\), (5.3) 
where o (\\ h ||) is a remainder term in || h || and u'e a 
linear functional on 08 of the form 
r n(p) Q 
Ü'0(h)= Z Z trp(hpe"p) — Q\(c,m)\Me). (5.4) 
p= 1 n= 1 6 ml 
0„ = 
Proof: The formula is proved with the help of the 
foregoing lemmas. The variational principle is carried 
out on the open set W, defined as in Lemma 5.3., on 
which the functional 
ü(c, ß)

~
R Z cpsp(Qp) 
P P= I 
(5.6) 
is varied under the subsidiary conditions: 
gp(ß):= trpU?p)-l=0, for l<p<r. (5.7) 
Since 
g'pe(h) = trp{hp), 
fori <p<r,ßeW and h = (h1,..., hr), (5.8) 
we have the linear independence of these r linear func-
tiona
l in the variable he 38, and thus every ß e W is 
a regular point for the subsidiary conditions in the 
sense of [21]. Thus in order that ß belongs to a state 
in deSf{c, ß), it is necessary ([21]), that there are r real 
constants (the Lagrange parameters) z^,..., kr such 
that it holds for sufficiently small selfadjoint h e M :

Since the hp are arbitrary if || hf 
one concludes for all p:

Note that the two lemmas treat the differentiation of 
the functionals s, ü over positive matrices with 
ö-(^) cz (0, 1). If we restrict ourselves to density ma-
trices, we have the usual thermodynamic functionals 
for extremal permutation invariant states. 
Theorem 5.4. Let ß=(ßx,... ,ßr) effl belong to an ex-
tremal permutation invariant state in deSf (c, ß). Then 
it satisfies the so-called matrix-valued self consistency-
equations:

\\Ap\-m\Qp\\ = 1 \A | \Q\ \Q\ 1

Put this into the equation (A. 14) and obtain 
kp = \Ap\-m\Qp\+(m-m)\Qp\<e'\A\ 
+ (m — m + \)\Qp\. (A. 16) 
Now, we need an estimation of m and m: by definition, 
there
 exists one p e {1,..., r} with \A])\< (m+ l)|ßp|

Replacing (m — m +1) in equation (A. 16) by this result, 
we
 have

by (A.ll). (A. 18) 
Now there are all equations available for estimating 
the size of the considered regions. We use the decom-
position
 indicated in Part (ii). Then we have 
\A°\= ^kp<(2+^J\A\re' + 3\C2\. (A.19)

specific entropy in a finite region for an arbitrary state

 Proof of Lemma 5.1. 
This proof is a slight generalization of the tech-
niques used in [22], Lemma II.2. Suppose 0 e O(Qp) for

a fixed p. We choose KX = 0 as the first eigenvalue of QP-. with a new polynomial p3 (r). But the argument in  the 
Further
 we have the projections Px,..., Ps on the dif- logarithmic part in the derivative becomes arbitrarily 
ferent one dimensional eigensubspaces belonging to small in the neighborhood of t = 0. This means, that 
/'(r)<0 as t -> 0 and so one reaches a state g(t) with 
/ (c, ß, g{t))< f{c,ß,q) which contradicts the as-
the eigenvalues. Thus we have 
s 
Qp= Z sumption, that Q minimizes the specific free energy. 
Now let us choose a new permutation-invariant  state 
(pit), which is identified with the density matrices A.3 Proof of Lemma 5.2. 
Q(t):=(g1,...,(l-t) gP + t P^.,.,6 r), (i) Let us begin with an estimation of the n'th power 
of the sum of two elements in Jtn. It holds for arbi-
where t e [0,1 ]. Calculating the free energy / (c, ß, (p (t)), trary x,y e Jln and hN: 
one obtains 
f(t) := f(c, ß, cp(t)) = Q(c, (p(t))~ i s(c, (pit))

P k = 2 
with pj (t), p2(r) polynomials in t. Thus it is possible to 
evaluate the derivative with respect to t for t^O: 
f'(t) = p'2(t)+-?il+\n(t)+  Z Ak(ln((l-t) Afc) + 1)

This estimation is obtained straight forwardly by cal-
culating (x + y)k. 
(ii) Now take an x e U (=> || 1 — x || < 1). Since U is 
open
 in the norm topology, there exist <5>0 and rj < 1 
such that for all selfadjoint h with || h || < <3, y := x + h is 
strictly positive and || 1 — x || + || h || < q <  1. 
To
 investigate the expansion of the entropy-func-
tional, we use the well known series representation of 
ln(t) which converges absolutely and uniformly on the 
interval [a, 1] with a >0. Using the functional calculus, 
we have

Note, that the lemma holds for an arbitrary C*-algebra with 1 and a trace state. The proof is then completely 
the same as in our case.
