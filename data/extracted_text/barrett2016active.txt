In this paper, we integrate recent theoretical and empirical developments in
predictive coding and active inference accounts of interoception (including
the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model) with working hypoth-
eses from the theory of constructed emotion to propose a biologically plausible
unified theory of the mind that places metabolism and energy regulation
(i.e. allostasis), as well as the sensory consequences of that regulation (i.e. inter-
oception), at its core. We then consider the implications of this approach for
understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allos-
tasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a ‘locked in’ brain that is relatively
insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the
ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.
This article is part of the themed issue ‘Interoception beyond homeostasis:
affect, cognition and mental health’.
1. Introduction
Since ancient times, the human mind has been understood as a collection of
mental faculties for thinking (cognitions), feeling (emotions) and volition
(actions, and in more modern versions, perceptions). These categories come
not from biology, but from the philosophical concerns about truth, beauty
and ethics that anchor Western theories of human nature. But the human
brain did not evolve to think or feel or see. Several decades of research
points to a different hypothesis: the human brain has a common computational
architecture that, first and foremost, supports the human body as it moves,
grows, survives and reproduces [1]. As a consequence,metabolism and other
forms of energy regulation may be at the core of the human mind, regardless
of whether a person is thinking, feeling or perceiving. An emerging theoretical
framework, centred on energy regulation, rests on three important insights.
First, brains do not react to the world, but instead predict and then test their
hypotheses against incoming sensory evidence. Their hypotheses constitute
internal models of the body in the worldthat are constructed via Bayesian infer-
ences constrained by sensory inputs, from which all perceptions and actions
emerge (for a discussion of the computational details, see [2,3]). All animal
brains, not just those found in a human body, host an internal model [1].
Collectively, these ideas are referred to as predictive coding, active inference
or belief propagation accounts of brain function (e.g. [4–10]); informative dis-
cussions of these accounts are found in several other papers in this issue
[2,11]. Second, a human brain’s internal model (i.e. predictions) constructs all
varieties of cognitions, emotions and perceptions, and guides actions, but the
computational architecture for prediction did not evolvefor these purposes.
Predictions fundamentally serve to maintain energy balance, i.e. allostasis.
Allostasis is not a condition or state of the body—it is how the brain efficiently
maintains energy regulation in the body [1,12]. Allostasis is defined in terms of
prediction: a brain maintains energy regulation by anticipating the body’s needs

and preparing to satisfy those needs before they arise
[1,12–14]. For example, allostasis describes the brain’s capacity
both to predict that to start running requires more oxygen in
the body’s striate muscles, as well as to mobilize the needed
resources by increasing cardiac output, redistributing blood
flow from organs that can spare oxygen (e.g. the stomach),
etc. Third, these predictions cause changes in the body’s
internal systems (in humans, these include the immune, endo-
crine and autonomic nervous systems) and the sensations that
arise from those changes are calledinteroception [15]. Interocep-
tive sensations are routinely experienced as lower dimensional
feelings of affect [16,17]. If interoception plays a role in allosta-
sis, and allostasis is at the core of the brain’s computational
architecture, then the properties of affect—valence and arousal
[18,19]—are best thought of as basic features of consciousness
[20–26], rather than properties of emotionper se. These insights
offer the possibility of better understanding why affective dys-
regulation (and correspondingly, interoceptive difficulties)
constitute a transdisorder vulnerability to mental illness [27],
are key factors in mood disorders [28] and are common in
physical illness [29]; for a discussion, see [11].
Recently, a powerful predictive coding account of interocep-
tion has emerged [2,11,30–33]. This account, when integrated
with the insights above, creates a powerful framework for re-
examining how the computational architecture for prediction
can produce affective dysregulation (e.g. [5,17]). The purpose
of this paper is to discuss these exciting and potentially transfor-
mative ideas with reference to the development and treatment
of depression. We begin by considering predictive coding
accounts of allostasis and interoception, briefly outlining our
hypotheses about the brain’s computational architecture with
a focus on allostasis and interoception as core features. We
then introduce the theory of constructed emotion, and present
several novel hypotheses that unite the metabolic, mood and
vegetative symptoms that occur in depression (and in other
illnesses as well) within a common computational framework.
We conclude by exploring the implications for treatment.
2. Energy regulation is at the core of the brain’s
computational architecture
There is a virtual revolution emerging in our understanding of
brain structure and function, nicely illustrated by several
papers in this special issue (i.e. [2,11]). It begins with a
simple idea: maintaining a body is expensive. A body must
be watered, fed and cared for, so that it can grow, thrive
and ultimately, reproduce and care for its young. Growth, sur-
vival and reproduction (and therefore gene transmission)
depend on the near continual intake of energy resources
(metabolic and otherwise). Further, the physical movements
necessary to move around in the world and acquire those
resources in the first place (and protect against threats and
dangers) require upfront energy expenditures which in mam-
mals include spending resources such as glucose, water,
oxygen, electrolytes, etc. To flourish, an animal must balance
energy expenditures with deposits and see a return on its
resource investments, not just in the quality and quantity of
resources acquired, but also in having enough surplus
energy to encode and consolidate the details of experience,
making those experiences available within the brain’s synap-
tic connections to guide future decisions about expenditures
and deposits. From the brain’s perspective, then, its body
and the world beyond are a system within which the body’s
overall metabolism and energy regulation must be managed.
With these observations in mind, we can think of a brain as
hosting an internal model of the world from the perspective
of its body’s physiological needs (following the well-known
cybernetics principle that anything which regulates (i.e. acts
on) a system must contain aninternal model of that system
[34]). An internal model is implemented by intrinsic brain
activity (e.g. [35–38]) that, in humans, uses a whopping
20% of the total energy consumed [39].
1 The novel consider-
ation here is that allostasis, and its sensory consequences
(i.e. interoception), are core features of this model.
Allostasis isthe capacity tovary physiological systems flexibly
according to predicted energy demands [1].Efficiencyrequires the
ability toanticipatethe body’s needs andprepare to satisfy them
before they arise [1,12].2 Too much of a resource (e.g. obesity)
or not enough (e.g. fatigue, [44]) is suboptimal, and ineffi-
cient. Prolonged imbalances can lead to illness (e.g. [45,46])
that remodels the brain, specifically causing atrophy in the
regions that subserve allostasis [47,48] and causing increased
arborization of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to
enhanced sympathetic reactivity [49,50]. For a review, see
[51]. This in turn makes physiological regulation even less
efficient and therefore more metabolically expensive.
A broad range of evidence supports the hypothesis that the
primary task of a brain is to implement allostasis in the service
of efficient metabolism and energy regulation. First, there is the
signal processing evidence across species that to enhance effi-
ciency, brains send only the minimum data necessary, as
efficiently as possible, and using the least possible neural
wiring [1].
3 Second, there is both structural and functional
brain imaging evidence in humans that reveals a system
which integrates allostasis and interoception at the core of
the brain’s intrinsic architecture [52,53] (figure 1). This
system consists of two intrinsic networks, conventionally
called the default mode network and the salience network,
connected by an ensemble of the brain’s ‘rich club’ hubs.
These hubs belong to a community of densely interconnec-
tion regions that make up the structural core of the brain
that serves as a high-capacity backbone for synchronizing
information flow [54–60]. Rich clubs appear across species
as diverse as roundworms, fruit flies and humans [61]. In pri-
mates, rich club regions have more complex pyramidal cell
structure (larger dendritic branches, larger spines, etc.; [62])
and possess more excitatory (relative to inhibitory) che-
moarchitecture [63]. Furthermore, older studies that applied
strychnine to the exposed cortices of macaque monkeys (to
block local GABA receptors and temporarily increase excit-
atory signals sent from the treated cortical area) reveal that
rich club hubs have stronger connections that together have
a net excitatory effect on other regions of cortex [64]. Simi-
larly, higher intrinsic connectivity involving the pregenual
anterior cingulate cortex (a rich club hub) is associated
with higher glutamate and glutamine concentrations in that
cortical site [65]. These findings are consistent with other
brain imaging evidence showing that networks flexibly
adjust their connectivity to one another via the rich club
hubs to prepare for and adjust to changing task demands
[66,67]. The default mode and salience networks are ‘multi-
use’ or ‘domain general’ networks that are routinely
engaged in a wide variety of tasks spanning almost every
phenomenon and task domain within psychology [68,69].
Others have even argued that consciousness is enabled by

the sort of information integration provided by the hubs of
the rich club [22].
Recently, we [30,70], along with others [2,11,31–33], have
proposed a computational architecture for the brain that
places allostasis and interoception at the core of its internal
model. This assertion is based on integrating several different
lines of research. First, decades of anatomical and functional
research shows that the five exteroceptive sensory systems
work via predictive inference (for a review of evidence, see
[70]; for recent ultra-high field brain imaging evidence,
see [71]), as does the motor system [72–76]. The brain predicts
the timing and content of sensory events [77]. These findings
strongly support the increasingly popular hypothesis that the
brain constructs embodied simulations [78,79] that function as
Bayesian filters [3,80] for incoming sensory input, driving
action and constructing perception. We integrated this view
with a second line of research that has produced a well-
validated neuroanatomical model for information flow
within the brain [81–83]. Together, these research findings
allowed us to propose that simulations, as ongoing, intrinsic
activity, function as prediction signals (also known as ‘top-
down’ or ‘feedback’ signals, and more recently as ‘forward’
models) that serve as plans for allostasis by continuously
anticipating sensory events in the body and in the outer
environment.
4 Unanticipated information (prediction error)
from both internal and external sensory domains modulates
the predictions (also known as ‘bottom-up’ or, confusingly,
‘feedforward’ signals). Error signals track the difference
between the predicted sensations and those that are incoming
from the sensory world (including the body’s peripheral

physiological systems). The brain has various mechanisms for
reducing prediction errors, and once they are sufficiently
minimized, predictions (i.e. simulations) become the infer-
ences about the causes of sensory events and plans for how
to move (or not to move) the body to deal with them [7,91].
By modulating ongoing visceromotor actions (i.e. inner
movements associated with the immune, endocrine and auto-
nomic nervous systems) and motor movements to deal with
upcoming sensory events, a brain infers their likely causes.
In our view, then, sensory predictions arise from allostasis,
and therefore allostasis (and interoception) guide all
mental function. Sensory prediction errors (i.e. learning) are
treated, at a very basic level, as information that guides a
predicted allostatic plan. Whatever else the brain might be
doing—thinking, seeing, tasting—it is also predictively
regulating the body’s physiological systems in the service
of allostasis.
These various sources of evidence allowed us to propose a
very specific computational architecture for implementing
allostasis, guiding action and constructing perception [30,70],
and we further develop this framework here (figure 2). Specifi-
cally, we proposed that prediction signals originate in cortical
regions that have the least well-developed laminar structure,
referred to asagranular cortices. The most agranular cortical
sites are cytoarchitecturally arranged to send but not receive
cortical prediction signals. Another name for agranular cortices
is limbic. Limbic cortices, such as the cingulate cortices and the

Primary motor cortex is depicted in red, and primary sensory regions are in yellow. For simplicity, only primary visual, interoceptive and somatosen sory cortices are
shown; subcortical regions are not shown. ( b) Limbic cortices initiate allostatic predictions to the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei (e.g. periaqueductal grey, para-
brachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract) to regulate the autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune systems (solid lines). The incoming sensory i nputs from the
internal milieu of the body are carried along the vagus nerve and small diameter C and A d fibres to limbic regions (dotted lines). Comparisons between prediction
signals and ascending sensory input results in prediction error that is available to update the brain’s internal model. In this way, prediction error s are learning signals and
can adjust subsequent predictions. ( c) Efferent copies of allostatic predictions are sent to motor cortex as motor predictions (solid lines) and prediction errors are sent from
motor cortex to limbic cortices (dotted lines). ( d ) Sensory cortices receive sensory predictions from several sources. They receive efferent copies of allostatic predictions
(black lines) and efferent copies of motor predictions (red lines). Sensory cortices with less well-developed lamination (e.g. primary interocept ive cortex) also send
sensory predictions to sensory cortices that are more well developed (e.g. in this figures, somatosensory and primary visual cortices) (orange line s). For simplicity’s

cortical sites that project to subcortical regions controlling allos-
tasis, such as medial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex, and parts of temporal and parietal cortex, provide the
substrate for allostasis (figure 2a). Descending allostatic predic-
tion signals are relayed to the body’s physiological systems via
a collection of subcortical regions [52,53], including the central
nucleus of the amygdala [92], the ventral and dorsal striatum,
and the central pattern generators [93] of the hypothalamus,
the parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal grey and the solitary
nucleus (figure 2b).
5 The hippocampus very likely has a
predictive role to play in allostasis as well (e.g. [95,96]).
Following the anatomic principles of information flow
[81–83], we hypothesized that efferent copies of allostatic
signals cascade to primary motor cortex as skeletomotor pre-
diction signals, as well as to all primary sensory cortices as
sensory prediction signals (see figure 2c,d, respectively; for a
discussion, see [30,70,72,80]). Tract-tracing evidence indicates
that prediction signals flow from deep layers of limbic cortices
and terminate in the upper layers of cortical regions with
more developed (i.e. more granular) structure, such as gusta-
tory and olfactory cortex, primary motor cortex, primary
interoceptive cortex, and the primary visual, auditory and
somatosensory regions (which have the most developed lami-
nar organization). Some prediction signals are conveyed
directly to primary sensory regions via metabolically more
expensive long-range connections, whereas others become pro-
gressively more detailed as they cascade through numerous
synaptic relays (such that the posterior probabilities in the
sending cortex become the priors in the receiving cortex in
Bayesian terms).
6
Because motor cortex has a laminar organization that is
less well developed than primary visual, auditory, somato-
sensory and interoceptive regions [101], we hypothesize
that motor cortex sends efferent copies to those sensory
regions as sensory predictions (figure 2d, solid red paths;
see [72]). Furthermore, because of their differential laminar
organization, we hypothesize that primary interoceptive
cortex in mid-to-posterior dorsal insula forwards sensory
predictions to visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices
which propagate across either a single or multiple synapses
(figure 2d, solid orange paths). The skeletomotor prediction
signals prepare the body for movement, whereas the intero-
ceptive prediction signals are represented as a change in
affect (i.e. the expected sensory consequences within the
body) and the extrapersonal sensory prediction signals pre-
pare upcoming perceptions. This ensemble of hypotheses is
consistent not only with over three decades of tract-tracing
studies in non-human animals, but also with engineering
design principles (i.e. compute locally, and relay only the
information that is needed to assemble a larger pattern; [1]).
As prediction signals cascade across the synapses within a
brain, incoming sensory signals arriving to the brain (i.e. from
the external environment and the internal periphery) simul-
taneously allow for computations of prediction error that are
encoded to update the internal model (correcting visceromotor
and motor action plans, as well as sensory representations; see
figure 2, dotted paths). Sensory signals arise from changes
within the body’s physiological systems and ascend via vagal
afferents and small diameter afferents in the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord, through the nucleus of the solitary tract, the
parabrachial nucleus, the periaqueductal grey and finally to
the ventral posterior thalamus, before arriving in granular
layer IV of the primary interoceptive insular cortex [15,102].
Prediction errors also arise within the amygdala, the basal
ganglia and the cerebellum and are forwarded to the cortex
to correct its internal model [52,103–105].
Within this framework, we hypothesize that information
flowing from the amygdala to the cortex is not ‘emotional’
per se , but signals uncertainty [106] about the predicted
sensory input (via the basolateral complex) and helps to
adjust physiological functions in support of allostasis (via
the central nucleus) as a result.
7 The arousal signals that are
associated with increases in amygdala activity (e.g. [108])
can be considered as learning signals [109]. Similarly, predic-
tion errors from the ventral striatum to the cortex (referred to
as ‘reward prediction errors’ [110]) convey information about
sensory inputs that impact allostasis more than expected
(i.e. indicating that this information should be encoded and
consolidated in the cortex, and acted upon immediately).
Dopamine is hypothesized to support vigorous action and
learning that is necessary to secure the rewards that maintain
efficient allostasis (or restore it in the event of disruption),
rather than playing a necessary or sufficient role in rewards
themselves [111,112]. Other neuromodulators, such as opioids,
may be more intrinsically rewarding (e.g. [113]).
The cerebellum models sensory prediction errors from the
periphery and relays them to cortex to rapidly modify motor
predictions (i.e. it is hypothesized to predict the sensory con-
sequences of a motor command much faster than actual
sensory prediction errors can be received [74], and helps
the cortex reduce the sensory consequences caused by one’s
own movements). The cerebellum may have the same role
to play for allostatic predictions given the connectivity
between the cerebellum and cingulate cortices, hypothalamus
and the amygdala [104,114–116].
8 This would give the
cerebellum a major role in allostasis.
The limbic cortices that guide allostasis fall within the tra-
ditional territory of three intrinsic networks within the brain.
We have discussed two of them already (figure 1). The first is
the default mode network, which we hypothesize genera-
tively uses prior experiences to construct the brain’s internal
model. This proposal is consistent with other proposals that
the default mode network constructs mental models of the
world from different points of view and different time
points [36–38]. If a simulation is an embodied brain state,
then the default mode network ‘initiates’ simulations and
represents part of their pattern; its multimodal sensorimotor
summaries become more detailed and particularized as they
cascade out to primary sensory and motor regions.
We further hypothesize that the limbic cortices within the
salience network send predictions that adjust the internal
model to the conditions of the sensory periphery, again in
the service of allostasis. This is consistent with the salience
network’s role in attention regulation; (e.g. [117–120]). We
specifically propose that the salience network tunes the
internal model by anticipating which prediction errors
are likely to be allostatically relevant and therefore worth
the metabolic cost of encoding and consolidation [121], and
then modulating the gain on those errors accordingly.
9 These
predictions are called precision signals [123–126]. Precision
signals optimize the sampling of the sensory periphery for
allostasis. Via their core position in the brain’s rich club,
and their role in multisensory integration [57], the salience
network’s precision signals apply attention to every sensory
system in the brain (this is sometimes called ‘affective’ atten-
tion). Precision signals directly alter the gain on neurons as

they compute prediction error from incoming sensory input
(i.e. they apply attention to signal the degree of confidence
in the reliability or quality of incoming sensory signals,
and/or the predicted relevance for allostasis). Unexpected
sensory inputs that are anticipated to have allostatic impli-
cations (because they are likely to impact survival, offering
reward or threat, or are of uncertain value) will be treated
as ‘signal’ and learned (i.e. encoded) to better predict
energy needs in the future, with all other prediction error
treated as ‘noise’ and safely ignored ([109]; for discussion,
see [17]). Limbic regions within the salience network can
also indirectly signal the precision of incoming sensory
inputs via their modulation of the reticular nucleus that
encircles that thalamus and controls the sensory input that
reaches the cortex via thalamocortical pathways (for relevant
anatomy, see [127–129]).
In a healthy brain, prediction error signals allow for learn-
ing to better tailor the brain’s internal model to the immediate
circumstances and, thereby, to minimize future error and
improve efficient allostasis. As we propose later in this paper,
however, chronic prediction errors of a certain magnitude
and frequency could constitute a transdisorder vulnerability
to illness. In our view, the management of precision is a
key computation that is relevant in the development and
maintenance of depression.
Importantly, the salience network helps accomplish multi-
modal integration (its spatial topography strongly overlaps
with the multimodal integration network as documented
in [57]). Moreover, as we have documented, primary intero-
ceptive cortex (in the dorsal mid to posterior insula) is a
component of the salience network, ensuring that every
mental event (not just emotions) is infused with interoception,
which is made available to consciousness as affect. This state of
affairs provides the recipe for affective realism, where people
experience supposed facts about the world that are created in
part by interoception and the associated affective feelings
[17]. Food is ‘delicious’ or ‘distasteful’. People are ‘nice’ or
‘mean.’ Affective realism leads people to believe that objects
and people in the world are inherently negative or positive.
Finally, we hypothesize that neurons within the fronto-
parietal control network sculpt and maintain simulations
for longer than the several hundred milliseconds it takes to
process imminent prediction errors. We hypothesize that
they apply attention to adjust the degree of confidence in sen-
sory predictions (i.e., adjusting priors) and they may also
help to suppress or inhibit simulations whose priors are
very low. It pays to be flexible, to construct, maintain and
use patterns that extend over longer periods of time (different
animals have different timescales that are relevant for their
behavioural repertoire and ecological niche). It is also valu-
able to learn on a single trial, without the need for
recurring statistical regularities in the world, particularly if
you reside in a quickly changing environment or when the
prediction error was large. As a prediction generator, the
brain is constructing simulations across many different time-
scales (i.e. it is integrating information across the few
moments that constitute an event, but also across longer
time frames at various scales; for similar ideas, see
[96,130]). The frontoparietal control network (which contains
key limbic rich-club hubs in the mid cingulate cortex and
anterior insula) also may have a role to play in managing sen-
sory prediction errors, by applying attention to select those
body movements that will generate the expected sensory
inputs, presumably with help from cerebellar and striatal pre-
diction errors. These movements then generate the sensory
inputs that reduce prediction error and confirm an existing
prediction. This dynamic may have importance for
depression; as we will see, physical movements are often
compromised in the most severe cases of depression, remov-
ing a mechanism for reducing prediction error.
3. The theory of constructed emotion
Thus far, we have proposed that the brain’s internal model
consists of embodied, whole brain representations that predict
what is about to happen in the external environment, the best
course of action for dealing with these impending events, and
their consequences for allostasis. The implication is that all
perception (i.e. the ‘meaning’ of sensory events) contains inter-
oceptive representations that are a consequence of allostasis.
The processing of prediction errors is also guided by allosta-
sis-relevant predictions (i.e. precision estimates, or ‘affective’
attention). These working hypotheses, and the anatomical
and functional evidence that supports them, fill the compu-
tational and neural gaps in initial theoretical formulations in
the conceptual act theory of emotion [131–135], transforming
it into a unified theory of mind and brain that provides novel
hypotheses about how a brain constructs emotional events [17].
Specifically, the unified theory proposes that the brain’s
internal model runs on concepts, constructed as prediction sig-
nals. Traditionally, a category is a population of events or
objects that are treated as similar because they all serve a par-
ticular goal in some context; aconcept is the population of
representations that correspond to those events or objects
[136]. Evidence indicates that the brain prepares multiple com-
peting predictions (with associated energy costs and potential
rewards) before deciding between them and implementing
one [137]. Because the brain regulates physiological systems
to proactively provide the energy necessary for motor move-
ments, our complimentary hypothesis is that it assembles a
population of predictions, i.e. a concept, with a distribution
of prior probabilities (what cognitive scientists refer to as an
‘ad hoc’ concept; [79,138,139]). In the language of the brain, a
concept is a group of distributed patterns of neural spike
trains, across a population of neurons, whose representations
reflect the spatial and temporal scales that are most relevant
to an animal’s behavioural repertoire. This hypothesis is gener-
ally consistent with brain imaging findings that the default
mode network represents semantic concepts [140,141]. Predic-
tions, as embodied brain states, emerge as default mode
summaries cascade out to primary sensory and motor regions
to become detailed and particularized (i.e. to modulate the
spiking patterns of sensory and motor neurons [17]; for sup-
porting evidence on embodied representations of concepts,
see [142–145]).
10
Using past experience as a guide, the brain is essentially
asking, ‘what is this new sensory input most similar to?’
[147,148], where similarity is computed against the popu-
lation of predictions and their associated energy costs
and potential benefits for the body. That is, the conceptual
representations (i.e. the prediction signals with some distri-
bution of priors) are tested against the incoming sensory
evidence to categorize incoming sensory signals (from out-
side the skull) according to past experience (producing a
distribution of posterior probabilities). Incoming sensory

evidence, as prediction error, helps to select from or modify
this distribution of predictions, because certain simulations
will better fit the sensory array (i.e. they will have larger pos-
teriors), such that incoming sensory events are categorized as
similar to the past experiences with the highest posterior
probabilities, thereby making them meaningful. The resulting
categorization enables allostasis, allowing the brain to effi-
ciently predict energy expenditures for motor actions, as
well as the benefits that will result; this is how the brain
proactively adjusts the body’s physiological systems to satisfy
those needs before they arise [12]. We hypothesize that, in
this way, the brain manages physiological systems and
motor actions to deal with upcoming sensory events, infer-
ring their likely causes as they happen. The brain, via its
trio of core networks, proactively anticipates demand across
multiple body systems (e.g. need for glucose, oxygen, salt,
etc.), evaluates the priorities (in terms of immediate and
longer term needs, costs and likely pay-offs), and thereby
implements allostasis. In neurotypical brains, completed
predictions are categorizations that maintain efficient physio-
logical regulation, guide appropriate action and construct
perception. The meaning of every sensory event therefore
includes a plan for allostasis during that event.
The unified theory also proposes that the processing of pre-
diction error is equivalent to concept learning. Prediction errors
(i.e. unanticipated sensory inputs) cascade in a feedforward
cortical sweep, originating in the upper layers of cortices that
have more-developed lamination and terminating in the deep
layers of cortices with less well-developed lamination.
11
As information flows from primary sensory regions (whose
upper layers contain many smaller pyramidal neurons with
fewer connections) to limbic and other heteromodal regions
in frontal cortex (whose upper layers contain fewer but
larger pyramidal neurons with many more connections),
it is compressed and reduced in dimensionality [149].
This dimension reduction efficiently represents a lot of
information with a smaller number of neurons, reducing
redundancy and saving metabolic cost, because smaller
populations of neurons are summarizing statistical regu-
larities in the spiking patterns in larger populations in
the sensory and motor regions. Additional efficiency is
achieved because conceptually similar representations utilize
similar neural populations during simulation (e.g. [150]).
As a result, different predictions are separable, but are not
spatially separate (such that multimodal summaries are orga-
nized in a continuous neural territory that reflects their
similarity to one another). In this way, the brain is con-
densing redundant firing patterns into more efficient (and
cost-effective) multimodal summaries. This information is
available for later use as limbic cortices generatively construct
prediction signals, initiated as low-dimensional, multimodal
summaries (i.e. ‘abstractions’); as we noted earlier, these sum-
maries, consolidated from prior encoding of prediction errors,
become more detailed and particular as they propagate out to
more architecturally granular sensory and motor regions.
From this perspective, we hypothesize that interoceptive pre-
dictions are part of every concept that is learned and
constructed, and categorization via concepts is the prime com-
putation by which the emotion regulation process, cognitive
reappraisal, takes place (the mechanisms for other regulation
processes [151,152] can also be understood with our predictive
inference account, but that is beyond the scope of this paper).
This particular hypothesis is relevant to depression because,
like most disorders, depression is associated both with alexithy-
mia, a condition defined by an impoverished conceptual
understanding of emotion, and intense negative affect [153–
155]. Interestingly, both alexithymia and depression are
linked to diminished interoceptive awareness (e.g. [28,156]),
which itself has recently been characterized as an inability
to calibrate precision estimates for interoceptive prediction
errors [11].
Within the unified theory of mind and brain, experiences
of past, present and future are constructed within the same
computational architecture via the same brain systems. In
humans, it is well established that past experiences [157]
and present experiences [158] contribute to experiences of
the future. What is more striking, from our perspective, is
that the present is, fundamentally, the remembered present
[159]: the past becomes the present, corrected by the immedi-
ate future. What differs from moment to moment, context to
context or even person to person is the extent to which the
brain is prioritizing its own internal model versus accommo-
dating that model to unexpected information from the
sensory periphery (i.e. assimilation versus accommodation).
These ideas provide us with the framework for examining
the puzzle of depression.
4. Allostasis, interoception and depression
Depression is a devastating syndrome that is best characterized
as abnormalities in neurologic (e.g. [160,161]), metabolic
[162–165] and immunologic [44,166–170] systems, as well as
aberrant hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)-axis func-
tion [171–173] and pervasive negative affect [174]. That is,
depression is a disorder of allostasis.
Our unified theoretical framework, which is based on
brain architecture and function supporting the efficient regu-
lation of energy, may prove fruitful for understanding the
dizzying variability in the pathophysiology of depression.
Using the unified theory, we propose that the brain’s internal
model is adversely affected in the development and mainten-
ance of depression (e.g. [30,175]). Specifically, the mood,
motor, autonomic, immune, metabolic and circadian dysregu-
lations all point to a central problem with inefficient energy
regulation. We hypothesize that affective feelings character-
ized as pleasant or unpleasant may provide information
about the moment-to-moment energy conditions of the
body, whereas arousal might be a consequence of
unresolved prediction error and indicate a need to learn [17].
Consistent with this, there is experimental evidence that
momentary allostatic dysregulation is associated with momen-
tary distress [176,177] and that arousal is a cue for novelty and
learning [109,178].
12 Taken together, we propose that
depression is the result of a relatively ‘locked in’ brain (i.e.
relative insensitivity to prediction errors) coupled with ineffi-
cient energy regulation that is associated with intense
suffering (i.e. negative affect), and difficulty engaging in
vigorous mental or physical activity. The ‘locked in’ brain
hypothesis is that internal models with certain characteristics
result in inefficient energy regulation (either when they are
insensitive to prediction errors and/or when they are subject
to poorly calibrated precision estimates). Both problems of
prediction error processing or precision estimation would
lead to a failure of model updating. These can, in turn,
prompt further inefficiency, producing a downward spiral.

Furthermore, we propose that there are many possible
paths to depression (such many-to-one mappings are termed
‘degeneracy’; [179]), not just because depression is a hetero-
geneous disorder, but also because there may be multiple
pathways that shift the brain into a developmental trajectory
towards inefficient metabolism and energy regulation. A
clear example of a many-to-one mapping in depression is the
reliable and discrepant functional finding of both increased
[174,180] and decreased [181,182] resting metabolism in the
subgenual portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC).
In the light of the proposed role of sgACC in maintaining sym-
pathetic and parasympathetic autonomic control of the viscera
[183,184] and our conceptualization of depression as a state of
inefficient metabolism and energy management, it becomes
clear thateither sgACC hyper-activation (fatigue, listlessness)
or hypo-activation (agitation, irritation) can promote energy
dysregulation leading to a depressed condition. A similar vari-
able finding has been reported for anterior insula activity [185].
Not all pathways to depression require a pre-existing or longer
lasting structural or functional nervous system dysfunction,
however; many forms of depression are episodic, and some
individuals have a single episode that never recurs, in part
because there are many ways for allostasis to become costly
and metabolically inefficient, not all of them permanent. For
example, temporary changes in eating, sleeping or exercise
behaviours can lead to transient changes in energy regulation
[186–190] as can the loss of a loved one [191–194]. Using the
unified theory, it is possible to hypothesize about the brain’s
computational architecture so as to better understand the var-
ious ways in which allostasis can become inefficient and
resource management can be compromised. Based on
figure 2, we hypothesize that major depressive disorder devel-
ops from at least one of three broad classes of inter-related
problems (each of which can be caused by multiple, interacting
neuropathological processes): the first class relating to the
nature of the internal model (see figure 2, solid lines emanating
from regions of the default mode network), the second relating
to the nature of prediction errors (figure 2, dotted lines) and the
third having to do with precision (figure 2, solid lines emanat-
ing from regions of the salience network). (Given space
constraints, we will consider hypotheses related to the fronto-
parietal control network, cerebellar, striatal and thalamic
portions of the theory in another venue.)
(a) A metabolically inefficient internal model
Using the logic of our unified theory, our first hypothesis is that
a person becomes at risk for depression when his brain is inef-
ficient at managing energy regulation for some relatively
prolonged period of time (i.e. weeks to months). Inefficiency
could result, for example, if the metabolic demand on the
body was large in the past and the brain has not adjusted to
its current context (e.g. the person was raised in an impover-
ished or adverse environment where rewards were rare, risks
were frequent, and large investments of metabolic energy
were routinely required). Consistent with these hypotheses,
adverse childhood experiences such as traumatic events or
neglect [195,196] are associated with later structural and func-
tional abnormalities in the brain’s core networks that predate
the onset of depression [197–199] and may be associated
with miscalibrated predictions. Metabolic efficiency may also
be compromised by the loss of a loved one [191–194], as well
as by the persistent presence of low-grade stressors (often pre-
sent in adverse environments characterized by inconsistency
and uncertainty, or prolonged social evaluative stress) that
cultivate sympathetic nervous system arborization; such arbor-
ization is known to enhance HPA axis reactivity [49,50]; for a
review, see [51], producing increased reactivity and false
alarms (i.e. the perception of threats where none exist). Even
small but innumerable challenges (e.g. lack of sleep, poor nutri-
tion) or physical illnesses (e.g. metabolic syndrome) can reduce
metabolic efficiency because the brain has to work harder
to achieve optimal energy regulation, even in the absence of
structural or functional brain dysfunctions.
We also hypothesize that individuals may be vulnerable
to depression because they have a narrower range of optimal
energy regulation; in such people, the brain can efficiently
implement allostasis, but they may be at greater risk for dys-
regulation in the face of varying environmental demands. By
contrast, someone with a wider optimal range can more
easily remain metabolically efficient in the face of broader
variations in contextual demands. Consider, for example, a
situation where you are reading quietly in your office and
someone who has been critical of you in the past (say, a
senior colleague) approaches your office door. If your col-
league comes to your office on occasion, when you hear her
footsteps, if the last (or a particularly salient) visit occurred
when it was raining outside as it is on this day, etc., your
brain will predict your colleague’s arrival by constructing
an embodied simulation. Part of this prediction will be how
much glucose is needed to jump up and close the door,
and how to mobilize this resource (by redirecting blood
flow to the legs from other organs that need it less, by releas-
ing cortisol, by reaching in your desk for some chocolate,
etc.). Alternatively, you could be reading in your office and
it is a beautiful day outside. The last time it was sunny and
warm like this you heard a blue jay just outside your
window, and your brain will predict how much glucose is
needed to stand up, draw the curtains back, and open your
window. When allostasis is working well, your brain has
little difficulty efficiently predicting what your muscles need,
what your heart and peripheral vasculature need, etc., to sup-
port any predicted action. We hypothesize that in the former
case when your critical colleague approaches your door, the
simulations created by the brain, as predictions, will involve
negative affect associated primarily when there is metabolic
inefficiency (and, if the inefficiency is of sufficiently long dur-
ation, an increase in visceral nociception may also result). The
result may be what religion professor Wendy Farley calls
‘tragic embodiment’: discomfort in your body that is intense
enough to draw your attention to yourself and away from
the world.
13 Pervasive negative affect may be a context
in which the brain has difficulty processing prediction
error. Indeed, depression is associated with inwardly focused
attention [200]. By contrast, associative thinking has been
linked, both conceptually and empirically, to positive affect
[147,201].
Pervasive negative affect could also lead one to construct a
profoundly negative internal model. The brain samples past
experiences to create predictions of the immediate future and
it is doing so in a current context of metabolic inefficiency. Feel-
ing unpleasant could also lead to affective realism, trapping
a person in a vicious cycle of negativity. In fact, there is
abundant evidence that persistent distress plays a critical role
in major depression. Diagnostically, sustained unpleasant
mood, irritability and/or anhedonia are key symptoms of
a major depressive episode. Furthermore, in the course of a

given episode, both prediction and prediction errors are biased
towards the unpleasant (e.g. attention to and memory
of information that will disrupt optimal energy regulation;
e.g. [202]). Epidemiologically, sustained distress plays a signifi-
cant role in depression, over the long course of risk, illness,
remission and relapse as well as over the course of a given
depressive episode. For example, prospective longitudinal
studies have consistently shown that neuroticism—a personal-
ity trait characterized by excessive and sustained negative
affect—predicts subsequent onset of depression [203]. In the
context of the unified model, we might conceptualize such sus-
tained negative affect as the phenomenological representation
of metabolic inefficiency.
(b) Unreliable prediction errors
The nature of prediction errors might also contribute to a
progressive isolation of the brain’s internal working model
from its sensory context. Accordingly, we hypothesize that
unreliable prediction errors are a second possible compu-
tational ingredient to developing depression. For example,
the increased arborization of the sympathetic nervous system
leads to increased false alarms that can result in substantial
differences between the prediction signals sent from limbic vis-
ceromotor cortices and the ascending interoceptive signals
about the state of the body, resulting in increased prediction
error. We hypothesize that increased interoceptive prediction
error will be associated with inefficient allostasis, in much the
same way that prediction error in the motor system is indicative
of poor motor control [204]. The relationship between a motor
prediction and a skeletomotor muscle movement is inherently
noisy—commands produce noisy movements as both the body
and environment change—and so we might expect something
similar in the visceromotor domain. Moreover, the afferent
sensory consequences of visceromotor changes are inherently
noisy. (Recall that the autonomic, immune, and metabolic
changes associated with allostatic dysregulation have sensory
consequences that are communicated via the vagus nerve
and the small diameter C and Ad fibres to primary interocep-
tive cortex in the dorsal mid- and posterior insula via relays
in the brainstem and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei
[205,206].) Many of these fibres are unmyelinated, mean-
ing that they influence one another via a process known as
ephaptic coupling as information is ascending (for discussion,
see [102]).
We hypothesize that the resulting noisy afferent intero-
ceptive inputs [207] would be progressively discounted
more and more by precision predictions, reducing the
output of prediction error signals from the cortical columns
in primary interoceptive cortex, ultimately resulting in even
greater energy dysregulation. Limbic regulation of the reticu-
lar nucleus of the thalamus is another avenue to modulate
sampling of the sensory array, again reducing the availability
of prediction error signals [127–129]. More speculatively, a
third pathway for reducing sensory sampling might be the
allostatic predictions descending through the brainstem to
the spinal cord, which serve as a gain adjustment on ascend-
ing viscerosensory signals [17,208]. As is the case in the motor
system (e.g. [209]), we expect that learning (i.e. correcting the
internal model by modifying predictions) will increasingly
diminish, because it is driven more by predictions of pre-
cision than by prediction errors themselves (a possible
mechanism might be the precision-related prediction errors
to agranular limbic regions of the default mode that are
being sent from the more developed dysgranular limbic
regions within the salience portion of the allostatic/interocep-
tive system (e.g. the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)
and the midcingulate cortex (MCC) that is more associated
with motor responses)).
Prediction errors might also remain uncorrected due to
fatigue and reduced movements. For example, as the costs of
energy dysregulation accrue, visceromotor regions slow the
body down with feelings of fatigue [44] and the so-called sick-
ness behaviours that conserve metabolic resources that are
running low [210], including reduced interaction with the out-
side world (most notably with other people [211,212]). This
solution reduces metabolic costs via reduced motor move-
ments, and less exploration that usually requires processing
prediction error and new encoding and consolidation, but it
deprives the brain of one main way to reduce prediction
error (i.e. move to generate the predicted sensory inputs).
In addition to fatigue, rumination may be another behav-
ioural hallmark of a brain locked into the past, issuing
predictions to explain incoming sensory events that remain
uncorrected by sensory cues in the present. Indeed, the pres-
ence of a ruminative cognitive style (with a focus on potential
causes and consequences of depression) predicts longer and
more severe depressive episodes [200] and increases the risk
of depressive relapse in remitted adults [213]. Consistent
with the unified theory, rumination and repetitive thinking
are associated with increased connectivity between the
sgACC and the rest of the default mode network [214]. This
increased connectivity allows the brain to idle in viscero-
motor and interoceptive predictions that are disruptive to
efficient allostasis.
(c) Inaccurate precision signals
The third potential ingredient that can contribute to depression
might be ineffectiveprecision signalling, particularly when sig-
nalling a failure to predict resources that can improve
metabolic efficiency (i.e. reward insensitivity; e.g. [215]). For
example, low serotonin levels make it difficult to sustain
effort when a reward is delayed [216–218]; for a review of
neuromodulatory functions, see [219]. Low dopamine levels
[220] in depression impair effortful movements and encoding
of prediction errors. In addition, several meta-analyses demon-
strate that nodes of the salience network are atrophied in
depression [47,48] (as in other illnesses), and the major fibre
pathways that link the salience network to other parts of the
brain are compromised in depression [221]. Although these
findings are broadly consistent with our hypotheses, stronger
support still awaits; our hypotheses are, in effect, compu-
tational in nature, and so require functional testing on
relevant timescales.
5. Implications for treatment
Our hypothesis is that a depressed brain is relatively ‘locked
in’, and running a metabolically inefficient internal model of
the body in the world, resulting in pervasive negative affect
that is salient and difficult to modify. The fact that there are
many potential sources of pathophysiology that will ulti-
mately result in a relatively ‘locked-in’ depressed brain
(i.e. ‘degeneracy’; [179]) is probably one reason why major
depressive disorder is so difficult to treat. Nonetheless,
by suggesting that depression arises from a chronic energy
inefficiency and altered interoceptive signalling through a

well-specified computational architecture, the unified theory
of mind and brain suggests several targets of opportunity
for intervention and treatment.
First, depression may be relieved by directly affecting the
descending allostatic predictions that originate in agranular
limbic cortices. For example, deep brain stimulation in the
region of the subcallosal (agranular) anterior cingulate may
achieve its antidepressant effects [222–224] via its ability to
alter allostatic predictions to the body and brain. Indeed, the
effectiveness of Mayberg’s intracranial stimulation for untrea-
table depression could be due to the fact that it affects three
white matter tracts (the cingulum bundle, the forceps minor
and the uncinate fasciculus [225]), thereby modifying the con-
nectivity within and between the default mode and salience
networks.
Second, according to the unified theory, depression can
arise from the effects of chronic, aberrant allostatic predictions
leading to or resulting from HPA-axis dysregulation and
inflammation. This suggests that interventions to address
these systemic affects should help to slow the onset and inten-
sity of depression. Indeed, recent efforts have explored the
antidepressant effects of cortisol synthesis inhibitors [226,227]
and anti-inflammatory medications [228–230] in depression.
Greater aerobic physical activity may also help prevent the
occurrence of chronic aberrant allostatic predictions, which is
consistent with findings that those who are physically active
have a prospectively lower risk for depression [231]. However,
once the brain’s internal model is altered and relatively insensi-
tive to prediction errors, physical activity may be less impactful,
consistent with findings that exercise has more modest positive
effects in those who already have depression [232]. Alterna-
tively, it may be that various methods for enhancing efficient
energy regulation (such as exercising, and eating and sleeping
just enough to maintain optimal energy balance) may need to
be combined with other interventions (medication, cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT)) in depression to have a sufficiently
potent effect to reset the brain’s internal model.
Third, another approach to intervening on interoceptive
neurocircuitry in depression is to reduce the ‘noisy’ afferent
interoceptive prediction errors, thereby overcoming the
gating effects of precision estimates. In principle, one way to
accomplish this would be to greatly increase the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) of afferent (primarily vagal) interoceptive
signals. This may be one mechanism by which vagal nerve
stimulation has its effects [233]. Additional novel approaches
to increasing the SNR on interoceptive signals are also under
development, including pharmacological interventions such
as infusion regimens with theb-adrenoreceptor agonist isopro-
terenol that have been tested in other psychiatric illnesses
[234,235] and therapy within sensory-attenuated environments
that increase the salience of interoceptive signals [236].
Fourth, treatments that offer the opportunity for re-
categorization provide yet another intervention pathway. For
example, CBT may have its effects by helping a person con-
struct new concepts that, as prediction signals, modify the
gain on prediction errors via the salience network. Over time,
this process may alter the sample of inputs that eventually
become the ‘empirical priors’ that agranular limbic cortices
use to initiate subsequent predictions. This dynamic may
explain why CBT alters the activity of two key regions in the
brain’s rich club: the cingulate and anterior insular cortices
[237,238]. Consistent with this idea, CBT is very effective in
treating depression in individuals with low activity in the
anterior insula before treatment (presumably because CBT
helps them to change their predictions, potentially by improv-
ing their processing of prediction errors and corresponding
concept learning via salience network changes); alternatively,
CBT is largely ineffective and medications are more effective
in treating depression in individuals with high anterior
insula activity before treatment [185,239], suggesting
the hypothesis that activity in the anterior insula may be indica-
tive of the extent to which multimodal precision estimates can
be easily modified. Relatedly, the empirical priors themselves
may be direct intervention targets, thereby altering the compu-
tation of interoceptive predictions. One example of this may be
electroconvulsive therapy, which frequently interrupts
memory consolidation and alters the activity of both viscero-
motor limbic regions and the hippocampus, with changes in
both regions correlated with treatment response [240].
6. Conclusion
The size and complexity of human brains grant our species
enormous energy range and behavioural flexibility, affording
us the largest ecological niche of any mammal. By conceptua-
lizing allostasis and interoception as unified processes within
a predicting brain, the unified theory computationally recasts
many of the ‘mental’ symptoms of affective distress, rumina-
tion and fatigue in metabolic terms. The theory suggests that
understanding more about the role of metabolism in guiding
basic perception and action will provide a richer, more power-
ful framework for studying major depressive illness. From this
perspective, depression is an internal model, associated with
distress, mental withdrawal from the world and sometimes a
literal physical withdrawal from the world. Treating
depression, then, will require providing the brain with the
resources to modify its internal model of the body in the
world and repair its energy regulation.

1Long-range neural connections, like those that form the human brain’s
broadly distributed intrinsic networks, are particularly metabolically
expensive [1], with most of the energy costs going to signalling between
neurons, particularly in postsynaptic processes [40–43].
2One aspect of allostasis involves the brain dynamically regulating
resource allocations (i.e. diverting glucose, electrolytes, water, etc.,
from one system to another) to meet the body’s spending needs

(e.g. in advance of standing up, the heart prepares to beat stronger
and faster, blood vessels in the legs constrict and blood pressure
goes up to ensure that the brain continues to receive the needed
blood (and oxygen)). Allostasis also includes the brain’s signalling
the need for resources before a bodily resource becomes depleted
(e.g. drinking before dehydration occurs) or preparing for the
intake of resources in advance of their ingestion (e.g. saliva is pre-
emptively secreted when the body is in need of glucose, even
before anything is ingested, and a key component of saliva is
alpha-amylase, an enzyme that breaks down glucose. Even just
imagining eating food causes saliva secretion).
3All animal brains operate in the same manner (i.e. even insect brains
coordinate visceral, immune and motor changes [1].
4The term ‘feedback’ derives from a time when the brain was
thought to be largely stimulus driven [84]. Nonetheless, the history
of science is laced with the idea that the mind drives perception, e.g.
in the eleventh century by Ibn al-Haytham (who helped to invent
the scientific method), in the eighteenth century by Kant (1781)
and in the nineteenth century by Helmholtz. In more modern
times, see Craik’s concept of internal models [85], Tolman’s cogni-
tive maps [86], Johnson-Laird’s internal models [87,88] and for
other relevant references, see [89,90]. The novelty in recent formu-
lations can be found in (a) the hypothesis that predictions are
embodied simulations of sensory motor experiences, (b) they are ulti-
mately in the service of allostasis and therefore interoception is at
their core, and, of course (c) the breadth of behavioural, functional
and anatomic evidence supporting the hypothesis that the brain’s
internal model implements active inference as prediction signals,
including (d) the specific computational hypotheses implementing
our predictive coding account.
5Cortical regions with a dysgranular structure are referred to as
limbic [82] or paralimbic [94].
6Prediction signals are conveyed as slow frequency oscillations
(e.g. [97–99]) and, indeed, there is evidence that genes associated
with slower rhythms are upregulated in limbic circuitry [100].
7Even more interestingly, there is some evidence to suggest that the
cortical regions projecting to the brainstem nuclei which are
the source nuclei for these neuromodulators (such as the locus coer-
uleus for norepinephrine) are largely entrained by limbic cortical
regions via descending allostatic predictions that project directly
from the cingulate cortices and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as
indirectly via projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala
and the hypothalamus. The locus coeruleus also receives ascending
interoceptive and nociceptive prediction errors [107]. This is yet
another way that allostasis is linked to the modulating the gain or
excitability of neurons that represent sensory and motor prediction
errors.
8In a fly brain, the mushroom bodies may play an analogous role to
the cerebellum [1].
9This allows for the encoding of statistical patterns of uncertain value
that can later be reconstructed when they are of use [122].
10Note that this hypothesis is species-general: rats have a default
mode network and are not able to engage in mental time travel as
far as we can tell [146], but this in no way disconfirms the hypothesis
that the network is running an internal model of the animal’s world
in the service of allostasis.
11They also arise from ascending inputs to terminate in the deep
layers of cortex (e.g. [92]), but these can be thought of as errors
related to predictions of precision.
12The human nervous system is not wired to represent interoceptive
sensations in high-dimensional detail. Some of the ascending viscero-
sensory inputs that reach the brain are not labelled lines sending
precise, modality-specific information. Furthermore, interoceptive pre-
dictions only traverse one or two synapses from limbic visceromotor
regulation regions to primary interoceptive cortex, which does not
leave much opportunity for them to become elaborated with high-
dimensional detail (compared to the sensory predictions reaching
primary exteroceptive cortices, which usually traverse more synapses
and therefore can be more elaborated with details). Relative low dimen-
sionality is probably a good thing, because if we could detect the
ongoing dynamic sensory changes in the body in a lot of detail, we
would never pay attention to anything else (think about the last time
you had abdominal cramps).
13To paraphrase an example Farley once used during an address: you
could be listening to the radio about a terrible plane crash that took
the lives of 200 people while opening the mail, but if you give your-
self a paper cut on an envelope, your attention will be completely
diverted from the disaster while you nurse your minor discomfort.
It is not your moral position that a paper cut deserves more attention
than the death of 200 people, but your discomfort demands your
attention, even if just for a moment. So imagine your distraction if
you felt intensely unpleasant much of the time.
