Okay, let’s begin the extraction process based on the provided research paper text.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel approach to stochastic optimal control by framing it within the framework of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). Specifically, it demonstrates that the control problem can be cast as an inference problem, minimizing a free energy bound.

2.  **Hypothesis:**  The FEP provides a unified framework for both estimation and control problems in stochastic systems.

3.  **Claim:** The paper reveals that, under certain conditions, the ActInf approach yields the same control actions as traditional stochastic optimal control methods, such as LQG.

4.  **Hypothesis:**  The inclusion of goal priors in the generative model allows for a more natural and intuitive formulation of control objectives.

5.  **Claim:** The paper demonstrates that the ActInf approach can be implemented using message passing on a factor graph, providing a computationally tractable solution.
