Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a computational framework for perception based on the principle of least action, utilizing the free energy principle. The core hypothesis is that all viable organisms minimize sensory uncertainty about their environment over a temporal horizon.

2.  The authors formulate the recognition dynamics (RD) as a Bayesian filtering process, where the brain represents the external world probabilistically and actively infers causes of sensory inputs.

3.  The paper argues that the conventional formulation of the FEP suffers from several technical complexities, particularly the handling of dynamic systems and the need for an infinite number of generalized coordinates.

4.  The authors propose a reformulation of the RD by casting it as a Lagrangian mechanical system, avoiding the need for generalized coordinates and simplifying the mathematical description.

5.  The paper posits that the brain’s internal model of the environment is represented by a probability density function (the R-density), and the brain’s predictive inference is governed by the minimization of the free energy.

6.  The authors suggest that the brain’s perceptual operations can be implemented by a neural particle, which is a single neuron, and that the brain’s representation of the external world is a probabilistic representation.

## Important Quotes

1.  “All viable organisms perceive and act on the external world by instantiating a probabilistic causal model embodied in their brain in a way to ensure their adaptive fitness or autopoiesis.” (The authors state: "All viable organisms perceive and act on the external world by instantiating a probabilistic causal model embodied in their brain in a way to ensure their adaptive fitness or autopoiesis.") - *This quote establishes the central tenet of the FEP.*





6.  “We postulate that the Laplace-encoded IFE in the FEP, denoted as F, serves as an effective, informational Lagrangian of the brain, written as L.” (According to the paper: "We postulate that the Laplace-encoded IFE in the FEP, denoted as F, serves as an effective, informational Lagrangian of the brain, written as L.") - *This quote describes the IFE as a Lagrangian.*
