### Intelligent Resource Allocation for UAV-Based Cognitive NOMA Networks: An Active Inference Approach – Summary

### OverviewThis paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) network. The primary goal is to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannels and power allocation based on the UAV’s mobility. The authors propose a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to address the complexities of this problem. This approach leverages the UAV’s ability to continuously update its beliefs and actions based on incoming sensory inputs, aligning with the way biological systems operate. The paper highlights the need for adaptive resource allocation in dynamic wireless networks and introduces a framework that can handle the inherent variability and uncertainty associated with UAV-based communication.### MethodologyThe authors introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, called Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN), to intelligently maximize the sum rate of a UAV-based Cognitive-NOMA network. The framework employs a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to model the system. The key elements of the Active-GDBN framework are: (1) a coupled state-switching model to capture temporal dependencies between the UAV trajectory and the SUs’ mobility; (2) a Bayesian filtering approach to estimate the hidden states; and (3) a learning algorithm to update the generative model. The authors state: "The core idea is to treat the UAV as an intelligent agent that learns to adapt its behavior based on its observations of the wireless environment." They note: "The UAV can continuously update its beliefs about the state of the environment and adjust its actions accordingly." The authors further argue: “Traditional optimization schemes have limited adaptability and typically rely on fixed objectives.” The study demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively handle the challenges posed by the dynamic and uncertain nature of UAV-based communication.### ResultsThe simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Active-GDBN approach compared to suboptimal baseline schemes. The authors state: "The Active-GDBN achieved an improved and consistent sum rate in fewer episodes." Specifically, the simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark schemes by approximately15% in terms of the cumulative sum rate. The authors state: “The Active-GDBN achieved a maximum of5 SUs per subchannel.” The authors further note: “The Active-GDBN’s performance is robust to variations in the channel conditions and UAV trajectory.” The study demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively handle the challenges posed by the dynamic and uncertain nature of UAV-based communication.### DiscussionThe authors emphasize the importance of active inference for adaptive resource allocation in dynamic wireless networks. They state: “The UAV can continuously update its beliefs about the state of the environment and adjust its actions accordingly.” The authors highlight the ability of the Active-GDBN to handle the inherent variability and uncertainty associated with UAV-based communication. The authors argue that the Active-GDBN’s ability to learn and adapt to changing conditions makes it a promising approach for future UAV-based communication systems. The authors state: “The Active-GDBN’s performance is robust to variations in the channel conditions and UAV trajectory.” The study demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively handle the challenges posed by the dynamic and uncertain nature of UAV-based communication.### ConclusionIn conclusion, the authors present a novel active inference-based learning approach for intelligent resource allocation in UAV-based Cognitive-NOMA networks. The proposed Active-GDBN framework enables the UAV to continuously adapt its behavior based on incoming sensory inputs, leading to improved sum rate performance. The authors state: “The 

Active-GDBN represents a strong candidate for future UAV-based communication systems.” 

The study demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively handle the challenges posed by the dynamic and uncertain nature of UAV-based communication.
