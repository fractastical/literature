## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The active inference agent’s objective is to minimize its free energy"
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – "−F =D [q(s,a)(cid:107)p(o ,s ,a )]"
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – "KL t 0:t 0:t =−E [lnp(o |s )]+D [q(s )(cid:107)p(s |s ,a )]"
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "MSE(s ,f (s ,a ))"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "optimize a variant of the expected free energy"
*   Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (exact quote from paper) – "VAE encodes the visual features that are relevant to reconstruct the input images"
*   Deep Active Inference (DAIF) (exact quote from paper) – "deep active inference (dAIF)"
*   Expected Free Energy (EFE) (exact quote from paper) – "Expected Free Energy (EFE) and Generalized Free Energy (GFE)"
*   Generalized Free Energy (GFE) (exact quote from paper) – "Generalized Free Energy (GFE)"
*   Receding Horizon Control (exact quote from paper) – "the agent is able to compute the best action taking into account a time horizon"
