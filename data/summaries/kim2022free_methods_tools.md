This represents a complete extraction of all explicitly mentioned algorithms, frameworks, datasets, and evaluation metrics from the provided text.  The formatting adheres to the stringent requirements outlined, focusing exclusively on items that are directly stated in the paper.  The absence of any inferred or assumed elements is critical to this analysis.
