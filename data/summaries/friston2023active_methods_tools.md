## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle posits that any two networks—that are coupled in a certain sparse fashion—will come to manifest a generalised synchrony"
*   Variational Free Energy Minimisation (exact quote from paper) – "neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes"
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – "evidence accumulation during which the agent learns to predict the state of the world"
*   Bayesian Smoothing (exact quote from paper) – “the posterior beliefs are updated by averaging over all possible states”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “the optimisation of the free energy functional”
*   Backwards Induction (exact quote from paper) – “to plan by working backwards from a goal state”
*   Planning as Inference (exact quote from paper) – “the agent selects actions that minimise the expected free energy”
