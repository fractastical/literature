Okay, here’s an extraction of the key claims, hypotheses, and important quotes from the provided research paper, following the outlined requirements and formatting standards.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Hypothesis:** The paper’s central hypothesis is that a novel object-centric active inference architecture, termed AXIOM, can learn and perform effectively in complex environments by integrating prior knowledge about object dynamics and interactions.

2. **AXIOM Architecture:** The core of AXIOM is a modular architecture combining a slot-mixture model (sMM) for object segmentation with a recurrent switching lineardynamicalsystem (rMM) for predicting object dynamics and transitions.

3. **Bayesian Active Inference:** The paper leverages active inference principles, specifically integrating Bayesian inference to balance reward maximization with information gain, optimizing the model’s learning process.

4. **Object-Centric Representation:** The paper’s key innovation is the object-centric representation, where the model learns to represent objects as distinct entities with unique characteristics, enabling more efficient and robust learning.

5. **Adaptive Model Refinement:** The AXIOM architecture dynamically adapts and refines its object-centric state-space through Bayesian model reduction, pruning redundant components and focusing on the most relevant features.
