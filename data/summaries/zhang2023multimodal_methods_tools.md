Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference Planner (AIP) (exact quote from paper) – “AIP is a high-level decision-making algorithm that relies on symbolic states, observations, and actions”
*   Multi-Modal Model Predictive Path Integral Controller (M3P2I) (exact quote from paper) – “M3P2I is a controller that samples in parallel plan alternatives to achieve a goal”
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle is a fundamental principle that states that systems minimize their free energy”
*   Inverse Temperature (β) (exact quote from paper) – “β is the inverse temperature parameter”
*   Importance Sampling (exact quote from paper) – “importance sampling scheme calculates the approximate optimal control input u∗”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is used to minimize the cost function”
*   Model Predictive Control (MPC) (exact quote from paper) – “MPC computes a sequence of control inputs to minimize the cost”
*   Symbolic Actions (exact quote from paper) – “Symbolic actions are used to represent the actions in the AIP”
*   Behavior Trees (BT) (exact quote from paper) – “BT guides the search and allows real-time high-level planning within the AIP framework”
*   Backchaining (exact quote from paper) – “Backchaining is used to derive optimal control inputs”
*   Halton Splines (exact quote from paper) – “Halton splines are used to sample control inputs”
*   Parallelizable Physics Simulations (exact quote from paper) – “sampling-based MPCs, such as MPPI [18], [19], can handle non-linearities, non-convexities, or discontinuities of the dynamics and costs”
