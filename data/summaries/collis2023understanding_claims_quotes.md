Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Distinct Definition of Tool Discovery and Tool Innovation:** The authors articulate a distinction between tool discovery (simply repeating a successful action) and tool innovation (constructing a novel tool independently), defining them within the framework of active inference.
2.  **Tool Affordances as a Key Mechanism for Tool Innovation:** The central hypothesis is that tool innovation arises through the agent’s ability to infer the appropriate tool properties based on its understanding of the environment’s affordances – the opportunities for action provided by the environment.
3.  **Bayesian Model Inversion as the Underlying Cognitive Process:** The paper posits that tool innovation is underpinned by Bayesian model inversion, where the agent updates its probabilistic generative model of the world to reflect the observed interactions.
4.  **Factorising Hidden States Enables Tool Invention:** The core finding is that by factorising the hidden states of the agent’s generative model into tool affordances, the agent can ‘invent’ the appropriate tool without needing to be explicitly taught how to use it.
5.  **One-Shot Generalization through Affordance Composition:** The paper suggests that the agent can achieve one-shot generalization to novel situations by composing relevant affordances to create a new tool.
