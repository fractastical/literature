### OverviewThis paper investigates the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent systems through the active inference framework. It explores how a group of agents can self-organize to exhibit coordinated behavior and collective intelligence. The research focuses on understanding how agents can achieve a shared understanding and act together effectively, even when individual agents have limited cognitive abilities. The study demonstrates how a group of agents can develop a collective identity and act as a single entity, highlighting the importance of communication and coordination in complex systems.### MethodologyThe research employs active inference, a computational framework that models agents as Bayesian inference engines. Agents are designed to minimize their free energy by predicting and reacting to their environment. The agents are configured to interact with each other, exchanging information and coordinating their actions. The simulation uses a model of a flock of birds, where each bird attempts to stay close to its neighbors and avoid collisions. The simulation incorporates a Markov blanket, which defines the statistical boundaries between agents and their environment, allowing agents to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant noise.### ResultsThe simulation demonstrates that the agents self-organized into a cohesive flock, exhibiting coordinated movement and collective behavior. The agents successfully navigated complex environments and responded to external stimuli, demonstrating a high degree of coordination and adaptability. The simulation showed that the agents were able to maintain a stable flock structure, despite changes in the environment or the actions of individual agents. The simulation demonstrated that the agents were able to achieve a high level of collective intelligence, allowing them to solve complex problems and adapt to changing conditions.### ResultsThe simulation demonstrates that the agents self-organize into a cohesive flock, exhibiting coordinated movement and collective behavior.

The findings suggest that active inference provides a powerful framework for understanding and modeling collective behavior in complex systems. The research highlights the importance of communication and coordination in achieving collective goals. 

The findings suggest that the emergence of joint agency is a natural consequence of the interaction between agents and their environment. 

The research provides insights into the design of multi-agent systems that can achieve complex goals and adapt to changing conditions.
