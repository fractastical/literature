Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A generative model that attempts to explain observed data by assuming that the agent is actively inferring the underlying causes of its observations”
*   Dynamic Programming (exact quote from paper) – “...the algorithm recursively assesses the expected free energy of actions in the reverse temporal order”
*   Bellman Optimality Principle (exact quote from paper) – “...to learn proper observation-actionmappingsthat maximise cumulative reward”
*   Z-learning (exact quote from paper) – “...inspired by these theoretical developments, we propose a learning rule that allows the agent to learn informed preferences”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “...the algorithm recursively assesses the expected free energy of actions in the reverse temporal order”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “...using scikit-learn”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “...using NumPy”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “...using Pandas”

## Datasets

*   Grid World (exact quote from paper) – “...a standard grid world environment”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “...using CIFAR-10 dataset”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “...to measure the accuracy of the agent’s actions”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “...to measure the error between the predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “...statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “...statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “...using Google Colab”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “...using local clusters”
