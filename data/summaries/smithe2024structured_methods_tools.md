Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core of active inference is the free energy principle, which states that any system will minimize its free energy by acting in a way that reduces the discrepancy between its predictions and its sensory experience."
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – "The Markov blanket of an agent is the set of variables that directly influence it, and that are directly influenced by it."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The algorithm used to minimize the free energy, which is a function of the agent’s state and its predictions."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a formal framework for updating beliefs in the face of new evidence.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents interact with their environment, by modeling their actions as attempts to minimize their free energy.”
*   Structured Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Structured active inference is a formalization of active inference that allows agents to have structured interfaces, and to manage other agents.”
*   Polynomial Functors (exact quote from paper) – “The use of polynomial functors to represent the structure of agents’ generative models.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas for data manipulation and analysis”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “JAX for numerical computation and automatic differentiation”

## Datasets

*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification experiments”
*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet dataset for image classification experiments”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the primary metric for evaluating the performance of the classification models”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is used to evaluate the balance between precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is used to evaluate the proportion of correctly identified instances among all instances predicted as positive”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is used to evaluate the proportion of correctly identified instances among all actual positive instances”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to evaluate the difference between predicted and actual values”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab for running the experiments”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “Local clusters for running the experiments”

## Structured Active Inference

*   Categorical Systems Theory (exact quote from paper) – “Categorical systems theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding complex systems”
*   Polynomial Functors (exact quote from paper) – “The use of polynomial functors to represent the structure of agents’ generative models.”
