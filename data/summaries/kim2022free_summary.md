### OverviewThis paper investigates the relationship between living systems and the principles of free energy and inference. The authors propose a unified framework, integrating the thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles, to explain biological phenomena, such as homeostasis, allostasis, and perception. The central argument is that organisms maintain their internal states by minimizing free energy, and that this minimization process drives active inference, where organisms actively construct their sensory experiences.### MethodologyThe authors employ a computational approach, based on the stochastic thermodynamics and Bayesian inference, to model biological systems. They utilize the Langevin equation to describe the dynamics of neuronal populations, incorporating both deterministic and stochastic forces. The key elements of their methodology include: (1) the application of the free-energy principle to biological systems, (2) the formulation of a mathematical model for active inference, and (3) the use of numerical simulations to test their model. Specifically, they use the Langevin equation to describe the dynamics of neuronal populations, incorporating both deterministic and stochastic forces. They show that the model predicts that the brain actively constructs its sensory experiences by minimizing free energy. Specifically, the numerical simulations reveal that the brain undergoes a dynamic transition from a resting state to a cognitive attractor, which corresponds to the online inference of the environmental causes in continuous time. The model predicts that the brain dynamically adjusts its activity to minimize sensory uncertainty, and that this adjustment drives adaptive behavior. The model also predicts that the brain’s internal model is a Bayesian one, and that the model’s parameters are encoded by neuronal activities.### DiscussionThe authors argue that their model provides a more comprehensive explanation of biological systems than traditional approaches. They suggest that the free-energy principle is a fundamental principle governing all living systems. They also argue that the model provides a framework for understanding how the brain performs complex cognitive functions, such as perception, learning, and motor control. The authors highlight that the model is not limited to the brain, but can be applied to other biological systems, such as plants and bacteria. They suggest that the model may also have implications for artificial intelligence and robotics. The authors emphasize that the model is a starting point for further research, and that it may need to be refined to account for more complex biological phenomena. The authors highlight that the model is a starting point for further research, and that it may need to be refined to account for more complex biological phenomena.### ConclusionIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel framework for understanding living systems based on the free-energy principle and active inference. The authors demonstrate that the model can accurately reproduce key features of biological systems, and that it provides a promising avenue for future research. The authors state: "The free-energy principle is a fundamental principle governing all living systems."
