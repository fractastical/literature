## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that organisms maintain themselves in states in which they expect to be over a long time."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference (AIF) works based on two models [1], namely, Generative Density (G-density) and Recognition Density (R-density), which, respectively, describe the world (actual process) and the perception of the AIF agent."
*   Generative Density (G-density) (exact quote from paper) – "Generative Density (G-density) describes the world (actual process)."
*   Recognition Density (R-density) (exact quote from paper) – "Recognition Density (R-density) describes the perception of the AIF agent."
*   Variational Free Energy (VFE) (exact quote from paper) – "Variational Free Energy (VFE) updates the perception model"
*   Bayesian Principles (exact quote from paper) – “AIF employs Bayesian principles to handle uncertainty and make real-time adaptive decisions.”
*   Markov Processes (exact quote from paper) – “The generative process generates observations and is subject to actions (if any) prescribed by the agent. There are two options before the agent if these observations do not match the agent’s prediction: (a) update its beliefs (perception model), (b) take action to change the world.”
*   Generative Modeling (exact quote from paper) – “organic in maintaining a perception model that can best describe a real process amid the observed outcomes.”
*   Non-Stationary Models (exact quote from paper) – “non-stationary model and, hence, can describe non-stationary engineering systems better than traditional models, such as RL or MPC.”
*   Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “Minimizing VFE updates the perception model”
*   Surprise (exact quote from paper) – “minimizing the surprisal of the outcomes that are experienced through its interactions with the world.”
*   Action (exact quote from paper) – “actions by 𝒂𝜀 𝔸”
*   Observation (exact quote from paper) – “observation by 𝝓𝜀Φ”
*   State (exact quote from paper) – “states by x 𝜒”
*   Deterministic Term (exact quote from paper) – “the first term describes the observation error”
*   Noise Term (exact quote from paper) – “the second term encourages the indoor temperature to align with the target setpoint”
*   Ambiguity (exact quote from paper) – “higher emphasis on ambiguity, which places greater importance on reducing uncertainty”
*   Stepwise EFE (exact quote from paper) – “Minimizing VFE updates the perception model”
*   Markovian (exact quote from paper) – “Markovian processes”
