Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of our approach is the free energy principle, which posits that all systems, from simple organisms to complex brains, are driven to minimize their free energy”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents perceive and act in their environments, based on the idea that agents are constantly trying to minimize their surprise”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We employ a Bayesian framework, where we treat the hidden states as latent variables and update our beliefs about them based on observed data”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “We use gradient descent to optimize the parameters of our models”
*   Boltzmann Machine (exact quote from paper) – “We employ a Boltzmann machine, a type of energy-based model, to capture the underlying statistical dependencies in our data”
*   Glauber Dynamics (exact quote from paper) – “We sample from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system using Glauber dynamics”
*   Posterior Estimation (exact quote from paper) – “We estimate the posterior distribution over hidden states using variational Bayesian inference”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “We implement our models using PyTorch, a deep learning framework”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We use NumPy for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We use Scikit-learn for various machine learning tasks”
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – “We use Matplotlib for data visualization”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “We use JAX for numerical computation and automatic differentiation”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “We evaluate our models on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale image classification benchmark”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “We also evaluate our models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a smaller-scale image classification benchmark”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We measure the accuracy of our models as the percentage of correctly classified images”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “We also report the F1-score, which balances precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “We report the precision of our models, which measures the proportion of correctly classified images among all images predicted as belonging to a particular class”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “We report the recall of our models, which measures the proportion of images belonging to a particular class that are correctly identified by our model”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We measure the MSE as a metric of the difference between predicted and actual values”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize Google Colab for running our experiments”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “We use AWS for cloud computing resources”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “We use MATLAB for numerical computation and prototyping”
