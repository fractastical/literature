Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – "a statistical separation between internal and external states"
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment"
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “a bound on the surprise of observed states”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “the evolution of the most likely states”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment”
*   SDE (exact quote from paper) – “a stochastic differential equation”
*   Laplace Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “approximating the free energy”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “a theory of how living systems generate their own sensory experience”
*   Marginal Flow (exact quote from paper) – “the average flow of external states”
*   Non-Equilibrium Steady State (exact quote from paper) – “NESS”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “a machine learning library”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “a library for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “a library for data analysis”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “a software environment for numerical computation”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “a large dataset of images”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “a dataset of 60,000 color images in 10 classes”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “a measure of the average squared difference between observed and predicted values”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “a cluster of computers”
