### OverviewThis paper investigates the development of a fault-tolerant control scheme for robotic manipulators using precision learning and active inference. The authors present a novel approach that avoids the need for a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, representing its health status, is learned online in a model-free way, allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude failing sensors. The core idea is to model the sensor precision and update it online in a model-free way, allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly, exclude failing sensors.### MethodologyThe authors build upon the framework of unbiased active inference (u-AIC), a promising approach for fault-tolerant control. The u-AIC is used to estimate the state of the system and generate control inputs. The key methodological contribution is the incorporation of precision learning, where the inverse covariance matrix of each sensor is updated online based on the observed sensory data. Specifically, the authors use a Gamma prior on the precision, allowing for Bayesian inference. The system is governed by a deterministic dynamic model of the system, which is not available to the agents. The authors use a Kalman filter to estimate the state and control inputs.### ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors tested the method on a2-DOF robotic manipulator, injecting a fault into one of the encoders. The results show that the system is able to reach the set-point without any threshold definitions or ad-hoc recovery mechanisms.
