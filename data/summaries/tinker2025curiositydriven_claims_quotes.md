Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper investigates how robots can develop language and action through self-exploration, integrating active inference with reinforcement learning.

2.  **Hypothesis 1:** Generalization improves markedly as the scale of compositional elements increases.

3.  **Hypothesis 2:** Curiosity combined with motor entropy enhances developmental learning.

4.  **Hypothesis 3:** Primitive actions develop earlier, followed by more complex, prerequisite-dependent actions.

5.  **Hypothesis 4:** Exception-handling rules can be acquired through exploratory learning, exhibiting U-shaped developmental performance.

6.  **Central Claim:** The framework presented provides a powerful account of scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in both humans and artificial agents.
