Okay, let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle is a general framework for understanding how systems maintain a consistent state by minimizing their free energy."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents perceive and act upon their environment to minimize surprise."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method for updating beliefs based on observed data.”
*   Percolation Model (exact quote from paper) – “The model is based on the concept of percolation, where a continuous phase transforms into a discontinuous phase.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations and array manipulation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for numerical computation and simulation.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images used for computer vision tasks.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in ten classes.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly classified samples.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the completeness of positive predictions.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the simulations.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services is used for computing resources.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “A local cluster is used for running the simulations.”
