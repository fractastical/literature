Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper articulates a view of resilience under the free energy principle, positing that resilience is the condition under which things exist at all.
2.  Self-organisation under the free energy principle is about resilience, in the sense that identity is a constant process of self-reconfiguration, implying the existence of a self-model and the energy to reconfigure that self-model – and hence, the resilience of a maintained identity under changes.
3.  A general framework for thinking about resilience in this context will be sketched out, and some models will be provided using that framework.
4.  The paper investigates what an appropriate description of this flexibility might be and how can it can be modelled, and in particular, what resilience has to do with a changing identity in dynamic environments.
5.  The authors hypothesize that a key aspect of adaptive systems is their ability to continuously adjust their internal models to better predict and respond to environmental changes.
6.  The paper proposes that the brain maintains an internal self-model which is continuously refined as part of its predictive engagement with the world.
7.  The authors suggest that the brain encodes a model of ‘self’ to better predict incoming sensations.
8.  The paper argues that maintaining an identity requires not just change but also a degree of stability of core features, offering a conundrum that self-evidence attempts to resolve.
9.  Resilience is not simply a fixed quantity one has a certain amount of; it is something one does, dynamically, over time.
10. The authors claim that an identity (the organism’s self-model) is sustained by ongoing self-production and error-correction—the same processes that characterise resilience.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "In this paper we will articulate a view of resilience under the free energy principle and vice versa. The free energy principle is about existence and identity, and resilience is the condition under which things exist at all.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the central thesis of the paper: resilience is fundamentally linked to the free energy principle and the concept of existence.

**Quote:** "Self-organisation is implicitly defined in terms of identity—that is, the self. However, it is also apparent that self-organisation is never static, and the sense of identity implicit here must somehow be flexible or else be capable of accommodating changes in the environment.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote highlights the dynamic nature of self-organisation and the need for flexible identity to maintain resilience.

**Quote:** "To self-evidence, an agent must learn and constantly adjust a generative model of the world and of itself, using sensory evidence to correct discrepancies.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote describes the core mechanism of self-evidence: continuous learning and model adjustment based on sensory input.

**Quote:** "Maintaining an identity requires not just change but also a degree of stability of core features, offering a conundrum.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote introduces the tension between adaptability and stability that is central to the concept of resilience.

**Quote:** "Resilience generally refers to the capacity of a system to withstand shocks or disturbances without losing its core functions or identity [18,33,42]."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This quote provides a standard definition of resilience, framing it as the ability to maintain functionality under stress.

**Context:** Section 2.1
**Significance:** This quote presents the mathematical foundation of the free energy principle, a key element of the paper's theoretical framework.

**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote reiterates the core mechanism of self-evidence: continuous learning and model adjustment based on sensory input.

**Quote:** “The brain expends informational and energetic resources to keep its self-model aligned with reality—revising beliefs or deploying actions when mismatches (prediction errors) arise.”
**Context:** Section 2.1
**Significance:** This quote illustrates the computational cost of maintaining a self-model and the mechanisms for correcting errors.

**Quote:** “The authors state: “Maintaining an identity requires not just change but also a degree of stability of core features, offering a conundrum.”"
