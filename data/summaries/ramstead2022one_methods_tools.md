## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “the FEP is at its core a modeling method, which leverages the fact that, if there is a Markov blanket in the nonequilibrium steady state density of a system, then it can be described as engaging in variational inference about the causes of its sensory perturbations.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “the FEP deploys a specific concept of “thing,” defined as a cohesive locus of states enshrouded by a Markov blanket, which couples that thing to its embedding environment.”
*   Modus Tollens (exact quote from paper) – “their argument is valid. However, as the saying goes, “one person's modus ponens is another person's modus tollens.”"
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “if there is a Markov blanket in the nonequilibrium steady state density of a system, then it can be described as engaging in variational inference about the causes of its sensory perturbations.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “the FEP deploys a specific concept of “thing,” defined as a cohesive locus of states enshrouded by a Markov blanket, which couples that thing to its embedding environment.”
*   Statistical Tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
