Okay, let's begin extracting the key information from the provided research paper.

**1. Key Claims and Hypotheses**

*   **Claim 1:** The research aims to demonstrate the influence of granulation on the RVs (radial velocity) measurements of exoplanets.
*   **Hypothesis 1:** The observed variations in RVs are primarily driven by granulation effects, and not by other factors.
*   **Claim 2:** The authors used a kima (Keplerian-based, radial velocity, time-series) analysis to quantify the impact of granulation on RV measurements.
*   **Hypothesis 2:** The kima method is a suitable approach for assessing the influence of granulation on RV measurements.
*   **Claim 3:** The study provides a quantitative assessment of the granulation effects on RV measurements for exoplanets.
