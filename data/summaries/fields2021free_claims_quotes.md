Okay, let's begin. Here's the extracted information from the provided text, formatted according to the specified requirements:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Central Claim:** The paper proposes that generic quantum systems, particularly those exhibiting quantum coherence, can perform computations and exhibit behaviors previously thought to be exclusive to biological systems, specifically mimicking aspects of human cognition.

2. **Hypothesis:** The Free Energy Principle (FEP) – specifically, the idea that systems minimize free energy to determine their state – can be applied to quantum systems, offering a framework for understanding computation and cognition in quantum systems.

3. **Claim:**  Quantum systems can exhibit “contextual” behavior, meaning their behavior depends on the context in which they are observed, challenging classical notions of deterministic systems.

4. **Hypothesis:**  The concept of “quantum Darwinism” – where the most robust quantum states are those that are most likely to be observed – is a key mechanism driving the evolution of quantum systems.

5. **Claim:**  The FEP provides a framework for understanding how biological systems, particularly in terms of their cognitive processes, can be viewed as quantum systems.
