## Bridging Cognitive Maps: a Hierarchical Active Inference Model of Spatial Alternation Tasks and the Hippocampal-Prefrontal CircuitThe authors state: "Cognitive problem-solving benefits from cognitive maps aiding navigation and planning." They note: "The concept of a cognitive map can apply to the more fine-grained spatial codes that are found in the hippocampal formation." The paper argues: "The hierarchical active inference model provides a mechanistic account of how the HC – mPFC circuit supports spatial alternation tasks."The study investigates the role of hierarchical active inference in spatial alternations. The authors state: "The key is to understand how the HC and the mPFC interact to enable the resolution of spatial alternation tasks." The research demonstrates that the model’s dual layers acquire effective cognitive maps for navigation within physical (HC map) and task (mPFC map) spaces, using a biologically-inspired approach: a clone-structured cognitive graph. The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. The authors highlight that disrupting inter-layer communication impairs decision-making, consistent with empirical findings.The study presents a novel computational theory of hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during cognitive tasks that require navigating in both physical and task space – spatial alternation tasks.
