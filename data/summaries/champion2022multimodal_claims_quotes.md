Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The primary claim** of the paper is that a new version of Branching Time Active Inference (BTAI) can model several observations and latent states simultaneously, addressing the exponential complexity issues of previous BTAI formulations.
2.  **The authors hypothesize** that by factorizing the likelihood and transition mappings, the computational burden of inference can be significantly reduced.
3.  **A key finding** is that the proposed BTAI model outperforms previous versions of BTAI (Champion et al., 2021a) and BTAI (Champion et al., 2022b,a) on the dSprites environment.
4.  **The authors state** that the model’s ability to handle multiple observations and latent states is crucial for tackling complex tasks where multiple factors are involved.
5.  **The authors hypothesize** that the model’s performance will improve as the number of latent states and observations increases.
