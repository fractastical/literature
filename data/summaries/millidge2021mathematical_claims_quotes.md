Okay, here's an extraction of key claims and quotes from the provided text, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Hypothesis:** The Free-Energy Principle (FEP) posits that self-organizing systems, particularly biological ones, maintain themselves by minimizing the free energy associated with their state. This involves a dynamic balance between entropy production and the system’s ability to reduce its overall energy.

2. **Methodological Framework:** The FEP relies on a specific mathematical formulation involving the Helmholtz decomposition, a gradient descent approach, and the concept of a Markov Blanket to model the interactions within a system.

3. **Role of the Markov Blanket:** The Markov Blanket, defined as the set of variables that are statistically dependent on a given system, is central to the FEP. It acts as a boundary that encapsulates the relevant information needed to accurately model the system’s dynamics.

4. **Hypothesis of System Modeling:** The FEP suggests that systems can be effectively modeled by defining their state in terms of a set of variables that are statistically dependent on the system itself, effectively capturing the essential information needed for accurate modeling.

5. **Hypothesis of System Modeling:** The FEP suggests that systems can be effectively modeled by defining their state in terms of a set of variables that are statistically dependent on the system itself, effectively capturing the essential information needed for accurate modeling.
