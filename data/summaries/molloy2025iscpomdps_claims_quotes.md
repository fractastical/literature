Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Core Claim:** The authors introduce a new class of partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) called Initial-State Cost Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (ISC-POMDPs) that can handle costs dependent on both the value and future uncertainty associated with initial states.

2.  **Hypothesis:** ISC-POMDPs can be reformulated and solved as standard (ρ-)POMDPs, enabling the optimization of control policies that explicitly account for initial-state uncertainty.

3.  **Key Finding:** ISC-POMDPs introduce a non-Markovian cost function, which is a critical difference from standard POMDPs and requires a recursive Bayesian fixed-point smoother to estimate the initial state.

4.  **Key Finding:** The authors demonstrate that ISC-POMDPs can be treated as POMDPs with augmented states, allowing for a recursive Bayesian smoother to estimate the initial state.

5.  **Key Finding:** ISC-POMDPs can be solved using a recursive Bayesian fixed-point smoother, which resembles the standard Bayesian filter, and can be used to solve the problem.
