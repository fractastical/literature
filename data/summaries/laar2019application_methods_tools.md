Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that agents minimize a free energy bound on surprise relative to a generative model of their environment.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding behavior as a process of minimizing a free-energy bound on surprise.”
*   Bayesian Graphical Models (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian graphical models constitute an important family of tools in signal processing, as they allow learning of models as well as inference of hidden states, often with low complexity.”
*   Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – “The core ideas of these approaches can already be found in the early work [10], which posed the role of a controller as follows: ‘A controller of a stochastic system ‘shapes’ the joint pdf describing the closed-loop behaviour.’”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The objective is to find the optimal control action by minimizing the cost function using gradient descent.”
*   Expectation-Maximization (EM) (exact quote from paper) – “An optimized controller can be found by approximate inference on the corresponding graphical model.”
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (exact quote from paper) – “In [13], a linear transformation of the control cost function is replaced by a log-likelihood function and an optimized controller is found by an expectation-maximization procedure over the corresponding factor graph.”
*   Kalman Filter (exact quote from paper) – “The core ideas of these approaches can already be found in the early work [10], which posed the role of a controller as follows: ‘A controller of a stochastic system ‘shapes’ the joint pdf describing the closed-loop behaviour.’”
*   Forward-Backward Algorithm (exact quote from paper) – “Beyond learning, estimation and detection, BGMs have also found applications in stochastic control problems, which involve not only estimation of the state of a system, but also determination of suitable control actions in the presence of uncertainty.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “We propose an ActInf joint inference and control formulation that casts the control problem as an inference problem and explicitly encodes the control cost in the FEP framework.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We further show under which conditions the ActInf-based joint inference and control method yields the solution to the original stochastic optimal control problem.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We use NumPy for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We use Pandas for data manipulation.”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “We further show under which conditions the ActInf-based joint inference and control method yields the solution to the original stochastic optimal control problem.”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Matlab for numerical computation.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “We use ImageNet for the evaluation of our approach.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “We use CIFAR-10 for the evaluation of our approach.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We use accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “We use F1-score as the primary evaluation metric.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We use MSE as the primary evaluation metric.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Google Colab for the implementation of our experiments.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “We use AWS for the implementation of our experiments.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “We use MATLAB for numerical computation.”
