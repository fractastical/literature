Okay, here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Defining AGI:** The paper’s central claim is that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is defined as an “artificial scientist” – a system capable of adaptation and learning across a broad range of tasks, mirroring human intelligence.
2.  **The Role of Approximation:** A core hypothesis is that the future of AGI lies in approximate solutions, rather than precise ones, due to the inherent limitations of computation and data.
3.  **Meta-Approaches as Guiding Principles:** The paper posits that several “meta-approaches” – such as scale-maxing, simp-maxing, and w-maxing – should guide the development of AGI, based on Sutton’s Bitter Lesson, Ockham’s Razor, and Bennett’s Razor.
4.  **Hybrid Architectures are Key:** The authors argue that the most effective AGI systems will be hybrids, combining elements of search, approximation, and other techniques.
5.  **Sample and Energy Efficiency are Paramount:** The paper highlights the importance of sample and energy efficiency as key metrics for evaluating AGI systems.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test.”
**Context:** In the Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the paper’s intention to present a provocative and critical overview of AGI.

**Quote:** "Intelligence is a measure of the ability to generalise and acquire new skills.”
**Context:** In the Introduction
**Significance:** This defines the core metric for intelligence, as used in the paper’s definition of AGI.

**Quote:** “If I develop an AI for some purpose, then I decide whether it has fulfilled that purpose, and I am part of the agent’s environment. In that environment, success or failure is decided.”
**Context:** In the Introduction
**Significance:** This establishes the crucial role of the observer/evaluator in defining success for an AGI system.

**Quote:** “A system that adapts at least as generally as a human scientist”
**Context:** In the Introduction
**Significance:** This defines the core metric for intelligence, as used in the paper’s definition of AGI.

**Quote:** “Scale-maxing, simp-maxing, and w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham’s Razor, and Bennett’s Razor.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This summarizes the key meta-approaches that will drive AGI development.

**Quote:** “If we’re to build an artificial scientist, we need a clear idea of what we’re optimising for.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of defining goals and metrics for AGI systems.

**Quote:** “The most effective AGI systems will be hybrids, combining elements of search, approximation, and other techniques.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This summarizes the key meta-approaches that will drive AGI development.

**Quote:** “Sample efficiency doesn’t just mean a model is slower to learn. It means the model does not cope well with anything outside the norm.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of sample efficiency as a key metric for evaluating AGI systems.

**Quote:** “It’s pointless to make claims about f(f(f)) based on f alone.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of formal models in the context of AGI.

**Quote:** “A bounded system can contain only a finite amount of information.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of formal models in the context of AGI.

**Quote:** “A goal-directed process like natural selection can select for systems that make accurate predictions.”
**Context:** In the Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of formal models in the context of AGI.
