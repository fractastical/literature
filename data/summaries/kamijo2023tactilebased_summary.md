### OverviewThis paper investigates a novel tactile-based active inference approach for force-controlled peg-in-hole insertions. The authors propose a dual-policy architecture that leverages a deep active inference model to align the tilted peg with the hole, without relying on visual feedback or pre-trained models. The system combines a force-controlled insertion policy with an active inference policy based on tactile feedback. The key innovation lies in using the internal state (tilt of the peg) as a belief, updating it through Bayesian inference to minimize prediction error. The authors demonstrate the system’s effectiveness through experiments with five different pegs, achieving a90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than0.1 mm.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers around a dual-policy architecture, as depicted in Figure1. The insertion policy executes force control based on a learned RL policy, guiding the grasped peg into the hole. When the peg slips, the alignment policy takes over, utilizing active inference to adjust the robot’s end-effector pose and align the peg with the hole. The generative model g predicts tactile sensations from the inferred tilt µ, as described in Equation (7). The authors employ a deep active inference model, as detailed in Section2, to estimate the contact area of the grasped peg. The generative function g is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, as described in Section2. The authors train the decoder using self-data augmentation, creating a dataset of tactile images of the peg in a straight pose. The authors use the instant decoder training method, as described in Section4. The authors employ a Bayesian approach to update the internal state µ, as described in Equation (9). The authors use a Gaussian prior for µ with mean zero and variance σ2. The authors set Σ−1 =2×104 and σ2 =1×10−2.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate the system’s effectiveness through experiments with five different pegs, achieving a90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than0.1 mm. The authors observed that the baseline method achieved a success rate of just5% when inserting the pulley into the motor, and70% when inserting the pulley into the motor. The authors demonstrated that the system generalizes to multiple objects without a pre-trained model. The authors’ results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods that lack tactile sensory feedback. The authors’ results show that the system’s performance is robust to variations in object geometry and material properties. The authors’ results show that the system’s performance is consistent across different experimental conditions.### DiscussionThe authors’ approach offers a robust and adaptable solution for force-controlled peg-in-hole insertions. The system’s ability to generalize to multiple objects without a pre-trained model is a key advantage.
