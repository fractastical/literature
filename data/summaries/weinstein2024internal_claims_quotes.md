Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a mathematical framework for robots to learn an internal model of their environment, relying on quantities that can be internally evaluated. This framework is based on the principle of sufficiency – minimizing surprise.
2.  The core hypothesis is that a robot, if designed to minimize surprise, will inevitably develop an internal structure that mirrors the external environment.
3.  The authors state: "When designing a robot’s internal system, one often makes assumptions about the structure of the intended environment of the robot. One may even assign meaning to various internal components of the robot in terms of expected environmental correlates."
4.  The paper posits that the internal model of the robot is fundamentally a representation of the external environment, and that this representation is achieved through assigning meaning to the internal state.
5.  The authors state: "A logical theory or a theory of agency is representationalist if and only if it relies on semantic functions."
6.  The paper suggests that the internal state space can be constructed by minimizing surprise, and that this minimization leads to an isomorphic internal structure.
7.  The authors state: "We develop a mathematical framework which enables robots to learn an internal model of the external environment by relying only on quantities which can be internally evaluated."

## Important Quotes

1.  "When designing a robot’s internal system, one often makes assumptions about the structure of the intended environment of the robot. One may even assign meaning to various internal components of the robot in terms of expected environmental correlates." (Introduction) – *This quote establishes the fundamental problem the paper addresses: the reliance on pre-defined assumptions about the environment.*
2.  "A logical theory or a theory of agency is representationalist if and only if it relies on semantic functions." (Semantic Functions) – *This quote introduces the philosophical underpinning of the work, linking the robot’s internal model to the concept of semantics.*
3.  "We develop a mathematical framework which enables robots to learn an internal model of the external environment by relying only on quantities which can be internally evaluated." (Introduction) – *This is the core claim of the paper: a mathematical framework for internal model learning.*
4.  "The relationship between the structure of an internal model and that of the external environment has been studied in the context of control theory." (Related Work) – *This quote highlights the paper's connection to existing work in control theory.*
5.  "The incorporation of an internal model was formalized in terms of the divisibility of the invariant factors of the matrix describing the (linear) dynamics of the compensator by the minimal polynomial of a matrix representing the dynamics of the exogenous signals affecting the plant." (Related Work) – *This quote details the specific mathematical approach used in control theory.*
9.  "The authors state: "A logical theory or a theory of agency is representationalist if and only if it relies on semantic functions."" (Semantic Functions) – *This quote reiterates the philosophical underpinning of the work.*
