Here’s a draft of the summary, incorporating all the above instructions and constraints.**1. Introduction**This paper investigates the precision of radial velocity (RV) measurements using the ESPRESSO instrument, achieving a measurement accuracy of10 cm/s. This represents a significant advancement in the field, enabling more precise characterization of exoplanetary systems. The study focuses on extracting and quantifying the RV signal from the target star, HD10700, utilizing the ESPRESSO instrument.**2. Methodology**The methodology employed involves a multi-step process: (1) Data acquisition from the ESPRESSO instrument, (2) Data reduction and calibration, (3) RV signal extraction and analysis, and (4) uncertainty quantification. The ESPRESSO instrument provides high-resolution RV measurements, enabling the detection of subtle variations in the stellar velocity. The data reduction process involved calibration of the instrumental noise and removal of instrumental artifacts. The RV signal was extracted using a custom-designed algorithm, and the uncertainty in the measurement was quantified using a Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty in the measurement was quantified using a Monte Carlo simulation, considering the uncertainties in the instrument, the data reduction process, and the RV signal itself. The final uncertainty is10 cm/s.**3. Results**The results of the study demonstrate that the ESPRESSO instrument can achieve an RV measurement accuracy of10 cm/s. This represents a significant improvement over previous instruments, enabling more precise characterization of exoplanetary systems. The RV signal from HD10700 is well-defined, with a clear peak at10 cm/s. The RMS noise of the RV signal is1.0 cm/s. The RMS noise of the RV signal is1.0 cm/s.**4. Discussion**The achievement of a10 cm/s RV measurement accuracy represents a significant advancement in the field of exoplanetary science. This level of precision enables more accurate determination of exoplanetary properties, such as their mass, orbital period, and eccentricity. The results of this study will be used to improve the accuracy of future exoplanetary measurements.**5. Conclusion**The ESPRESSO instrument is capable of achieving a10 cm/s RV measurement accuracy, enabling more precise characterization of exoplanetary systems. This represents a significant advancement in the field of exoplanetary science.---**Note:** This is a draft, and the final length and content will depend on the specific requirements. The key is to adhere to the constraints and guidelines provided, particularly the repetition avoidance rules.
