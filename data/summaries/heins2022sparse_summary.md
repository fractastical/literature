### Sparse coupling and Markov blankets: A comment on "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz and Buckley

### OverviewThe authors investigate the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets within the context of stochastic differential equations and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The paper critically examines the claims made in "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera et al., specifically regarding the emergence of Markov blankets from sparse coupling structures. The authors demonstrate that Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling, and that ‘such a cyclic structure can generate couplings that propagate beyond causal interactions’. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence in the case of Gaussian steady-statedensities. We precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads—or does not lead—to conditional independence. Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of constraints are satisfied in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.### MethodologyThe authors analyze the ‘canonical loop’ that is claimed to generically give rise to Markov blankets in [3,4,5]. The authors show that in general Markov blankets are not guaranteed, and that ‘such a cyclic structure can generate couplings that propagate beyond causal interactions’. The authors use Langevin-style stochastic differential equations, where the solution admits a (non-equilibrium) steady-state density p, i.e., a solution to the Fokker-Planck equation [11]. We assume that the solution admits a (non-equilibrium) steady-state density p, i.e., a solution to the Fokker-Planck equation [11]. The authors used these considerations to explore the limits and applicability of the Free Energy Principle (hereafter: FEP) in linear stochastic sytems. Previous FEP literature has intimated that sparse coupling structures (absent causal coupling between two subsets of states) lead to the emergence of Markov blankets [3,5,7,10].
