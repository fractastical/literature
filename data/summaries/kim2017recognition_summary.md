### OverviewThis paper investigates the theoretical framework of the recognition dynamics (RD) in the brain under the principle of least action, as articulated by the free energy principle (FEP). The authors formulate the RD as a Bayesian filtering process, wherein the brain attempts to minimize sensory uncertainty about the external world. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the RD, leveraging the FEP to derive a set of coupled differential equations governing the brain’s perceptual states. The authors demonstrate how this RD can be implemented at a single-cell level, and subsequently scaled up to a hierarchical architecture of the brain.### MethodologyThe authors’ approach centers on the mathematical formulation of the RD, employing the principle of least action. They define the informational Lagrangian (IL) of the brain, representing the sensory uncertainty. The IL is then used to derive a set of coupled differential equations, which govern the RD of the brain’s perceptual states. The authors implement this RD at a single-cell level, describing the dynamics of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron. They also scale up the model to a hierarchical architecture, incorporating a coarse-grained representation of the brain’s functional hierarchy. The authors utilize a Bayesian filtering approach, wherein the brain represents the external world probabilistically, updating its beliefs based on sensory input. They employ a gradient-descent scheme to minimize the IFE, effectively finding the optimal trajectory for the brain’s perceptual states. The authors’ approach relies on the assumption that the brain’s representation of the external world is a Gaussian density, allowing for tractable mathematical analysis.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that the RD can be implemented at a single-cell level, describing the dynamics of a Hodgkin-

Huxley neuron. 

The authors show that the RD can be implemented in a manner that minimizes the sensory uncertainty, effectively allowing the brain to adapt to its environment
