Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search) is a novel approach to neural architecture search that leverages biologically inspired principles – specifically, reaction-diffusion systems, gene regulatory networks, and the Free Energy Principle – to automatically generate neural networks.

2.  **Hypothesis:** By mimicking the self-organizing processes observed in embryonic development, MorphoNAS can produce neural network architectures that are both functionally effective and structurally efficient.

3.  **Claim:** The system operates by encoding developmental rules within a compact genome, allowing for the emergence of complex network topologies without explicit manual design.

4.  **Claim:** The system’s evolutionary experiments, targeting specific structural properties (number of nodes, edges, and sources), demonstrate its ability to generate functional networks.

5.  **Claim:** The proposed framework offers a potentially scalable approach to neural architecture search, which could be applied to a wide range of problems.
