## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle mathematically describes the principle that living things obey. The free energy in the FEP measures the difference between the probability distribution of environmental states that act on a biological system and an approximate posterior distribution of environmental states encoded by the configuration of that system.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference aims to find action that minimizes the uncertainty”
*   Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (exact quote from paper) – “The generative model is implemented with a variational autoencoder”
*   Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) (exact quote from paper) – “The generative model is implemented with a fully connected neural network”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified.”
*   Monte-Carlo Planning (exact quote from paper) – “Monte-Carlo planning in large POMDPs”
*   Point-based Value Iteration (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Statistical Tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
