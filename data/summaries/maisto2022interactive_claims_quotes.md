Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, formatted according to the requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions, grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference.
2.  The model posits that agents coordinate their actions by engaging in a process of interactive inference, aligning their beliefs and behavioral strategies to achieve a shared goal.
3.  The model predicts that in “leaderless” joint actions, agents will spontaneously coordinate their behavior and task representations, without explicit communication.
4.  The model predicts that in “leader-follower” joint actions, a leader will intentionally signal its intentions to a follower, reducing the follower’s uncertainty and facilitating successful joint action.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the model can reproduce key behavioral dynamics observed in human-human joint actions, such as synchronization of movements and shared task representations.

## Important Quotes

1.  "We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference." (Introduction) - *This quote establishes the core claim of the paper: the development of a model based on active inference.*
2.  "To solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference." (Abstract) - *This quote defines the central mechanism of the model – interactive inference – as the key to achieving joint action.*
3.  "Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action." (Abstract) - *This quote highlights the expected outcome of the model: the alignment of beliefs and behaviors leading to successful joint action.*
5.  "The first simulation illustrates a ‘leaderless’ joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other’s movements.” (Simulation 1) - *This quote describes the first simulation, illustrating the spontaneous coordination observed in “leaderless” joint actions.*
6.  "When one agent (‘leader’) knows the true joint task goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (‘follower’) infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan.” (Simulation 2) - *This quote describes the second simulation, illustrating the “leader-follower” dynamics and the intentional communication for reducing uncertainty.*
7.  "The model presented here formalizes joint action as a process of interactive inference based on shared task knowledge between the agents [2], [45]." (Introduction) - *This quote highlights the formalization of joint action as an interactive inference process.*
8.  "The expected free energy functional… automatically promotes epistemic behavior.” (Methods) - *This quote describes the key mechanism of the model – the use of the expected free energy functional – that automatically promotes epistemic behavior.*
9.  "The model predicts that in ‘leaderless’ joint actions, agents will spontaneously coordinate their behavior and task representations, without explicit communication.” (Simulation 1) - *This quote reiterates the key prediction of the model regarding spontaneous coordination in “leaderless” joint actions.*
10. "The model presented here formalizes joint action as a process of interactive inference based on shared task knowledge between the agents [2], [45]." (Introduction) - *This quote emphasizes the formalization of joint action as an interactive inference process.*
