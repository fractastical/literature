### OverviewThis summary of “From Representation to Enactment: The ABC Framework of the Translating Mind” by Carl, Mizowaki, and Raj, investigates the authors’ novel approach to understanding translation, moving beyond traditional representational models. The core argument centers on the idea that translation is not a process of internal representation but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. The paper proposes a framework that emphasizes the embodied and situated nature of translation, highlighting the importance of interaction with the environment, tools, and sociocultural practices. The summary will extract key claims, findings, and methodological details from the paper, while strictly adhering to the requirements of unique content and avoiding repetition.### MethodologyThe authors present a novel ABC framework to explain translation, arguing that it moves beyond representational models. The authors state: "The classical representational view of the mind considers cognitive processes to remain confined to the brain, where ‘mind = brain’." (Carl et al.,2025). They argue that translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. The authors draw on Predictive Processing (PP) and (En)Active Inference, suggesting that the translator’s mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain–body–environment interactions. The authors state: “The mind is a system collectively constituted by embodied, embedded, enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) processes.” (Carl et al.,2025). The authors propose a framework that integrates the concepts of Predictive Processing and Enactive Inference, suggesting that the translator’s mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain–body–environment interactions. The authors state: “The predictive brain does not represent, but it controls and regulates mental processes, i.e., processes that stretch into the environment.” (Seth,2014). The authors also draw on Hutchins’s work on situated cognition, emphasizing the importance of the environment in shaping cognitive processes. The authors state: “Hutchins’s (1995) ‘Cognition in the Wild’ can be considered a precursor of the ‘The Extended Mind’ (EM) hypothesis which is, however, strongly rooted in classical cognitivism.” (Carl et al.,2025).### ResultsThe authors identify several key findings related to the ABC framework. First, they demonstrate that translation involves a complex interplay of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes. The authors state: “Affective processes are feeling and emotion-related, providing an evaluative dimension that is crucial for successful agent-environment interaction.” (Carl et al.,2025). Second, they show that the translator’s behavior is influenced by their internal state, and vice versa. The authors state: “Affective states can either mobilize cognitive resources (facilitating performance) or overwhelm them.” (Carl et al.,2025). Third, they demonstrate that the translator’s mind emerges through loops of brain–body–environment interactions. The authors also highlight the importance of the environment in shaping cognitive processes. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes.” (Carl et al.,2025)“The mind is a system collectively constituted by embodied, embedded, enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) processes.” (Carl et al.,2025)“The predictive brain does not represent, but it controls and regulates mental processes, i.e., processes that stretch into the environment.” (Seth,2014)### DiscussionThe authors’ ABC framework offers a novel and compelling perspective on translation, moving beyond traditional representational models. The framework highlights the embodied and situated nature of translation, emphasizing the importance of interaction with the environment, tools, and sociocultural practices. The authors’ approach aligns with recent developments in cognitive science and linguistics, particularly the growing interest in embodied cognition and situated learning. The framework’s emphasis on the dynamic interplay of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes provides a richer and more nuanced understanding of the translation process. The authors’ approach also has implications for the design of translation tools and technologies, suggesting that future tools should be designed to support the integration of these three dimensions.### ConclusionIn summary, “From Representation to Enactment: The ABC Framework of the Translating Mind” presents a significant contribution to the field of translation studies. 

The authors’ novel framework offers a valuable tool for understanding the complex processes involved in translation, emphasizing the embodied, situated, and dynamic nature of the translation process. 

The authors’ work highlights the importance of considering the broader context in which translation takes place, and suggests that translation is not simply a matter of linguistic competence, but a complex interplay of cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.
