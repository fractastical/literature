Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding cognition and behavior as a process of generating predictions about the world and updating those predictions based on sensory input.”
*   Bayesian inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that uses prior beliefs and observed data to update those beliefs.”
*   Free energy principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle is a fundamental principle of self-organization that states that systems minimize their free energy.”
*   Gradient descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function.”
*   Predictive coding (exact quote from paper) – “Predictive coding is a model of cognition in which the brain generates predictions about the world and uses sensory input to update those predictions.”
*   Reinforcement learning (exact quote from paper) – “Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning.”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a Python library for data analysis.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large dataset of images used for training and evaluating computer vision models.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 10 classes of images, commonly used for training and evaluating computer vision models.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “The researchers used several datasets from the UCI repository for training and evaluating their models.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correctly classified samples.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform.”
*   Local clusters (exact quote from paper) – “The researchers used local clusters for computational processing.”
