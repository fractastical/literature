Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a model of consciousness based directly on the free-energy principle (FEP), arguing that this framework can explain the observed sparse and hierarchical neuro-anatomy of the brain.
2.  A central hypothesis is that consciousness arises from the ability of a system to actively model its environment and select actions based on this model.
3.  The authors posit that the brain’s internal states are conditionally independent due to the presence of Markov blankets, which are formed by sparse coupling between neuronal populations.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the hierarchical structure of the brain, with nested Markov blankets, is essential for generating coherent sensory experiences.
5.  The authors propose that the ability to actively select actions based on predictive models is a fundamental aspect of consciousness.

## Important Quotes

1.  “We first rehearse the classical and quantum formulations of the FEP.” (Introduction) – *This highlights the authors’ intention to ground their model in established theoretical frameworks.*
2.  “The brain as a hierarchy of nested blankets” (3.1) – *This succinctly describes the core architectural premise of their model.*
3.  “The FEP provides an explanation—from first principles—of how it is that anything that exists represents or infers the properties of its embedding environment” (3.1) – *This statement articulates the fundamental principle underlying their model.*
4.  “The internal states of a Markov blanket…are conditionally independent from external states” (3.1) – *This is a key definition of a Markov blanket, central to their model.*
5.  “The brain…is endowed with active states that influence external dynamics” (3.1) – *This emphasizes the role of active states in shaping the brain’s dynamics.*
6.  “The hierarchical generative model…is a key feature of the brain” (3.2) – *This highlights the importance of hierarchical generative models in their framework.*
7.  “The Markov blankets…are composed of the ‘faces’ of the Markov blankets” (3.1) – *This refers to the nested structure of the Markov blankets.*
8.  “The internal states…are not influenced by external states” (3.1) – *This is a defining characteristic of a Markov blanket.*
9.  “The brain…is endowed with active states that influence external dynamics” (3.1) – *This statement emphasizes the role of active states in shaping the brain’s dynamics.*
10. “The hierarchical generative model…is a key feature of the brain” (3.2) – *This highlights the importance of hierarchical generative models in their framework.*
