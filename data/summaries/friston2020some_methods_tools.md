## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Helmholtz Decomposition (exact quote from paper) – “Crucially, because we are (stipulatively) assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition.”
*   Fokker-Planck Equation (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
*   Laplace Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “Crucially, because we are (stipulatively) assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition.”
*   Stochastic Differential Equations (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.”
