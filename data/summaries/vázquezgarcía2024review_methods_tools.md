Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (exact quote from paper) – “VAE is a generative model that learns a latent representation of the data, capturing the underlying structure and variability.”
*   Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) (exact quote from paper) – “LDM is a generative model that learns a latent representation of the data, capturing the underlying structure and variability.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a theoretical framework that describes how the brain generates perceptions and actions by minimizing surprise.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that updates beliefs based on observed data.”
*   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for processing images and other grid-like data.”
*   Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (exact quote from paper) – “MLP is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes.”
*   Local Linear Embedding (LLE) (exact quote from paper) – “LLE is a dimensionality reduction technique that preserves local relationships in the data.”
*   Sparse Autoencoder (exact quote from paper) – “Sparse autoencoder is a type of autoencoder that encourages the latent representation to be sparse.”
