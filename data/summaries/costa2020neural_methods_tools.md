## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle provides a normative framework for explaining behaviour under the free energy principle – a theory of self-organisation originating in neuroscience [1–4] that characterises systems at steady-state as having the appearance of sentience [5,6]."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference describes organisms as inference engines. This assumes that organisms embody a generative model of their environment. The model encodes how the states external to the agent influence the agent’s sensations. Organisms infer their surrounding environment from sensory data by inverting the generative model through minimisation of variational free energy. This amounts to performing approximate Bayesian inference (also known as variational Bayes) [2,3,8–11] or minimising the discrepancy between predictions and sensations [1,12]."
