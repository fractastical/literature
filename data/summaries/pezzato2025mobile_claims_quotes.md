Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Main Claim:** The paper demonstrates that active inference can scale to the complexity of modern robotics benchmarks, specifically the Habitat Benchmark, by introducing a fully hierarchical hybrid active inference architecture.

2. **Hypothesis:** Combining discrete and continuous active inference processes, through a hierarchical structure, will enable robots to achieve long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks effectively.

3. **Claim:** The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three long-horizon tasks within the Habitat Benchmark (TidyHouse, PrepareGroceries, and SetTable).

4. **Claim:** The system’s success relies on a novel whole-body controller based on continuous hierarchical active inference, integrating navigation, manipulation, and obstacle avoidance.

5. **Claim:** The system’s modular design allows for flexible skill composition, online adaptation, and recovery from task failures without the need for offline training.
