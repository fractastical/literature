## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The proposed model is built upon the free energy principle, which posits that agents minimize their free energy by generating actions that reduce the mismatch between their internal models and the external world.”
*   Variational Recurrent Neural Network (PV-RNN) (exact quote from paper) – “The proposed model, which is built upon the free energy principle, is characterized by three essential features. These are that (1) goalscanbespecifiedforbothstaticsensorystates,e.g.,forgoalimagestobereachedanddynamicprocesses,e.g.,formovingaroundanobject; (2)themodelcannotonlygenerategoal-directedactionplans,butcanalsounderstandgoalsbysensoryobservation; and (3)themodelgeneratesfutureactionplansforgivengoalsbasedonthebestestimateofthecurrentstate,inferredusingpastsensoryobservations.”
