Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Need for a Comprehensive Framework:** The authors state: "Over the past four decades, efforts have been made to develop and evaluate models for Empirical Translation Process Research (TPR), yet a comprehensive framework remains elusive.” This highlights the longstanding challenge in the field.

2.  **Introducing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference:** The authors state: “FEP and AIF provide a mathematically rigorous foundation that enables modeling of deep temporal architectures in which embedded translation processes unfold on different timelines.” This introduces the core theoretical framework.

3.  **Relevance as a Central Concept:** The authors state: “RT assumes that, due to the selection pressure towards increasing efficiency, our cognitive systems have evolved in such a way that our perceptual mechanisms tend automatically to pick out relevant stimuli, our memory retrieval mechanisms tend automatically to activate potentially relevant assumptions, and our inferential mechanisms tend automatically to process them in the most productive way.” This establishes the role of Relevance Theory.

4.  **Linking Effort and Effect:** The authors state: “The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) are formulated within a mathematical rigorous framework (i.e., Bayesian reasoning) in which (artificial) agents are modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that can learn from experiences, and it has been analyzed within an enactivist framework (Bruineberg et al. 2018; Kirchhoff and Kiverstein 2021; Carl 2023).” This establishes the theoretical basis.

5. **The Monitor Model as a Key Component:** The authors state: “The Monitor Model, as proposed by Tirkkonen-Condit (2005); Schaeffer and Carl (2013/2015), stipulates that automated translation routines are associated with comparatively low levels of effort, as they involve minimal cognitive resources.” This introduces the Monitor Model.
