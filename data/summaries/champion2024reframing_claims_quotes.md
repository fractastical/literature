Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper aims to formalize the expected free energy (EFE) and unify four distinct formulations of the EFE, which are commonly found in the active inference literature.
2.  **Hypothesis:** It is possible to derive all four EFE formulations from a single root definition of the EFE.
3.  **Finding:** The paper identifies four distinct formulations of the EFE: risk over states plus ambiguity, entropy plus expected energy, and information gain/pragmatic value.
4.  **Finding:** The paper demonstrates that the EFE can be used to model the agent’s behavior, i.e., the agent aims to reach its preferred states or observations.
5.  **Finding:** The paper highlights the importance of the prior preferences over observations, and how they influence the agent’s behavior.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "active inference is a leading theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning."
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the broader context and importance of active inference.

**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote highlights the problem the paper addresses – the lack of a formal justification for the various EFE formulations.

**Quote:** "The EFE is a function defining the cost of performing a particular policy as a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, e.g., the goal is to maximize pragmatic value (reward), while also maximizing information gain."
**Context:** Definition of the Expected Free Energy
**Significance:** This quote provides a clear definition of the EFE and its key components.

**Quote:** "The variational posterior defines the most likely state of the environment, it does not indicate which action should be selected. Instead, the agent aims to reach a set of preferred states or observations, by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE)."
**Context:** Definition of the Expected Free Energy
**Significance:** This quote explains the role of the variational posterior and the agent’s objective function.

**Quote:** “The risk over states plus ambiguity formulation is defined as ∆ D [F(s |a) || T(s |a)] + E H [F(o |s)]”
**Context:** Definition of the Risk over States plus Ambiguity formulation
**Significance:** This quote provides the exact mathematical formulation of the first EFE formulation.

**Quote:** “The entropy plus expected energy formulation is defined as −E [D [F(s |a) || T(s |a)]] −E [lnT(o,s|a)]”
**Context:** Definition of the Entropy plus Expected Energy formulation
**Significance:** This quote provides the exact mathematical formulation of the second EFE formulation.

**Quote:** “The information gain and pragmatic value formulation is defined as −E [D [F(o |a) || T(o |a)]] −E [lnT(o,s|a)]”
**Context:** Definition of the Information Gain and Pragmatic Value formulation
**Significance:** This quote provides the exact mathematical formulation of the third EFE formulation.

**Quote:** “The agent is equipped with a (generative) model that encodes the environment dynamics, and a variational posterior approximating the true posterior over latent variables.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the core components of active inference.

**Quote:** “To solve the dual meaning problem, the prior preferences over observation are sometimes considered as being part of a target distribution.”
**Context:** Section 5.4
**Significance:** This quote highlights the key assumption and potential issue in the formulation of the EFE.
