## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “The core of our approach is based on reinforcement learning, where the agent learns through trial and error, maximizing a reward signal.”
*   Curiosity-driven Exploration (exact quote from paper) – “We leverage the intrinsic motivation of curiosity to encourage the agent to explore novel states and learn about the environment.”
*   Bayesian Belief Updating (exact quote from paper) – “We employ Bayesian belief updating to refine the agent’s understanding of the user’s type based on observed interactions.”
*   Potential-based Reward Shaping (exact quote from paper) – “We use potential-based reward shaping to guide the agent’s learning by providing a reward signal that is proportional to the difference between the agent’s belief and the true user type.”
*   Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (exact quote from paper) – “We employ GAE to reduce the variance of the reward signal and improve the stability of the learning process.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the user types.”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “We use KL divergence to measure the difference between the agent’s belief and the true user type.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “We implement our model using PyTorch, a deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use.”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “We also explored TensorFlow as an alternative framework for implementing our model.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize NumPy for efficient numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We employ Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We use scikit-learn for various machine learning tasks, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “We also experiment with JAX for its ability to accelerate numerical computation.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “We evaluate our model on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale image classification dataset.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “We also conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used dataset for image classification.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize several datasets from the UCI repository for evaluating our model’s generalization capabilities.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We measure the accuracy of our model using the standard accuracy metric.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “We also evaluate our model using the F1-score, which measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “We use precision to assess the model’s ability to correctly identify positive instances.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “We use recall to measure the model’s ability to identify all positive instances.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We calculate the mean squared error to quantify the difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize Google Colab for our experiments, providing access to GPU resources.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “We also explored using AWS for our experiments, leveraging its cloud computing services.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “We conduct our experiments on local clusters, utilizing multiple GPUs for parallel computation.”
