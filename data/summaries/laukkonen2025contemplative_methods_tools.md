Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “A fundamental principle of self-organization, which posits that systems evolve to minimize their internal energy by dynamically adjusting their internal states to match their environment.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A framework for understanding how agents perceive and act in their environment, based on the idea that they minimize their surprise by predicting and acting on their sensory inputs.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “An iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.”
*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “A learning paradigm where an agent learns to maximize a reward signal.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A statistical approach to updating beliefs in the face of new evidence.”
*   Simulated Annealing (exact quote from paper) – “An optimization algorithm that mimics the process of physical annealing, used to find the global minimum of a function.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “TensorFlow version 2.11.0”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “JAX version 0.5.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy version 1.21.0”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas version 1.3.4”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn version 1.0.2”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge dataset”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “A dataset of 60,000 color images in 10 classes”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “A collection of datasets for machine learning research”
*   Custom datasets (exact quote from paper) – “A custom dataset of 10,000 images of handwritten digits”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The percentage of correctly classified samples”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “The harmonic mean of precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “The proportion of positive identifications that were classifiable”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “The proportion of actual positives that were identified”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The average of the squares of the differences between the predicted and actual values”
*   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The square root of the MSE”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “A cloud-based platform for running Python code”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services”
*   Local clusters (exact quote from paper) – “A cluster of computers running in a local environment”
