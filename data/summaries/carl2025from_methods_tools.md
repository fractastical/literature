## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of the model is based on the free energy principle, which posits that all living systems are active in minimizing their free energy” – mentioned in [Section 2.1]
*   Predictive Processing (exact quote from paper) – “The model is based on the active inference framework, which assumes that the brain is constantly generating predictions about the causes of sensory input and updating these predictions based on the difference between predictions and actual sensory input” – mentioned in [Section 2.2]
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the neural network” – mentioned in [Section 3.1]
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for modeling cognitive processes as the active generation of predictions and their subsequent updating based on sensory evidence” – mentioned in [Section 2.2]
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model utilizes Bayesian inference to update its beliefs about the causes of sensory input” – mentioned in [Section 2.2]
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The Markov blanket of a node in the network represents the set of nodes that are directly connected to it and that are necessary to determine its state” – mentioned in [Section 3.3]

## Software Frameworks and Libraries
