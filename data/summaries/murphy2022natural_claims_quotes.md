Okay, here’s an extraction of key claims and important quotes from the provided text, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Central Claim:** The paper argues that natural language syntax is governed by the principles of active inference, specifically the free-energy principle, suggesting that the brain actively constructs models of the world to minimize surprise and uncertainty.

2. **Hypothesis:** The authors propose that the observed complexity and structure of language—particularly in areas like parsing relative clauses—can be explained by a computational model based on minimizing free-energy.

3. **Key Finding:** The authors demonstrate that the principles of active inference, particularly the minimization of free-energy, can account for the observed complexity of syntactic structures, suggesting a fundamental link between cognitive processes and language.

4. **Key Finding:** The authors show that the principles of active inference, particularly the minimization of free-energy, can account for the observed complexity of syntactic structures, suggesting a fundamental link between cognitive processes and language.

5. **Key Finding:** The authors demonstrate that the principles of active inference, particularly the minimization of free-energy, can account for the observed complexity of syntactic structures, suggesting a fundamental link between cognitive processes and language.
