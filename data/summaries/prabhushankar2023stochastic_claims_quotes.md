Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The central claim** is that supervised neural networks, despite their ability to perform tasks, are inherently passive and prone to noise, leading to suboptimal performance.
2.  **The authors hypothesize** that a framework incorporating action during inference can mitigate this passivity and improve network performance.
3.  **The authors propose** a new measurement called “stochastic surprisal” as a function of the network, input, and possible action.
4.  **The authors claim** that stochastic surprisal can be used to quantify the discrepancy between the network’s internal representation and the external environment.
5.  **The authors hypothesize** that by incorporating action, the network can actively reduce its surprisal, thereby improving its performance.
6.  **The authors claim** that stochastic surprisal can be applied to both generative and discriminative neural networks.
7.  **The authors hypothesize** that the proposed method can be used to assess distortions in image quality assessment and robust recognition.

## Important Quotes

1.  “The human visual system is the resultant of an evolutionary process influenced and constrained by the natural visual stimuli present in the outside environment (Geisler, 2008; Sebastian et al., 2017).” (Introduction) - *This quote establishes the foundational principle of the paper: the visual system is shaped by external stimuli.*
2.  “We posit that these shortcomings of supervised neural networks are a resultant of neural networks lack an explicit control mechanism of incorporating prior beliefs into predictions.” (Discussion) - *This quote directly states the core problem the paper addresses: the lack of an active inference mechanism in supervised networks.*
3.  “We define a quantity called stochastic surprisal that is a function of a hypothetical action” (Methods) - *This is the core definition of the proposed measurement.*
4.  “In this paper, we use a generative model to estimate the surprisal” (Methods) - *This highlights the application of the proposed method to generative networks.*
5.  “The stochastic surprisal acts on the network parameters” (Methods) - *This clarifies the mechanism of action within the network.*
6.  “We measure the discrepancy between the network’s internal representation and the external environment” (Discussion) - *This summarizes the purpose of stochastic surprisal.*
7.  “The authors state: “We propose a framework for action during inference.” (Methods) - *This is the core definition of the proposed method.*
8.  “The authors state: “We use a generative model to estimate the surprisal” (Methods) - *This highlights the application of the proposed method to generative networks.*
9.  “The stochastic surprisal acts on the network parameters” (Methods) - *This clarifies the mechanism of action within the network.*
10. “We measure the discrepancy between the network’s internal representation and the external environment” (Discussion) - *This summarizes the purpose of stochastic surprisal.*
