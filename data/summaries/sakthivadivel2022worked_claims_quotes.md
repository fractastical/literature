Okay, here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a new approach to studying the mathematics and physics of interacting stochastic processes, termed “Bayesian mechanics.”
2.  The core hypothesis is that systems can be understood as estimators for statistical quantities or parameters of another system to which they couple, making them inference machines.
3.  A key finding is that classical physics can be derived from the principle of constrained maximum calibre, and that the Bayesian mechanics of internal states of classical objects can be formulated.
4.  The paper posits that the most likely state of a system is the one that minimizes surprisal, and that this minimization is a key component of Bayesian mechanics.
5.  The authors suggest that a system’s internal state can be understood as a parameter for a recognition density.
