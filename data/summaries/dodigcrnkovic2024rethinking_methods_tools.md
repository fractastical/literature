## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle is a fundamental principle of brain function, stating that the brain minimizes its free energy by predicting and acting on its sensory environment."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a computational framework for understanding how agents interact with their environments, based on the minimization of free energy."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "Gradient descent is a widely used optimization algorithm for training neural networks."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian inference is a statistical method for updating beliefs based on new evidence."
*   Morphological Computation (exact quote from paper) – “Morphological computation is a computational approach that connects the physical structure of a system with its functional behavior.”
*   Self-Assembly (exact quote from paper) – “Self-assembly is a process where components spontaneously organize themselves into ordered structures.”
*   Autopoiesis (exact quote from paper) – “Autopoiesis is a concept describing the self-organizing and self-maintaining processes of living systems.”
*   Mimetic Bodies (exact quote from paper) – “Mimetic bodies are physical structures that enhance computational capabilities by facilitating the interaction between the agent and its environment.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch is a deep learning framework used for implementing the proposed model."
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is a library for numerical computation."
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis."
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning algorithms."
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “Matlab is used for numerical computation and simulation.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – "ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images used for training and evaluating the proposed model."
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – "Accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of the model."
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “Local clusters are used for computational simulations and model training.”
