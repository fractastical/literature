Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that model collapse occurs when a generative AI model is trained on data that does not “surprise” it – meaning the data is too predictable or familiar to the model’s internal representations.

2. **Defining Collapse via Next-Token Probabilities:** The authors propose characterizing model collapse directly from the model’s next-token probability distributions, rather than relying on metrics computed on the AI-generated content itself.

3. **Surplexity as a Metric:** They define “surplexity” – the perplexity of a model given a document – as a key measure for detecting and mitigating model collapse.

4. **Data Selection Strategy:** The central claim is that a mitigation strategy can be implemented by filtering training documents based on their surplexity, maximizing the surprise the model experiences.

5. **Beyond Human-AI Distinction:** The paper argues that the distinction between human-authored and AI-generated data is becoming increasingly blurred, necessitating a new approach to model training.
