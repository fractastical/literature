How particular is the physics of the free energy principle?The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems – weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements are for the statistical structure of a system and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP – the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical separation between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) – are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system’s history of interactions.The FEP assumes a random dynamical system described by a Langevin stochastic differential equation:dzt = f(z )+ω , (1)t tdt −where f is an arbitrary but differentiable function and ω is a Gaussian white noise with a diagonal covariance matrix2Γ.The solution of this system in the non-equilibrium steady state yields statistical moments.Inordertoexploretheassumptionsrequiredtoconnecttheconditionalaverageflowofasystemtothegradientofthfreeenergy,weproposethatthesystem’sdynamicsaregovernedbytheMarkovblanketcondition,whichseparatesinternalandexternalstates,andthatthesystem’sdynamicsaregovernedbythegradientofthfreeenergy.The FEP assumes a random dynamical system described by a Langevin stochastic differential equation:dzt = f(z )+ω , (1)t tdt −where f is an arbitrary but differentiable function and ω is a Gaussian white noise with a diagonal covariance matrix2Γ.The solution of this system in the non-equilibrium steady state yields statistical moments.The FEP assumes that the system will reach a non-equilibrium steady state described by the probability density function p(z ), which can be described using a SDE decomposition that separates the flow into dissipative ( Γ J(z )) and solenoidal (Q J(z )) componentsf(z ) =(Q Γ) J(z ), (3)t z t−∇J(z ) = logp(z ), (4)t t−The FEP makes some requirements about the solenoidal flow matrix Q, as it assumes it is state-independent (i.e. Q does not change with z) and that it is stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium)The FEP assumes that the system will reach a non-equilibrium steady state described by the probability density function p(z ), which can be described using a SDE decomposition that separates the flow into dissipative ( Γ J(z )) and solenoidal (Q J(z )) componentsf(z ) =(Q Γ) J(z ), (3)t z t−∇J(z ) = logp(z ), (4)t t−The FEP makes some requirements about the solenoidal flow matrix Q, as it assumes it is state-independent (i.e
