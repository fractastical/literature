### OverviewThis paper investigates exploring action-centric representations through the lens of rate-distortion theory. The authors argue that the efficient coding hypothesis, which posits that organisms seek to maximize the information about sensory input in an efficient manner, needs to account for the downstream utilization of perceptual data. They propose that a formal framework based on rate-distortion theory can provide a solution to this problem, allowing for the development of representations that are both efficient and tailored to the specific needs of the perceptual system. The study demonstrates that lossy compression, guided by rate-distortion theory, can lead to representations that capture task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour and are not in service of reconstructing the data.### MethodologyThe authors employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to model action-centric representations. The VAEs are trained to minimize the expected distortion between the input data and the reconstructed data, as defined by the rate-distortion function. The key components of the methodology include:1) the use of a VAE architecture with four convolutional layers;2) the implementation of a loss function that combines the KL divergence term with a distortion term;3) the training of the VAEs on the Fashion-MNIST dataset; and4) the evaluation of the performance of the VAEs in terms of their ability to classify images. They state: “We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data.”### ResultsThe results demonstrate that the VAEs can achieve a significant reduction in the amount of information needed to represent the data, while maintaining a high level of accuracy in downstream tasks. Specifically, the authors found that the VAEs can achieve an85% accuracy in classifying images, while using a rate of0.1 bits per sample. They note: “Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.” The study demonstrates that the lossy compression, guided by rate-distortion theory, can lead to representations that capture task-dependent invariances and are not in service of reconstructing the data. The authors also found that the VAEs are able to learn a compact latent space, which is sufficient to represent the data effectively. They state: “We find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data.”### Claims and ArgumentsThe central claim of the paper is that the efficient coding hypothesis needs to be reformulated to account for the downstream utilization of perceptual data. The authors argue that a rate-distortion theory-based approach provides a formal framework for achieving this goal. They state: “Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data.” The authors further argue that full reconstruction of the data is not necessary to achieve optimal behaviour, and that lossy compression can be a more efficient strategy. They note: “Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.”### DiscussionThe authors conclude that rate-distortion theory provides a valuable tool for understanding and designing perceptual systems. They state: “The teleological essence of the perceptual system imposes a normativity on representations: a perceptual representation is accurate if it captures the relevant information needed downstream and discards the irrelevant details.” The study highlights the importance of considering the downstream utilization of perceptual data when designing efficient coding schemes. The authors argue that a rate-distortion theory-based approach can lead to representations that are both efficient and tailored to the specific needs of the perceptual system. Under a Bayesian approach to cognition, the brain performs inference to compute an optimal posterior distribution over hidden environmental states given sensory data. As computing the true posterior is usually intractable, the brain approximates the true posterior by optimizing the variational free energy. The main conceptual contribution of rate-distortion theory is to define the “goodness” of that approximation, as computing the true posterior is not always necessary to act optimally. 

In the context of active inference, it has been shown that action-oriented models learn parsimonious representations of the environment by capturing relevant information for behaviour. 

In the same spirit, we investigate the information-theoretic properties of action-centric representations and their relation to the formal definition of abstractions we propose.
