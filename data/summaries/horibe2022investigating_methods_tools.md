## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The agent trained its generative model using the gestures of two people who were facing each other and interacting beforehand and generated gestures that took into account both its own and the other person’s movements.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “gradient descent”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “active inference and epistemic value”
*   Partial Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) (exact quote from paper) – “modelledthetime dynamics is solved by maximizing parameter likelihood”
*   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (exact quote from paper) – “trained its generative model using the gestures of two people who were facing each other and interacting beforehand and generated gestures that took into account both its own and the other person’s movements”
*   Multinomial Logistic Regression (exact quote from paper) – “multinomial logistic regression”
*   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “CNN structure, which is Fully-connected layer (On 2nd axis 56 to 48)”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy, Pandas, etc.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas, NumPy, etc.”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn”
*   OpenPose (exact quote from paper) – “OpenPose, is used to extract 2d skeleton keypoints”

## Datasets

*   Human Interaction Data (exact quote from paper) – “We gathered 8 experiment subjects and repeat 5 times each condition”
*   Custom Dataset (exact quote from paper) – “Dataset C consists of skeleton keypoints sequence of experimenters C and participants C”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “Not specified in paper”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Not specified in paper”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Not specified in paper”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “Not specified in paper”

## Software Tools and Platforms
