Okay, let's begin the extraction process based on the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper argues that efficient coding in biological systems, particularly in the brain, requires an action-centric approach rather than solely focusing on reconstructing sensory data. The authors propose that representations should be geared towards facilitating adaptive behavior, rather than simply faithfully replicating the input.

2.  **Hypothesis:** The authors hypothesize that rate-distortion theory provides a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding, allowing for the design of representations that capture the relevant information needed for action.

3.  **Claim:** Abstractions, as defined in the paper, are crucial components of action-centric representations. These abstractions are characterized by their ability to convey the necessary information to answer specific queries about the data.

4.  **Claim:** Full reconstruction of sensory data is not a necessary condition for achieving optimal behavior. The authors suggest that representations can be efficient lossy compressions of the data, focusing on the key invariances and symmetries relevant for action.

5.  **Hypothesis:** The use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a suitable framework for modeling action-centric representations, leveraging the principles of rate-distortion theory and Bayesian inference.
