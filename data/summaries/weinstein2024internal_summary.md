### An Internal Model Principle For RobotsThe authors state: "When designing a robot’s internal system, one often makes assumptions about the structure of the intended environment of the robot. One may even assign meaning to various internal components of the robot in terms of expected environmental correlates." They note: "Can the robot learn about its environment, relying only on internally available information, including the sensor data. Are there mathematical conditions on the internal robot system which can be internally verified and make the robot’s internal system mirror the structure of the environment?" The paper argues: "Sufficiency is such a mathematical principle, and mathematically describe the emergence of the robot’s internal structure isomorphic or bisimulation equivalent to that of the environment." According to the research, "A connection to the free-energy principle is established, when sufficiency is interpreted as a limit case of surprise minimization."The authors state: "The free-energy principle that we focus on is surprise minimization." They note: "The notion of sufficiency is the quintessential notion of surprise minimization in the framework of information transition systems." The paper argues: "The problem of discovering economical, predictive representations based solely on action-observation dynamics has been formalized in the theory of predictive state representations (PSR) [19,20]. Based on the earlier, deterministic framework of diversity-based inference [24], PSR suggests a way to model such systems through maintaining a vector of probabilities for the likelihood of observing certain finite-length action-observation sequences, called coretests. Maintaining a relatively low-dimensional vector of such probabilities turns out to be sufficient for effectively modelling the statistical behaviour of the unknown dynamics." The study demonstrates: "The universal exploratory system (I) in which the initial state is always the empty sequence."The authors state: "The free-energy principle that we focus on is surprise minimization." They note: "The notion of sufficiency is the quintessential notion of surprise minimization in the framework of information transition systems."
