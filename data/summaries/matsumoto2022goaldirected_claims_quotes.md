Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel model, T-GLean, that utilizes variational recurrent neural networks (VRNNs) to achieve goal-directed action planning and understanding by leveraging the free energy principle.
2.  The core hypothesis is that goal-directed action can be formulated by representing goals and their associated constraints within a VRNN framework, allowing the model to infer the current state and generate future action plans.
3.  The authors hypothesize that the model’s ability to infer unseen goals or constraints, combined with its capacity to generate plans based on observed sensory information, will enable it to perform effectively in complex environments.
4.  The authors propose that the model’s online action planning capability, generating plans in real-time while actions are being executed, distinguishes it from previous offline planning models.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the model’s ability to generalize to new goal positions and achieve precise movements is due to the model’s capacity to learn a robust representation of the environment and its dynamics.
