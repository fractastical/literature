Okay, here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors claim that active inference provides a rigorous approach to decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in autonomous robotic systems.
2.  The authors hypothesize that incorporating contextual information (e.g., user preferences, mission status) can significantly improve the efficiency of CMABs.
3.  The authors propose that active inference can be applied to CMABs by calculating the expected free energy (EFE) and incorporating a selection bias toward preferred outcomes.
4.  The authors state that the EFE term is analytically intractable for general context-dependent likelihood models, necessitating the development of approximation methods.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the variational Bayesian importance sampling (VBIS) and Laplace approximation methods can provide tractable solutions for calculating the EFE in CMAB problems.
6.  The authors claim that active inference generally requires fewer iterations to identify optimal options compared to other CMAB strategies.
7.  The authors state that active inference achieves superior cumulative regret compared to other strategies, particularly for stationary and dynamic switching MABs.
