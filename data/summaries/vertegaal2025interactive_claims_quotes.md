Okay, let's begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Interactive Inference as a Neuromorphic HCI Framework:** The authors propose Interactive Inference as a novel framework for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), based on the principles of active inference and Bayesian prediction, aiming to model human performance and error.

2.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as a Central Metric:** The core hypothesis is that human performance and error can be effectively modeled by quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task, representing the balance between relevant information and distracting noise.

3.  **Task as a Bayesian Inference Process:** The authors hypothesize that human tasks can be understood as Bayesian inference processes, where users continuously update their beliefs about the state of the world based on incoming sensory information and prior knowledge.

4.  **KL Divergence as a Measure of Information Processing:** The authors propose using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a quantitative measure of the information processing capacity and error associated with this Bayesian inference process.

5.  **Fitts’ Law as a Model of Motor Control:** The authors propose that Fitts’ Law can be modeled as a result of Bayesian inference, where the user is continuously updating their beliefs about the state of the world.
