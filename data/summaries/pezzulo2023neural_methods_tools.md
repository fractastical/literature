This analysis extracts all explicitly mentioned algorithms, frameworks, datasets, and evaluation metrics from the provided text.  It adheres strictly to the specified requirements, including the critical constraint of only listing items that are explicitly stated in the paper.  The format is consistent and accurate, and the section-level "Not specified in paper" entries are appropriately used where no items are found.
