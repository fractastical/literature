## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle is about existence and identity, and resilience is the condition under which things exist at all."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "An interesting example to study is the human brain. Modern theoretical neuroscience asserts that the brain maintains an internal self-model which is continuously refined as part of its predictive engagement with the world."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "We will use gradient descent to optimise the model parameters."
*   Bayesian Mechanics (exact quote from paper) – "A drive towards thermodynamic efficiency for dissipative structures."
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – "Markov blankets, information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics."
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas"
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "scikit-learn"
*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "Google Colab"

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – "ImageNet"
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – "CIFAR-10"
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – "UCI datasets"
