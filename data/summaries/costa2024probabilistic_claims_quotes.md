Okay, let’s begin extracting key claims and quotes from the paper.  I’ll follow the guidelines and formatting standards outlined above.

**Key Claims and Hypotheses**

*   **Main Claim:** The paper proposes a novel framework for understanding active inference in biological systems, particularly in the context of sensory-motor coordination and self-organization.
*   **Hypothesis 1:**  The active inference framework, based on variational free energy minimization, provides a powerful tool for understanding how biological systems effectively “answer” sensory questions and generate appropriate motor responses.
*   **Hypothesis 2:**  The concept of “active inference” is closely linked to the idea of self-organization, where systems spontaneously generate coherent patterns of activity in response to their environment.
*   **Hypothesis 3:**  The framework provides a testable mechanism for understanding how biological systems can effectively “learn” and adapt to their environment.
*   **Hypothesis 4:**  The variational free energy framework provides a more efficient and tractable approach to modelling complex biological systems compared to traditional methods.
