Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel “thoughtseed” framework, positing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge within the Global Workspace.
2.  The core hypothesis is that thoughtseeds—emergent, higher-order constructs—represent a fundamental unit of cognitive processing, enabling adaptive behavior through active inference.
3.  The framework posits a hierarchical organization of cognitive processes, with thoughtseeds operating across nested levels of representation (Neuronal Packet Domains, Knowledge Domains, and the Global Workspace).
4.  The authors hypothesize that the brain’s architecture reflects a “hierarchical self-organizing system” where information processing occurs through a series of nested Markov blankets.
5.  The authors propose that the brain’s architecture reflects a “hierarchical self-organizing system” where information processing occurs through a series of nested Markov blankets.

## Important Quotes
