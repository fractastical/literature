Okay, let's begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, formatted according to the requirements above:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a framework for understanding cognitive processes:** The authors propose a new model, FEPS, based on the FEP and AI, aiming to provide an interpretable representation of cognitive processes.
2.  **FEPS utilizes a Projective Simulation (PS) approach:** The model employs PS, a memory organization technique where clips represent sensory states and are connected by directed edges, to create a representation of the environment.
3.  **FEPS learns by minimizing the free energy:** The core of the model is based on the minimization of the variational free energy, which reflects the agent’s surprise about its sensory inputs.
4.  **The model learns by associating sensory states and actions:** The agent learns to associate sensory states with actions, allowing it to plan and execute actions based on its internal model of the environment.
5.  **The model can be used to solve complex behavioral tasks:** The authors demonstrate the FEPS model’s ability to solve tasks such as a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid.

## Important Quotes
