Here's a summary of the paper "Particular flows and attracting sets: A comment on "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz and Buckley," adhering to the provided instructions.### OverviewThis commentary expands on the recent article "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera et al. by studying the flow fields of linear diffusions, and particularly the rotation of their attracting sets in the presence of different types of solenoidal coupling. The authors state: “This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if internal states are performing inference about states external to the system.” The core argument is that while the FEP offers a powerful framework, the dynamics of internal states are not always directly aligned with the variational free energy gradient, particularly when solenoidal couplings are present. The authors express general agreement with the target article’s overarching result that the dynamics of the conditional modes are not representative of system-wide behaviour1.### MethodologyThe target article, "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" investigates the Free Energy Principle (hereafter: FEP) in the context of linear diffusion processes, i.e., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes [2,3]. Using this class of systems as a testbed for the FEP’s claims, the authors carefully deconstruct various assumptions and their consequences, which they claim are made (implicitly or explicitly) in the existing FEP literature [4–6,12–14]. The authors begin by analyzing linear systems that allow for non-zero solenoidal coupling between internal and blanket states, and between blanket states and external states. The authors parameterize the solenoidal matrix Q as follows: “In the top row of Figure1, one can see that particular states are attracted to a line that is misaligned with the line {(b,µ(b))}—the set at which the variational free energy is minimised [7].” The authors then use the Itô stochastic differential equation to describe the evolution of the system, as shown in Equation (1).### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that the flow of particular states f (x) under different external conditions is always pulled to a linear attracting set, but importantly, this attracting set is only aligned with the line of conditional modes µ(b) in special cases. These cases depend on the nature of solenoidal couplings. The authors show that the presence of solenoidal coupling between external and blanket states rotates the linear attracting set of particular states relative to the line of the conditional modes, but in doing so also contracts the effective volume of state space that particular states visit. This solenoidal coupling helps particular states accelerate their flow towards (and maintain their proximity to) the free energy minimum. The authors state: “This is in line with investigations into the importance of solenoidal coupling in augmenting the speed of convergence of diffusions to their steady-state [8–11], and hints at the importance of the ‘canonical’ or ‘normal’ form of the flow introduced in previous FEP literature [4,6,12,13].”### DiscussionThe authors’ analysis highlights a nuanced relationship between solenoidal coupling and the dynamics of internal states. The key finding is that while the FEP framework can be applied to stochastic systems, the internal dynamics are not always directly aligned with the variational free energy gradient, particularly when solenoidal couplings are present. 

This suggests that the FEP’s interpretation of internal states as performing inference about external states is only valid under specific conditions.

Note that this does not conflict with the central claims of the FEP.
