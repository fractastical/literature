Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a framework rooted in active inference to model decision-making in embodied agents, leveraging experiment-informed generative models. This framework aims to explain the emergent intelligence observed in biological systems like the DishBrain.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Integrating memory-based learning and predictive planning within an active inference framework will enable agents to learn and adapt effectively in dynamic environments, mirroring the adaptive behaviour of biological systems.

3.  **Claim:** The core of the research is to demonstrate that active inference, combined with a generative model informed by experimental data (specifically, the DishBrain system), can effectively simulate intelligent decision-making processes.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The design of the generative model, incorporating parameters such as risk (Γ) and the level of memory engagement, will significantly impact the agent’s performance and learning dynamics.

5.  **Claim:** The paper’s methodology centers on utilizing a counterfactual learning (CFL) approach, which relies on updating the model parameters based on observed outcomes, to improve decision-making.
