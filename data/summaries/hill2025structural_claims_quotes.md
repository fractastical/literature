Okay, let's begin the extraction process according to your detailed requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN) as a novel computational model for homeostatic control, integrating predictive inference with structural plasticity.

2.  **Hypothesis:** By endowing computational agents with the ability to physically move and reposition their cells, they can actively structure their input streams, leading to more efficient learning.

3.  **Claim:** The brain’s primary function is to construct and maintain an internal model of the world, which it uses to predict the causes of its sensory inputs.

4.  **Hypothesis:** Local learning rules, specifically Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity, combined with structural plasticity mechanisms, can enable a network to learn both how to process information and where to position its computational resources.

5.  **Claim:** The Free Energy Principle posits that biological agents act to minimize a form of prediction error or surprise, serving as a tractable upper bound on surprise.

6.  **Hypothesis:**  The brain’s spatial organization – its topographic maps – is itself a fundamental component of its computational power.
