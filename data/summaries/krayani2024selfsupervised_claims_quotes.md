Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information based on the provided paper text, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel self-supervised path-planning method for UAV-aided wireless networks based on active inference. This method aims to enable UAVs to autonomously navigate and optimize their routes.

2.  **Hypothesis:** The proposed method, utilizing a learned world model and active inference, will outperform traditional reinforcement learning approaches in terms of faster adaptation, greater stability, and improved generalization proficiency for UAV path planning.

3.  **Core Claim:** The method’s efficacy relies on learning a world model from demonstrations provided by an offline path planning optimizer. This allows the UAV to understand the environment and implicitly discover the optimizer’s policy.

4.  **Hypothesis:** By incorporating an active inference framework, the UAV can anticipate the outcomes of its actions and assess the expected surprise, leading to more robust and adaptive decision-making.

5.  **Core Claim:** The proposed method leverages “expected surprise” as a metric for scoring different policies during planning, enabling the UAV to select the most promising action based on its predicted impact.

6.  **Hypothesis:** The active inference approach will improve the UAV's ability to handle dynamic and unpredictable environments, leading to more reliable and efficient path planning.
