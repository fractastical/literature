Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the specified requirements:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a new model for surprise in the neocortex, based on the idea that the brain actively infers the cause of sensory input, rather than passively receiving it.
2.  **Hypothesis:** Similarity between objects is a fundamental cognitive capability of the neocortex, and the model can be used to explain how the brain recognizes and associates objects.
3.  **Core Claim:** The model proposes that the brain uses Bayesian inference to resolve ambiguity in sensory data, and that this inference can be implemented through algorithms operating on cortical columns.
4.  **Hypothesis:** The model’s success relies on the ability to learn associations between objects, and that this learning process can be formalized through algorithms that find similarities.
5.  **Core Claim:** The model’s key components are the cortical columns, which are organized in a hierarchical manner, and the ability to actively infer the cause of sensory input.
6.  **Hypothesis:** The model can be used to understand how the brain handles multimodal sensory information.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Jeff Hawkins and his colleagues in Numenta have proposed the thousand-brains system.
