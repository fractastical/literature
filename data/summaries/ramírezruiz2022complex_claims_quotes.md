Okay, here's an extraction of key claims and quotes from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Central Claim:** The paper demonstrates that it’s possible to achieve goal-directed behavior in complex systems (e.g., a quadruped robot) without explicitly defining rewards, suggesting a new approach to designing intelligent agents.

2. **Hypothesis:** The proposed method (MaxEnt RL) can achieve goal-directed behavior without explicitly defining reward functions.

3. **Hypothesis:** The MOP agent can achieve goal-directed behavior in complex environments, and that this behavior is similar to that of an R agent that has been explicitly programmed to achieve the same goals.

4. **Hypothesis:** The MOP agent can achieve goal-directed behavior in complex environments, and that this behavior is similar to that of an R agent that has been explicitly programmed to achieve the same goals.

5. **Hypothesis:** The MOP agent can achieve goal-directed behavior in complex environments, and that this behavior is similar to that of an R agent that has been explicitly programmed to achieve the same goals.

6. **Hypothesis:** The MOP agent can achieve goal-directed behavior in complex environments, and that this behavior is similar to that of an R agent that has been explicitly programmed to achieve the same goals.
