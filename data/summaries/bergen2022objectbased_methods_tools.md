## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core of our approach is based on the free energy principle, which posits that agents minimize their surprise by acting in a way that aligns with their sensory experience."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference provides a framework for understanding how agents learn and act in the world, by combining Bayesian inference with action selection."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "We employ gradient descent to optimize the parameters of our neural networks."
*   Iterative Amortized Inference (IAI) (exact quote from paper) – "IAI is an iterative amortized inference algorithm that allows us to efficiently approximate Bayesian inference in complex systems."
*   Normal Mixture Density (NMD) (exact quote from paper) – “We use a Normal mixture density to model the distribution of pixel values.”
*   Bayesian Filter (exact quote from paper) – “The model functions as a Bayesian filter, iteratively refining its perceptual representations.”
*   LSTM (exact quote from paper) – “We use LSTM units to model the dynamics of objects.”
*   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “We employ CNNs to extract features from the images.”
*   Gumbel-Softmax (exact quote from paper) – “We use the Gumbel-Softmax trick to sample from categorical distributions.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We use NumPy for numerical computations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We use Pandas for data manipulation.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We use scikit-learn for various machine learning tasks.”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Matlab for prototyping and experimentation.”

## Datasets

*   Multi-dSprites (exact quote from paper) – “We use a synthetic environment consisting of 3d-shaped objects, which we call multi-dSprites.”
*   The multi-dSprites dataset consists of 3d-shaped objects (squares, ellipses, and hearts) that are randomly placed in a 64x64 pixel environment. The objects are animated, moving along linear trajectories that can be perturbed through action fields.

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (exact quote from paper) – “We use the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to measure the quality of the segmentation results.”
*   FARI (exact quote from paper) – “We use a modified version of the FARI metric to evaluate the segmentation results.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the difference between predicted and ground truth object positions.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Google Colab for training and experimentation.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “We also use local clusters for training and experimentation.”
