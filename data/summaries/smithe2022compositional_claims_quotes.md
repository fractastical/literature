Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the initial extraction based on the provided text. Note that this is an iterative process – we’ll refine and expand this as we delve deeper into the paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Core Hypothesis:** The authors propose a compositional framework for active inference, aiming to provide a more rigorous and tractable approach to modeling adaptive systems, particularly those found in neuroscience.

2.  **The Central Claim:** The authors demonstrate that a suitable framework for active inference can be constructed using polynomial functors, allowing for a more precise representation of the dynamics of biological systems.

3.  **The Laplace Doctrine:** The authors propose a doctrine, termed the Laplace doctrine, which involves constructing a dynamical system whose dynamics are governed by a Gaussian distribution.

4.  **The Hebb-Laplace Doctrine:** The authors propose a doctrine, termed the Hebb-Laplace doctrine, which involves constructing a dynamical system whose dynamics are governed by a Gaussian distribution, where the parameters are learned through stochastic gradient descent.

5. **The Fundamental Assumption:** The authors assume that the dynamics of biological systems can be described by a polynomial functor.
