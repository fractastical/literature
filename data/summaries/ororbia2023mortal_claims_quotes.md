**Key Claims and Hypotheses**

*   **Claim 1:** The paper proposes a model for understanding biological systems, specifically focusing on the concept of “metabolic dependency” – that is, the idea that biological systems are driven by their internal metabolic processes.
*   **Hypothesis 1:**  A model based on metabolic processes can be used to understand and explain biological systems, particularly in the context of adaptive behavior.
*   **Claim 2:** The paper introduces a concept of “homeostatic and allostatic dependency,” suggesting that biological systems are regulated by internal feedback loops and adaptive responses to environmental changes.
*   **Hypothesis 2:**  The concept of “homeostatic and allostatic dependency” can be used to model adaptive behavior in biological systems.
*   **Claim 3:** The authors propose a framework for understanding biological systems based on the interplay between internal metabolic processes and external environmental factors.
*   **Hypothesis 3:** The framework of metabolic dependency can be used to model biological systems.
