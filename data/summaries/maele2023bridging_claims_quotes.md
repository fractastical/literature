Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, formatted according to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel hierarchical active inference model to explain spatial alternation tasks and the interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
2.  The model posits that the HC and mPFC learn cognitive maps for navigation and task space, respectively, using a common statistical learning algorithm (clone-structured cognitive graphs).
3.  The model predicts that disrupting communication between the HC and mPFC impairs difficult decisions, mirroring experimental findings.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the hierarchical active inference architecture, with reciprocal bottom-up and top-down message passing, is a key mechanism for solving spatial alternation tasks.
5.  The authors suggest that the model can explain the observed behavioral patterns in rodent spatial alternation tasks, specifically the observed “alternation,” “rotated alternation,” “back and forth,” and “circling” behaviors.
