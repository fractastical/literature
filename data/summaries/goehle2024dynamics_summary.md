Connections between this work, statistical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics have beenstudied by Friston and others [2–12] and extended to more generic biological systems [13] as well asmachine learning contexts [14]. More recently, Hein et al. [15] showed that the principle of “surpriseminimization” allows for collective behavior to arise in complex interacting systems.In this short communication, we rephrase the free energy principle in terms of free entropy, whicharises naturally from the information geometry of the Fisher metric [16–18]. This quantity and thecorresponding techniques from information geometry have been used extensively in statistical physics [19–27].Using techniques from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fishermetric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents’ beliefs. Theresulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the DeGroot dynamics. In the two-agentcase, the potential function is defined using Jeffrey’s divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized bya non-linear spring. Thesedynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori, as shown numerically toproduce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information-theoreticcontrol problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stableapproach to alter an agent’s belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND derivation of these dynamics from the free energy principle or thecorresponding “minimum surprise principle”The free energy principle was developed by Friston, rephrased as a free entropy minimization.Kilner and Harrison [1] as a thermodynamically inspired model of perception that presupposes the brainminimizes surprise (entropy) by maintaining an internal model of reality that is updated regularly throughsensory input. Using classical mechanics on manifolds, the authors define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric and a potential energy function based on agent belief stress. This results in a variation of the DeGroot dynamics. In the two-agent case, the potential is defined using Jeffrey’s divergence, leading to a non-linear spring, and the resulting dynamics produce chaotic trajectories near the system’s boundary. The authors also explore persuasion as an information-theoretic control problem, finding that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent’s belief compared to a slowly changing belief state approaching the target.
