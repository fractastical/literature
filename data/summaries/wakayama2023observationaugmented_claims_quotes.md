Okay, here’s the extracted information from the paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Main Claim:** The paper introduces a novel variant of contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) to address the challenges of incorporating external, potentially noisy, observations into robotic decision-making, particularly in remote exploration scenarios.

2. **Hypothesis:**  The proposed OA-CMAB framework, utilizing probabilistic semantic data association (PSDA) and active inference with a mixture prior, can achieve robust parameter inference and efficient decision-making even when external observations are inaccurate.

3. **Claim:** The core innovation lies in adapting the measurement update process to account for data validity uncertainties, enabling the robot to learn from both internal sensor data and external observations while mitigating the negative impact of erroneous data.

4. **Claim:** The generalized expected free energy (EFE) approach, when combined with a mixture prior and PSDA, provides a robust framework for active inference, allowing the robot to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation based on evolving uncertainty.
