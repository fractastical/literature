### OverviewThis paper investigates how the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can explain deviations from scale-free behavior in real-world networks and how these deviations emerge from constraints on information processing. The authors propose a minimal FEP model for node behavior, revealing three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents; when optimal detection occurs, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action; and when saturation effects limit the agent’s information processing capabilities. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in many real networks, explaining the signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. The study connects microscopic information processing constraints to macroscopic network structure, providing a mechanistic foundation for network formation that bridges cognitive and collective behaviour.### MethodologyIn the Introduction, the authors state: "Complex networks pervade natural and artificial systems, from cellular interactions to social relationships (Baraba´siandAlbert1999)." They note: "A commonfeature in these networksis the frequent emergence of power-law degree distributions, where the probability of a node having k connections follows P(k) k−γ (Newman2003b)." They add: "While preferential attachment has successfully described network growth, it has faced criticism for lacking mechanistic underpinning (Newman2018)." The authors then state: "Recent studies have shown that FEP can explain diverse biological phenomena, from cellular behaviour to neural organisation (Friston2013;Constantetal.2018)." The paper continues: “The principle has been successful in bridging scales of organisation, but some researchers question its universal applicability (ColomboandWright2018).” The authors state: “We developaminimalActiveInferencemodeltounderstand how simple agents learn from and interact with their environment.” The model captures two key processes: how agents update their internal beliefs about the environmental gradient’s slope (µ) and how they choose actions based on this internal belief. The model uses a Gaussian distribution for the prior belief (b) on the environmental gradient, with parameters µ and σ2, and a Gaussian distribution for the recognition density Q(b). The authors state: “The free energy F is defined as F = Q(b)ln db Q(b)lnL Obs b db.” The authors state: “The gradient of free energy with respect to µ yields the posterior mean belief µ.” The authors state: “We use a linear relationship between detection statistics and the environmental gradient.” The authors state: “This creates a relationship: larger clusters generate stronger detection statistics, leading to more precise belief and movement accuracy.” The authors state: “These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining the signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints.”### ResultsThe authors state: “When detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment.” The authors state: “In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale.” The authors state: “Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent’s information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth.” The authors state: “These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining themasignaturesofagentswithoptimalinformationprocessingunderconstraints.” The authors state: “The degree distribution reflects the interplay between these regimes.” The authors state: “When detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment.” The authors state: “In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale.” The authors state: “Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent’s information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth.” The authors state: “These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining themasignaturesofagentswithoptimalinformationprocessingunderconstraints.”### DiscussionThe authors state: “The free energy principle provides an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing.” The authors state: “We show that agentsevolvingunderFEPprinciplesprovidesamechanismforpreferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-worldnetworks.” The authors state: “The analysis focuses on the knee-shaped degree distribution, which is a characteristic feature of many real networks.” The authors state: “The knee-shaped degree distribution reflects the interplay between these regimes.” The authors state: “The free energy principle provides an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing.” The authors state: “We show that agentsevolvingunderFEPprinciplesprovidesamechanismforpreferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-worldnetworks.” The authors state: “The analysis focuses on the knee-shaped degree distribution, which is a characteristic feature of many real networks.” The authors state: “The free energy principle provides an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing.” The authors state: “We show that agentsevolvingunderFEPprinciplesprovidesamechanismforpreferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-worldnetworks.” The authors state: “
