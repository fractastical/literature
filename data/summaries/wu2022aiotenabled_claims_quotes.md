## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "An autonomousArtificialInternetofThings(AIoT) data via sensors and send various types of reminders to roommates or medical teams via actuators."
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the core functionality of the system – autonomous data collection and targeted alerts.

**Quote:** "Specifically, CASAS [1] dataset is employed to monitor the disease’s progression and provide an interface, and this work will focus on the”PythonwithinWatsonStudio”"
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** Identifies the CASAS dataset as the foundation for the research and highlights the use of Watson Studio.

**Quote:** “Random Forest (RF) [11] because of its high accuracy, flexibility (suitable for different data distributions), interpretability, and low running time complexitiy.”
**Context:** Methodology - RF
**Significance:** Justifies the choice of Random Forest as the preferred machine learning model.

**Quote:** “To train an ML model in a supervised way, the activity statistical data items are supposed to label with “normal” or “abnormal”. Z-score, a popular statistical method for abnormal data detection, is mainly utilized here to determine the abnormal quantitative attributes of frequency and time span.”
**Context:** Methodology - Abnormal Activity Detection
**Significance:** Details the methodology for detecting abnormal activity using Z-score.

**Quote:** “To determine this memory’s state c , an LSTM unit takes the previous memory state c and performs element-wise multiplication with the forget−gate f.
