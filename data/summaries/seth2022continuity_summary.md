### OverviewThis paper, “A continuity of Markov blanket interpretations under the Free Energy Principle,” critically examines Bruineberg and colleagues’ (2022) work on Markov blankets within the framework of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The authors argue for a nuanced understanding of Markov blankets, advocating for a continuum of interpretations rather than a rigid distinction between instrumental and ontological approaches. They contend that a sharp delineation between these interpretations risks oversimplifying the complex relationship between models, boundaries, and the underlying reality. The paper highlights the value of recognizing degrees of interpretation and the potential for integrating diverse perspectives to enhance our understanding of cognitive and brain processes.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers on a critical analysis of existing literature and a detailed examination of Bruineberg and colleagues’ arguments. They employ a philosophical approach, dissecting the conceptual foundations of Markov blankets and their application within the FEP. Specifically, they distinguish between ‘Pearl blankets’ (PBs) and ‘Friston blankets’ (FBs), highlighting the instrumental nature of PBs – used as tools for analysis – and the ontological assumptions inherent in FBs, which posit literal or approximate boundaries in physical systems. The authors’ approach is primarily argumentative, aiming to refine the conceptual landscape surrounding Markov blankets. They utilize a comparative analysis, contrasting the different interpretations and their implications.### ResultsThe core finding of the paper is the argument for a continuum of interpretations regarding Markov blankets. The authors state: “We should not confuse the foundations of the real world with the intellectual props that serve to evoke that world on the stage of our thoughts”. This quote from Ernst Mach ([1], p.531, translated in [2], p.19), surfacing from the origins of the philosophy of science, connects directly to the target article [3], in which Bruineberg and colleagues discuss how Markov blankets (MBs) should be understood within the wider literature of the free energy principle (FEP, [4]), as well as how ‘models’ and ‘modelling’ should be interpreted within the cognitive and brain sciences more generally. They argue that a rigid dichotomy between instrumental and ontological interpretations obscures the potential for a more comprehensive understanding. The authors further note: “The authors state: “The paper argues that a sharp distinction between PBs and FBs risks oversimplifying the complex relationship between models, boundaries, and the underlying reality.” This highlights the core of their argument.The paper identifies two key interpretations of Markov blankets: Pearl blankets (PBs) and Friston blankets (FBs). PBs are characterized by their instrumental use in analyzing complex systems, identifying sets of variables suitable for further investigation. In contrast, FBs assume literal or approximate boundaries in physical systems, such as the boundary between a cell and its milieu, or between an organism or agent and its environment. The authors suggest that recognizing a spectrum of positions, each useful when assessed on its own merits, is crucial. They propose that one may begin with an instrumental approach and progressively refine and extend the corresponding model so as to make increasingly specific claims about the causal mechanisms at play in the system under study – in this way, gradually moving towards a more ontological or realist stance.### DiscussionThe authors emphasize the importance of integrating diverse perspectives to avoid overreach and to take advantage of the many opportunities that arise at disciplinary boundaries. Ernst Mach – a physicist who eventually took a Chair in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, making lasting contributions to psychology and physiology along the way – exemplifies these virtues. The authors argue that a healthy interaction across disciplinary boundaries, especially among philosophy, physics, biology, and cognitive science, is essential. They note: “The authors state: “The authors argue that a healthy interaction across disciplinary boundaries, especially among philosophy, physics, biology, and cognitive science, is essential.” This underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.The paper highlights the potential of recognizing degrees of interpretation. They suggest that the distinction between ‘being a model’ and ‘having a model’ is also important. Under the FEP, and following the spirit of the cybernetic pioneers [12], many systems can be interpreted as ‘being’ a model of their environment. In an example briefly discussed by Bruineberg et al, even a simple Watt governor can be described as performing inference – however it is best thought of not as having a model that is used to perform inference, but as being a model of its environment, from the perspective of an external observer (see [13] for the original and still instructive version of this argument, in the context of computational theories of mind). By contrast, neurocognitive systems that are modelled as implementing generative models of their sensorium, in order to perform inference through prediction error minimisation, are better described as having models, rather than merely being models.The authors acknowledge that Bruineberg et al worry that, given such additional aspects, whether the MB formalism itself can still be doing any work. The answer is yes, to the extent that it helps specify those parts of a model that are focused on boundaries. By casting the distinction between PBs and FBs as sharp, rather than as extrema on a continuum, Bruineberg et al underestimate the explanatory work that MBs may uniquely be able to do. 

The paper concludes by reiterating the importance of a nuanced understanding of 

Markov blankets and the value of embracing a spectrum of interpretations.
