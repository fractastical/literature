## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework that combines Bayesian inference with a generative model to predict the state of the world and to control the agent’s actions”
*   Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “The framework combines multiple objectives into a single optimization problem”
*   Temporal Logic (exact quote from paper) – “The temporal logic is used to specify the task requirements”
*   Deterministic Finite Automaton (exact quote from paper) – “The DFA is used to capture the temporal attributes”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is used for object recognition”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is used for image classification”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “UCI datasets are used for benchmarking”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The accuracy of the robot is evaluated by comparing the predicted actions with the ground truth”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “The F1-score is used to evaluate the performance of the robot”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “The precision is used to evaluate the performance of the robot”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “The recall is used to evaluate the performance of the robot”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The MSE is used to evaluate the performance of the robot”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms
