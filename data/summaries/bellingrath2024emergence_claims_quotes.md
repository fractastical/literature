Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  “The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the ‘width’ of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling.” (Introduction) – This claim establishes the central theoretical framework of the paper: that subjective time perception arises from a self-modeling process.

2.  “The free-energy principle posits that self-organizing systems, or things, must ‘maintain their states and form in the face of a constantly changing environment’ (Friston 2010).” (Introduction) – This statement outlines the foundational principle driving the paper’s approach: the free-energy principle.

3.  “The intentional binding effect (i.e. the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) is a ‘bias’ that naturally emerges from the simulated computational model.” (Results) – This identifies one of the key empirically observed biases arising from the model.

4.  “The ‘width’ of subjective temporality is, in essence, the ‘distance’ between the moment of voluntary action and the subsequent sensory consequence.” (Results) – This provides a concise definition of the core concept of “width” of subjective temporality.

5.  “The model predicts that the subjective temporal ‘Now’ is extended not only in a ‘cognitive’, or opaque, sense, but also in an immediate, transparent, felt sense.” (Results) – This highlights the dual nature of the temporal experience, encompassing both cognitive and phenomenological aspects.

6.  “The model predicts that the subjective temporal ‘Now’ is extended not only in a ‘cognitive’, or opaque, sense, but also in an immediate, transparent, felt sense.” (Results) – This highlights the dual nature of the temporal experience, encompassing both cognitive and phenomenological aspects.
