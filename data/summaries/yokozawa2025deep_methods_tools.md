## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that an agent’s brain minimizes the free energy, which is the difference between the agent’s internal model of the world and the actual world” – mentioned in Section 2.1.
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a unified framework for explaining perception, learning, and action by minimizing the free energy” – mentioned in Section 2.1.
*   Diffusion Policy (exact quote from paper) – “A diffusion policy is a generative model that learns to sample candidate action sequences” – mentioned in Section 3.1.
*   Multiple Timescale Recurrent State-Space Model (MTRSSM) (exact quote from paper) – “The MTRSSM is a hierarchical model that captures dynamics at multiple timescales” – mentioned in Section 3.2.
