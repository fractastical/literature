Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Core Claim:** Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering.

2. **Hypothesis:** The “Era of Experience” – where agents learn from self-generated data – is achievable only if agents can autonomously form, evaluate, and adapt objectives, a capability lacking in current AI systems.

3. **Central Argument:** The fundamental limitation of contemporary AI lies in its inability to intrinsically motivate itself, relying instead on externally defined rewards.

4. **Proposed Solution:** AIF, by minimizing free energy, offers a unified Bayesian objective that naturally balances exploration and exploitation, eliminating the need for continuous reward engineering.

5. **Key Insight:** The success of agents like AlphaZero demonstrates the potential of AIF to achieve superhuman performance through self-play, highlighting the importance of internal, goal-directed learning.

6. **Central Argument:** The current AI landscape is dominated by “externalized cognition,” where human judgment and oversight are essential for guiding AI systems, creating a dependency that hinders true autonomy.
