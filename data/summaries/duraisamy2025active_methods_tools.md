## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The system seeks to minimize its free energy, which is a measure of its internal inconsistency"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for modeling the relationship between internal models and external reality”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is used to optimize the model parameters”
*   PCA (exact quote from paper) – “Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data”
*   Bayesian Optimization (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian optimization is used to efficiently search the parameter space”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis”
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – “Matplotlib is used for data visualization”

## Datasets

*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes”
*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet dataset, consisting of 1.2 million images across 1000 categories”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The accuracy of the model on the test set”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “The precision of the model, which measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “The recall of the model, which measures the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The mean squared error, which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the experiments”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “A local cluster of computers is used for training the model”
