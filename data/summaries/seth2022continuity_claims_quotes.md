Okay, here’s the extraction of key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Continuity of Interpretations:** The authors argue for a continuum of interpretations of Markov blankets, moving from instrumental (Pearl blankets) to ontological (Friston blankets), rather than a strict dichotomy.
2.  **Model Refinement:** The paper proposes that models can be progressively refined and extended to incorporate increasingly specific aspects of boundaries, ultimately moving towards a more ontological stance.
3.  **“Being” vs. “Having” a Model:** The authors distinguish between “being” a model (a system performing inference) and “having” a model (a system possessing a representation), highlighting the importance of this distinction for understanding cognitive phenomena.
4.  **Methodological Value of the MB Framework:** The paper asserts that the Markov blanket framework retains explanatory value even when incorporating additional philosophical assumptions or technical constraints.
5.  **Critical Examination of Literalist Readings:** The authors challenge overly literal interpretations of Friston blankets, advocating for a more nuanced approach.

## Important Quotes

1.  "We should not confuse the foundations of the real world with the intellectual props that serve to evoke that world on the stage of our thoughts.” This quote from Ernst Mach ([1], p.531, translated in [2], p.19), surfacing from the origins of the philosophy of science, connects directly to the target article [3], in which Bruineberg and colleagues discuss how Markov blankets (MBs) should be understood within the wider literature of the free energy principle (FEP, [4]), as well as how ‘models’ and ‘modelling’ should be interpreted within the cognitive and brain sciences more generally. (Context: Abstract) – *This quote establishes the foundational philosophical context for the paper’s argument.*

2.  "PBs embody an instrumental approach, in which MBs are used as tools to aid the analysis of complex systems, for example by identifying sets of variables suitable for further investigation.” (Context: Discussion of Pearl Blankets) – *This quote defines the instrumental interpretation of Markov blankets.*

3.  "What does ‘refine and extend’ mean? It could mean equipping the model with additional features that represent potentially important and context-specific aspects of the relevant boundaries, such as autopoetic (self-producing) processes for biological boundaries [5, 6], and embodied and embedded interactions for cognitive boundaries [7, 8], and a recognition of the limited degree to which statistical identification of a MB might generalise to nonequilibrium systems [9, 10]." (Context: Discussion of Model Refinement) – *This quote details the specific strategies for refining and extending models.*

4.  "The authors state: "Bruineberg and colleagues reveal the dangers of conflating these two interpretations, in particular when an instrumental (PB) application is implicitly or explicitly taken to justify ontological (FB) conclusions.” (Context: Discussion of Pearl and Friston Blankets) – *This quote highlights the core argument about the potential for misinterpretation.*

5.  “Many systems can be interpreted as ‘being’ a model of their environment.” (Context: Discussion of “Being” vs. “Having” a Model) – *This is the foundational statement of the “being a model” concept.*

6.  “In an example briefly discussed by Bruineberg et al, even a simple Watt governor can be described as performing inference – however it is best thought of not as having a model that is used to perform inference, but as being a model of its environment, from the perspective of an external observer (see [13] for the original and still instructive version of this argument, in the context of computational theories of mind).” (Context: Discussion of “Being” vs. “Having” a Model) – *This provides a concrete example illustrating the “being a model” concept.*

7.  “The authors state: "The same reasoning can be applied to the distinction between ‘being a model’ and ‘having a model’ – a distinction which Bruineberg et al mention, but only in passing (see also [11]).” (Context: Discussion of “Being” vs. “Having” a Model) – *This quote reiterates the importance of the “being” vs. “having” distinction.*

8.  “The authors state: "By casting the distinction between PBs and FBs as sharp, rather than as extrema on a continuum, Bruineberg et al underestimate the explanatory work that MBs may uniquely be able to do.” (Context: Discussion of Pearl and Friston Blankets) – *This highlights the critical assessment of Bruineberg et al’s approach.*

9.  “The authors state: "A physicist who eventually took a Chair in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, making lasting contributions to psychology and physiology along the way – exemplifies these virtues.” (Context: Acknowledgements) – *This quote provides a relevant example of a multidisciplinary thinker.*

10. “The authors state: "Many systems can be interpreted as ‘being’ a model of their environment.” (Context: Discussion of “Being” vs. “Having” a Model) – *This is the foundational statement of the “being a model” concept.*
