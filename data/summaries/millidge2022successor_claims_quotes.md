Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations, offering significant advantages over standard active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost.
2.  The core hypothesis is that successor representations provide a more efficient and flexible way to represent value functions compared to traditional Bayesian filtering approaches within active inference.
3.  The paper argues that successor representations can be directly integrated with standard active inference methods, leading to a new agent architecture (SR-AIF).
4.  The authors hypothesize that the successor representation allows for the dynamic computation of the value function, even as the reward function changes, without requiring substantial experience.
5.  The paper posits that successor representations can be used to effectively represent the value function of an expected free energy (EFE) and can be used to dynamically trade-off exploration and exploitation at runtime.
6.  The authors claim that the successor representation can be treated as a linear representation of the optimal control problem, mirroring the duality between control and estimation.

## Important Quotes

"Recent work Millidge, Tschantz, Seth and Buckley (2020) has uncovered close links between active inference and the framework of control as inference, which shows how many classical reinforcement learning algorithms can be understood as performing Bayesian inference to infer optimal actions Attias (2003); Levine (2018); Rawlik (2013); Toussaint(2009)." – *In the Introduction, the authors state: "This highlights the potential for a more efficient approach to value function estimation."*

"The successor representation (SR) Dayan (1993) provides an alternative way to estimate the value function, instead of directly estimating it." – *In the Introduction, the authors state: "This represents a key departure from traditional Bayesian filtering approaches."*

"We show how SR-AIF has significant computational complexity benefits over standard AIF and that, moreover, the explicit generative model in AIF enables the SR to be computed instantly without requiring substantial experience in the environment." – *In the Results section, the authors state: "This demonstrates the potential for SR-AIF to scale to larger problems."*

"In a special class of MDPs known as linearly solvable MDPs there is a general duality between control and inference Todorov (2008, 2009) such that control can be cast as a Bayesian filtering problem where the value functioncorresponds totheposterior." – *In the Discussion section, the authors state: “This provides a theoretical foundation for the SR approach.”*
