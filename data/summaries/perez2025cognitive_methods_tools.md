## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference combines the Bayesian brain hypothesis with reinforcement learning to model perception, learning, and decision-making"
*   Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) (exact quote from paper) – “The DDM is a computational model of decision-making that assumes decisions are made by accumulating evidence over time”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function”
*   Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (exact quote from paper) – “The Bayesian Brain Hypothesis frames cognitive processes as inferences based on prior beliefs and current evidence”
*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm in which an agent learns to maximize a reward signal”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions”
*   Prediction Error (exact quote from paper) – “Prediction error is the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a Python library for data analysis”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is a numerical computing environment”

## Datasets

*   Two-Step Task Dataset (exact quote from paper) – “The dataset consists of 24 participants performing the two-step task”
*   The dataset was made available by [17]

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Reaction Time (RT) (exact quote from paper) – “RT is the time taken to respond to a stimulus”
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correct responses”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were conducted on local clusters”

## Not specified in paper
*   No other software tools or platforms are explicitly mentioned in the paper.
