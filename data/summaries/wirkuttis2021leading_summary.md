### OverviewThis paper investigates dyadic robot imitative interaction using the active inference framework. The authors state: “action intention” and “belief” can be formulated as a predictive model. “Action intention” is considered a top-down prediction of action outcomes and “belief” as an estimated precision of this prediction or the strength of intention (as described in [2], [15]). Analogous to PC and AIF, Ito and Tani showed that imitative interaction can be performed using an RNN model by minimizing the prediction error instead of free energy in order to update deterministic latent variables [13]. However, this deterministic model does not account for the belief of action intention because the precision of prediction cannot be estimated. On a related topic, Ahmadi and Tani developed predictive-coding inspired variational RNN (PV-RNN) [16]. Their model was used to investigate how the strength of top-down intention in predicting fluctuating temporal patterns was modulated, depending on learning conditions in the model. Ahmadi and Tani found that softer regulation of the complexity term during network training develops strong top-down intention. Predictions are more deterministic by self-organizing deterministic dynamics with the initial sensitivity characteristics in the network. Likewise, tighter regulation of the complexity term results in weaker intention and increased stochasticity. Compared to other neural network models based on the FEP [17], [18], [19], [20], PV-RNN has advantages when applied to problems in robotics. It can cope with temporal structure by using recurrence associated with stochastic latent variables and by hierarchical abstraction through a multiple timescale structure [21].### MethodologyThe authors state: “In simulation experiments of dyadic robot imitative interaction, we examine how a leader and a follower can be determined in conflicting situations by investigating the underlying network dynamics.” They note: “The generative model is used for prior generation to make future predictions.” The paper argues: “The inference model for the posterior is described as: Q φ (z t |d˜ t−1 ,e t:T )=N(z t ;µq t ,σ t q)”, where µq t is tanh(Aµ) and σq t is exp(Aσ). The authors state: “The learningprocessinferstheposteriorto the posterior inference window”. One essential element of the model is the introduction of a parameter w, the so-called meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. Different w settings result in alternation of the estimated precision in predicting the sensation, as described later as prior generation (see section III-C). The model is also characterised by employing an architecture of multiple timescale RNN (MTRNN) [21]. The whole network comprises multiple layers of RNNs wherein the dynamics of each layer are governed by different time constant parameters τ. This scheme supports development of hierarchical information processing by adequately setting the timescale of each layer [21],[14].Thisapproachisconsidered as analogous to [24], [25].### ResultsThe
