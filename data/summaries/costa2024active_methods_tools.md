## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle is a descriptive framework for action and perception, providing a unified account of how biological agents interact with their environment.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in neuroscience [13–17], RL [18–21] and robotics [22–25].”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm is based on gradient descent, which is a standard optimization technique.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in neuroscience [13–17], RL [18–21] and robotics [22–25].”
*   POMDP (Partial Observable Markov Decision Process) (exact quote from paper) – “The prediction model is typically a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “The expected free energy functional is defined as −logP(a |h )=E [logP(s|a ,h )−logP(s,o|h )]”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The Markov blanket of a node in a Bayesian network is the set of its parents and children.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for numerical computation.”

## Datasets

*   T-Maze (exact quote from paper) – “The T-Maze environment is a standard benchmark for evaluating active inference algorithms.”
*   The T-Maze environment is a standard benchmark for evaluating active inference algorithms.

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were run on a local cluster of computers.”
