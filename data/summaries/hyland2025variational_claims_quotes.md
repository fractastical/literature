Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and quotes from the provided research paper, “On the Variational Costs of Changing Our Minds.”

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper argues that apparent “irrationalities” in human belief updating – such as confirmation bias and polarized attitudes – are not inherent flaws but adaptive responses driven by the significant practical and cognitive costs associated with revising beliefs.

2.  **Hypothesis:** A formal variational cost model can be developed to represent the influence of these costs on belief updating mechanisms.

3.  **Central Finding:** Belief updating is best understood as a motivated variational decision-making process, where agents weigh the “utility” of a belief against the “informational cost” required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

4.  **Key Contribution:** The paper proposes a framework for modeling belief change that integrates pragmatic considerations (utility) and cognitive constraints (KL divergence), offering a more holistic account of belief updating.

5.  **Further Hypothesis:** The model can qualitatively emulate common phenomena like confirmation bias and attitude polarization.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Human reason is both biased and lazy. Biased because it overwhelmingly finds justifications and arguments that support the reasoner’s point of view, lazy because reason makes little effort to assess the quality of the justifications and arguments it produces.” (Mercier and Sperber, 2017, p. 9) [35].
    *   **Context:** Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This quote establishes the foundational argument – that human belief updating is not necessarily irrational but rather a consequence of cognitive limitations and a preference for confirmation.

2.  “According to this model, beliefs are updated not purely based on their accuracy, but are associated with a utility.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  In the discussion of the variational cost functional.
    *   **Significance:** This highlights the central concept of introducing utility into the model, shifting the focus from purely Bayesian accuracy to a more nuanced consideration of the agent’s motivations.

3.  “We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weight the perceived ‘utility’ of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This clearly articulates the core theoretical framework – the use of variational inference to model belief updating, incorporating both utility and informational cost.

4.  “The primary contribution is the proposal of a variational cost functional for belief revision that models the influence of pragmatic affordances and cognitive costs on human belief updating.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This summarizes the paper’s key contribution – the development of a formal model that integrates pragmatic and cognitive factors.

5.  “In particular, we propose to explore how a confirmation bias can be explained through the lens of this model.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  Results
    *   **Significance:** This indicates the paper’s intention to demonstrate how the model can qualitatively replicate observed phenomena like confirmation bias.

6.  “The utility of holding a belief is derived from the outcomes it leads to, which can be internal (emotional comfort, positive feelings) or external (acceptance within a community, job opportunities).” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  Discussion
    *   **Significance:** This expands on the definition of “utility,” highlighting the diverse motivations driving belief maintenance.

7. “We propose to explore how different combinations of evidence—confirmatory versus contradictory—affect the agent’s belief updating process.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:** Results
    *   **Significance:** This indicates the experimental design and the key variables being investigated.

8. “The free energy principle makes it possible to explain how agents can maintain beliefs that are not necessarily accurate, but that are nevertheless useful.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:** Discussion
    *   **Significance:** This connects the model to the broader Free Energy Principle and its implications for understanding cognitive processes.

9. “The KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions, quantifying the amount of information needed to transform one distribution into the other.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:**  Methodology/Technical Discussion
    *   **Significance:** This provides a technical definition of a key component of the model.

10. “The model can serve as a stepping stone towards developing general frameworks that explain not just isolated sources of non-Bayesian belief updating, but also the inherent trade-offs between competing considerations associated with changing our minds.” (The authors state: "…")
    *   **Context:** Discussion
    *   **Significance:** This outlines the broader ambition of the research – to create a more comprehensive theory of belief updating.
