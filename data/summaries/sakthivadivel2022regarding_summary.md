### OverviewThis summary analyzes Dalton A R Sakthivadivel’s “Regarding Flows Under the Free Energy Principle: A Comment on “How Particular is the Physics of the Free Energy Principle?” by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz, and Buckley.” The paper investigates the core argument of the original critique, which posits that the Free Energy Principle (FEP), when applied in its conventional state-based formulation, is uninformative about the dynamics of many physical systems. This summary extracts key quotes, identifies central claims, and summarizes the paper’s findings, emphasizing the proposed shift towards a path-based model as a potential solution to the identified limitations.### MethodologySakthivadivel’s commentary centers on the authors’ assertion that the FEP, in its standard state-based formulation, fails to adequately describe the behavior of linear systems. The paper highlights the original authors’ concern regarding the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, stating: “In [AMTB22, section3.2], the authors discuss how the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, respectively, are uniformative about a linear system’s behaviour.” This observation is supported by Figure5 of the target paper, which demonstrates a “poor correlation between system dynamics and marginal dynamics,” leading to the conclusion that the FEP is a “poor descriptor of the system.” The authors’ approach involves a critical examination of the assumptions underlying the FEP’s state-based formulation, specifically the reliance on gradients and marginal flows. As the authors note, “The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”### ResultsThe primary finding of Sakthivadivel’s commentary is the proposed solution: a shift towards a path-based formulation of the FEP. The paper argues that this approach, incorporating dynamical trajectories, offers a more robust and accurate description of physical systems, particularly linear systems. The authors state: “One might expect path-based descriptions to be superior to state-based ones for one simple reason: maximum calibre is asymptotically maximum entropy.” This “laconic statement” reveals a fundamental observation: systems in non-equilibrium regimes, where fluctuations do not obey ensemble properties, are best described by probabilities over the possible trajectories of the system. The paper further elaborates on this point, noting that this approach is referred to as the “principle of maximum calibre” by Jaynes. The authors also highlight the relevance of path integral methods, stating: “Besides maximum calibre, the evolution of diffusing systems in non-stationary regimes is famously solved backwards by the path integral.” The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the system’s evolution over time, rather than its instantaneous state.### DiscussionSakthivadivel’s commentary focuses on the methodological implications of the original critique. The paper argues that the FEP’s state-based formulation, by focusing on gradients and marginal flows, fails to capture the essential dynamics of systems, particularly linear systems. The authors’ argument is summarized as: “The authors note that free energy is not a useful quantity to describe simple systems, and that it will be even more difficult to use the FEP insightfully in the more complicated systems which are of interest to the FEP.” The paper suggests that the path-based approach, centered on the concept of “maximum calibre,” offers a more accurate and nuanced description of these systems. The authors also point to the importance of considering the system’s evolution over time, stating: “Here, the paths-based view clarifies the role of non-stationary dynamics in the FEP.”### Key Quotes1.“In [AMTB22, section3.2], the authors discuss how the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, respectively, are uniformative about a linear system’s behaviour.”2.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”3.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”4.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”5.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”6.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”7.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”8.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”9.“The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”10. “The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”11. “One might expect path-based descriptions to be superior to state-based ones for one simple reason: maximum calibre is asymptotically maximum entropy.”12. “The authors note that free energy is not a useful quantity to describe simple systems, and that it will be even more difficult to use the FEP insightfully in the more complicated systems which are of interest to the FEP.”### 

Conclusion

Sakthivadivel’s commentary provides a critical assessment of the original critique, highlighting the limitations of the FEP’s state-based formulation and proposing a shift towards a path-based model as a potential solution. 

The paper’s findings underscore the importance of considering the system’s evolution over time, rather than its instantaneous state, and emphasizes the relevance of concepts like “maximum calibre” and path integrals. 

The summary demonstrates that the core argument of the original critique—that the FEP is uninformative about the dynamics of many physical systems—is supported by the proposed path-based approach.
