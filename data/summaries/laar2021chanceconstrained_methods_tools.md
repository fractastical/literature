## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle postulates that perception and action in biological agents minimize a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference is a neuroscience-based theory that has been used extensively to explain behavior of biological agents in dynamic environments."
*   Bethe Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – "The Bethe free energy is an information-theoretic measure that bounds the current and the future expected statistical surprise, i.e., how unpredictable are the observations under a given generative model."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The optimization is performed using gradient descent."
*   Variational Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – "Several widely used message passing algorithms, including (loopy) belief propagation, variational message passing and expectation propagation can be derived as fixed-point equations of the (Bethe) free energy."
*   T-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
