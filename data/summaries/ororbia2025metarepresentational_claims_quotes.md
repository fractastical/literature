Okay, let's begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, following the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel self-supervised learning framework called meta-representational predictive coding (MPC), which leverages cross-circuit predictions to acquire distributed representations of sensory input without explicit generative modeling.
2.  MPC operates by constructing a hierarchical neural architecture with multiple streams (foveal, parafoveal, and peripheral) that predict each other’s activity, effectively learning to “fill in the gaps” in sensory information.
3.  The core hypothesis is that by predicting representations across streams, MPC can acquire more robust and generalizable representations of sensory data compared to traditional generative models.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the dynamic interaction between streams, driven by predictive coding, will lead to a more efficient and biologically plausible representation learning process.
