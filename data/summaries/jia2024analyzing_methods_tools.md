Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   PCA (exact quote from paper) – “Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality”
*   Deep Learning (exact quote from paper) – “neural network architecture for feature extraction”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “machine learning library for model training and evaluation”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “deep learning framework for model implementation”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “large-scale image dataset for object recognition”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “small-scale image dataset for image classification”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “various datasets for machine learning tasks”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “percentage of correctly classified samples”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “harmonic mean of precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “ratio of true positives to all predicted positives”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “ratio of true positives to all actual positives”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “statistical measure of the average difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “cloud-based platform for running code”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services for cloud computing”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “numerical computing environment”
*   R (exact quote from paper) – “statistical computing language”
