Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive stream processing on edge devices using Active Inference (AIF), demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.
2.  **Hypothesis:** AIF can dynamically optimize the configuration of stream processing services on edge devices, ensuring QoS requirements are consistently met.
3.  **Claim:** The core of AIF lies in its ability to predict sensory information to minimize surprise, thereby guiding actions towards desired outcomes.
4.  **Claim:** The paper demonstrates that AIF agents can learn causal relationships between system variables and SLO fulfillment, leading to improved decision-making.
5.  **Claim:** The AIF agent’s iterative action-perception cycle, combined with its generative model, allows it to converge to optimal service configurations.

## Important Quotes

1.  “The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it.” (Abstract) - *This quote establishes the problem context and the need for new solutions.*
2.  “In cases where ML training and inference are carried out in close proximity to the data source, i.e., on edge devices, AIF can ensure model accuracy whenever the accuracy drops.” (Section 2.2) - *This highlights the core benefit of AIF – maintaining accuracy in edge environments.*
3.  “The free energy principle and Active Inference (AIF) are based on the idea that cognitive agents constantly predict and evaluate sensory information to decrease long-term surprise.” (Section 2.2) - *This provides the foundational theoretical basis for the approach.*
4.  “The generative model consists of two combined components: a directed graph that expresses variable relations, and the conditional probabilities of the variables” (Section 2.2) - *This describes the key components of the AIF agent’s generative model.*
5.  “The agent uses causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor.” (Section 4.3) - *This describes the agent’s learning process.*
6.  “The agent follows an action-perception cycle where it first estimates which parameter assignments would violate SLOs, then compares this expectation with new observations, and finally adjusts its beliefs accordingly.” (Section 4.3) - *This details the core operational cycle of the AIF agent.*
7.  “To minimize EFE through optimal action, agents consider the known concepts of either (1) changing the environment toward its preferences to maximize pragmatic value or (2) improving decision-making by resolving contextual information to maximize information gain.” (Section 4.3) - *This explains the dual optimization criteria of the agent.*
8.  “The agent uses causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor.” (Section 4.3) - *This reiterates the agent’s learning process.*
