Although this model has been widely studied andeven computational models are presented, but, due to various limits and inefficiencies in thegeneration of different types of knowledge, its application is limited to semantic knowledgebecause of has been formed according to semantic memory and declarative knowledge andhas many limits in explaining various procedural and conditional knowledge. Given the im-portance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areasof improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existingmodels in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great impor-tance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchersproposedamodelforgeneratingthreetypesofdeclarative,procedural,andconditionalknowl-edge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute andgenerate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perceptionprocess(activeinference).

Atthesametime,findingappropriatemodelsforknowledgegenerationbythebraincanpavethewayfortherealizationofintelligentmachinesthat,unsupervised,cangenerateknowledgeand use it in processes related to their cognitive features and functional goals.Human knowledge is formed based on the contents of its memory, therefore, given the functionof memory and different features of knowledge, human knowledge can be classified into threecategories: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and conditional knowledge. Declarativeknowledge is about what a phenomenon or object is, and procedural knowledge is about howthingsaredone. Conditionalknowledgeleadstoguidingapersoninapplyingbothdeclarativeandprocedural knowledge [1,22,32,51].Various models for knowledge generation are mostly focused on one or at most two categoriesof knowledge. In addition, the process of knowledge generation in the existing proposed modelsis more descriptive and lacks computational steps or process analysis that can be converted intocomputational algorithms. At the same time, no model can address all three types of knowledgein an integrated manner. One of the most important and widely used models is the semanticnetworks model, which provides a model for generating semantic knowledge using the relationshipbetween concepts. This model refers only to the generation of declarative knowledge and there isvery limited information on procedural or conditional knowledge generation and expression. Themodelofsemanticnetworksisbasedonsemanticmemoryanddespitetheadvancesthathavebeenmade to compute it; it has many limitations in providing a computational model for generatingprocedural or conditional knowledge.Thecurrentpaperpresentsamodelforthegenerationofdeclarativeknowledge thatsimultaneouslysupports, analyzes, and generates procedural and conditional knowledge computationally. Theproposed model takes into account concepts, the relationship between concepts, and the featuresorstimuli of concepts generators. Conceptsorobjectsarethesmallestunitofdeclarativeknowledgeformation in a semantic network structure or knowledge generation. This model is based on thefree energy principle (FEP) in the brain, which shows the process of generating concepts fromstimuli [5,22]. For this purpose, while reviewing the FEP model and examining its variables, themodel has been adapted in a way that can show how to generate different types of knowledge.Finally, a model is presented that, while being able to compute different types of knowledge, canalso show the process of knowledge generation. This model shows the process of learning andupdating knowledge and generating concepts under different conditions such as meaning-makingusingstimuli, executiveandproceduralfunctions, aswellastheacquisitionofexecutiveskills[19].In terms of computation or modeling, this model uses the inference attribute of the human mindto generate concepts by receiving sensory stimuli [23].2 Semantic memory and the formation of semanticDeclarativeknowledgeistheresultofthedatainsemanticmemoryprocessedbythebrain[11,43].Perception of concepts, and their stimuli and the relationship between different concepts based onthe commonalities in their stimuli form declarative knowledge. Stimuli, because of the featuresof concepts, generate new concepts that are then stored in memory. It should be noted that insemanticmemory,themeaningofaconceptispreservedandnottheworditselforthegrammaticalfeatures of a conceptual sentence. Concepts are generated through their stimuli. In other words,concepts are hidden variables in the environment that can be discovered or inferred through stim-uli.In addition, declarative knowledge can be presented orally (linguistically) and in writing. In thiscase, declarative knowledge is generated by information that is constructed as a hierarchy in thesemanticmemoryandtheformofanetworkconsistingofconceptsandtheirrelationships(seman-tic networks) [31].Each concept could have several stimuli. The stimuli of each concept can be varied and abundant,which depending on the observer may differ in quality and number, however, most concepts andobjects in the environment create stimuli that affect the observer factors equally. Networks ofinterconnectedconceptsareconstructedaboutthesemanticnetworks,whichmaydifferdependingon the type of culture, or the capabilities of agents (observers).Thus, semantic knowledge is the result of input perceptions and inference of these perceptions,which is stored in semantic memory as a communication network. This network creates semanticorganization, which allows the agent to retrieve information. This type of semantic network is ina hierarchical manner and a combination of concepts in the form of nodes and relationships be-tween concepts. A graphical representation of a semantic network is shown in Figure1 [4] relationbetween concepts is represented by arrows. In Figure1 semantic network, Is A means a directlink between two concepts, for example, ”stork is a bird” or Capable of means the ability of oneconcept to perform another.Semantic networks are presented in different forms or models with similarities and differences[33,29,47,50] but the common feature of all is the on concepts and the stimuli of concepts toseparate or categorize concepts. These models include [12,40]:- Feature comparison model: Concepts are categorized by matching their stimuli, and accordingto the stimuli of the target group.- Hierarchical network model: Concepts are organized by using hierarchical relationships in thesemantic network.- Spreading activation model: This model emphasizes interconnected concepts. Concepts once ac-tivatedinthemind,expandalongnetworkpathsandactivateotherconcepts,however,thefartherawayfromtheoriginalconcept,thelessactivethesubsequentconceptsbecome. Thismodelshowsa clear picture of the semantic relationships between concepts that decrease over time.Semantic network models, despite their many strengths in explaining the memory functions thatlead to knowledge generation, also have weaknesses. For some concepts, the hierarchical modelmay not find a feature that puts it at one of the levels of the hierarchy, or it may even have somekind of contradiction in predicting the level of the hierarchy for some concepts. In addition, thismodel neglects the typical effect. The identifier effect states that members who are more identi-fable at one level are easier to categorize than less representative members are. The success of thescalable activation model also significantly depends on the proper explanation of the test results;otherwise, it is considered an inefficient model, although it well demonstrates the ability of sem-antics preparation. Semantic network models are so flexible that sometimes this flexibility makes themimpossible to predict. The process of knowledge generation in semantic networks is the result ofstimuli generation and the relationship of received concepts with stimuli. This feature of semanticnetworks represents a Markovian model [52,2] that has the following two basic features:-Conceptsarenotfullyknown,understandingorinferringeachdoesnotmeaninferringallexistingconcepts, and they are known as hidden variables that must be inferred through stimuli. So thatin terms of the agent, some concepts can be understood through inference, and some are hiddenin the environment.- Each concept is deduced under a probabilistic process through its stimuli generated by that con-cept. Given the models of semantic networks, the way
