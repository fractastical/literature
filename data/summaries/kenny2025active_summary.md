Active Inference in Discrete State Spaces from First PrinciplesThe authors state: “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents perceive and act in complex environments, where the agent’s goal is to minimize surprise.”They note: “The core idea of active inference is that agents actively shape their perceptions of the world, and that this shaping process is driven by a fundamental tension between minimizing surprise and maximizing predictive accuracy.”The paper argues: “The free energy principle, as formulated by Friston, provides a mathematical framework for understanding consciousness as a generative process, where the brain constantly updates its internal models of the world to minimize prediction error.”According to the research, “The free energy principle is a unified theory of mind, linking perception, action, and consciousness.”The authors state: “The key to understanding active inference lies in the concept of variational inference, which provides a computationally tractable approach to estimating the posterior distribution over hidden variables.”The paper argues: “The free energy principle provides a mathematical framework for understanding cortical responses.”The authors state: “The free energy principle is a unified theory of mind-brain.”The authors state: “The free energy principle is a unified theory of mind-brain.”The authors state: “The free energy principle: a unified brain theory?”The authors state: “The free energy principle, as formulated by Friston, provides a mathematical framework for understanding
