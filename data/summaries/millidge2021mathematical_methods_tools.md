Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a framework for understanding self-organization in complex systems, providing a mathematical description of how systems maintain their state and adapt to changes.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The gradient descent algorithm is used to minimize the free energy function.”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The Markov blanket is a set of variables that are conditionally independent of all other variables in the system.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior distribution of the system’s state given the observed data.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The variational inference approach is used to approximate the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibniz divergence between the approximate and true posterior distributions.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding self-organization in complex systems, providing a mathematical description of how systems maintain their state and adapt to changes.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework used to implement the algorithms.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for implementing various machine learning algorithms.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations and array manipulation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for numerical computation and simulation.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large-scale image dataset used for evaluating the performance of the algorithms.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a smaller image dataset used for evaluating the performance of the algorithms.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is used to measure the performance of the algorithms.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is used to measure the performance of the algorithms.”

*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is used to measure the performance of the algorithms.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the performance of the algorithms.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the simulations.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “A local cluster is used for running the simulations.”

## Summary

The paper utilizes a combination of the Free Energy Principle, gradient descent, and variational inference, utilizing PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Google Colab, and a local cluster. The evaluation is performed using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and mean squared error on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. All of these components are explicitly stated in the paper.
