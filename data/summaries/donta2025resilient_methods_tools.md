## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle is a fundamental principle of self-organization in biological and artificial systems, which states that systems minimize their free energy by generating internal models of their environment and acting accordingly.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for modeling and understanding behavior as a process of generating internal models of the environment and acting accordingly to minimize the discrepancy between these models and the observed world.”
*   Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL) (exact quote from paper) – “PAIR-Agent performs Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL) to infer causal dependencies among probabilistic fault variables.”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The agent uses the Markov blanket to identify potential faults from CFGs.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is used to optimize the parameters of the Bayesian network.”
*   Variational Bayesian Learning (exact quote from paper) – “PAIR-Agent employs variationalBayesianlearnerstorefinecausalrelationsacross checkpointsadaptively.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing and model evaluation.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for data visualization and model development.”
