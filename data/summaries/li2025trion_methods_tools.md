## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle is a guiding principle for understanding how systems self-organize and maintain stability by minimizing the difference between their internal state and the environment."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The gradient descent method is employed to minimize the energy functional."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The active inference framework is used to model the interaction between the system and its environment, incorporating both prior beliefs and predictive models."
*   Quantum Monte Carlo (exact quote from paper) – "The Quantum Monte Carlo method is employed to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model."
*   Sign-Problem-Free (exact quote from paper) – “The simulation is performed with a sign-problem-free approach.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is used for data analysis and model evaluation.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”

## Datasets

*   π-flux square lattice (exact quote from paper) – “The π-flux square lattice is a two-dimensional lattice with a π-flux per plaquette.”
*   Honeycomb lattice (exact quote from paper) – “The honeycomb lattice is used as a reference system.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to quantify the difference between the simulated and theoretical results.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the simulations.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The simulations are performed on a local cluster.”
