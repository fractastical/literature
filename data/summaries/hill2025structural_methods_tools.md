## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "the free-energy principle posits that biological agents act to minimize a form of prediction error or surprise (variational free energy) (Friston 2010; Parr and Friston 2019)."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference, which extends this principle to action (Parr and Friston 2019)."
*   Local Learning Rule (exact quote from paper) – "the local learning rule based on Hebbian plasticity, cellsthatfiretogether,wiretogether(Legenstein,Pecevski,andMaass2008)."
*   Hebbian Plasticity (exact quote from paper) – "a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule updates a cell’s directional connection strengths (s) and its homeostatic activation expectation (E)."
*   Prediction Error (exact quote from paper) – "prediction error, the difference between the cell’s actual activation (V) and its learned expectation (E)."
*   Structural Plasticity (exact quote from paper) – “anovelmovementmechanismallowingprocessingcells tophysicallymigrateacrossthe2Dgrid.”
*   Synaptic Weight Updates (exact quote from paper) – “updates a cell’s directional connection strengths (s) and its homeostatic activation expectation (E).”
*   Long-Term Memory (exact quote from paper) – “a scalar value representing the cell’s homeostatic baseline, or its predicted activation.”
*   Short-Term Memory (exact quote from paper) – “accumulate information over a macro-episode (defined as 4 full environment episodes) and are used to drive structural plasticity.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas”
*   Gymnasium (exact quote from paper) – “Gymnasium: A Standard Interface for Reinforcement Learning Environments.”

## Datasets

*   CartPole-v1 (exact quote from paper) – “the CartPole task from the Gymnasium library”
*   Environment characteristics (exact quote from paper) – “4x4 grid”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Success Rate (exact quote from paper) – “the network’s ability to maintain a stable balance”
*   Episode Length (exact quote from paper) – “measured in steps”
*   Locked Network Success Rate (exact quote from paper) – “82% success rate”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab”
