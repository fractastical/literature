## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle posits that systems act to minimize a quantity called free energy, which measures how well an internal generative model predicts observations."
*   Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) (exact quote from paper) – "CEM is a method for optimizing a function by sampling points from a distribution that is biased towards regions of low error."
*   Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (exact quote from paper) – "MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm designed for decision-making in large and complex state spaces."
*   Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB1) (exact quote from paper) – “UCB1 assigns a score to each child node, balancing the average reward observed and the uncertainty of the node.”
*   Bayesian Active Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian Active Learning is a method for selecting the most informative data points to label, based on a probabilistic model of the data.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Variational Inference is a technique for approximating intractable posterior distributions.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by repeatedly adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL Divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computation in Python.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning, providing a wide range of algorithms and tools.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is a numerical computing environment and programming language.”
*   R (exact quote from paper) – “R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.”

## Datasets

*   Pendulum (exact quote from paper) – “The Pendulum environment is a continuous control task where the agent must swing a pendulum to its upright position.”
*   Sparse Mountain Car (exact quote from paper) – “The Sparse Mountain Car environment is a continuous control task where the agent must navigate a car to the flag by building momentum.”
*   HalfCheetah-Run (exact quote from paper) – “The HalfCheetah-Run environment is a continuous control task where the agent must control a two-dimensional cheetah to maximize its forward velocity.”
*   HalfCheetah-Flip (exact quote from paper) – “The HalfCheetah-Flip environment is a continuous control task where the agent must control a two-dimensional cheetah to perform front flips.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.”
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correctly classified instances.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is a measure of the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is a measure of the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were conducted on local clusters with multiple GPUs.”
