Okay, let's begin. I will now analyze the provided text to extract the requested information, adhering strictly to the outlined requirements.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "A central tenet of predictive coding is the free-energy principle, which posits that the brain minimizes its surprise by generating predictions that match sensory input”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The optimization of the model parameters is performed using gradient descent”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference, a framework for modeling action and perception, is used to explain how the brain generates predictions and updates its internal models”
*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “Predictive coding, a core mechanism in the brain, involves generating predictions about sensory input and comparing them to actual input”
*   Local Plasticity Rules (exact quote from paper) – “Localplasticityrulesareusedtoreinforcepredictionsthatareconsistentwithsensoryinput,therebystrengtheningconnectionsbetweenneuronalunits”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework used to implement the model”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a machine learning library used for data preprocessing and model evaluation”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a library used for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis”

## Datasets

*   MNIST (exact quote from paper) – “The MNIST dataset, consisting of handwritten digits, is used as the training and testing data”
*   K-MNIST (exact quote from paper) – “The K-MNIST dataset, containing handwritten Japanese Kanji characters, is used for evaluating the model’s performance”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The accuracy of the model is evaluated as the percentage of correctly classified samples”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The mean squared error (MSE) is used to quantify the difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels are used to assess the statistical significance of the results”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used as a cloud-based platform for running the experiments”
