Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, formatted according to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a novel computational model of adaptive driving behavior based on active inference, offering a principled solution to how humans manage uncertainty and achieve goals.
2.  **Hypothesis:** The model can explain adaptive driving behaviors, such as adjusting speed and lane position, by minimizing expected free energy, which reflects the trade-off between progress and caution.
3.  **Key Finding:** The model successfully reproduces key observed adaptive driving behaviors in both a simulated occlusion scenario and a visual time-sharing scenario, demonstrating the effectiveness of the active inference framework.
4.  **Hypothesis:** The model’s ability to generate adaptive driving behavior stems from its ability to learn a generative model of the environment and to use this model to minimize expected free energy.
5.  **Key Finding:** The model’s performance is sensitive to the precision of the prior beliefs, highlighting the importance of accurate environmental models in adaptive driving.
