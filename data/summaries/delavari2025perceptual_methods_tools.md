## Summary

The research paper utilizes a combination of algorithms and frameworks to develop a robust autonomous driving system. The core methodology is based on Active Inference, which minimizes prediction error by learning a generative model of the environment. The system employs PyTorch and TensorFlow for deep learning, NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. The experiments are conducted in the CARLA simulator, utilizing Google Colab and a local cluster for training. The evaluation metrics include deviation and success rate, measured using the SSIM index.
