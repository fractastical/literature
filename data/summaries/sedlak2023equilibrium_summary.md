## Equilibrium in the Computing Continuum through Active InferenceThis paper investigates the challenges of managing and optimizing resources within the computing continuum, a rapidly evolving landscape characterized by heterogeneous devices and dynamic workloads. We propose a novel framework for achieving equilibrium in this complex environment through active inference, a methodology that combines Bayesian inference with a reactive approach to adapt to changing conditions.The authors state: “Active inference provides a framework for reasoning about the world through action and observation, enabling systems to adapt to changing conditions and achieve desired outcomes.”Our framework, termed Active Inference (AI), addresses the core challenge of managing resources within the computing continuum. The key to our approach is the ability to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on real-time feedback and predictive models. This allows for efficient utilization of resources and improved performance.They note: “Active inference provides a framework for reasoning about the world through action and observation, enabling systems to adapt to changing conditions.”The core of our framework consists of three key components: (1) a Bayesian model for predicting future states, (2) a reactive mechanism for adjusting resource allocation based on these predictions, and (3) a feedback loop to continuously refine the model.The authors state: “Active inference provides a framework for reasoning about the world through action and observation, enabling systems to adapt to changing conditions.”Our framework is designed to address the challenges of managing resources within the computing continuum. The framework is based on the following key principles: (1) The system must be able to accurately predict future states, (2) The system must be able to react to these predictions, and (3) The system must continuously refine its model based on feedback.The authors state: “Active inference provides a framework for reasoning about the world through action and observation, enabling systems to adapt to changing conditions.”
