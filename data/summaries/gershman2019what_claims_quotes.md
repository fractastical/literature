Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying account of brain function, subsuming other theories like Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and optimal control theory.
2.  **Hypothesis 1:** The brain seeks to minimize surprise (free energy).
3.  **Hypothesis 2:** The brain is equipped with an internal (generative) model of the environment, specifying how sensory observations are generated from hidden states.
4.  **Hypothesis 3:**  The brain’s activity is driven by minimizing the difference between its predictions and actual sensory input.
5.  **Claim 4:**  The FEP can be understood as a variational inference framework.
6.  **Claim 5:**  The FEP does not have a fixed set of distinct claims, but rather makes different claims under different assumptions about the internal model and the optimization scheme.
7.  **Hypothesis 4:**  Active inference, where the agent influences observations through actions, is equivalent to information gain maximization.
