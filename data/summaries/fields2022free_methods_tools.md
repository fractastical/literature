Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP states that any system with morphological degrees of freedom and locally limited free energy will, under the constraint of the free energy principle, evolve toward a neuromorphic morphology that supports hierarchical computations in which each ‘level’ of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs”
*   Bayesian Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a general physical principle, and therefore, it is applicable to any system that can be described in terms of Bayesian inference”
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is defined by the variational free energy, which is an upper bound on (Bayesian) surprisal”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The MB is defined as the set of variables that are conditionally independent of the rest of the system, given the state of the MB”
*   Hierarchical Measurements (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP drives systems toward hierarchical computations in which each ‘level’ of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a general physical principle, and therefore, it is applicable to any system that can be described in terms of Bayesian inference”
*   Coarse-Graining (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP drives systems toward hierarchical computations in which each ‘level’ of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs”
*   Fine-Graining (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP drives systems toward hierarchical computations in which each ‘level’ of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs”
*   Measurement (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP drives systems toward hierarchical computations in which each ‘level’ of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python”
