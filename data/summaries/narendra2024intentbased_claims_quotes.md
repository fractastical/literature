Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Central Claim:** The paper argues for the necessity of intent-based meta-scheduling in programmable networks, driven by the scale and complexity of these networks. It posits that traditional scheduling approaches are insufficient for managing the demands of 5G and beyond.

2. **Hypothesis: Meta-Scheduling is Required:** The paper hypothesizes that a meta-scheduler is needed to coordinate multiple schedulers and dynamically adjust resource allocation across a programmable network.

3. **Intent-Based Decomposition:** The authors claim that user requirements can be decomposed into intents, which can then be propagated down to the lower layers of the network.

4. **Scale and Distribution:** The paper asserts that programmable networks will be highly distributed and large in scale, necessitating a centralized approach to scheduling.

5. **Active Inference as a Foundation:** The authors propose using active inference as the basis for the meta-scheduler, leveraging its ability to model and predict network behavior.

6. **Multi-Domain Coordination:** The paper suggests that intent-based management can be used to coordinate multiple administrative domains within a programmable network.

## Important Quotes

1.  “The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G munication standards bodies such as 3GPP1, Telemanagement (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called “programmable” networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement.” (The authors state: "The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G munication standards bodies such as 3GPP1, Telemanagement (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called “programmable” networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement.") – *This quote establishes the context for the research and highlights the driving force behind the need for automated scheduling.*



4. “To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-baseddynamicmeta-schedulinginprogrammablenetworks.Ourresearchagendawillbebuiltona- tiveinference,atypeofcausalinference” (The authors state: "To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-baseddynamicmeta-schedulinginprogrammablenetworks.Ourresearchagendawillbebuiltona- tiveinference,atypeofcausalinference") – *This quote outlines the research agenda for intent-based meta-scheduling.*


6. “The CU would be enhanced with the agents as depicted in Fig. 7. 2) The Assurance Agent would receive the requirements. It is assumed that, due to the scale involved, multiple user requirements would come in at the same time.” (The authors state: "The CU would be enhanced with the agents as depicted in Fig. 7. 2) The Assurance Agent would receive the requirements. It is assumed that, due to the scale involved, multiple user requirements would come in at the same time.") – *This quote describes the architecture of the meta-scheduler.*
