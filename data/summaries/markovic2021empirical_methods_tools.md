Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that the brain minimizes the free energy of its states, which is a measure of the difference between the actual state of the world and the brain’s internal model of it.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how the brain generates behavior by minimizing the free energy of its internal model of the world.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that updates beliefs based on new evidence.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Variational inference is a technique for approximating intractable Bayesian inference by finding the closest distribution to the true posterior.”
*   Change Detection (exact quote from paper) – “Change detection is a process of identifying and adapting to changes in the environment.”
*   Thompson Sampling (exact quote from paper) – “Thompson sampling is a Bayesian optimization algorithm that samples from the posterior distribution to select actions.”
*   Optimistic Thompson Sampling (exact quote from paper) – “Optimistic Thompson sampling is a variant of Thompson sampling that uses an optimistic prior to guide action selection.”
*   Bernoulli Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “The Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution that models the outcome of a single trial with two possible outcomes: success or failure.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning algorithms.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is a numerical computing environment and programming language.”
*   JAX (exact quote from paper) – “JAX is a high-performance numerical computation library developed by Google.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images used for computer vision research.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 10,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “UCI datasets are a collection of datasets used for machine learning research.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified examples.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified positive examples out of all positive examples.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the proportion of correctly identified positive examples out of all actual positive examples.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services provides a range of cloud computing services.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “Local clusters are computer systems connected together to perform parallel computations.”
