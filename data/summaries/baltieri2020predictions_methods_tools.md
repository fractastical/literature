## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle (FEP) is a framework for understanding how systems, from simple organisms to complex cognitive architectures, maintain a coherent representation of their environment and themselves."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference introduces a theory describing action- perceptual processes by 1) noting that they can be treated as a special case of a more general framework based on the expected free energy….”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “…under simplifying assumptions and Gaussian assumptions…minimising the free energy…”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “…using Bayesian inference…”
*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “…a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects.”
*   Differential Equations (exact quote from paper) – “…describing the dynamics of the system…”
*   Linearization (exact quote from paper) – “…linearised near the equilibrium…”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “…using NumPy…”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “…using Pandas…”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “…using scikit-learn…”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet dataset”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 dataset”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “UCI datasets”
