Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "a unified understanding of cognition and action which can be applied at many levels, from a single neuron to an entire brain or organism"
*   Bayesian Updating (exact quote from paper) – "updating beliefs about the world in light of new observations"
*   Free Energy Minimisation (exact quote from paper) – "a form of approximate Bayesian inference, by minimising a quantity known as free energy"
*   Generative Models (exact quote from paper) – “a model which explains its observations causally in terms of both hidden states of the world and its own actions”
*   Marginalisation (exact quote from paper) – “the process of obtaining the marginal distribution of a variable”
*   Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – “a process of exchanging information between nodes in a network”
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “a simplification of the model by assuming that each node interacts with an average of all other nodes”
*   Markov Categories (exact quote from paper) – “a category with normalisation and cancellative caps”
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “a form of free energy for open models”
*   Discrete Time Models (exact quote from paper) – “models with a discrete time steps”
