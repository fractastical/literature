Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A novel approach to solving problems in robotics and control, based on the principles of Bayesian inference and information theory.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm used to minimize the loss function.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A statistical method that uses prior beliefs and observed data to update those beliefs.”
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “A simplification of the model by assuming that all particles are in the same state.”
*   Monte Carlo methods (exact quote from paper) – “A computational technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
