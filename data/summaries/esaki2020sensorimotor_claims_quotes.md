## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors claim that visual perception infers the environmental state, not the sensory input itself. This suggests that the spatial limitations of the human visual field – specifically, the central visual field of about 5 degrees – are not “limitations” but rather “triggers” for action.
2.  The authors hypothesize that the free energy principle (FEP) can be used to model sensorimotor visual perception. They propose that the brain minimizes free energy by adjusting its configuration to accurately predict sensory input.
3.  The authors state that the proposed embodied system, configured by a body and memory, can achieve sensorimotor visual perception by operating according to the FEP.
4.  The authors propose that the generative model, implemented with a variational autoencoder (VAE), contains prior knowledge about the environment.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the system’s ability to achieve sensorimotor visual perception relies on the interaction between the body and memory, and the resulting causal relationship between these.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "visual perception infers the environmental state, not the sensory input itself."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This is the central claim of the paper, defining the core concept of sensorimotor visual perception as an inference process.

**Quote:** “The spatial limitations of the human visual field, such as that described above, are treated as constraints called partial observation.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This highlights the key assumption of the model – that the limited spatial resolution of the human visual system is a fundamental aspect of the perceptual process.

**Quote:** “The free energy principle mathematically describes the principle that living things obey. The free energy in the FEP measures the difference between the probability distribution of environmental states that act on a biological system and an approximate posterior distribution of environmental states encoded by the configuration of that system.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This provides the mathematical foundation for the FEP and explains its role in biological systems.

**Quote:** “The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This defines the core components of the proposed system, emphasizing the interaction between the physical body and the internal memory system.

**Quote:** “The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This specifies the mechanism by which the body interacts with the environment, highlighting the limited spatial scope of visual observation.

**Quote:** “The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model obtained with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This describes the nature of the memory system as a generative model, incorporating prior knowledge and classifying it.

**Quote:** “In machine learning, many methods have been proposed that incorporate various characteristics and phenomena found in humans.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This indicates the inspiration behind the proposed system, drawing on established machine learning techniques.

**Quote:** “The spatial limitations of the human body, such as that described above, are treated as constraints called partial observation.”
**Context:** Results
**Significance:** This reiterates the key assumption of the model and its impact on the system's performance.

**Quote:** “The probability of the correct character became the highest among the characters.”
**Context:** Results
**Significance:** This summarizes the primary outcome of the experiment, demonstrating the system's ability to accurately recognize characters.

**Quote:** “The free energy in the FEP measures the difference between the probability distribution of environmental states that act on a biological system and an approximate posterior distribution of environmental states encoded by the configuration of that system.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This provides a detailed explanation of the free energy principle and its role in minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input.
