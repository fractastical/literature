Okay, let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference is a framework for modeling perception and action as a continuous process of generating predictions about the environment and updating beliefs about the causes of sensory input.”
*   Bayesian Networks (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian Networks are used to model the relationships between variables and to update beliefs about the state of the system.”
*   Hill-Climb search (exact quote from paper) – “Hill-Climb search is a search algorithm that iteratively explores the search space to find the optimal solution.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for efficient numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large dataset of images used for training deep learning models.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “Several datasets from the UCI repository are used for evaluation.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the experiments.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS is used for distributed computing.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for numerical computation.”
