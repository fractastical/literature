Okay, let's begin the extraction process according to your detailed requirements. Here’s the output, meticulously crafted to meet all specifications.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper proposes a model of overt and covert visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy.

2.  **Hypothesis:** The model can effectively simulate and explain observed attentional phenomena, such as the effects of valid and invalid cues, inhibition of return, and the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention.

3.  **Key Finding:** The model demonstrates behavior similar to human attention, including the ability to suppress previously attended locations (inhibition of return) after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval.

4.  **Key Finding:** The model exhibits involuntary, reflexive saccades faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability, mirroring observed human behavior.

5.  **Key Finding:** The model successfully captures the observed differences between endogenous and exogenous attention, with valid cues leading to faster reaction times compared to invalid cues.

6.  **Key Finding:** The model’s sensory precision optimization dynamically adjusts based on current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation.
