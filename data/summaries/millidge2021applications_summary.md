### OverviewThis paper, “Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience,” investigates the potential of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a framework for understanding complex systems, specifically focusing on its applications within machine learning and neuroscience. The authors argue that systems, including the brain, can be viewed as performing variational Bayesian inference to minimize a variational free energy, effectively self-organizing and maintaining a non-equilibrium state. The core premise is that any system maintaining a statistical separation from its environment can be characterized by this process.### MethodologyThe authors present the FEP as a general mathematical theory, drawing parallels to Ashby’s good regulator principle and incorporating ideas from thermodynamics, cybernetics, and cognitive science. They state: "The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)." The research centers on scaling up existing FEP-inspired theories, such as predictive coding and active inference, to address complex tasks. They highlight the potential biological plausibility of these theories, noting that if they can be scaled up to handle brain-level tasks, they could potentially be implemented in the brain. The authors emphasize that the FEP and its associated processes offer insights that can be used to improve and extend current methods in machine learning and neuroscience. Specifically, they focus on demonstrating that FEP-inspired models and theories can scale and showcasing how ideas from the FEP can be used to advance the field. The paper utilizes a mathematical walkthrough of the FEP, presenting it as a formalization and generalization of existing theories.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that the FEP can be applied to perception, action, and learning. In the context of predictive coding, they contribute to the FEP process theory by suggesting that perception can be understood as a process of minimizing free energy through predictive inference. They state: "A core tenet of the free energyprincipleisthatperception,action,andlearningcanallbeunifiedunderasingleinferenceobjectivewhichminimizesasingleobjective–thevariationalfreeenergy."Furthermore, they apply the FEP to action and learning, working with the process theory of active inference. They note that the FEP contains many insights which can be used to improve and extend current state-of-the-art methods in machine learning or neuroscience on its own terms.The authors present specific numerical results, though the exact values are not explicitly stated in this summary.They demonstrate that FEP-inspired models and theories can scale, and showcase how ideas from the FEP can be used to advance the field.### DiscussionThe authors conclude that the FEP provides a unifying framework for understanding complex systems, offering potential solutions for scaling up existing theories and improving current methods in machine learning and neuroscience. They state: "Specifically, in this thesis, we are primarily concernedwithscalingupmethodswhichhaveemergedinthetheoreticalneuroscienceliterature, to the extremely challenging and complex tasks which can be solved with modernmachine learningmethods." The paper’s contribution lies in demonstrating the applicability of the FEP to these domains, highlighting its potential for biological plausibility and its ability to inform the development of new machine learning algorithms. The authors’ work contributes to the literature through the application of the free energy principle to all of perception, action, and learning.### Key Quotes1."The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)."2."A core tenet of the free energyprincipleisthatperception,action,andlearningcanallbeunifiedunderasingleinferenceobjectivewhichminimizesasingleobjective–thevariationalfreeenergy."3."The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)."4."The free energy principle isthus effectively aformalization and generalizationoftheAshbyangoodregulatorprinciple(Conant&RossAshby,1970), whereanintrinsicpropertyofthesekindsofsystemsisthattheysomesensecometo embodyaBayesianmodeloftheirsurroundings,andtheperformainferenceusingthismodel(Baltieri,Buckley,&Bruineberg,2020)."5."The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)."6."The free energy principle isthus effectively aformalization and generalizationoftheAshbyangoodregulatorprinciple(Conant&RossAshby,1970), whereanintrinsicpropertyofthesekindsofsystemsisthattheysomesensecometo embodyaBayesianmodeloftheirsurroundings,andtheperformainferenceusingthismodel(Baltieri,Buckley,&Bruineberg,2020)."7."The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)."8."The free energy principle isthus effectively aformalization and generalizationoftheAshbyangoodregulatorprinciple(Conant&RossAshby,1970), whereanintrinsicpropertyofthesekindsofsystemsisthattheysomesensecometo embodyaBayesianmodeloftheirsurroundings,andtheperformainferenceusingthismodel(Baltieri,Buckley,&Bruineberg,2020)."9."The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organisationand dissipativestructures inthermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008), withcybernetic notionsoffeedback, regulation, andcontrol(Johnson & Moradi,2005; Kalman et al.,1960; Wiener,2019), to more ‘cognitive’ ideas of inference and learning (Dayan & Daw,2008; Rao & Ballard,1999; Schmidhuber,1991)."10.
