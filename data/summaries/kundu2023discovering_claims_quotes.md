Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a two-step, neuro-symbolic framework, ALGO, to discover novel actions from open-world egocentric videos with limited supervision.
2.  ALGO leverages object-grounding with CLIP to generate a grounded object search space.
3.  ALGO utilizes an energy-based symbolic pattern theory framework and learns visual-semantic action grounding to discover plausible actions, driven by prior knowledge.
4.  The authors hypothesize that a neuro-symbolic approach can effectively bridge the gap between vision and language for open-world activity understanding.
5.  The core hypothesis is that by combining visual and symbolic representations, ALGO can overcome the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods in open-world scenarios.
