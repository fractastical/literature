### OverviewThis summary extracts key claims, findings, and methodological details from “The Physics and Metaphysics of Social Powers: Bridging Cognitive Processing and Social Dynamics, a New Perspective on Power through Active Inference” by Albarracin et al. (2025). The paper proposes a framework based on Active Inference (AI) to understand social power dynamics, emphasizing the role of shared generative models and the minimization of free energy in shaping social interactions. The core argument centers on how agents actively construct their understanding of the world and how this influences their behavior and the power dynamics within social systems.### MethodologyThe authors employ an Active Inference (AI) framework to model social power dynamics. This framework posits that agents maintain their internal models of the world by minimizing a quantity known as free energy. This minimization process involves adjusting actions to reduce discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory inputs. The paper highlights the importance of shared generative models in coordinating social behavior. The authors utilize a computational approach to model social interactions, suggesting that agents are driven by a desire to reduce uncertainty and maintain a coherent representation of their environment. The authors explicitly state: “The authors state: “The core of our approach is to treat social interactions as a process of active inference, where agents dynamically adjust their internal models to minimize free energy”.” They further note: “They note: “This framework provides a formal basis for understanding how agents coordinate their actions and how power dynamics emerge from this coordination”.” The paper also discusses the role of scripts—shared cognitive structures—in shaping social behavior, stating: “The paper argues: “Scripts are crucial because they provide a shared framework for interpreting social situations and coordinating actions”.”### Key Claims and Findings1.Agents actively construct their understanding of the world by minimizing free energy, leading to coordinated behavior. “The authors state: “The core of our approach is to treat social interactions as a process of active inference, where agents dynamically adjust their internal models to minimize free energy”.”2.Shared generative models are essential for coordinating social interactions. “They note: “This framework provides a formal basis for understanding how agents coordinate their actions and how power dynamics emerge from this coordination”.”3.Scripts—shared cognitive structures—play a crucial role in shaping social behavior. “The paper argues: “Scripts are crucial because they provide a shared framework for interpreting social situations and coordinating actions”.”4.The minimization of free energy explains how agents reduce uncertainty and maintain a coherent representation of their environment. 

However, it argues that the minimization of free energy explains how agents reduce uncertainty and maintain a coherent representation of their environment. 

The authors suggest that the framework provides a formal basis for understanding how agents coordinate their actions and how power dynamics emerge from this coordination
