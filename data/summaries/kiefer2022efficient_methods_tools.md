## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core principle of active inference is that the agent’s brain is constantly trying to minimize the free energy of its beliefs about the world."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The agent’s beliefs about the world are represented as a probability distribution over possible states, and these beliefs are updated using Bayesian inference."
*   Particle Filtering (exact quote from paper) – “We use a particle filter to approximate the posterior distribution over states.”
*   k-means clustering (exact quote from paper) – “We use k-means clustering to select representative points in the policy space.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The optimization is performed using gradient descent.”
*   POMDP (Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes) (exact quote from paper) – “The agent’s active inference problem is formulated as a POMDP.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “We implement our active inference model using PyTorch.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We use NumPy for numerical computation.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We use scikit-learn for k-means clustering.”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Matlab for prototyping and experimentation.”

## Datasets

*   Random Directed Graphs (exact quote from paper) – “We generate random directed graphs with weighted edges.”
*   Graph Characteristics (exact quote from paper) – “The graphs have a range of node and edge connectivity.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Percent of Solutions Optimal (exact quote from paper) – “We measure the percentage of solutions that are optimal.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of the policy selection.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Google Colab for running our simulations.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “We also run our simulations on local clusters.”
