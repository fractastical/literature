Okay, let's begin. Here's the extracted information based on the provided research paper text, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose an “environment-centric active inference” (EC-AIF) to address unintended changes in the environment caused by agents.
2.  The core hypothesis is that a traditional active inference framework, where the agent is defined as the “action” performer, fails to account for external environmental changes.
3.  The authors hypothesize that defining the environment as encompassing all observable things, including agents performing actions, will allow agents to respond to these external changes.
4.  The paper’s central claim is that the proposed EC-AIF, by treating the entire world as the environment, enables agents to adapt to unforeseen environmental shifts.
5.  The authors suggest that the proposed EC-AIF will allow agents to respond to changes in the environment that are not intended by the agent.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "To handle unintended changes in the environment by agents, we propose an environment-centric active inference EC-AIF in which the Markov Blanket of active inference is defined starting from the environment.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote clearly states the paper’s primary goal and the core concept of the proposed approach.

**Quote:** “In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performsthe“action” suchasarobotoraperson,thentheenvironmentwas defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent’s “action,” and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote explains the limitations of the conventional active inference framework.

**Quote:** “As long as the defined environment is maintained, the agent will outperform the human in some cases. However, changes in the environment that cannot be directly changed by the agent or in the presence of other agents can occur.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This highlights the problem the paper addresses – the inability of traditional active inference to handle external changes.

**Quote:** “What are agents and environments? The design strategy should answer this essential question. Changes in the environment that are not intended by the agent originate from assuming an entity corresponding to the agent (e.g., a robot) and defining its surroundings as the environment.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This outlines the fundamental shift in perspective proposed by the EC-AIF.

**Quote:** “Instead of assuming the entity corresponding to the agent, considering all of the world as the environment, the changes in the environment must be under the intention of the agent. Therefore, defining a Markov Blanket based on the environmentbyassumingthateverythingintheworldistheenvironmentwould allow the agent to respond to changes in the environment.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This provides a detailed explanation of the core principle of the EC-AIF.

**Quote:** “The state of the agent is fully known. In addition, the state of the environment within the definition is inferred with high precision, but the state of the environment outside the definition is not inferred at all.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This clarifies the distinction between the defined environment and the external world.

**Quote:** “There is no entity corresponding to an agent. In addition to the people and objects that have been considered the environment, theenvironmentincludes theentities thatperform“actions,” suchas robotsand people.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This explicitly states the key difference between the conventional and proposed approaches.

**Quote:** “The state of the environment is inferred with varying accuracy.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This acknowledges that the environmental state inference will not be perfectly precise.

**Quote:** “The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and demonstrated in an object transport task.”
**Context:** Results and Discussion
**Significance:** This summarizes the experimental setup and the key application of the proposed approach.

**Quote:** “The robot arm adapted to changes in the environment and successfully transported the object.”
**Context:** Results and Discussion
**Significance:** This presents the primary experimental finding.

**Quote:** “In normal AIF, actions can be selected more quickly because there are fewer action variables than in EC-AIF.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights a key difference in the efficiency of the two approaches.

**Quote:** “The shortest path of object transport indicates that the principle of least action is implicitly included in the active inference.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This provides an interpretation of the experimental results in terms of a fundamental physical principle.

**Quote:** “The authors state: “The free energy principle: a unified brain the-ory.”
**Context:** References
**Significance:** This quote references the foundational theory upon which the active inference approach is based.
