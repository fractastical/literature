Okay, let's begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Core Claim:** The authors introduce “structured active inference,” a formalization of active inference using categorical systems theory, to address the complexity of modeling multi-agent systems in realistic environments.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Current approaches to active inference are insufficient for modeling complex multi-agent systems due to their inability to handle structured interactions and changing interfaces.

3.  **Key Finding:** Structured active inference provides a compositional framework that allows for the representation of agents with structured interfaces (e.g., mode-dependent agents), enabling the modeling of complex interactions and hierarchical agent structures.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The use of categorical systems theory is essential for providing a robust and scalable framework for active inference, particularly when dealing with agents that interact with computer APIs or manage other agents.

5.  **Key Finding:** The framework allows for the formalization of agent goals as predicates, which can be judged in relation to their interaction contexts, facilitating the development of ‘safeguarded’ AI systems.
