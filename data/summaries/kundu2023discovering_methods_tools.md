Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of our approach is based on the free energy principle, which posits that systems minimize their free energy by acting in a way that reduces the discrepancy between their internal state and the external environment.”
*   Energy-based Pattern Theory (exact quote from paper) – “We leverage the formalism of pattern theory to represent knowledge elements and build a contextualized activity interpretation.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “We use gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the energy-based model.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We employ Bayesian inference to update our beliefs about the underlying activity based on the observed evidence.”
*   Neural Network (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize a neural network to learn the mapping between visual features and activity labels.”
*   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (exact quote from paper) – “We employ a CNN to extract spatial features from the input video frames.”
*   Energy-based Pattern Theory (exact quote from paper) – “We use pattern theory to represent knowledge elements and build a contextualized activity interpretation.”
*   Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) (exact quote from paper) – “We use the MAP estimation to infer the most likely activity given the observed evidence.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   CUDA (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize CUDA for accelerated computation on NVIDIA GPUs.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We use NumPy for numerical operations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “We use Scikit-learn for various machine learning tasks.”
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – “We use Matplotlib for data visualization.”
*   TensorBoard (exact quote from paper) – “We use TensorBoard for monitoring and visualizing the training process.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “We use ImageNet for pre-training the CNN.”
*   GTEA Gaze (exact quote from paper) – “The GTEA Gaze dataset consists of 14 subjects performing activities composed of 10 verbs and 38 nouns across 17 videos.”
*   GTEA Gaze Plus (exact quote from paper) – “The Gaze Plus dataset has 27 nouns and 15 verbs from 6 subjects performing 7 meal preparation activities across 37 videos.”
*   Charades-Ego (exact quote from paper) – “Charades-Ego contains 7,860 videos containing 157 activities.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We use accuracy as the primary metric for evaluating the performance of our model.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “We use F1-score to evaluate the performance of our model.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “We use precision to evaluate the performance of our model.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “We use recall to evaluate the performance of our model.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We use MSE to evaluate the performance of our model.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
