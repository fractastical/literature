Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes a synthetic Active Inference Agents (AIF) framework based on free-form factor graphs, moving away from traditional variational inference approaches.
2.  The core hypothesis is that a local, epistemic objective, derived from a free energy functional, can drive AIF agents to systematically explore their environment and seek out information.
3.  The authors propose a novel Lagrangian Active Inference (LAIF) approach, which utilizes a constrained factor graph representation and a local free energy functional to solve for optimal policies.
4.  The paper demonstrates that LAIF can directly infer a policy for the T-maze task, circumventing the scaling issues associated with traditional AIF algorithms.
5.  The authors introduce a CFFG notation, which allows for a more intuitive and flexible representation of AIF models, facilitating the integration of constraints and the development of new algorithms.
