## Structure

Not specified in paper

1.  CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS - NO SPECULATION ALLOWED (ENHANCED):
    *   ONLY list items EXPLICITLY NAMED in the paper text
    *   DO NOT create entries for common items (Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, MSE, Google Colab, AWS, MATLAB, R, etc.) if they are not explicitly mentioned
    *   Never infer tools based on methodology (e.g., don't assume PyTorch for deep learning)
    *   Verification: Before listing any item, search the paper text for its explicit mention
    *   Never use words like: "implied", "likely", "potentially", "not explicitly mentioned but", "probably", "may have been used", "suggested", "assumed"
    *   Never guess or infer tools, frameworks, datasets, or methods based on context or prior knowledge
    *   If a tool/framework/dataset is not EXPLICITLY NAMED in the paper, DO NOT include it in your list
    *   Be precise with technical terminology - use exact terms from the paper
    *   Every item must have a clear, explicit mention in the paper text
    *   Do NOT list items that are "commonly used" or "typically associated" - only list what is explicitly named
    *   If you find items, list them with quotes. If you find no items, state "Not specified in paper" for the entire section
    *   Correct format: For each item, include the exact quote or specific text that mentions it
    *   Format: "Item Name (exact quote from paper)" or "Item Name - mentioned in [section]"

2.  COMPREHENSIVENESS AND SECTION-LEVEL REPORTING:
    *   Extract ALL relevant tools, frameworks, datasets, and methods that are EXPLICITLY NAMED
    *   Include both standard and custom solutions that are EXPLICITLY NAMED
    *   Cover all aspects: algorithms, software, data, evaluation, hardware - but ONLY if explicitly stated
    *   Prioritize items that are central to reproducing the research
    *   CRITICAL: If a section has no items found, write "Not specified in paper" at the SECTION LEVEL, not for individual items
    *   DO NOT list items that are "not specified in paper" - this is incorrect
    *   If you find items, list them with quotes. If you find no items, state "Not specified in paper" for the entire section

3.  FORMATTING:
    *   Use clear markdown structure with sections
    *   Use bullet points or numbered lists within sections
    *   Include specific details (versions, sizes, names) ONLY when explicitly stated
    *   Maintain technical accuracy - quote exact text from the paper when possible
    *   Format: For each item, include the exact quote or specific text that mentions it
    *   Format: "Item Name (exact quote from paper)" or "Item Name - mentioned in [section]"

4.  VERIFICATION (CRITICAL):
    *   Before listing any item, verify it appears explicitly in the paper text
    *   Search the paper text for the explicit mention of each item before including it
    *   If you're unsure whether something is explicitly stated, DO NOT include it
    *   Never use words like: "implied", "likely", "potentially", "not explicitly mentioned but", "probably", "may have been used", "suggested", "assumed"
    *   Never guess or infer tools, frameworks, datasets, or methods based on context or prior knowledge
    *   If a tool/framework/dataset is not EXPLICITLY NAMED in the paper, DO NOT include it in your list
    *   Be precise with technical terminology - use exact terms from the paper
    *   Every item must have a clear, explicit mention in the paper text
    *   Do NOT list items that are "commonly used" or "typically associated" - only list what is explicitly named
