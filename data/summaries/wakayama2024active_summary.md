Okay, here's a summary of the paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.**Active Inference in Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits for Autonomous Robotic Exploration**This paper investigates the application of active inference (AIF) to contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) for autonomous robotic exploration. The authors state: “When secondary information about options is accessible, suchproblemscanbeframedascontextualmulti-armedbandits(CMABs).” The core idea is to leverage AIF’s ability to balance exploration and exploitation, using the expected free energy objective function, to guide decision-making in a realistic robotic exploration scenario. The research focuses on a simulated mining site selection problem, incorporating hyperspectral data and geological labels.
