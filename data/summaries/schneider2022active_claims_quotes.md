Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Main Claim:** The paper demonstrates that Active Inference (AI) can be effectively applied to complex robotic manipulation tasks, specifically balancing a ball into a target zone, even in sparse environments.

2. **Hypothesis:** The core hypothesis is that incorporating an information-seeking objective – driven by the agent’s curiosity – within the AI framework will enable systematic exploration of challenging, sparse environments where traditional, reward-based methods fail.

3. **Key Finding:** The research shows that agents driven by AI explore their environments in a directed and systematic way, successfully solving complex manipulation tasks that are unsolvable with methods lacking explicit information-seeking behavior.

4. **Contribution:** The paper’s primary contribution is the demonstration of a practical application of Active Inference for robotic manipulation, highlighting its potential for tackling problems with sparse rewards and partial observability.

5. **Theoretical Claim:** The authors argue that the combination of a goal-directed and information-seeking objective, as formulated within the Free Energy Principle, is crucial for effective robotic manipulation.
