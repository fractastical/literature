Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a new framework – Active Inference – to understand power dynamics, framing it as a process of minimizing uncertainty through predictive models and action.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Social scripts, understood as shared predictive models, are fundamental to how agents interact and exert influence within social systems.

3.  **Claim:** Power is not simply a matter of force or control, but rather a function of an agent’s ability to attract attention, facilitate desired policies, and effectively process information.

4.  **Hypothesis:**  Narratives, understood as scripts, play a crucial role in shaping power dynamics by influencing how agents interpret and respond to situations.

5.  **Claim:**  The ability to minimize uncertainty through predictive models is a core driver of power, enabling agents to anticipate and shape their environment.

6.  **Hypothesis:**  Social norms and expectations (deontic values) contribute to the regulation of behavior and the exercise of power within social systems.

## Important Quotes

1.  **Quote:** “...powermustbeunderstoodinthefirstinstanceasthemultiplicityof force relations immanentin the sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own organization; as the process which, through ceaseless struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support which these force relations find in one another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the contrary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which theytake effect...” ([Foucault, 1990], pp. 92–93, our emphasis in bold).
    **Context:** Introduction – Framing of Power
    **Significance:**  Establishes Foucault’s foundational definition of power as a relational, dynamic process.

2.  **Quote:** “...theacquisitionandmaintenanceofpowerisintertwinedwithbothsocialinteractionsandcognitiveprocessingcapacity:socially-facilitatedempowermentgrantsagentsmoreinformation-processingcapacitiesandopportunities,eitherbyrelyingonothers tobringaboutdesiredpoliciesorultimatelyoutcomes,orbyenjoyingmoreinformation-processingpossibilitiesasarelyingonothersforthe reproductionof(material)tasks.”
    **Context:** Abstract – Defining Social Empowerment
    **Significance:**  Highlights the link between social interaction, cognitive capacity, and the acquisition of power.

3.  **Quote:** “Narrativesare socialmechanismswhichhave theabilitytomake orbreak power[Blakeley,2024].Not-yet-engagedscripts (speculations, fictions, etc.: future forecasting)canbeunderstoodas semanticattractorsenabling—relatively—risk-freelearning[deJager,2022].”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Introduces the concept of narratives as a mechanism for shaping power dynamics, specifically through speculative modeling.

4.  **Quote:** “Possibilisticcognitivexploration intheform of, e.g., (fictional) narrativesallow agentstoconsider counterfactualscenariosand minimize uncertaintywithout exposure to “real-world” consequences.”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Explains the benefit of using narratives for risk-free learning and exploration.

5.  **Quote:** “In thecontextofpower,leveraging“strongnarratives”—suchas“usversus them”reductionisms—greatlyminimize uncertainty(technically: variationalfreeenergy,thedivergencebetween what is expected and what is actually experienced)about an agent’s or group’s currentpredicaments,andthusbecomeappealing(sometimesself-fulfilling)policiesthatbringabouttheir effects,resultingincollectivebehaviorswhichcanbebeneficialordetrimentaltothegreaterwhole[Albarracin et al.,2022].”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Demonstrates how strong narratives can be strategically used to influence behavior and outcomes.

6.  **Quote:** “The effects of variational free energy-minimization can be observed at the level of the basic structures of language: (semantic) attractors such as redundancy, rhyme and alliteration, can be understoodaspatterns whichaidmemory,communicationandinformation-retrievalpolicies: they permanentlyreappear,poolingattentiontothe“same”phenomena,thusgreatlyreducingtheneedto decode and recode linguistic interaction anew.”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Highlights the role of linguistic patterns in facilitating information processing and maintaining shared understanding.

7.  **Quote:** “By way of the same uncertainty-minimizing mechanisms, (simple or complex) narrative scripts create cognitive situations whereagents can reducecomplexaspectsoftheworlddowntopreferredandoralready-identifiedscenarios. Unlike ‘direct’experience,wherepredictionerrorspresentimmediaterisks,narrativesprovidespeculative semanticspacesforexploringmodelsagainsthypotheticaloutcomes.”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Emphasizes the advantage of using narratives for exploring possibilities without the risks associated with direct experience.

8.  **Quote:** “Withregardtosocialpower,theproblemsimmediatelyemergein situationswherecollectiveattentioncontrolledbyagentsalreadybenefitingfromdominantnarrativescanlead to,e.g.,theexacerbationofmisinformation,echo chambers, conspiracy theories, etc. (ibid.), in an attempt to retain attention and therefore power.”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Illustrates the potential negative consequences of dominant narratives and the manipulation of attention.

9.  **Quote:** “In political communication and organization, where the proliferation of scripts can be understood as an optimization of the learning/risk trade-off inherent in active inference, this is of crucial attention, particularly at a time when the democratic, technological and futurological organization of life is in question.”
    **Context:** Section 2 – Scripts as Social Mechanisms
    **Significance:**  Positions the framework within broader contexts of political, technological, and societal organization.

10. **Quote:** “We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.”
    **Context:** Section 3 – Power Through the Lens of Active Inference
    **Significance:**  Articulates the core mechanism of empowerment as a feedback loop involving information processing and risk management.
