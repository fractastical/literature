## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core of the model is based on the free energy principle, which states that a system will minimize its free energy by acting in a way that reduces its internal uncertainty"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a framework for modeling perception and action based on the idea that agents actively seek to minimize their free energy”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The model uses Bayesian inference to update its beliefs about the state of the world”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the neural network”
*   Gaussian Distributions (exact quote from paper) – “The model assumes that the sensory data follows a Gaussian distribution”
*   Markov Kernels (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses Markov kernels to represent the uncertainty in the sensory data”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The model was trained on the ImageNet dataset”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The model was also evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset”
