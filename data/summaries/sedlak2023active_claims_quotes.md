Okay, let's begin the extraction process based on the provided research paper text.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Claim:** Machine Learning (ML) models are often not retrained, leading to inaccurate views of the system state and hindering their ability to adapt to changing conditions.
    *   **Context:** Abstract
    *   **Significance:** This highlights a critical limitation of current ML deployments in distributed systems – a lack of continuous learning and adaptation.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Active Inference (AI) can provide a more holistic approach to system management by starting with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and dynamically adapting to ensure their fulfillment.
    *   **Context:** Abstract
    *   **Significance:** This proposes a fundamental shift in how ML models are used, moving beyond reactive monitoring to proactive, goal-oriented control.

3.  **Claim:** Active Inference combines causal inference, free energy minimization, and action-perception cycles to create a robust framework for distributed systems.
    *   **Context:** Section II. Background
    *   **Significance:** This outlines the core principles of AI and how they are applied within the context of distributed systems.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The agent’s behavior can be described by a continuous calibration mechanism, where the agent continuously adjusts its beliefs based on observed outcomes.
    *   **Context:** Section IV. Active Inference Design Process
    *   **Significance:** This highlights the iterative nature of the agent’s learning process and its reliance on feedback.

5.  **Claim:** The agent’s generative model is constructed by a DAG, which represents the causal relations between model variables.
    *   **Context:** Section IV. Active Inference Design Process
    *   **Significance:** This emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causal structure of the system.

6. **Claim:** The agent’s behavior is determined by three main factors: pragmatic value, assigned risk, and information gain.
    *   **Context:** Section IV. Active Inference Design Process
    *   **Significance:** This outlines the agent’s decision-making process, highlighting the interplay of different objectives.
