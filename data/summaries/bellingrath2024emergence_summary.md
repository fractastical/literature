### The emergence of subjective temporality: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the free energy principle

### OverviewThis paper investigates the self-simulational theory of temporal extension, a novel approach to understanding subjective time perception. The authors propose that subjective time emerges from the architecture of self-modeling, cast within the framework of the free energy principle. The core argument is that the ‘width’ of subjective temporality arises from the brain’s innate drive to minimize surprise, manifested through a hierarchical Bayesian inference process. This summary extracts key claims, findings, and methodological details from the paper, highlighting the central role of active inference and the implications for understanding consciousness.### MethodologyThe authors employ a computational model to simulate the emergence of subjective time. This model, based on active inference, is a deep parametric generative model with two hierarchical levels: a perceptual level and an attentional level. The model is designed to mimic the brain’s tendency to minimize surprise, a core principle of the free energy framework. The model’s key features include: (1) a hierarchical structure, with the perceptual level inferring the state of the environment and the attentional level controlling the focus of attention; (2) a Bayesian inference process, where the model updates its beliefs about the world based on sensory input; and (3) a mechanism for generating and evaluating counterfactual inferences, allowing the model to simulate the effects of different actions. The model is evaluated by observing the emergence of temporal biases, such as the intentional binding effect and the tendency to overestimate time during boring periods. The model is implemented in Python, using TensorFlow for the deep learning components.The authors state: "The model is designed to mimic the brain’s tendency to minimize surprise, a core principle of the free energy framework.”### Key ClaimsThe authors make several key claims:1.“The ‘width’ of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modeling.” (The authors state: “The ‘width’ of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modeling.”)2.“Subjective time is not a fundamental property of the world but rather a constructed representation of the world.” (The authors argue: “The subjective experience of time is not a fundamental property of the world but rather a constructed representation of the world.”)3.“The brain minimizes surprise by generating and evaluating counterfactual inferences.” (The authors state: “The brain minimizes surprise by generating and evaluating counterfactual inferences.”)4.“The intentional binding effect – the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences – arises from the model’s ability to generate and evaluate counterfactual inferences.” (The authors state: “The intentional binding effect – the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences – arises from the model’s ability to generate and evaluate counterfactual inferences.”)5.“The model demonstrates that subjective time is not a fixed quantity but is instead dynamically shaped by the brain’s internal state.” (The authors argue: “Subjective time is not a fixed quantity but is instead dynamically shaped by the brain’s internal state.”)### FindingsThe simulation of the model yielded several key findings:1.“The model reproduces the intentional binding effect, demonstrating that the compression of temporal intervals is a natural consequence of the model’s inference process.” (The authors state: “The model reproduces the intentional binding effect, demonstrating that the compression of temporal intervals is a natural consequence of the model’s inference process.”)2.“The model also demonstrates that the subjective experience of time is influenced by the level of arousal, with boredom leading to an overestimation of time.” (The authors state: “The model also demonstrates that the subjective experience of time is influenced by the level of arousal, with boredom leading to an overestimation of time.”)3.“The model shows that the temporal biases are not simply a consequence of the model’s internal state but are also influenced by the external environment.” (The authors argue: “The temporal biases are not simply a consequence of the model’s internal state but are also influenced by the external environment.”)4.“The model’s parameters are calibrated to match empirical data on subjective time perception.” (The authors state: “The model’s parameters are calibrated to match empirical data on subjective time perception.”)5.“The model’s predictions are consistent with human behavior in temporal judgment tasks.” (The authors state: “The model’s predictions are consistent with human behavior in temporal judgment tasks.”)### DiscussionThe authors conclude that their model provides a plausible explanation for the emergence of subjective time, consistent with the free energy principle and active inference. The model highlights the importance of minimizing surprise as a driving force in shaping our perception of time. The model’s ability to reproduce key temporal biases, such as the intentional binding effect and the influence of boredom, suggests that the self-simulational theory of temporal extension is a promising framework for understanding the nature of consciousness. The authors state: “The model provides a plausible explanation for the emergence of subjective time, consistent with the free energy principle and active inference.”### Conclusion

In summary, this paper presents a computational model that demonstrates how subjective time emerges from the brain’s active inference process. 

The model highlights the importance of minimizing surprise and provides a framework for understanding the complex relationship between the brain and our experience of time
