### Overview“Some Minimal Notes on Notation and Minima: A Comment on “How Particular is the Physics of the Free Energy Principle?” by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz, and Buckley” presents a critical assessment of a technical critique of the free energy principle (FEP). The authors, Maxwell J D Ramstead and Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, focus on two key areas of contention: the interpretation of marginal flows and the gradient of surprisal. The paper argues that while the target paper contains accurate observations, it ultimately does not undermine the FEP, and highlights several misinterpretations within the original critique. The authors emphasize the importance of careful notation and the distinction between average flows and their expected values.### MethodologyThe authors’ approach is primarily a detailed critique of the technical arguments presented in the target paper [AMTB22]. They dissect the authors’ claims regarding marginal flows, surprisal, and variational free energy gradients. Specifically, they address an ambiguity in the flow of a system’s mode, and a misinterpretation of the gradient of free energy. The core of their argument rests on demonstrating that the original paper’s assumptions, particularly regarding the interpretation of the flow operator, lead to a nonsensical conclusion. The authors meticulously examine the equations presented in [PDCF20] and [AMTB22], highlighting a crucial error in the notation concerning the average flow. They demonstrate how the original equation3.5, η˙(b) = (Q−Γ)∇I(η,b), should have been written as (cid:104)η˙(b )(cid:105) = (Q−Γ)∇I(η ,b ), emphasizing the importance of the expectation operator. They further illustrate this point with a counterexample involving planar vector fields, demonstrating that equating the gradients of different quantities does not necessarily imply that their flow paths are identical. The authors also analyze the gradient of free energy, arguing that it does not map linearly to the gradient of surprisal, and that this relationship is contingent on specific conditions, such as a linear transformation of the flow. They note that the authors in [AMTB22] correctly identify this issue, but fail to fully connect it to the broader implications for the FEP.### ResultsThe primary result of the authors’ critique is the demonstration that the original paper’s conclusions are accurate, but that they do not invalidate the FEP. They argue that the misinterpretation of the flow operator, as presented in equation3.5, leads to a flawed argument. Specifically, they show that the original paper’s claim that the average flow of a system is equal to the flow of the average is incorrect. They provide a concrete example – the planar vector fields X = (−x,−y) and Y = (y,−x) – to illustrate this point. They demonstrate that the gradients of these two vector fields are different, and that their integral curves are also different. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the interpretation of the flow operator, and the distinction between expected values and actual flows. The authors also demonstrate that the gradient of free energy does not map linearly to the gradient of surprisal, and that this relationship is contingent on specific conditions. They note that the authors in [AMTB22] correctly identify this issue, but do not adequately connect it to the broader implications for the FEP. The authors conclude that the original paper’s critique is valuable in exposing potential pitfalls in the FEP literature, and in highlighting the importance of careful notation and interpretation.### DiscussionThe authors’ discussion centers around the need for precise definitions and careful consideration of assumptions within the FEP. They argue that the misinterpretation of the flow operator, as presented in the target paper, is a significant issue. They state: "The authors state: "the average flow of a system is equal to the flow of the average". They note: "This is incorrect". They argue: "The authors are absolutely correct when they make this point. It is likely this error can be traced back to an unfortunate notational choice in [PDCF20]". They state: "The authors state: "the gradient of free energy ought to be informative about the average flow of external states". They note: "This is not true". They note: "This is not true".### Quotes1. "The authors state: "the average flow of a system is equal to the flow of the average".2. "
