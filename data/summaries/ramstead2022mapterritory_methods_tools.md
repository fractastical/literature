## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a mathematical statement (or indeed a physical principle) which provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches to behaviour and dynamics [4].”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a mathematical statement (or indeed a physical principle) which provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches to behaviour and dynamics [4].”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a mathematical statement (or indeed a physical principle) which provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches to behaviour and dynamics [4].”
*   Maximum Entropy (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP is a mathematical statement (or indeed a physical principle) which provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches to behaviour and dynamics [4].”
*   Bayesian Mechanics (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle (FEP) have been proposed as a universal modelling methodology for physical things, and in particular, for self-organising systems [1–3].”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “These internal states (or their dynamics) are coupled to other (external) subsets of the system in such a way that they can be read as parameters for probability densities over the external subset.”
*   Constraint Maximum Entropy Principle (CMEP) (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP provides a unifying perspective on formal approaches to behaviour and dynamics [4].”
*   Statistical Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian mechanics, a corollary of the FEP, comprises a set of tools to write mechanical theories (i.e., laws of motion) that relate the dynamics of states or paths of a physical system to the dynamics of probabilistic beliefs (or conditional probability densities) that are encoded by some (so-called internal) subsets of the states of the system [5].”
