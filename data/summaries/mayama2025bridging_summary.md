This paper investigates the relationship between integrated information theory (IIT) and the free-energy principle (FEP) in living neuronal networks. The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” They note: “The authors state: “integrated information correlates strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and shows no significant relationship with VFE.” The paper argues: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” According to the research, “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The study demonstrates that “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.” The authors state: “The authors state: “integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.”The research demonstrates that VFE decreases across sessions, while Bayesian surprise and accuracy increase. Network-level analyses reveal that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex follow a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlates strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and shows no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between Φ and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. This suggests that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency.The hill-shaped trajectory of Φ during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation.This paper bridges integrated information theory and the free-energy principle in living neuronal networks
