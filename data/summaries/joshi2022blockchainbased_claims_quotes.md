Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors claim that existing knowledge markets are inefficient due to excessive financing concentration, ineffective information exchange, a lack of security, and mapping issues.
2.  The paper hypothesizes that a decentralized framework incorporating blockchain, active inference, and zero-knowledge proofs can address these inefficiencies.
3.  The authors propose that active inference, specifically free energy analysis, can efficiently map stakeholders in a research contract, providing a more secure and controlled knowledge exchange environment.
4.  The paper suggests that a DAO-like structure, leveraging blockchain, is essential for sustaining a knowledge market over time.
5.  The authors claim that the proposed framework will improve the monetization of knowledge assets and ensure equitable outcomes for both investors and knowledge sellers.

## Important Quotes

"A knowledge market can be described as a type of market where there is a consistent supply of data to satisfy the demand for information and is responsible for the mapping of potential problem solvers with the entities which need these solutions." (Abstract) – *This quote establishes the definition of a knowledge market as presented in the paper.*

"The authors present a decentralized framework incorporating technologies such as blockchain, active inference, zero-knowledge proof, etc. The proposed decentralized framework provides not only an efficient mapping mechanism to map entities in the marketplace but also a more secure and controlled way to share knowledge and services among various stakeholders.” (Abstract) – *This quote highlights the core contribution of the paper: a decentralized framework.*

“Theauthorsstate: “Theproblemwiththeconventionalknowledgetradeisthatit’sclutteredwithaplethoraofintricacies,which,inturn,leadstoinefficientinformationflowbetweenthestakeholders.” (Section 5) – *This quote emphasizes the flaws of the conventional knowledge exchange system.*
