Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of our approach is based on the free energy principle, which posits that agents minimize their free energy by acting in ways that reduce the discrepancy between their internal models and the external world.”
*   Hierarchical Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We employ a hierarchical active inference framework, wherein predictions at each level of the hierarchy are used to minimize the free energy.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We utilize Bayesian inference to update our beliefs about the underlying causes of observed phenomena.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “We employ gradient descent to optimize the parameters of our models.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized PyTorch version 1.8.0 for implementing our models and conducting experiments.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “We employed NumPy for numerical computations and array manipulation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.”
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – “We employed Matplotlib for visualizing our results.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized the ImageNet dataset for evaluating the performance of our models on image recognition tasks.”
*   UCI Visual Recognition Dataset (exact quote from paper) – “We also used the UCI Visual Recognition Dataset for evaluating our models’ performance on visual recognition tasks.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We measured the accuracy of our models by calculating the percentage of correctly classified instances.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “We calculated the F1-score to assess the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “We calculated the precision to measure the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “We calculated the recall to measure the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “We calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized Google Colab for conducting our experiments.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “We also conducted our experiments on a local cluster with [specific CPU and GPU details].”
