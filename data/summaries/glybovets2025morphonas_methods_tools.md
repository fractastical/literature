## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “a free energy principle: a unified brain the-ory: combining integrated information and global neuronal workspace theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active InferenceFramework;TowardSolvingtheHardProblemandCharacterizingAgenticCausation.” – mentioned in [Section 3.2]
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference, morphogenesis, and computational psychiatry.” – mentioned in [Section 3.2]
*   Reaction-Diffusion Systems (exact quote from paper) – “reaction-diffusion (RD) models, first proposed by Alan Turing [3], show how interacting diffusive chemicals (morphogens) can spontaneously break symmetry and form spatial patterns. These patterns emerge from morphogens’ dynamics, mutual interaction and inhibition, a purely bottom-up mechanism.” – mentioned in [Section 2.1]
*   Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) (exact quote from paper) – “GRNs implement the generative model inside each cell, mapping environmental signals to internal states (gene expression, which modulates morphogen secretion) in a way that maximizes the cell’s certainty about its identity or position [4].” – mentioned in [Section 3.2]
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent” – mentioned in [Section 3.3]
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference” – mentioned in [Section 3.2]
*   Maximum Likelihood (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – mentioned in [Section 3.2]
