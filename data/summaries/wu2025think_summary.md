### OverviewThis paper investigates the potential of active inference to improve decentralized execution in multi-agentsystems. The authors propose a novel framework, AIM, that models teammates’ decision-making processes through perception, belief, and action, without relying on explicit communication. AIM utilizes a dual filter mechanism to select relevant teammates and integrate their information, ultimately enhancing collaborative performance.### MethodologyThe authors state: "Inmulti-agentsystems,explicitcognitionofteammates’de-cision logic serves as a critical factor in facilitating coordination. Communication (i.e., “Tell”) can assist in the cognitive development process by information dissemination, yet it is inevitably subject to real-world constraints such as noise, latency, and attacks. Therefore, building the understanding of teammates’ decisions without communication remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel Agent inon-communicationMARLframeworkthatrealizestheconstructionofcognitionthroughlocalobservation-basedmodeling(i.e.,“Think”).Ourframeworkenablesagentstomodel teammates’ active inference process. At first, the proposed method produces three teammate portraits: perception-belief-action. Specifically, we model the teammate’s decision process as follows:1) Perception: observing environments;2) Belief: forming beliefs;3) Action: making decisions. Then, we selectively integrate the belief portrait into the decision process based on the accuracy and relevance of the perception portrait. This enables the selection of cooperative teammates and facilitates effective collaboration. Extensive experiments on the SMAC, SMACv2, MPE, and GRF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.bandwidth, high latency, and significant noise (Tung et al.2021; Hu et al.2023; Song et al.2025). Therefore, we explore the method for developing the cognition of teammates’ decisions without communication.In contrast to directly telling an agent how its teammates act, we advocate that agents could engage in “Think how your teammates think”. Specifically, the agent actively builds comprehension of teammates’ decisions. To achieve this, the direct method is to model teammates’ decision process. However, existing agent modeling methods fail to fully fill this. On the one hand, some methods rely on access to other agents’ trajectories during the modeling (Rabinowitz et al.2018; Zintgraf et al.2021), which is unavailable during decentralized execution. On the other hand, some methods typically only enable a single agent to model other agents that possess fixed parameters (Xie et al.2021; Papoudakis, Christianos, and Albrecht2021; Yu, Jiang, and Lu2024). This configuration imposes an upper bound on the system’s collaborative efficiency, preventing the team from learning more optimal policies. Furthermore, these methods only model incomplete decision components (e.g., behaviors or intentions), risking inaccuracies from discrepancies between the model and the actual situation. To address this, we rely solely on local observations to model teammates’ complete decision processes, reducing modeling inaccuracies during decentralized execution.Inspired by human brain decision-making mechanisms and active inference theory (Friston et al.2016), we model the teammate’s decision process as an active inference process comprising perception-belief-action. In this process, the teammate perceives environments, forms beliefs, and then takes actions by integrating perceptions and beliefs. Consequently, we employ local observation-based modeling (i.e., “Think”) to acquire teammates’ perception-belief-action. Figure1 provides an illustrative example of this modeling process.In this paper, we propose a novel non-communication framework for modeling Active Inference of teammates (AIM). The framework consists of two parts: At first, we develop a modeling method to model teammates’ three portraits: perception-belief-action, solely based on local observations. Meanwhile, the perception and belief portraits are optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and actual actions. Then, we propose a dual filter mechanism to enhance teammates’ cognition utilization. This mechanism features selective collaboration by choosing teammates whose modeled portraits have high accuracy. Additionally, by considering the perception relevance among agents, we adopt an attention module dynamically integrates teammates’ belief portraits, thereby optimizing the decision process. Our proposed method demonstrates significant improvement in tasks within SMAC(Samvelyanetal.2019),SMACv2(Ellisetal.2024),MPE(MordatchandAbbeel2018)andGRF(Kurachetal.2020).### ResultsThe authors state: “Ourframeworkenablesagentstomodelteammates’activeinferenceprocess.” The authors note: “Ourframeworkenablesagentstomodelteammates’activeinferenceprocess.” The authors add: “Ourframeworkenablesagentstomodelteammates’activeinferenceprocess.”### DiscussionThecompletelossfortheteammateportraitviaactiveinferenceisexpressedas:### Dual FilterofAccuracyandRelevanceDuetolocalobservation,errorsintheactiveinferenceprocess are unavoidable. Indiscriminately utilizing erroneous portraits of teammates can directly distort the agent’s comprehension of the current environment, resulting in non-cooperative behavior. Furthermore, since collaboration in multi-agent systems is often localized, it is redundant to incorporate the portraits of all teammates in decision-making. Hence, we propose a dual filter mechanism for selecting cooperative teammates, focusing on two aspects: the accuracy and relevance of portraits.DualFilterofAccuracyandRelevance

### ConclusionandDiscussionIn this paper, we propose AIM, a novel framework that replaces explicit communication (i.e., “Tell”) with agent modeling (i.e., “Think”) to construct the cognition of teammates’ decision logic. AIM models teammates’ active inference through perception, belief, and action, and employs a dual filter mechanism to select relevant teammates and integrate their information. Experiments validate the effectiveness of AIM. 

However, in scenarios where selective collaboration is required, AIM selects a fixed set of top k teammates as collaborators. 

The dynamic selection of collaborative teammates based on portraits remains an open issue and is left for future work.
