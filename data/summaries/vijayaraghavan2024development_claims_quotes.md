Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, formatted according to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper proposes a novel framework for developing compositionality and generalization in robotic learning through the integration of language, proprioception, and visual information, driven by the free-energy principle.
2.  **Hypothesis:**  The model’s ability to learn and execute complex behaviors is enhanced by the associative learning between language and sensorimotor patterns.
3.  **Key Finding:**  Generalization performance improves significantly with increased task composition variation, suggesting that the model’s ability to self-organize compositional structures in the linguistic latent state space is crucial.
4.  **Key Finding:** The model’s performance is significantly impacted by the presence of visual attention and working memory modules, highlighting their importance in accurately generating visuo-proprioceptive sequences.
5.  **Key Finding:** The model demonstrates the ability to infer linguistically represented goals from observed visuo-proprioceptive sequences, indicating a successful integration of language and action.
