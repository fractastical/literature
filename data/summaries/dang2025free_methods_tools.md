## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle provides a unified framework for understanding cognitive processes by minimizing surprise and maintaining cognitive stability through internal predictions and adjustments"
*   Cognitive Process Modeling (exact quote from paper) – "A cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics"
*   Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (exact quote from paper) – "The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is employed to train the AV’s decision-making policy, leveraging its maximum entropy objective to encourage exploration and robustness"
*   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) (exact quote from paper) – "A Graph Convolutional Network is integrated into both the actor and critic networks to capture structured multi-agent interactions"
*   Bayesian Updating (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian updating is used to refine the agent’s belief about others’ behavior based on observed data and prior assumptions"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "Gradient descent is used to optimize the policy parameters during the training process"
*   Maximum Entropy (exact quote from paper) – “The SAC algorithm is based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims to maximize the entropy of the policy distribution”
*   Cognitive Uncertainty (exact quote from paper) – “Cognitive uncertainty is approximated by computing the KL divergence between the predicted and observed distributions”
*   Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “Free energy is defined as the difference between the agent’s internal state and the external environment, representing the agent’s surprise or error”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is used for numerical computation and array manipulation"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks, including clustering and classification"
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – "Matplotlib is used for data visualization"

## Datasets

*   Hamburg Bergedorf Station (HBS) dataset (exact quote from paper) – "The HBS dataset, containing 78 representative interaction scenarios involving a single AV and three pedestrians"
*   (No other datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper)

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Success Rate (exact quote from paper) – "The success rate is defined as the proportion of episodes in which the AV reaches its destination without any collisions"
*   Collision Rate (exact quote from paper) – "The collision rate is defined as the frequency of collisions with surrounding agents"
*   Timeout Rate (exact quote from paper) – "The timeout rate accounts for episodes where the AV fails to reach its destination within the maximum allowed time despite avoiding collisions"
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for training and evaluating the AV decision-making model”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “A local cluster is utilized for computationally intensive simulations”
*   (No specific hardware specifications are mentioned)
