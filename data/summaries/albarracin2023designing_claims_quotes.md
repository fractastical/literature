Okay, here’s the extraction of key claims and quotes from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes that active inference, a variational principle of information physics, can be leveraged to design explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Specifically, it argues that active inference provides a framework for modeling core aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection.

2.  **Hypothesis:** By incorporating active inference into AI systems, it is possible to create systems that can generate and explain their own decisions, mirroring the processes of human-like introspection.

3.  **Core Claim:** The proposed AI architecture foregrounds an explicit hierarchical generative model, which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The development of an AI system based on active inference will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying human decision-making and behavior.

5.  **Core Claim:** The paper suggests that the ability to model the internal states and beliefs of an AI system is crucial for achieving explainability and transparency.

6.  **Hypothesis:**  The integration of active inference into AI systems will result in systems that are more robust and adaptable to changing environments.

## Important Quotes

1.  “We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions.” (Introduction) – *This quote establishes the paper's central focus: applying active inference to decision-making, introspection, and action generation.*
