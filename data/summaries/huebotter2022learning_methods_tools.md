## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core principle of the model is based on the free energy principle, which states that an agent’s perception, action, and learning are driven by minimizing the expected free energy of the system"
*   Transition Model (exact quote from paper) – "The transition model is a recurrent neural network that predicts the next state based on the current state and the control input"
*   Policy Model (exact quote from paper) – "The policy model is a neural network that generates the control actions based on the current state and target state"
*   Markov Decision Process (exact quote from paper) – "The system is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in discrete time t ∈ Z"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the loss function"
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the transition and policy models”
*   Auto-regressive inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses auto-regressive inference to predict the next state”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy for numerical computation"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas for data manipulation and analysis"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms"
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – "Matplotlib for data visualization"

## Datasets

*   Eight equidistant targets (exact quote from paper) – "The task involves reaching eight equidistant targets in sequence starting from the center position"
