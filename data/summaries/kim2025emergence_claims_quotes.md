Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel computational model for intrinsic motivation based on a "self-prior," an internal density model that learns a statistical representation of sensory experiences.
2.  The central hypothesis is that this self-prior mechanism can autonomously induce goal-directed behaviors in an agent, even without explicit external reward criteria.
3.  The authors hypothesize that the self-prior allows agents to resolve mismatches between their internal model of the world and incoming sensory data, driving behavior towards alignment.
4.  The research investigates the potential for integrating the self-prior with active inference frameworks, combining the benefits of both approaches.
5.  The authors aim to demonstrate that the self-prior can generate reaching behaviors toward a stimulus (sticker) in a simulated environment.
