Okay, here’s a summary of the paper “From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference” adhering to all the specified requirements:### OverviewThis paper investigates the potential of scale-free active inference for modelling complex systems, specifically drawing on the principles of Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. The authors propose a novel approach to modelling complex systems by leveraging scale-free dynamics and hierarchical representations, offering a potential solution to the challenges of modelling complex systems.### MethodologyThe authors employ a scale-free approach to modelling complex systems, using a hierarchical dynamical system to represent the system is a series of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a variable in the system. 

The model is based on a 

Bayesian framework, where each node is associated with a prior probability distribution, and the model is updated as new data is observed. 

The authors use a scale-free approach to modelling complex systems, using a hierarchical dynamical system to represent the system is a series of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a variable in the system.
