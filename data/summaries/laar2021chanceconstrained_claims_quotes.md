Okay, let's begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Chance-Constrained Active Inference:** The paper proposes a novel approach to active inference (ActInf) by incorporating chance constraints, allowing for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation. This contrasts with traditional ActInf, which constrains all realizations of a random variable.

2.  **Bayesian Surprise and Free Energy:** The paper builds upon the free energy principle (FEP) and the concept of Bayesian surprise, defining the free energy as a bound on the current and future expected statistical surprise.

3.  **Message Passing Framework:** The core contribution is the development of a message-passing framework for chance-constrained ActInf, enabling modularity and scalability. This framework leverages variational calculus to solve the optimization problem.

4.  **General Purpose Message Passing:** The proposed framework can be applied to a wide range of graphical models, including those with chance constraints, and can be combined with pre-derived message update rules.

5.  **Corrected Beliefs:** The paper demonstrates that chance constraints lead to the formation of corrected beliefs, where the probability mass is constrained to lie within a safe region, as described by the authors.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of the random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote clearly articulates the central innovation of the paper – the shift from strict prior constraints to allowing for probability of constraint violation.
