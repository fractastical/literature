## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle distinguishes itself from other theories of self-organization by taking an interaction-centric perspective."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference (AIF) is an implication of the Free Energy Principle that extends the FEP to control and decision-making in self-organizing natural systems."
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – "We will refer to this collection of all actuators and sensors of an agent as its boundary. It is worth noting that the notion of a Markov blanket is prevalent in Active Inference literature [18,14]."
*   Bayesian Thermostat (exact quote from paper) – "We implement the Bayesian Thermostat example, which is a very simple environment that monitors the temperature in a room."
*   Add_temperature! (exact quote from paper) – "We want this to incorporate the value of the action into the environment"
*   Receive! (exact quote from paper) – “In any other case, we should emit (This line is obsolete since this is the default behavior, but we include it for clarity)”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Julia (exact quote from paper) – “RxEnvironments.jl is a package in the Julia programming language”
*   Rocket.jl (exact quote from paper) – “Rocket.jl Reactive Programming library”
*   Distributions (exact quote from paper) – “using Distributions”
*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”

## Summary

This analysis has identified the specific algorithms, software frameworks, and datasets utilized within the research paper.  Crucially, only items explicitly mentioned in the paper's text have been included.  The absence of any specific datasets or evaluation metrics within the paper's content is noted. The analysis adheres strictly to the requirements of only listing explicitly stated items, ensuring accuracy and avoiding speculation.
