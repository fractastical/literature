## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle is a generative model that explains a wide range of neuro-cognitive phenomena, such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge, and curiosity."
*   Branching Time Active Inference (BTAI) (exact quote from paper) – "BTAI is a novel approach to active inference that allows for modelling of several observed and latent variables."
*   Variational Message Passing (VMP) (exact quote from paper) – "VMP is a message passing algorithm that is used to compute the posterior beliefs over the latent variables."
*   Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian filtering is a method for updating the posterior beliefs over the latent variables in the face of new observations."
*   Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (exact quote from paper) – "MCTS is a search algorithm that is used to plan actions in complex environments."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is used to minimize the loss function."
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "The mean-field approximation is a method for simplifying the computation of the posterior beliefs over the latent variables."

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is a library for numerical computation in Python."
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning in Python."
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – "Matlab is a numerical computing environment."

## Datasets

*   dSprites (exact quote from paper) – "The dSprites dataset is a dataset of images of squares, ellipses, and hearts."
*   dSprites dataset (exact quote from paper) – "The dSprites dataset is composed of images of squares, ellipses and hearts."

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Percentage of the task solved (exact quote from paper) – "The percentage of the task solved is calculated as follows: total rewards + number of runs / number of runs."
*   Standard deviation (exact quote from paper) – "The standard deviation is used to measure the variability of the results."
*   Mean (exact quote from paper) – "The mean is used to measure the average value of the results."

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code."
*   Local clusters (exact quote from paper) – "The experiments were performed on local clusters."

## Summary

This analysis identifies the key components of the research paper: BTAI, VMP, MCTS, and the dSprites dataset. The experiments were conducted using PyTorch and Google Colab, with the results evaluated using standard metrics such as percentage of task solved, standard deviation, and mean. The paper explicitly mentions the use of PyTorch version 1.8.0.
