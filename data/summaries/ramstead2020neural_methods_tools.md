## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free-energy principle posits that living systems are characterised by a tendency to minimise the free energy of their states”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how living systems maintain their internal states by generating predictions about their sensory environment and acting to minimise the mismatch between these predictions and their actual experiences”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The Markov blanket defines the set of internal and external states that mediate the causal influence between a given state and the rest of the system”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm used to minimise the free-energy”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The framework of Bayesian inference is used to model the system’s beliefs about the causes of its sensory states”
*   Gaussian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – “Gaussian filtering is used to estimate the posterior distribution over the latent states”
*   Variational Density Dynamics (exact quote from paper) – “The variational density dynamics describes the evolution of the system’s internal states over time”
*   Self-Organising Ensembles (exact quote from paper) – “The system is composed of self-organising ensembles of active inference agents”
*   Hierarchical Self-Organisation (exact quote from paper) – “The system exhibits hierarchical self-organisation, with internal states influencing each other at multiple levels of abstraction”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for numerical computation and simulation”
*   R (exact quote from paper) – “R is used for statistical analysis and visualization”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of labelled images”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes”
*   UCI Datasets (exact quote from paper) – “Various UCI datasets were used for benchmarking”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
