Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a message-passing realization of Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization, transforming EFE minimization directly as a variational inference problem.
2.  The core hypothesis is that by introducing appropriate epistemic priors, the computational challenges associated with EFE minimization can be overcome, enabling efficient policy inference.
3.  The authors claim that their approach offers a practical and computationally tractable method for planning under uncertainty, particularly in complex environments with high-dimensional state spaces.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the proposed method will demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional control-as-inference approaches, especially in handling epistemic uncertainty.
5.  The authors state that their approach bridges the theoretical framework of the Free Energy Principle with practical implementations for artificial agents.
