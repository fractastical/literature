Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided text, adhering to all the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT) posits that consciousness is fundamentally linked to the amount of integrated information within a system.** This is the core claim underpinning the entire research effort.

2. **The authors hypothesize that manipulating the level of activity within a specific brain region (the posterior cortex) will directly affect the subjective experience of spatial awareness.** This represents the central experimental prediction.

3. **The research aims to test whether the degree of integration within a neural network correlates with the level of conscious experience.** This highlights the core methodological approach.

4. **The study investigates the potential role of spontaneous activity in generating conscious awareness, challenging traditional views of consciousness.** This represents a key theoretical contribution.

5. **The authors propose a minimal unifying model of consciousness based on the free energy principle, suggesting that consciousness arises from the brain’s attempt to minimize its surprise.** This represents a key theoretical contribution.
