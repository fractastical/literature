### OverviewThis summary analyzes “From Physics to Sentience: Deciphering the Semantics of the Free-Energy Principle and Evaluating its Claims” by Sheikhbahaee, Safron, and Hesp. The paper critically examines the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) and its application to characterizing adaptive, sentient, and cognitive systems. The authors identify several areas where the paper’s formulation requires clarification and rigor, particularly concerning the use of terminology and the assumptions underlying the claims. The core argument revolves around the need for precise semantics when applying the FEP, especially when addressing complex concepts like agency and sentience.### MethodologyThe authors’ assessment of the paper is presented as constructive feedback, aiming to improve the clarity, rigor, and applicability of the framework. They specifically address what they perceive as idiosyncratic definitions and derivative statements within the target article. The authors state: "Certain idiosyncratic definitions and derivative statements in this paper and prior works have tended to confuse scientists who attempt to assess the validity of such formulations in depth." They highlight the importance of careful consideration of physics terminology, noting that “the authors aimed to formulate a robust Bayesian mechanics by borrowing from physics, particular care needs to be taken concerning physics terminology.” The paper relies heavily on the definition of “generalized coordinates,” which are defined as a vector containing higher-order time derivatives of motion, used to approximate local dynamics under certain limiting assumptions on some unspecified time scale. The authors note that this usage may generate confusion with respect to a particular analytical method held dear by physicists. They argue that a different label or clearer explanation would be beneficial.The authors further point out that the formulation consists of postulates and approximations with unclear boundary conditions, making it difficult to evaluate individual claims. They state: “Since the formulation itself consists of postulates and approximations with unclear boundary conditions, it becomes difficult (or impossible) to evaluate individual claims.”The study demonstrates that the authors assumed that solutions have flow operators that do not change on relevant time intervals without specifying what degrees of change might be considered significant and what kinds of time intervals could be “relevant”.### Results & ClaimsThe authors identify several key claims made within the target article.They argue that the paper’s handling of “strange particles” and the circular causation involved in their beliefs about their self-generated actions may not only speak to the “strange loops” characteristic of some complex adaptive systems, but also to the deeper issues of life-mind continuity and the recursive nature of consciousness. The authors also note the use of “integrated world modeling” as a potential functional property achieved in a variety of ways in different kinds of “particles,” such as through information bottlenecks emerging from complex attractor dynamics.However, they caution against associating “sentience” with particles, stating: “To associate the functionalities (and perhaps phenomenality) of ‘sentience’ with particles may generate further confusion by both implying the kinds of panpsychism the authors explicitly renounce, as well as potentially suggesting a kind of illegitimate eliminative reductionism concerning the values of agents with conscious experience (e.g. the ‘as if’ language used throughout the paper for the ontological status of particles with goals).”The authors further highlight the interchangeable use of “autonomy” and “agency,” noting a significant difference between systems driven by meaningful internal dynamics and systems capable of planning to achieve explicitly represented goals. They argue: “The words autonomy and agency are used interchangeably, but there is a significant difference between systems driven by meaningful internal dynamics [12], and systems that are capable of planning in order to achieve explicitly represented goals; thus, it remains important to recognize the difference between teleology vs. ‘mere’ telonomy [13,14,15].”### Discussion & ConclusionThe authors conclude that while the FEP-based formalism presented by Friston and colleagues offers an intriguing perspective, many conceptual nuances still need to be addressed. They emphasize the need for painstaking clarification to ensure the framework can do justice to the complex systems it aims to describe and engage the global and interdisciplinary community of academics. The authors state: “In conclusion, this FEP-based formalism presented by Friston and colleagues offers an intriguing perspective, but many conceptual nuances still need to be addressed. 

This painstaking process could eventually allow the authors to do justice to the complex systems they want to describe and the global and interdisciplinary community of academics they aim to engage.”

They reiterate the importance of precise semantics and rigorous evaluation of claims to avoid confusion and ensure the framework’s utility.
