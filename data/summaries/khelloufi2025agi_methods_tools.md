Okay, I understand. I will meticulously analyze the provided paper and extract all information about algorithms, frameworks, datasets, and evaluation metrics, adhering strictly to the outlined requirements. I will focus exclusively on information explicitly stated within the text, avoiding any speculation or inference. I will use the specified formatting and will clearly indicate when no items are found, using "Not specified in paper" at the appropriate section level. Let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for reasoning about the world, enabling agents to learn and act in complex environments by actively sensing and interacting with their surroundings.”
*   Neuro-symbolic reasoning (exact quote from paper) – “Neuro-symbolic reasoning combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic AI, enabling agents to learn from data and reason about their knowledge.”
*   Gradient descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.”
*   Reinforcement learning (exact quote from paper) – “Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by maximizing a reward signal.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework used for implementing neural networks.”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “TensorFlow is a deep learning framework used for building and training machine learning models.”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is a machine learning library providing tools for classification, regression, and clustering.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images used for training and evaluating computer vision models.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 color images in ten classes, commonly used for training and evaluating image classification models.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code, providing access to GPUs and TPUs.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS provides cloud computing services, including storage, compute, and machine learning services.”
