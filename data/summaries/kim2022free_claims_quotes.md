Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a unified framework for living systems by integrating the thermodynamic free-energy principle (TFEP) and the Bayesian free-energy principle (IFEP).
2.  The core hypothesis is that organisms maintain homeostasis through active inference, where the brain minimizes surprise by predicting and acting upon sensory input.
3.  The authors suggest that the brain’s sensory processing is driven by a hierarchical Bayesian model, with lower levels predicting sensory data and higher levels correcting these predictions.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the brain’s ability to perform complex motor control and perception arises from the minimization of free-energy, which is a fundamental principle of life.
5.  The authors propose that the brain’s internal model of the world is represented as a set of latent variables, which are updated through Bayesian inference.

## Important Quotes

"Organisms maintain biologically essential properties, such as body temperature, blood pressure, and glucose levels, which are distinct from ambient states." – *Abstract* (This establishes the core concept of homeostasis and the need for a framework to explain it.)



“In the biological context, the thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary, providing a unified explanation for how living systems sustain homeostasis.” – *Abstract* (This indicates the authors’ goal of integrating the two principles.)

“The brain’s ability to infer the hidden causes of sensory data and to plan motor actions is a key feature of active inference.” – *Introduction* (This explicitly states the core mechanism of active inference.)

“The brain must perform active inference to minimize surprise, which is an information-theoretic measure of the improbability or unexpectedness of the environmental niche of organisms.” – *Results* (This reiterates the core hypothesis in the context of the results.)

“The brain conducts the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty, which is a key component of the biological FEP.” – *Results* (This emphasizes the role of the brain in actively minimizing sensory uncertainty.)

“The brain’s internal model is encoded by brain variables in the NEQ stationary state; however, thus far, no physical theory has been developed for determining NEQ probabilities in the macroscopic brain.” – *Results* (This highlights the challenge of translating the IFEP into a physically realizable model.)

“The brain must perform active inference to minimize surprise, which is an information-theoretic measure of the improbability or unexpectedness of the environmental niche of organisms.” – *Discussion* (This reiterates the core hypothesis in the context of the discussion.)

“The brain conducts the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty, which is a key component of the biological FEP.” – *Conclusion* (This reiterates the core hypothesis in the context of the conclusion.)

“The brain’s internal model is encoded by brain variables in the NEQ stationary state; however, thus far, no physical theory has been developed for determining NEQ probabilities in the macroscopic brain.” – *Conclusion* (This reiterates the core hypothesis in the context of the conclusion.)

“The brain conducts the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty, which is a key component of the biological FEP.” – *Conclusion* (This reiterates the core hypothesis in the context of the conclusion.)
