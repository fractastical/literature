Okay, let's begin. Here's the extracted information from the provided research paper text, formatted according to the specified requirements:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The core hypothesis** of the paper is that active inference, specifically using the generalized Kelly criterion, provides an optimal framework for discriminative neural network classification, leading to improved performance and robustness.
2. **The central claim** is that the proposed approach, combining a variational free energy (VFE) with the Kelly criterion, offers a tighter upper bound on the expected complexity of the active inference process.
3. **A key claim** is that incorporating prior probabilities and uncertainty estimates into the training process can significantly improve the classification accuracy and robustness of the neural network.
4. **A central hypothesis** is that the proposed method effectively addresses the imbalance in class-sample distributions, a common challenge in many classification problems.
5. **A key claim** is that the proposed approach, by leveraging the Kelly criterion, enables the network to adapt its learning strategy based on the observed uncertainty in the data.
