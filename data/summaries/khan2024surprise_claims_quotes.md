Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel framework for understanding allostasis and adaptive regulation by coupling information-theoretic prediction errors (from active inference) with affective, stress-related hormonal dynamics (specifically, cortisol).

2.  **Hypothesis:** Cortisol, when acting as an allostatic mediator, provides adaptive advantages to an agent’s long-term physiological regulation.

3.  **Claim:** The authors argue that the coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, hormonal dynamics can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The model presented in this paper can be used to test the hypothesis that allostatic regulation is not simply a reactive response to environmental change, but rather a proactive, anticipatory process driven by internal hormonal dynamics.

## Important Quotes


2.  “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This highlights the central argument of the paper.*

3. “Prediction errors (surprisal) are, in turn, associated with the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive, allostatic mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This defines the core mechanism proposed by the paper.*

4. “It is not simply that the agent reacts to deviations from its internal set points, but rather that it actively anticipates these deviations and adjusts its internal state accordingly.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This clarifies the proactive nature of allostatic regulation.*

5. “The generative model is endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This describes the experimental setup.*

6. “We argue that coupling information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This summarizes the paper’s central contribution.*

7. “The agent aims to maintain its viability by keeping its life-critical internal variables above their target values.” (The authors state: “The agent aims to maintain its viability by keeping its life-critical internal variables above their target values.”) – *This describes the agent’s primary goal.*

8. “In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive, allostatic mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology.” (The authors state: “We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner.”) – *This outlines the model’s core components.*

9. “The agent must infer the (hidden) state that it believes causes the interoceptive and exteroceptive signals that it observes.” (The authors state: “The agent must infer the (hidden) state that it believes causes the interoceptive and exteroceptive signals that it observes.”) – *This describes the agent’s inference process.*
