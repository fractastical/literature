Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The primary claim** is that a dynamic cognitive map can be constructed autonomously in complex environments, mimicking biological navigation strategies. The authors propose a novel computational model integrating active inference and a generative model to achieve this.

2.  **The authors hypothesize** that by combining visual observations and proprioception, the model can dynamically expand its internal map, anticipating novel locations and adapting to changing environmental structures.

3.  **A key claim** is that the model’s performance, as measured against the Clone-Structured Cognitive Graph (CSCG) model, demonstrates superior efficiency and adaptability in learning environmental structures, particularly in terms of minimizing navigation overlap.

4.  **The authors propose** that the model’s autonomous exploration and decision-making are driven by a Free Energy minimization process, aligning with biological navigation mechanisms.

5.  **A central hypothesis** is that the model’s ability to learn and navigate effectively stems from its dynamic cognitive map, which is continuously updated based on both observed data and internal predictions.
