Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a novel interpretation of the Watt governor as a system embodying active inference, challenging the traditional view of it as simply a dynamicist model.

2.  **Hypothesis:** The authors hypothesize that the Watt governor can be understood as an agent actively minimizing its prediction error by adjusting its actions (valve opening) to better match its perceived environment (engine speed).

3.  **Key Finding:** The authors demonstrate that the Watt governor’s behavior can be described using a generative model based on variational free energy minimization, similar to active inference frameworks.

4.  **Key Finding:** The paper argues that the internal representation of the governor is not necessarily a “black box” representation of the system, but rather a functional description of the agent’s interaction with its environment.

5.  **Key Finding:** The authors show that the governor’s behavior is consistent with a Bayesian inference process, where the agent updates its internal model based on incoming sensory data (engine speed) and prior beliefs.

6.  **Hypothesis:** The authors suggest that the Watt governor’s design reflects a fundamental principle of active inference, where agents actively shape their environment to reduce their uncertainty.

## Important Quotes

1.  “The authors state: “At the same time, he then questioned whether computational descriptions of the governor offered any explanatory power over the dynamical systems theory.”” (Introduction) – *This quote highlights the initial context of the paper and the challenge it addresses.*

2.  “The authors state: “We introduce an active inference formulation of the Watt governor, asystemoftenportrayedasthecanonical‘anti-representational’metaphorforcognition.”” (Abstract) – *This establishes the core methodological approach of the paper.*

3.  “The authors state: “Under the FEP and related approaches, perception is usually characterised as a process of (approximate Bayesian) inference on the hidden states and causes that generates sensory input.”” (Introduction) – *This quote defines the theoretical framework underpinning the paper’s approach.*

4.  “The authors state: “We define a Watt governor as a conical pendulum with two flyballs (the ‘bobs’) travelling at constant angular speed φ.”” (Figure 1 Caption) – *This provides the specific definition of the system being studied.*

5.  “The authors state: “ψ˙=(φ)2sin(ψ)cos(ψ)− sin(ψ)− ψ˙”” (Equation 1) – *This is a key equation describing the dynamics of the system.*

6.  “The authors state: “Atrest,theflyballsaresubjecttogravitationalforceandthetwoarm sare in a vertical position while the engine’s valve is fully open.”” (Figure 1 Caption) – *This describes the initial state of the system.*

7.  “The authors state: “As the engine is powered and steam flows into the cylinders via the fully open valve, the engine’s flywheel velocity is increased, alongside the vertical spin-dle’sangularvelocity.”” (Figure 1 Caption) – *This describes the dynamic process of the system.*

8.  “The authors state: “The steam engine was attached via a flywheel with a ratio of n”” (Equation 2) – *This describes the gear ratio between the flywheel and the engine.*

9.  “The authors state: “The dynamicsofthegenerativemodelareoverdamped”” (Equation 11) – *This describes the dynamics of the system.*

10. “The authors state: “At the same time, they are in a vertical position while the engine’s valve is fully open.”” (Figure 1 Caption) – *This describes the initial state of the system.*
