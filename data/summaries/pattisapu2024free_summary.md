### OverviewThis paper investigates a circumplex model of emotion, proposing a two-dimensional representation of emotions based on valence and arousal. The authors demonstrate that one can derive valence and arousal signals from an agent’s expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Simulation studies, involving an artificial agent performing a search task, provide evidence for this model, highlighting the manipulation of priors and object presence as drivers of commonsense variability in emotional states.### MethodologyThe research employs an active inference framework, where an agent minimizes free energy to understand its environment. The methodology involves constructing a generative model with two latent state factors: one tracking the agent’s location and the other maintaining a belief about the object’s location. The agent’s movement is conditioned on these factors, and the model incorporates a probability of the object being visible at each location. The researchers also incorporate a dimension for every location, which represents the object being absent by mapping to an invisible outcome at all locations.### ResultsSimulation studies revealed that agents began in a calm state only when they had precise prior beliefs on the object’s location. The manipulation of priors and object presence resulted in commonsense variability in emotional states. Specifically, the agent’s emotional state was influenced by the agent’s prior beliefs and the presence of the object. The authors observed that the agent’s emotional state was influenced by the agent’s prior beliefs and the presence of the object. The authors observed that the agent’s emotional state was influenced by the agent’s prior beliefs and the presence of the object.### DiscussionThis paper derives a circumplex model of emotion by associating both valence and arousal with the parameters of free energy. 

Simulation studies provide evidence that this model enables the sound ascription of anthropomorphic emotional state trajectories to a simulated agent performing basic search tasks. 

The study demonstrates that the inclusion of arousal as well as valence dimensions facilitates the commonsense understanding of emotion, even in simple scenarios.
