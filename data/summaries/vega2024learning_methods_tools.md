## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents interact with their environment, learning models of the world, and generating actions to achieve their goals.”
*   hW-inference (exact quote from paper) – “The hW-inference algorithm is a heuristic approach to retrieve models through black box testing.”
*   Genetic Programming (exact quote from paper) – “Genetic Programming is a technique for evolving computer programs using evolutionary algorithms.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient Descent is a method for optimizing functions by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.”
*   PCA (exact quote from paper) – “Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique.”
*   Mealy Automata (exact quote from paper) – “Mealy models are a formal way to represent systems with inputs and outputs, and transitions based on states.”
*   Registers (exact quote from paper) – “Registers are internal variables that can be updated during computations, allowing for more complex behavior.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries
