## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle suggests that the computing mechanisms in the brain accounting for perception, action and learning can be explained as a process of minimisation of an upper bound on surprise called free energy."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "We use a gradient descent optimisation method"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "active inference [6], [7], can explain motor control and decision making as an optimisation of free energy constrained by prior beliefs."
*   Kohonen Self-Organising Maps (exact quote from paper) – "Kohonen map [1] takes as input a 64x64 gray scale image."
*   Reservoir Computing (exact quote from paper) – "Reservoir computing (RC) techniques [9], [10]."
*   Random Search (exact quote from paper) – "random search"
*   Iterative Free-Energy Optimisation (exact quote from paper) – "We use a gradient descent optimisation method"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy, Pandas, etc."
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "scikit-learn"

## Datasets

*   Uci Machine Learning Repository (exact quote from paper) – "Uci machine learning repository"
