## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems (or artificial agents) maintain themselves in their characteristic states by minimizing the difference between the predictions of their internal model and their actual sensory data, a quantity known as free energy."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference (AIF), which operationalizes the FreeEnergy Principle, are two key objective functions: Variational Free Energy (VFE) and Expected Free Energy (EFE)."
*   Variational Free Energy (VFE) (exact quote from paper) – "This function quantifies the fitness of an agent’s internal model concerning the sensory observations it receives from its environment by mapping latent (hidden) states to sensory outcomes."
*   Expected Free Energy (EFE) (exact quote from paper) – "This function governs the agent’s policy selection by combining extrinsic value (goal-oriented behavior, aligned with the agent’s prior preferences) and epistemic value (exploration-driven behavior to reduce uncertainty in the agent’s model of the world)."
*   Bayes’ Rule (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes’ rule: P(o|s)P(s) = P(s|o)P(o)”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The agent minimizes this free energy by iteratively updating its approximate posterior Q(s)”
*   Dirichlet Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “The Dirichlet distribution is used as the prior distribution over the hidden states”
*   Categorical Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “The categorical distribution is used as the likelihood of the observations”
*   Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence: (cid:90) Q(s) D [Q(s)∥P(s|o)]= Q(s)ln ds”
*   Hebbian Learning Rule (exact quote from paper) – “A Hebbian-like learning rule updates the A matrix by strengthening associations between states and observations that co-occur”
*   State-Only Control (exact quote from paper) – “The agent is providing observations to itself via the sampling of the A matrix”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries
