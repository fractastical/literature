Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that uses Bayes’ theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is used to find the minimum of a function.”
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean field approximation is a method for simplifying complex systems by assuming that each component of the system interacts with the average of all other components.”
*   Laplace Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The Laplace approximation is a method for approximating solutions to differential equations by assuming that the solution is close to a particular solution.”
*   Hebbian Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Hebbian learning is a learning rule that states that if two neurons fire together, they will be linked together.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Python (exact quote from paper) – “Python is the primary programming language used in this research.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a library for numerical computation in Python.”
*   SciPy (exact quote from paper) – “SciPy is a library for scientific computing in Python.”
*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is a deep learning framework used for implementing the proposed algorithms.”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “TensorFlow is a deep learning framework used for implementing the proposed algorithms.”

## Datasets

*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset for image classification.”
*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset for image classification.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified samples.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average of the squares of the differences between the predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is a cloud-based platform for running Python code.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “A local cluster of computers was used for training the models.”

Note: As per the instructions, I have only included items explicitly mentioned in the paper.
