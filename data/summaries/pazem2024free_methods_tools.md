Okay, let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP posits that adaptive systems can be modeled as performing an approximate form of Bayesian inference”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “the agent’s behavior is determined by its internal model of the environment, which it uses to predict sensory inputs and plan actions”
*   Variational Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “the variational free energy (VFE) is an upper bound on the surprise”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “the outcome of this process minimizes a quantity called the variational free energy (VFE)”
*   Markov Blanket (exact quote from paper) – “The Markov blanket is a set of variables that completely determine the state of a node in a Bayesian network”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm uses gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the neural network”
*   Projective Simulation (PS) (exact quote from paper) – “PS is a model for embodied reinforcement learning and agency inspired from physics”
*   Clone-structured Memory (exact quote from paper) – “the ECM is organized as a graph, where each node represents a belief state”
*   Transition Function (exact quote from paper) – “the transition function p(B |B ,A )”
*   Emission Function (exact quote from paper) – “the emission function p(s |B )”
*   Reward (exact quote from paper) – “internal reward signal”
*   Preference Distribution (exact quote from paper) – “a distribution over belief states”
*   Expectation (exact quote from paper) – “the expected free energy”
*   Value Function (exact quote from paper) – “the value of a state”
*   Policy (exact quote from paper) – “the policy π(A |B )”
*   World Model (exact quote from paper) – “the world model”
*   Prediction Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “prediction accuracy”
