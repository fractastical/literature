Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of Active Inference is the minimization of the free energy, which is a measure of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The optimization of the free energy is achieved through gradient descent”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference is a formalization of the idea that agents act on the surrounding environment to achieve a desired state”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The framework relies on Bayesian inference to estimate the hidden states”
*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “The framework is based on the idea that the brain continuously generates predictions about the sensory input”
*   Model-Based Control (exact quote from paper) – “The model-based approach is based on the idea that agents use a model of the world to predict the consequences of their actions”
*   Hierarchical Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “The hierarchical structure of the model allows for the representation of complex dynamics”
