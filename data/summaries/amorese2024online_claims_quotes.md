Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework for robotic task execution, specifically designed to balance competing objectives while ensuring safety and user preference adherence.
2.  The framework utilizes a multi-stage approach: a task planner generates optimal trade-off plans, and a selector dynamically chooses the best plan based on user preference and learning.
3.  The core hypothesis is that by integrating active inference with a multi-objective planning approach, the robot can learn to effectively balance competing objectives and adapt to user preferences during task execution.
4.  The authors hypothesize that the proposed framework can achieve Pareto-optimal behavior, meaning it can identify and execute the best possible trade-offs between objectives, considering user preferences.
5.  The authors claim that the framework can learn the quantitative models of the environment, including the stochastic cost function, and adapt its behavior accordingly.
