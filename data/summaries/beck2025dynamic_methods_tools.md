## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle, along with the associated constructs of Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the core component of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is, a mathematical theory of ‘every’ ‘thing.’" –  This outlines the core theoretical framework.
*   Markov Blankets (exact quote from paper) – "Markov blankets are defined as the minimal set of variables that, when conditioned on, renders the remaining variables conditionally independent" – This defines the key concept.
*   Ontological Potential Functions (exact quote from paper) – “ontologicalpotentialfunctions” – This defines the mathematical representation of the object type.
*   Bayesian Maximum Likelihood Estimation (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes’ principle of maximum caliber” – This defines the statistical approach.
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Thealgorithmusesgradientdescenttooptimizesubjectivefunctionals” – This describes the optimization method.
*   Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization (exact quote from paper) – “use variationalBayesianexpectationmaximization” – This describes the algorithm.
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Thealgorithmusesactiveinference” – This describes the algorithm.
