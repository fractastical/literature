## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that all systems, from bacteria to brains, minimize their free energy by actively generating their own sensory experience.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding perception and action as unified processes of minimizing free energy.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The core of active inference is a Bayesian approach, where the agent’s beliefs are updated based on observed data.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The training process utilizes gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.”
*   PCA (Principal Component Analysis) (exact quote from paper) – “PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and extract salient features from the data.”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) measures the difference between two probability distributions.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used as a metric to evaluate the accuracy of the model’s predictions.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch is the deep learning framework used for implementing the model and training algorithms.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is utilized for numerical computation and array manipulation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data analysis and preprocessing.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is employed for various machine learning tasks, including PCA.”
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – “Matplotlib is used for data visualization.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The ImageNet dataset is used for evaluating the model’s performance on image classification tasks.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The CIFAR-10 dataset is utilized for training and testing the model’s ability to classify images.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “Various UCI datasets are used for benchmarking the model’s performance on different datasets.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is used to measure the percentage of correctly classified images.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is used to balance precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model’s predictions.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the experiments and training the model.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “Amazon Web Services (AWS) is utilized for cloud computing and storage.”
*   Local clusters (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments are also conducted on local clusters for increased computational power.”
