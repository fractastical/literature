## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) offers a foundational framework for understanding agentic and multi-agent systems through variational inference."
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – "We employ variational inference to approximate the intractable posterior distribution."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian inference of world models"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "One of the earliest progenitors of this idea is the Helmholtz machine, proposed by Dayan, Hinton, Neal, and Zemel in 1995 [Day+95], connecting the statistical mechanics governing the Helmholtz FreeEnergyandperceptualprocessing."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The minimization of the KL divergence through inference on q.”
*   Monte Carlo (exact quote from paper) – “Internal simulations, then tracking N MC trajectories”
*   Markovian (exact quote from paper) – “Markovian”
*   Minimization (exact quote from paper) – “minimization of D (q||p)”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “KL divergence”
