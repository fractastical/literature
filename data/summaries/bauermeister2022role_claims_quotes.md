Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a computational approach to study self-recognition that incorporates affective components, moving beyond existing models that overlook emotional influences.

2.  **Hypothesis 1:** Negative valence arises when an agent recognizes itself and learns something unexpected about its internal states.

3.  **Hypothesis 2:** Agents will avoid mirrors if they have a strong prior expectation of a negative affective state, anticipating an undesirable learning experience.

4.  **Key Finding:** Mirror self-recognition can be explained by the agent’s ability to infer its own internal states, coupled with the emergence of negative valence when encountering unexpected information.

5.  **Theoretical Contribution:** The model demonstrates a plausible mechanism for how affect might be intrinsically linked to the process of self-recognition.
