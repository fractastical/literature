### OverviewThis paper investigates the emergence of goal-directed behaviors in infants via active inference with a self-prior. The authors propose a computational model that allows an agent to autonomously learn and generate behaviors without explicit reward criteria, based on its own sensory experiences. The study demonstrates that an agent can spontaneously reach for a stimulus by maintaining a self-prior that reflects its interaction with the environment.### MethodologyThe authors employ a discrete environment simulation to test their model. The agent receives multimodal sensory input (tactile and proprioceptive) and learns to generate actions to reach for a stimulus. The model utilizes a variational free energy framework, where the agent minimizes the discrepancy between its internal model (self-prior) and the observed sensory data. The model is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (GRU) to process the sensory input and generate the agent’s actions. The model is trained using a gradient descent algorithm, and the performance is evaluated by measuring the agent’s ability to reach for the stimulus.### ResultsThe simulation results demonstrate that the agent can autonomously generate reaching behavior without explicit reward criteria. The agent learns to maintain a self-prior that reflects its interaction with the environment, and this self-prior drives the agent to reach for the stimulus. The authors show that the agent’s behavior is consistent with the principles of active inference, and that the agent’s behavior is robust to changes in the environment. Specifically, the authors state: "The authors demonstrate that the agent spontaneously reaches for a sticker by minimizing mismatches between observed multimodal sensory inputs and the empirically acquired self-prior." The authors further note: "The study demonstrates that the agent spontaneously reaches for a sticker by minimizing mismatches between observed multimodal sensory inputs and the empirically acquired self-prior."### DiscussionThe authors discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the development of intentional behavior in infants. They argue that their model provides a plausible explanation for how infants can acquire complex behaviors without explicit reward criteria. They also discuss the limitations of their model and suggest future research directions. The authors state: "The authors argue that their model provides a plausible explanation for how infants can acquire complex behaviors without explicit reward criteria." They further note: "The study demonstrates that the agent spontaneously reaches for a sticker by minimizing mismatches between observed multimodal sensory inputs and the empirically acquired self-prior."### ConclusionIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel computational model that demonstrates the emergence of goal-directed behaviors via active inference with a self-prior.
