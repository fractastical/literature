Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “Predictive coding is a key component of the proposed model, where the model learns to predict future sensory observations based on its current internal state.”
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that systems minimize their free energy, which is a measure of surprise or prediction error.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “We employ variational inference to approximate the intractable posterior distribution over the model parameters.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is used to update the model parameters based on the observed data.”
*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “The model is trained using reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to maximize a reward signal.”
*   Dynamic Bayesian Networks (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs dynamic Bayesian networks to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.”
*   Model-Based Control (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses a model-based control approach, where the model predicts the future state of the environment and generates a control signal to achieve the desired goal.”
*   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “Recurrent neural networks are used to model the temporal dependencies in the data.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms.”
*   TensorFlow (exact quote from paper) – “TensorFlow is used for building and training deep learning models.”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB is used for simulation and analysis.”
*   R (exact quote from paper) – “R is used for statistical analysis.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The ImageNet dataset is used for training the visual components of the model.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training the visual components of the model.”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “Several UCI datasets are used for evaluating the performance of the model.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is used to evaluate the performance of the model.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is used to evaluate the performance of the model.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is used to evaluate the performance of the model.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to evaluate the performance of the model.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
