Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Main Claim:** The paper demonstrates that Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling, even in linear stochastic systems. The authors show that “such a cyclic structure can generate couplings that propagate beyond causal interactions.”

2.  **Hypothesis:** The authors precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads—or does not lead—to conditional independence (Markov blankets).

3.  **Finding:** The derivations hold for both the linear case (as investigated by the target article) and the general, nonlinear case.

4.  **Finding:** The relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence is strengthened when assuming a ‘locality constraint’ on the solenoidal state-dependence. This constraint means that the coupling between any two pairs of states does not depend on other states besides the two that are interacting.

5.  **Finding:** The authors show that the “normal form” of the flow (as described in earlier literature) is a key factor in establishing this relationship.

## Important Quotes

**Context:** "Overview" Section
**Significance:** This quote identifies the specific structure (the ‘canonical loop’) that the authors are examining as a potential source of Markov blankets.

**Quote:** "In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely coupled stochastic differential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities are claimed—in previous FEP literature—to have a Markov blanket."
**Context:** "Overview" Section
**Significance:** This quote establishes the context of the paper – the authors are responding to a previous claim about the existence of Markov blankets in a particular system.

**Quote:** "The authors demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling."
**Context:** "Abstract" Section
**Significance:** This is a core finding of the paper – a direct challenge to a previously held belief within the FEP literature.

**Quote:** "Importantly, our derivations hold for both the linear case (the same class of systems investigated by the target article) as well as in the general, nonlinear case [4, 7]."
**Context:** "Abstract" Section
**Significance:** This highlights the broad applicability of the authors’ findings, extending beyond the specific linear system examined in the target article.

**Quote:** "We show that the relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence is particularly strengthened when one assumes the state-dependence of the solenoidal flow (a crucial feature underlying stochastic chaos and itinerancy in random dynamical systems [2, 4]) has a ‘locality’ constraint, whereby the coupling between any two pairs of states does not depend on other states besides the two that are interacting."
**Context:** "Overview" Section
**Significance:** This quote details the key methodological assumption – the ‘locality constraint’ – and its importance for establishing the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets.

**Context:** "Methods" Section (Implied from the description of the flow)
**Significance:** This quote describes the mathematical representation of the flow, a crucial element of the authors’ analysis.

**Quote:** “We show that the relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence is particularly strengthened when one assumes the state-dependence of the solenoidal flow (a crucial feature underlying stochastic chaos and itinerancy in random dynamical systems [2, 4]) has a ‘locality’ constraint, whereby the coupling between any two pairs of states does not depend on other states besides the two that are interacting.”
**Context:** "Overview" Section
**Significance:** This quote reiterates the key finding regarding the importance of the ‘locality constraint’ for establishing the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets.
