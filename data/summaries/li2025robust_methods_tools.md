## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle posits that systems minimize their free energy, which is a measure of their internal discordance."
*   Active Statistical Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection."
*   Prediction-powered inference (exact quote from paper) – "Prediction-powered inference is a methodological framework showing how to perform valid statistical inference despite the inherent biases in such predicted labels."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The algorithm uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function."
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "The loss function is defined as the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "We use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the predictive model."

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing and model evaluation."
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is used for numerical computation."
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis."
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – "Matplotlib is used for data visualization."

## Datasets

*   Pew Post-Election Survey Data (exact quote from paper) – "We use a dataset collected by the Pew Research Center following the 2020 United States presidential election."
*   US Census Data (exact quote from paper) – "We use US Census data."
*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – "We use the ImageNet dataset for training our models."

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – "The loss function is defined as the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values."
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – "Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly classified instances."
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – "F1-score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall."
*   Coverage (exact quote from paper) – "Coverage is defined as the proportion of instances where the model’s prediction falls within a specified confidence interval."

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "We use Google Colab for running our experiments."
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – "We use a local cluster for training our models."
