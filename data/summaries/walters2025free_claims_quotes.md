Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The Free Energy Principle (FEP) offers a compelling foundation for Active Inference, providing a framework for understanding intelligent systems.
2.  The authors propose a Cumulative Risk Exposure (CRE) metric, designed to be flexible and adaptable to varying contexts and needs.
3.  The primary hypothesis is that introducing gatekeepers into an autonomous vehicle (AV) fleet, even at low penetration rates, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.
4.  The authors hypothesize that incorporating a preference prior into the model, reflecting stakeholder-defined outcomes, will drive the agent to make decisions aligned with those preferences.
5.  The research investigates the relationship between the FEP and Bayesian/Active Inference, highlighting the potential for leveraging variational inference to approximate the true posterior.
6.  The authors propose a novel approach to modeling risk, utilizing the CRE metric, which can be applied to a wide range of applications.
