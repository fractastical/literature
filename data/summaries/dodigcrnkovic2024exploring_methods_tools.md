## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core of the approach is based on the free energy principle, which posits that biological systems minimize free energy by predicting and acting on their environment.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how organisms generate behavior by minimizing free energy.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The optimization process relies on gradient descent to adjust the model parameters.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs Bayesian inference to update its beliefs about the world.”
*   PCA (exact quote from paper) – “Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is used for various machine learning tasks.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The model was trained on the ImageNet dataset.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “accuracy of the model”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE”

## Software Tools and Platforms
