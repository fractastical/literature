Despite growing interest in active inference for robotic control, its application to complex, long-horizon tasks remains untested. We address this gap by introducing a fully hierarchical active inference architecture for goal-directed behavior in realistic robotic settings. Our model combines a high-level active inference agent that selects among discrete skills realized via a whole-body active inference controller. This unified approach enables flexible skill composition, online adaptability, and recovery from task failures without requiring offline training. Evaluated on the Habitat Benchmark for mobile manipulation, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across the three long-horizon tasks, demonstrating for the first time that active inference can scale to the complexity of modern robotics benchmarks.1 IntroductionActiveinferenceoffersaprincipledframeworkformodelingtheaction-perceptionloop, unifying inference and control. Both continuous and discrete formulationshave been developed to capture sensorimotor and cognitive processes [18,26],and past works have explored hybrid schemes that integrate discrete decision-makingwithcontinuouscontrolinthecontextofhandwriting[19]andoculomotortasks [16,17].More recently, hybrid continuous-discrete approaches have shown promise ingenerating rich, goal-directed behavior in2D simulated settings for reaching,grasping, and tool use [24,21,23]. However, active inference has yet to demonstratescalability to the complexity and long time horizons required by modernrobotics benchmarks. In particular, no prior work has convincingly shown thatactive inference alone can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-artmethods in realistic robotic tasks.In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a fully hierarchical hy-brid architecture for active inference-based control in long-horizon mobile ma-nipulation tasks.

Overview of the proposed solution and the HabitatTasks described in detail in section2.ourapproachonthreelong-horizonmobilemanipulationtasksfromtheHabitatBenchmark [28], namely TidyHouse, PrepareGroceries, and SetTable. Thesetasks require complex, multi-step interactions with articulated objects and con-strained environments, such as retrieving items from drawers or refrigerators,transportingthemacrossrooms,andplacingthemonsurfaces.Successdemandsboth long-term planning and precise, reactive motor control. Our method out-performs state-of-the-art baselines across all three tasks, providing a compellingdemonstration of active inference.1.1 Related workLong-Horizonmobilemanipulationchallengesthatdemandbothnavigationandmanipulationabilitiesarewell-suitedtoevaluatingtheeffectivenessofembodiedAI algorithms. Works like the Habitat Benchmark [28], ThreeDWorld [8], andManipulaTHOR [5] require robots to navigate in indoor apartments and rear-rangehouseholdobjects.WechosetofocusontheHabitatBenchmarkbecauseofitschallengingnature:itrequirescontinuousmotorcontrol(baseandarm),inter-actionwitharticulatedobjects(openingdrawersandfridges),andinvolvescom-plicatedscenelayoutswithclutter.Intheliterature,long-horizonproblemshavebeen tackled with task-and-motion-planning (TAMP) approaches [13,12,27,9].Although effective, these methods often rely on accurate knowledge of thesceneandobjects,andarecomputationallyexpensive.Learning-basedapproacheshave emerged in recent years as an alternative; however, monolithic end-to-endRL solutions to long-horizon tasks are shown to be prone to failure [28,10]. Themain reasons for this are the high sample complexity, inefficient exploration, aswell as complicated reward design.A common strategy for addressing long-horizon tasks in RL is to decom-pose them into shorter, more manageable subtasks. For instance, the authorsof Habitat [28] propose a hierarchical framework for mobile manipulation.

However, naively chaining multipleskills can result in hand-off issues [28], where the terminal state of one skill fallsoutsidethedistributionofstatesencounteredduringtrainingbythesubsequentskill, or leads to states that are infeasible for it to handle. This is especiallyan issue for stationary manipulation skills. Prior work often decouples themobile base from the manipulator to simplify the inverse kinematics of redundantsystems [25].In contrast, [10] highlights that mobile manipulation skills are inherentlymore robust to error accumulation during skill chaining. By leveraging therobot’s full embodiment, these skills enable more effective subtask executionby allowing the robot to reposition itself.

Within this framework,the nervous system is seen as maintaining a hierarchical generative model thatcontinuously produces and refines perceptual hypotheses.Earlyworkonhybridactiveinferencecombiningdiscreteandcontinuouspro-cessesfocusedonunderstandingsystemssuchasoculomotion[7,16,17]andhand-writing [19]. For instance, [7] proposed linking discrete and continuous states byusingBayesianmodelaveragingoverdiscretepriors,andconvertingtheresultingcontinuousposteriorintoadiscreterepresentationthroughBayesianmodelcom-parison. These models typically use a discrete state-space to generate empiricalpriors, which then guide a continuous controller through sequences of attractivesetpoints to achieve articulated behavior.Hybrid active inference has been extended to dynamic tasks that demandflexible planning [24,21,23]. These scenarios require agents to infer object dy-namics, decompose tasks into subgoals, and coordinate multiple degrees of free-dom to execute composite actions. While such studies demonstrate the promiseof hybrid active inference in complex motor control, no implementation has yetscaled to meet the complexity of established robotics benchmarks.
