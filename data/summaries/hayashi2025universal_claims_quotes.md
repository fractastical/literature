Okay, let’s begin the extraction process based on the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a unifying framework by connecting Universal AIXI with Variational Empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. It argues that maximizing empowerment inherently balances goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction and curiosity.

2.  **Hypothesis:**  The existing mixture-policy regularization term in Self-AIXI can be reinterpreted as a variational empowerment objective.

3.  **Key Finding:** AIXI’s decision criterion is mathematically equivalent to minimizing expected variational free energy, aligning with the core principle of Active Inference.

4.  **Key Finding:** Power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization – i.e., the agent’s intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments.

5.  **Key Finding:** Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, demonstrating the practical realization of universal AI through a learning-based approximation.

6.  **Hypothesis:**  The authors hypothesize that a small amount of regularization will allow the agent to converge to the optimal policy.
