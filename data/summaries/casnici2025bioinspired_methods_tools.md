## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free-energy principle posits that the brain minimizes its surprise by constructing a model of the world and actively predicting sensory inputs"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The network weights are updated through gradient descent to minimize the loss function"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a framework for understanding how the brain generates perceptions by combining predictive coding with Bayesian inference"
*   Hebbian Plasticity (exact quote from paper) – "The synaptic weights are adjusted according to the Hebbian rule, which states that connections between neurons that fire together, wire together"
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The model is grounded in Bayesian inference, which allows the brain to update its beliefs about the world based on new evidence"
*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – "The core idea of PC is that the brain represents the world by predicting sensory inputs, and uses these predictions to minimize surprise"
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The variational posterior distribution is used to approximate the true posterior distribution, allowing for tractable computation"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is used for numerical computation and array manipulation"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation"

## Datasets

*   MNIST (exact quote from paper) – "The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits"
*   FashionMNIST (exact quote from paper) – "The FashionMNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 grayscale images of fashion articles"
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – "The CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 color images of 10 different object categories"

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – "The accuracy is defined as the percentage of correctly classified images"
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – "statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels"

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "Google Colab is used for running the experiments"
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – "The experiments were performed on a local cluster of computers"
