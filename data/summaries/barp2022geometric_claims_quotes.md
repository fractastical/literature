Okay, let's begin. I will systematically extract the key claims and quotes from the provided text, adhering to the specified requirements and formatting guidelines.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Central Claim:** The paper proposes a framework for understanding active inference, specifically using message-passing algorithms (like belief propagation) to model complex systems, particularly in the context of neural computation.

2. **Hypothesis:** The core hypothesis is that active inference, modeled through message-passing, can provide a more accurate and robust representation of complex systems, particularly in areas like motor control and decision-making.

3. **Key Claim:** The paper argues that traditional approaches to modeling complex systems often fail to capture the dynamic interplay between different levels of abstraction, and that message-passing offers a more natural way to represent this interaction.

4. **Hypothesis:** The paper suggests that active inference can be used to model the brain's ability to learn and adapt to changing environments.

5. **Key Claim:** The paper proposes a framework for understanding active inference, specifically using message-passing algorithms (like belief propagation) to model complex systems, particularly in the context of neural computation.
