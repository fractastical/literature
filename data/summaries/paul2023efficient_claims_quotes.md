Okay, let's begin the extraction process based on the provided paper text.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel planning algorithm for active inference, dramatically reducing computational complexity compared to existing methods, enabling more precise model learning and planning, even under uncertain conditions.
2.  **Hypothesis:**  By leveraging dynamic programming and a simplified target distribution specification, active inference can be scaled to handle complex environments and achieve more robust intelligent behavior.
3.  **Claim:** The paper introduces a Z-learning approach to facilitate the learning of the agent’s preferences, allowing for more efficient and adaptive behavior.
4.  **Hypothesis:**  The proposed approach will improve the efficiency of active inference by minimizing the need for manually defined target distributions.
5.  **Claim:** The core of the paper’s contribution is the development of a computationally efficient planning algorithm that addresses the limitations of existing active inference methods.
