### OverviewThis summary synthesizes the key arguments and findings presented in “Return to Lacan: an approach to digital twin mind with free energy principle” by Lingyu Li and Chunbo Li. The paper investigates a novel framework for modeling the human mind, integrating the principles of the free energy principle (FEP) with Lacanian psychoanalysis. The central claim is that FEP provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale, and that Lacanian psychoanalysis, with its focus on the unconscious and the symbolic order, can be formalized within this framework. The authors propose a “digital twin mind” approach, leveraging this integration to create a sophisticated computational model of the human psyche.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers around a recurrent generative model, designed to mimic the dynamic interplay of the three orders – the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary – identified by Lacan. This model is built upon the FEP, which posits that living systems actively minimize their free energy by predicting and interacting with their environment. Specifically, the model employs variational inference, a technique from machine learning, to approximate the intractable calculations involved in the FEP. The core of the model consists of three interconnected units, each representing one of the Lacanian orders. These units communicate with each other, exchanging information and adjusting their internal states based on the observed environment. The authors highlight that this model is not intended as a literal representation of the brain, but rather as a conceptual framework for defining the system of current interest. The authors also emphasize the importance of the temporal structure, incorporating the concept of “logical time” – the non-linear, retrospective way in which humans construct their experience. From the perspective of logical time, “the past anticipates a future within which it can retroactively find a place”. In other words, the past bestows significance upon forthcoming events in an anticipatory manner, and the future imbues the past with retroactive meaning. Along logical time, meaningful relationships between events emerge, transforming time into a mechanism that generates significance. This concept underscores the anticipatory nature of human mind and emphasizes the importance of retroactive reconstruction.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate the model’s ability to simulate key aspects of Lacanian theory. They show that the model can reproduce the dynamic interplay between the three orders, mirroring the Borromean knot concept. Specifically, the model exhibits disturbances in one cognitive domain can propagate through the system, illustrating the interconnectivity and dynamic nature of mental processes. The authors articulate that errors in one cognition can influence performances of another one. The authors present a simulation where the model’s internal states are influenced by past experiences, demonstrating the model’s ability to simulate the concept of “retroactive influence”. The authors also demonstrate the model’s ability to simulate the concept of “object petit a”, showing how the model’s internal states are shaped by the absence of a complete representation of the external world. Derived from the Real, the concept of repetition—manifested as an incessant attempt to represent the unrepresented—becomes another fundamental concept of Lacanian psychoanalysis. The authors highlight that the model’s dynamic simulations reproduce the concept of “desire” by driving the synchronization of the Symbolic orders. The authors demonstrate the model’s ability to simulate the concept of “logical time”, showing how the model’s internal states are shaped by retrospective reconstruction.### Claims & Supporting Evidence“The authors state: ‘Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale.’” This foundational claim establishes the theoretical basis for the entire paper. “They note: ‘Expecting a digital twin mind from this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis.’” This articulates the central argument – integrating FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis to create a digital twin mind. “The authors argue: ‘Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the systems’ subsequent states.’” This highlights a parallel between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis – the importance of temporal dynamics and the role of “lacks” in shaping mental states. “The authors state: ‘With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a minimal definition of Lacanian mind – composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire running over the logical time.’” This outlines the core model – a three-order system (RSI) perturbed by desire, operating within a temporal framework. “The authors argue: ‘The fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in Lacan’s theory.’” This articulates the FEP’s concept of “concealed states” and its connection to Lacan’s “object petit a”. “The authors state: ‘The dynamic interplay between the three orders is defined as a Borromean knot.’” This highlights the key conceptual link between the three orders and the Borromean knot. “The authors argue: ‘And what drives the ongoing evolution of the three orders within logical time. Repetition, as mentioned, serves as the driving force. For Lacan, repetition represents the return of something that maintains identical—object petit a, a concept rooted in the Real, leading to the endless metonymic course of desire.’” And orientation of drive is the running of desire towards object petit a. The history of subjectivity unfurls in the repetition of desire’s trajectory: the unrepresented → object petit a → desire → object of desire → failure of representation → the unrepresented. That is, desire can never be satisfied, and the endless cycles contribute to so-called fantasy that need to be traversed by psychoanalysis practice. A minimal definition of the human mind from Lacanian perspective ultimately emerges — composite status of three orders which is perturbated by desire running over the logical time.”### DiscussionThis paper presents a novel and potentially fruitful approach to modeling the human mind. By integrating the principles of FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, the authors have created a framework that offers a new perspective on the complex interplay between the unconscious, the symbolic order, and the external world. The model’s ability to simulate key aspects of Lacanian theory – such as “lacks,” “object petit a,” and the influence of temporal dynamics – suggests that this framework could be a valuable tool for understanding a wide range of psychological phenomena. The authors’ emphasis on the importance of the temporal structure is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the role of retrospective reconstruction in shaping our experience of the world. The model’s potential for creating a “digital twin mind” – a computational model that accurately reflects the psychological processes of an individual – is a significant step towards creating truly intelligent machines. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the model, emphasizing that it is a conceptual framework rather than a literal representation of the brain. However, the model’s ability to simulate key aspects of Lacanian theory makes it a valuable tool for further research.### Key Terms:- The paper uses the following key terms: free energy principle, Lacan, psychoanalysis, digital twin.### ConclusionThis summary synthesizes the key arguments and findings presented in “Return to Lacan: an approach to digital twin mind with free energy principle” by Lingyu
