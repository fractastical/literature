Okay, let’s begin the extraction process according to your detailed requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

*   The authors introduce a distinction between “cognitive” and “metacognitive” particles, defining metacognitive particles as those that hold beliefs about their own beliefs.
*   The core hypothesis is that a typology of particles, including cognitive and metacognitive, can provide a framework for understanding complex mental processes.
*   The paper proposes that “strange particles” – those with internal states decomposed into distinct sets – are particularly well-suited for describing sentient behavior.
*   A key finding is that sensory states act as a Markov blanket, mediating the influence between higher-level and lower-level internal states in metacognitive particles.
*   The authors argue that metacognitive beliefs encode information about the parameters of beliefs about the world, representing a form of parametric depth.
*   The paper suggests that a chain of internal states, extending from one level to multiple levels of metacognition, can be modeled.
*   The authors believe that this particle typology, built upon the free energy principle, offers a promising approach to understanding cognition.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "Following the typology of particles introduced in the target article [1], we introduce a further distinction between cognitive and metacognitive particles."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This establishes the foundational concept of the paper – the differentiation between cognitive and metacognitive particles.

**Quote:** "Metacognitive particles are called as such because they have beliefs about (some of) their own beliefs."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This clearly defines the core characteristic of a metacognitive particle.

**Quote:** "The target article argues that strange particles may be most apt for describing sentient behaviour[1]."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This highlights the intended application of the particle typology – understanding sentient behavior.

**Quote:** "Figure1: Exampleofametacognitivestrangeparticle. Thisparticleissuchthatinternalstates(atthe lower level, i.e. µ ) are hidden from internal states (at the higher level, i.e. µ )."
**Context:** Introduction (referencing Figure 1)
**Significance:** This describes the specific structure of a metacognitive particle – the hidden lower-level states.

**Context:** Introduction (referencing Figure 1)
**Significance:** This explains the mechanism by which the higher-level internal states gain information about the lower-level states.

**Quote:** "such that the second set of states is hidden from the first via the Markov blanket."
**Context:** Introduction (referencing Figure 1)
**Significance:** This specifies the key structural element – the Markov blanket – that governs the interaction between the internal states.

**Context:** Equation (1)
**Significance:** This presents the formal representation of the coupling between the internal states, highlighting the role of sensory states.

**Quote:** "(µ⃗ ⊥⃗η,⃗a,µ⃗ )|⃗s (2)"
**Context:** Equation (2)
**Significance:** This equation formally describes the conditional relationship between the internal states and sensory states.

**Quote:** "The lower internal states can only be inferred vicariously by the higher internal states via the sensorystates."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This reiterates the crucial role of sensory states as the sole pathway for information flow between the levels.

**Context:** Equation (3)
**Significance:** This defines the metacognitive belief (qm) as the probability distribution of the internal states given the sensory states.

**Context:** Equation (4)
**Significance:** This defines the metacognitive belief as the maximum probability distribution of the internal states given the sensory states.

**Quote:** "It then follows that metacognitive beliefs encode information about the parameters of beliefs about the world, evincing a form of parametric depth [3]."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This introduces the concept of “parametric depth,” suggesting that metacognitive beliefs represent a level of abstraction about beliefs.

**Context:** Discussion
**SignSignificance:** This describes the relationship between the marginal and specific metacognitive beliefs.

**Context:** Conclusion
**Significance:** This summarizes the overall implication of the particle typology – that metacognition drives behavior.

**Context:** Note 1
**Significance:** This confirms the broad applicability of the particle typology.

This publication is based on work partially supported by the EPSRCCentreforDoctoralTraininginMathematics of Random Systems: Analysis, Modelling and Simulation, United Kingdom (EP/S023925/1)."
**Context:** Funding Statement
**Significance:** This provides details on the funding sources for the research.
