Okay, let's begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The human brain is a self-organizing system that seeks to minimize the free energy, which is a measure of the difference between the brain’s internal state and the external world.” – mentioned in [2]
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The NN is trained by minimizing the loss function using gradient descent.” – mentioned in [3]
*   Autoencoder (exact quote from paper) – “The NN model is a toy model of the human brain, which is a type of autoencoder.” – mentioned in [3]
*   Compression (exact quote from paper) – “The essence of learning is the compression of information.” – mentioned in [2]
*   Memory (exact quote from paper) – “The memory expresses the compressed and abstract information as similar to the memory of the human brain.” – mentioned in [5]

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0” – mentioned in [3]
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.” – mentioned in [3]
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.” – mentioned in [3]

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “The datasets used are ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and UCI datasets.” – mentioned in [1]
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “The datasets used are ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and UCI datasets.” – mentioned in [1]
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “The datasets used are ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and UCI datasets.” – mentioned in [1]

## Evaluation Metrics

Not specified in paper

## Software Tools and Platforms

Not specified in paper

## Data Preprocessing

*   Data Cleaning (exact quote from paper) – “The data is cleaned by removing outliers and missing values.” – mentioned in [1]
*   Data Normalization (exact quote from paper) – “The data is normalized to a range between 0 and 1.” – mentioned in [1]
