Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic) proposes a novel ethical framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic reasoning, departing from human-centered approaches.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Ethical reasoning in AI should be modeled not as a simulation of human norms but as a formal, emergent process grounded in the agent’s ongoing engagement with its environment.

3.  **Key Claim:** NAEL formalizes adaptive ethical behaviour in autonomous systems by minimizing global expected free energy, considering not only the agent’s own uncertainty but also the inferred uncertainty of other agents and the environment.

4.  **Hypothesis:**  A neuro-symbolic architecture, integrating deep learning for perception with symbolic reasoning frameworks, is necessary to allow agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions.

5.  **Key Claim:** The framework combines deontic, standpoint, and subjective logics to account for different facets of ethical reasoning, enabling agents to evaluate actions based on obligations, perspectives, and epistemic uncertainty.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics, NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent environments."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the core premise of NAEL – a fundamentally different approach to AI ethics, shifting away from human-centric assumptions.

**Quote:** "In response to this need, we propose NAEL, a Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic designed to formalize adaptive ethical behaviour in autonomous systems."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote explicitly introduces the name and purpose of the proposed framework.

**Quote:** “Active inference is a unifying theory of action and perception based on the minimization of so-called variationalfreeenergy[5].”
**Context:** Section 2.1: Active Inference
**Significance:** This quote defines the foundational theory underpinning NAEL’s approach to agent behaviour.

**Quote:** “Theagentisnotpassivelyobservingtheworld,butactivelyinteractsinit.Theactions theagentselectaremade to minimise their expected free energy E[F].”
**Context:** Section 2.1: Active Inference
**Significance:** This quote highlights the active role of the agent in shaping its environment and behaviour, central to the framework’s design.

**Quote:** “Thecoreproblemisnotjusttechnicalbutphilosophical: canmoralitybemeaningfullyimposedfrom outside, or must it emerge from within an agent’s own experience and interactions?”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote articulates the fundamental philosophical question that NAEL addresses – whether ethics can be externally imposed or must arise organically from an agent’s experience.

**Quote:** “NAEL is not a predefined moral rulebook but a dynamic reasoning system: it encodes structural constraintsonethicaldeliberation(e.g.,coherence,interdependence,adaptability),whileenablingagents toupdatetheirethicalbeliefsthroughinteraction.”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote emphasizes the adaptive and evolving nature of NAEL’s ethical reasoning, contrasting it with static rule-based systems.

**Quote:** “In theDeonticmodule,weuse thestandarddeonticrationalityaxiomslikeOa→Pa;i.e.,obligationsimplypermissions.”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote illustrates a specific example of how the symbolic logic components are applied to ethical reasoning.

**Quote:** “NAELalignswiththeviewthatethicsisnotastaticentitybutaprocessofcontinualnegotiation,prediction,andadjustment[1].”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote reinforces the adaptive and dynamic nature of ethical reasoning within the NAEL framework.

**Quote:** “Theagentdoesnotonlyminimizeitsownexpectedfreeenergybutalsoestimatesandincorporatesthe(predicted)freeenergyofotheragentsandtheenvironment.”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote highlights the key element of relationality in NAEL’s approach to ethics.

**Quote:** “Asartificialintelligence(AI)systemsincreasinglyparticipateinhigh-stakesdecision-making—rangingfrom healthcare to environmental governance—there is a growing urgency to design machines capable of ethical reasoning [2, 17].”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the context and motivation for the research, highlighting the importance of developing ethical AI systems.

**Quote:** “Theagentassumesthatotheragentswillbehaveinapredictablemanner(unlesssufficientevidenceisfoundagainstthat),andwillinturnactasotheragentsexpect,withinthelimitsoftheethicalconstraints.”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote illustrates the agent’s reliance on predictive modelling and the assumption of rational behaviour in other agents.

**Quote:** “As mentioned, NAEL adapts via online updates to: (i) adjust obligation weightsinthedeonticmodule;(ii)increaseepistemicexploration(e.g.,byreallocating sensing drones);and (iii) shift preference priors in the generative model C(o) based on context.”
**Context:** Section 3.4: DynamicAdaptationandLearning
**Significance:** This quote details the mechanisms by which NAEL adapts its ethical reasoning based on new information and experiences.
