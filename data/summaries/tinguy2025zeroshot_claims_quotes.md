Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Hypothesis:** The paper proposes a biologically inspired Active Inference framework (AIMAPP) to enable autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments, unifying mapping, localization, and decision-making within a single generative model.

2.  **Key Claim:** AIMAPP leverages topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behavior, mimicking how animals navigate their surroundings.

3.  **Key Claim:** The model operates through a probabilistic inference process, continuously updating its internal representation of the environment based on sensory observations and predicted future outcomes.

4.  **Key Claim:** AIMAPP dynamically adapts its exploration strategy, balancing the need for efficient path planning with the desire to discover novel areas.

5.  **Key Claim:** The model’s performance is robust to drift, sensor noise, and ambiguous observations, demonstrating superior navigation capabilities compared to traditional planning algorithms.

6.  **Hypothesis:** Integrating a generative model with a topological map will enable autonomous navigation in complex environments.
