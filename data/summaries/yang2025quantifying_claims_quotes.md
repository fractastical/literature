Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Core Claim:** The paper proposes a new indicator at the causal mechanism level to measure a system’s ability to flexibly respond to environmental changes, specifically focusing on the degree of synergy between the system and its environment.

2. **Hypothesis:** The proposed indicator, based on partial information decomposition (PID), accurately quantifies the system’s responsiveness to environmental shifts by identifying the strength of interactions between system and environmental variables.

3. **Central Finding:** The indicator’s value is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise, and this relationship is measurable.

4. **Methodological Contribution:** The paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed framework, including the calculation of information atoms, in unknown dynamics through machine learning.

5. **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper extends the information theory of individuality by incorporating causal mechanisms and environmental influences, moving beyond simple mutual information calculations.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “What is the most crucial characteristic of a system with life activity? Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems.”
**Context:** Abstract
**Significance:** This quote establishes the problem the paper addresses – the need for a quantifiable measure of “life-like” characteristics in systems.

**Quote:** “In this article, we propose a new indicator at the causal mechanism level to measure the ability of a system to maintain its own structure and function when dealing with environmental changes.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This is the core claim of the paper – the proposed indicator's purpose.

**Quote:** “We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition framework.”
**Context:** Results
