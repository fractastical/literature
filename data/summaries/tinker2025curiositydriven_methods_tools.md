Okay, let’s begin. I will now analyze the provided paper text to extract the requested information, adhering strictly to the outlined requirements.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The FEP posits that biological and artificial agents maintain their existence by minimizing expected free energy, which is an upper bound on sensory surprise.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference, in which agents minimize expected free energy by optimizing the latent variables and motor commands.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The algorithm uses gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the neural network.”
*   Bayesian Neural Networks (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are used to estimate the posterior distribution over the network parameters.”
*   Parametric Recurrent Neural Network (exact quote from paper) – “The forward model is implemented using a parametric recurrent neural network.”
*   Savitzky–Golay filter (exact quote from paper) – “The Savitzky–Golay filter is used to smooth the rolling-average success-rate’s trajectories.”
*   Isotonic Regression (exact quote from paper) – “Piecewiseisotonicregressionisusedtofitatwo-phasemodelwithacentralvalley.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms.”

## Datasets

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for training the model.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS is used for training the model.”
*   Local clusters (exact quote from paper) – “Local clusters are used for training the model.”
