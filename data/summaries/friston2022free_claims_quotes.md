Okay, let’s begin. Here’s a preliminary extraction of key claims and quotes from the provided text. This is a first pass, and we’ll refine it further as we process the entire document.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a Unified Framework:** The authors propose that the FEP provides a unified framework for understanding a wide range of phenomena, from sensory perception to motor control. Specifically, they argue that active inference – minimizing free energy – underlies many biological processes.

2. **Active Inference as a Hierarchical Process:** The paper suggests that active inference operates hierarchically, with different levels of abstraction contributing to the overall process.

3. **Bayesian Inference as a Core Mechanism:** The authors posit that Bayesian inference is a fundamental mechanism driving active inference, allowing organisms to make optimal decisions in uncertain environments.

4. **The Role of Predictive Coding:** The paper highlights predictive coding as a key component of active inference, where the brain constantly generates predictions and compares them to sensory input.

## Important Quotes


**Context:** Introduction

**Significance:** This quote establishes the central claim of the paper: the FEP as a unifying principle.
