Okay, let's begin the extraction process. Here’s the structured output based on the provided research paper text:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Claim:** Orchestrator, a novel multi-agent system framework, leverages active inference and reflective benchmarking to optimize global task performance in long-horizon settings.
2. **Hypothesis:** Integrating active inference principles—specifically, quantifying surprise and coordinating agent behavior—significantly enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent systems compared to traditional approaches.
3. **Claim:** The framework’s modular cell-structured architecture, combining planning, execution, and observation, enables scalable and adaptive coordination among agents.
4. **Hypothesis:**  By dynamically tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment interactions, Orchestrator can mitigate the effects of partial observability and enable agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently.
5. **Claim:** The framework’s success hinges on its ability to translate abstract free energy metrics into actionable guidance for agents, driving them toward optimal solutions.
