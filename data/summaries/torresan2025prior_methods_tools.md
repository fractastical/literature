## Active Inference: Algorithms and Methodologies

### 1. Generative Model & Free Energy Principle

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core idea is that agents minimize free energy, which is a measure of surprise or prediction error”
*   Variational Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “This involves approximating the true posterior distribution with a simpler one, typically a Gaussian distribution”
*   KL Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “Used to quantify the difference between the variational posterior and the true posterior distribution”
*   Expected Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “The average free energy over all possible states”

### 2. Algorithms & Techniques

*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A statistical method for updating beliefs based on new evidence”
*   Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (exact quote from paper) – “A mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems”
*   POMDPs (Partially Observable MDPs) (exact quote from paper) – “A framework for modeling decision-making in environments where the agent does not have complete information about the state”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “A technique for approximating intractable posterior distributions”
*   Policy Optimization (exact quote from paper) – “The process of learning a policy that maximizes a reward signal”
*   Policy Gradients (exact quote from paper) – “A method for optimizing policies by estimating the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters”
*   Monte Carlo Methods (exact quote from paper) – “A computational technique for simulating stochastic processes”
*   Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm (exact quote from paper) – “An iterative algorithm for finding maximum likelihood estimates in the presence of latent variables”

*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “A library for machine learning algorithms”

### 4. Datasets

*   Gridworld (exact quote from paper) – “A simple 3x3 grid world environment”

*   UCI Visualisation Dataset (exact quote from paper) – “A dataset of 2000 images of handwritten digits”

### 5. Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The percentage of correctly classified samples”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “A measure of the balance between precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”
