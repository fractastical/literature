## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a general theory of behaviour, based on the idea that agents minimise the free energy of their observations”
*   Counterfactual Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Counterfactual learning is a method for learning a model of the environment, based on the idea that agents learn to predict the consequences of their actions”
*   POMDPs (partial observability Markov decision processes) (exact quote from paper) – “A POMDP can be formally defined as a tuple of initial states, observations, actions, transition dynamics, and likelihood mapping”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimisation algorithm used to minimise the loss function”
*   Bayesian Optimization (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian optimization is a method for finding the optimal parameters of a model, based on the idea that we can use a prior distribution to represent our beliefs about the parameters”
*   Deep Learning (exact quote from paper) – “Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
