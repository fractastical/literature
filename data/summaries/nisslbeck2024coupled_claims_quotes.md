Okay, let's begin the extraction process based on the provided research paper text.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors propose an active inference agent to identify and control a mechanical system with multiple bodies connected by joints. This agent is constructed from multiple scalar autoregressive model-based agents, coupled together by virtue of sharing memories.
2.  The primary hypothesis is that coupling agents together will improve the agent’s ability to learn the dynamics of the system and drive it to a desired position more effectively than uncoupled agents.
3.  The authors demonstrate that a coupled agent of this kind is able to learn the dynamics of a double mass-spring-damper system, and drive it to a desired position through a balance of explorative and exploitative actions.
4.  The authors claim that coupled agents outperform uncoupled agents in terms of surprise and goal alignment.
5.  The authors state that the agent minimizes expected free energy over a finite time horizon.
