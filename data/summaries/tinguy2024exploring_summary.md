### OverviewThis paper investigates a novel computational model for navigation and mapping, rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently using memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex and aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn an environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental structures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during exploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model highlight our model’s ability to rapidly learn environmental layouts in a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. This is achieved without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of observations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating ambiguous environments.### MethodologyIn our approach, we adopt this viewpoint, proposing a topological map incorporating internal motion (Euclidean parameters) to delineate spatial experiences. The neural positioning system, found in rodents and primates, supports self-localisation and provides a metric for distance and direction between locations. This system includes place cells, heading direction cells [15], grid cells [2], speed cells [14], and border cells [30], working together to enable rapid learning, disambiguation of aliases, and a comprehensive understanding of spatial navigation [5]. Building on these concepts, we introduce a novel model that dynamically learns environmental structure and expands its cognitive map. Integrating visual information and proprioception (inferred body motion), our model constructs locations and connections within its cognitive map. Starting with uncertainty, the model envisions action outcomes, expanding its map by incorporating hypotheses into its generative model, analogous to Bayesian model reduction [9] that grows its model upon receiving new observation, we extend ours upon predicted beliefs. This process allows our model to efficiently navigate and comprehend environmental structures with minimal steps, using an active inference navigation scheme [17]. Compared to the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) [24], our model rapidly learns environmental layouts more efficiently. An exploration run is shown in Figure1, displaying from left to right the full environment, the extracted observation and exploration path and the resulting internal map of the agent.### ResultsThe authors state: "Our model dynamically learns environmental structure and expands its cognitive map." Integrating observations with proprioception (inferred body motion), our model constructs locations and connections within its cognitive map. The authors note: "The model’s ability to rapidly learn environmental layouts more efficiently." The model’s key findings are summarized as follows: the model achieves all tasks in significantly fewer steps compared to the CSCG model. The authors note: "The model’s ability to rapidly learn environmental layouts more efficiently." The average steps to explore the environments are shown in Figure3a. The model achieves all tasks in significantly fewer steps compared to the CSCG model. The authors note: "The model’s ability to rapidly learn environmental layouts more efficiently."### DiscussionThis study proposes a novel high-level abstraction model informed by biologically plausible principles mimicking key points of animal navigation strategies [33,1]. By integrating a dynamic cognitive graph with internal positioning and an Active Inference Framework (AIF), our models successfully explore the environment and learn its structure in a few steps, as expected from animals [32,26], facilitating adaptive learning and efficient exploration. Moreover, allowing the internal map to grow with expected beliefs not only creates a map adapted to any environment dimension, shape or observations but also enhances exploration by creating highly uncertain states where the whereabouts are predictable but the corresponding observations aren’t. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model [10] underscore the effectiveness of our approach in learning environment structures with minimal data and without prior knowledge of specific observation dimensions. This is mainly due to our agent’s capacity to imagine actions’ consequences and integrate them into its beliefs. Moving forward, it would be interesting to increase the prediction range of new states to integrate into the model and determine the impact on navigation. Moreover, studying the impact of a perfect memory on future policies and exploration efficiency, as well as seeing how the agent fares when trying to reach a defined objective it has prior upon in a familiar or novel environment would enhance the research. Finally deploying this model in real-world scenarios such as StreetLearn[20], based on Google map observations, would approach further this mechanism to animal behaviour and provide more conclusive evidence.Exploring and Learning Structure15AcknowledgementThisresearchreceivedfundingfromtheFlemishGovernmentunderthe“Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiële Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen” programme.References1.
