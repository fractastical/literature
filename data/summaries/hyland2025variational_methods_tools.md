## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that all systems, from brains to bacteria, are driven to minimize their free energy, which is a measure of surprise or uncertainty.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a computational framework that describes how agents interact with their environments by minimizing a free energy function.”
*   Bayes’ Rule (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes’ rule is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function by repeatedly adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Variational inference is a method for approximating intractable probability distributions by finding the closest distribution that satisfies certain constraints.”
*   Linear Affective Utility (exact quote from paper) – “We assume a linear affective utility function, where the utility of a belief state is proportional to the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is a library for data analysis and manipulation”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is a machine learning library”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is a large-scale labeled dataset of images”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “We used several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified examples”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is the proportion of correctly predicted positive examples out of all predicted positive examples”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is the proportion of correctly predicted positive examples out of all actual positive examples”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized Google Colab for running our experiments”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “We utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) for computational resources”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “We also utilized local clusters for experimentation”
