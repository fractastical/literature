## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference Framework (AIF) treats perception, learning, and action as components of a single generative process: agents minimise expected free energy by updating beliefs about the world and selecting actions to reduce uncertainty or satisfy preferences" – mentioned in [1]
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "AIF treats perception, learning, and action as components of a single generative process: agents minimise expected free energy by updating beliefs about the world and selecting actions to reduce uncertainty or satisfy preferences" – mentioned in [1]
*   Free Energy Minimization (exact quote from paper) – “treats perception, learning, and action as components of a single generative process: agents minimise expected free energy by updating beliefs about the world and selecting actions to reduce uncertainty or satisfy preferences” – mentioned in [1]
