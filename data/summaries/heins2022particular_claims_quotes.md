Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors’ primary claim is that the marginal flows of internal states in linear systems do not generally point along variational free energy gradients, challenging a central tenet of the Free Energy Principle (FEP).
2.  The authors hypothesize that the presence of solenoidal coupling between internal and blanket states significantly impacts the flow dynamics of particular states.
3.  The core finding is that for a restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of particular states *does* point along variational free energy gradients, enabling a stronger re-description of the flow.
4.  The authors propose that this finding suggests a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between solenoidal flows and the gradient flows of internal states.
5.  A key claim is that the alignment of the flow of internal states with the variational free energy gradient is contingent on the specific nature of the solenoidal couplings.

## Important Quotes

**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote clearly states the central focus of the commentary – examining the conditions under which particular states flow along free energy gradients.

**Quote:** "However, these results also supplement the discussion about marginal flows, and suggest that the relationship between solenoidal flows and the gradient flows of internal states is more nuanced than either the target article or previous FEP literature suggests."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This quote highlights the authors’ intention to refine the existing understanding of the FEP’s implications.

**Quote:** "The authors analyze the marginal flows of linear systems and contest what they claim is a central tenet of the FEP: namely, that the marginal flows of internal states µ˙ point down the gradients of the free energy F [1, Equation 22], µ˙(b) ∝ −∇ F(µ(b),b)"
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote explicitly identifies the core claim being challenged – the direct link between marginal flows and free energy gradients.

**Quote:** "I express general agreement with the target article’s statement that the marginal flow of internal statesdoesnotpointalongvariationalfreeenergygradientsevaluatedatthemostlikelyinternal state (i.e., the conditional mode)."
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote indicates a point of agreement with the target article’s findings, reinforcing the authors’ central argument.

**Quote:** "The authors analyze the marginal flows of linear systems and contest what they claim is a central tenet of the FEP: namely, that the marginal flows of internal states µ˙ point down the gradients of the free energy F [1, Equation 22], µ˙(b) ∝ −∇ F(µ(b),b)"
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote explicitly identifies the core claim being challenged – the direct link between marginal flows and free energy gradients.

**Quote:** "I show that the flow of particular states f (µ,b,η) under different external conditions is always pulled to a linear attracting set, but importantly, this attracting set is only aligned with the line of the conditional modes µ(b) in special cases."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This quote details the specific conditions under which alignment occurs, emphasizing the role of solenoidal coupling.

**Quote:** "In the top row of Figure 1, one can see that particular states are attracted to a line that is misaligned with the line {(b,µ(b))}—the set at which the free energy is minimised [7]. In this case, the alignment between the attracting set of particular states and the line of the conditional modes µ(b) does not hold."
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This quote provides a visual description of the alignment, illustrating the key finding.

**Quote:** "The authors analyze the marginal flows of linear systems and contest what they claim is a central tenet of the FEP: namely, that the marginal flows of internal states µ˙ point down the gradients of the free energy F [1, Equation 22], µ˙(b) ∝ −∇ F(µ(b),b)"
