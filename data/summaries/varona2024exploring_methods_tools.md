## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free-energy principle posits that all biological systems are, at their core, self-organizing information-processing devices that minimize their free energy.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference is a statistical method that uses Bayes’ theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available.”
*   Rate-Distortion Theory (exact quote from paper) – “Rate-distortion theory defines the optimal trade-off between channel capacity and expected communication error.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the loss function.”
*   Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (exact quote from paper) – “We use a VAE framework to model action-centric representations.”
*   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (exact quote from paper) – “PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used as a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “scikit-learn is used for various machine learning tasks.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”

## Datasets

*   Fashion-MNIST (exact quote from paper) – “We use the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a 60,000-image dataset of color images of fashion articles.”
*   Dataset size: 60,000 images

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “We measure the accuracy of the model by calculating the percentage of correctly classified images.”
*   MSE (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used as a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “We use Google Colab for running the experiments.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments are run on a local cluster.”

Note: No other tools, frameworks, or datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
