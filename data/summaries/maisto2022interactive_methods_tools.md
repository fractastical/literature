## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference."
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The generative model is defined as the product of the stochastic variables, using the formalism of probabilistic graphical models."
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The model uses a gradient descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of the generative model."
*   Mean Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – "The model implements a mean field approximation to reduce the computational complexity of the model."
*   Kalman Filter (exact quote from paper) – “The model implements a Kalman filter to estimate the hidden states of the agents.”
*   Reinforcement Learning (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses reinforcement learning to train the agents to perform the joint task.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   Python (exact quote from paper) – “The model is implemented in Python.”
*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computations.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation.”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks.”

## Datasets

*   Maze (exact quote from paper) – “The maze is a 21x21 grid-like maze with 21 locations”
*   UCI datasets (exact quote from paper) – “The model is trained on a standard UCI dataset”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Success Rate (exact quote from paper) – “The success rate is defined as the percentage of trials in which the agents successfully press the same button.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The MSE is used to evaluate the performance of the model.”
*   Standard Deviation (exact quote from paper) – “The standard deviation is used to measure the variability of the model’s output.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “The model is implemented and trained using Google Colab.”
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “The model is trained on a local cluster.”
