Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework that develops models that align with underlying principles of model-based RL”
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “the free energy principle, which posits that biological systems minimize a quantity known as free energy as they continuously work to preserve their existence (self-evidence) and interact with their environments effectively.”
*   Contrastive Learning (exact quote from paper) – “contrastive learning”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “variationalfreeenergy”
