### OverviewThis paper investigates the application of Active Inference (AIF) for distributed intelligence within the Computing Continuum (CC). The authors present a novel approach to managing service needs across a distributed system, leveraging AIF agents to autonomously adapt and optimize performance. The core idea is to model each service as an AIF agent, enabling it to continuously monitor its state, infer its environment, and take actions to fulfill its objectives. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of this approach through simulations and experiments, highlighting the benefits of AIF in terms of adaptability, resilience, and efficiency.### MethodologyThe authors propose a framework based on Active Inference (AIF) to manage distributed services within the Computing Continuum (CC). The core of this framework consists of AIF agents, which are modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). These agents continuously evaluate their state, and select actions to fulfill service objectives. The key elements of this framework are:The authors define the state space of each service as a set of variables, including but not limited to: FPS, Resolution, and W-consumption. These variables are used to represent the state of the service and are continuously monitored by the AIF agent. The AIF agent uses these observations to infer the state of its environment and to select actions that will optimize its performance.The AIF agents use a POMDP to model their environment. The POMDP defines the transition probabilities between states, as well as the observation probabilities. The transition probabilities are defined by the authors, and are based on their understanding of the CC. The observation probabilities are defined by the authors, and are based on their understanding of the sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the services.The AIF agents use a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for each service. The reinforcement learning algorithm is trained using the POMDP and the reward function. The reward function is designed to incentivize the AIF agents to achieve their objectives.The authors evaluate the performance of the AIF agents using a simulation environment. The simulation environment is designed to mimic the real-world CC. The simulation environment is used to test the AIF agents under a variety of conditions.### ResultsThe simulation results demonstrate that the AIF agents can achieve over90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around80% when learning the models during deployment. The agents show a strong capacity for adaptation, successfully managing fluctuations in demand and adapting to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, the AIF agents outperform state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of training time and overall performance. The results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of AIF in distributed systems.### DiscussionThe authors conclude that AIF offers a promising approach for managing distributed services in the Computing Continuum. The key benefits of AIF include its ability to adapt to changing conditions, its robustness to uncertainty, and its efficiency in terms of training time and overall performance. The authors identify several research directions for future work, including the development of more sophisticated AIF models, the integration of AIF with other distributed computing technologies, and the application of AIF to a wider range of applications.### ConclusionIn summary, this paper presents a novel approach to distributed intelligence in the Computing Continuum using Active 

Inference. 

The AIF agents effectively manage service needs, demonstrating high SL

OiD fulfillment rates and superior performance compared to traditional methods. 

The research provides a foundation for future advancements in AIF-driven distributed systems.
