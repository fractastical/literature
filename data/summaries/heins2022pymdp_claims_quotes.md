Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, adhering to all the specified requirements:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Active Inference as a Framework:** The authors claim that active inference provides a unified account of cognition and behavior, integrating action, perception, and learning within a Bayesian framework.
2. **Discrete State-Space Models:** The core hypothesis is that cognitive systems operate using discrete state-space models, where agents infer hidden states of the environment and select actions to influence these states.
3. **POMDPs as a Foundation:** The authors propose that Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a suitable mathematical framework for representing and simulating active inference models.
4. **Factorized Representations:** A key claim is that representing the generative model as a factorized representation (i.e., breaking down hidden states and observations into factors) is crucial for efficient inference and model building.
5. **Model-Based Learning:** The authors hypothesize that active inference agents learn by updating their beliefs about the underlying generative model, leading to adaptive behavior.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** “The free-energy principle… is a unified theory of cognition and behavior.”
