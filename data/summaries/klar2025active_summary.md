An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click BehaviourThe authors state: "We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent’s actions are selected by minimising Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over observing clicking a button correctly." They note: “A key advantage of AIF is that it offers a fundamentally different perspective. An AIF formulation frames pointing as a continuous process of minimising prediction error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input. It postulates behaviour as a process of reducing surprise to drive the environment into preferred configurations and minimising uncertainty that might, in the future, lead to disfavoured states.” The study demonstrates: “The agent’s internal model of the world is represented by a continuous state space, which is updated based on the agent’s perception of the environment.”The authors state: “We incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.” They note: “AIF is a widely-applicable model of the behaviour of organisms that unifies Bayesian models of perception with a probabilistic model for action under uncertainty. Section A describes the notation for such continuous system dynamics, how the agent constructs a belief about the states, dynamics and noise, as well as how it updates them. Specific adaptations of the standard general active inference approach in our model include:4 M. Klar et al.– System Dynamics:ThegeneralequationsaredescribedinSectionA.1.Inthe context of modelling a human pointing with a mouse, the system statemay be a combination of the cursor’s position and velocity and whether themouse button is being clicked. The observation reflects the user’s visual,proprioceptive, or haptic perceptions, which are noisy by nature.– Probabilistic Beliefs of AIF Agent are constructed about the states,dynamics and noise:1. Belief about system state Qs := N(µs,Σs).2. Beliefabout parameters of the system dynamics Qθ := N(µθ,Σθ).3. Beliefabout noise in observations Qp := exp(N(µp,Σp)). Each of these beliefs isrepresented by the mean and covariance matrix of a (multivariate) Gaussiandistribution. Since the belief about the noise Qp describes the standarddeviation of the different noise factors and thus needs to be positive at alltimes, we choose a log-normal distribution for robustness.– BeliefUpdatemechanismsaremostlystandard,andaredescribedinSectionA.2.To efficiently update the agent’s belief after performing an action, we usean Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which can be used to propagate Gaussianrandom variables through system dynamics [27,11].– Action Selection is based on minimising Expected Free Energy (EFE) asdescribedinSectionA.3.Sincethesecalculationsrequirealotofcomputationtime,especiallywhenthehorizonN islarge,theevaluationinthisworkwillexclude simulations with information gain.– Perceptual Delay is modelled by constructing a belief about s(t−τ) fora given perceptual delay of τ ∈ N timesteps and updating this belief usingtheobservationo(t−τ)obtainedinstept.Beforeactionselection,theagentuses its generative model and the last actions to create a temporary beliefabout s(t) by sequential updates. Additionally, we let the agent know aboutthe exact target location only after the initial delay (see Section3.2).31D Mouse Pointing with Active InferenceWe now demonstrate how AIF can be applied to simulate a human user performinga1D-mousepointingtask.Insuchatask,theuserisaskedtopositionamouse cursor within a one-dimensional target whose size and distance is variedsystematically.AdetaileddescriptionaboutthepointingtaskisprovidedinSec-tionC.Wesimulatesingletrialswhichterminateassoonasthebuttonisclickedsuccessfully or after two seconds.

In Active Inference terms, this means that we construct a gener-ative process that plays the role of the ‘real world’. The agent can interact withthe process via a Markov Blanket which also defines what the agent observes.Theagentalsoconstructsagenerativemodeloftheworld,whichcanbedifferentfromtherealworld.Wedecidedtokeepthesystemdynamicsidentical,however,the generative model is governed by the agent’s belief about system parameters(which may be wrong or uncertain). Our model has two main components, thearmdynamicsandthefingerdynamics,andanadditionallogicformouseclicks.Arm Dynamics As a basis for our simulated arm dynamics we choose aSecond-Order Lag model [23,16,4]. The state of this system is given by thecursor position s and velocity s . The agent controls the acceleration a that121is applied to the cursor. When moving a computer mouse over a desk in areasonable area, there is no force pulling the mouse to a certain stable position.Therefore we decided to set the cursor’s stiffness to zero. However, damping isstill applied with a factor of d>0.FingerDynamicsTomodeltheindexfingerpressingtheleftmousebutton,we use a simple First-Order Lag system [23] with stiffness k >0. A click isonly initiated when the displacement applied to the mouse button exceeds athreshold, requiring the agent to release the button before being able to clickagain. Therefore, both the previous button displacement s and the current3button displacement s must be present in the system state. The agent can4increase or decrease this force with a second action a .2After time-discretisation with ∆t =0.02, the combined system dynamicswhich take state s and action a and obtain the new state are therefore given bys +∆ts12f θ :R4×R2 →R4, f θ (s,a)= s2 −∆tds2 +∆ta1, (1) s4s −∆tks +∆ta442where d >0 is the damping parameter of the cursor and k >0 is the stiffnessparameter of the finger.
