### OverviewThis summary of “Structured Active Inference (Extended Abstract)” by Toby St Clere Smithe synthesizes the paper’s key arguments and findings. The paper introduces a formalization of active inference using categorical systems theory, offering a new approach to modeling complex systems and agents. It addresses limitations of existing active inference models by proposing a framework that can handle structured interfaces, hierarchical agents, and agents that interact with computer APIs. The core idea is to cast generative models as systems “on an interface,” with agents as controllers for these models. This approach enables the development of safe AI systems by allowing for formal verification of agent behavior.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers on the use of categorical systems theory (CST) to provide a compositional framework for active inference. They argue that traditional active inference models struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios due to their lack of structure. The paper proposes a new paradigm, “structured active inference,” that addresses this limitation by explicitly modeling agents’ interfaces as categorical systems. The key elements of this approach are:"The authors state: “We cast generative models formally as systems ‘on an interface’, with the latter being a compositional abstraction of the usual notion of Markov blanket; agents are then ‘controllers’ for their generative models, formally dual to them.”The authors note: “Being based on category theory, change and composition are at the heart of structured active inference: patterns of interaction among systems constitute morphisms of interfaces, as do changes-of-interface; and changes-of-structure are morphisms of systems (over interfaces).”The paper introduces the concept of “mode-dependence,” where an agent’s inputs can depend on its current state, and utilizes polynomial functors to represent these dependencies. This allows agents to correctly interact with computer APIs and to be type-checked, enabling formal verification. The authors also highlight the importance of using categorical logic to define agents’ goals as formal predicates, which can be judged in relation to their interaction contexts.### ResultsThe paper presents several key findings:"The authors state: “agents with structured interfaces (e.g. with ‘mode-dependence’, or that interact with computer APIs); agentsthatcan manageotheragents;and‘meta-agents’, thatuseactive inference to change their(internalorexternal)structure.”The authors note: “thanks to its compositionality, the logic of systems is itself ‘covariant’ with their patterns of interaction.”The paper demonstrates that structured active inference enables the development of agents that can manage other agents, and that can recursively use active inference to change their own structure. This is achieved by using the compositional nature of categorical systems to represent the interactions between agents. The authors also highlight the importance of using categorical logic to define agents’ goals as formal predicates, which can be judged in relation to their interaction contexts.The authors note: “agents’ goals may be gated behind the certification (within bounds) of their safety [3,4], and their policies judged accordingly.”The authors note: “The compositionality of the logic of systems is itself ‘covariant’ with their patterns of interaction.”The paper demonstrates that structured active inference permits not only typed policies, but also a rigorous analysis of agents’ goals as formal predicates (possibly in a fuzzy, quantitative, temporal logic), whose satisfaction may be judged in relation to their interaction contexts.### DiscussionThe paper’s central argument is that structured active inference provides a more robust and scalable framework for modeling complex systems and agents. The use of categorical systems theory allows for a compositional approach to modeling, which is essential for handling the complexity of real-world scenarios. The ability to formally verify agent behavior is a key benefit of this approach, which can be used to ensure the safety and reliability of AI systems. The authors highlight the importance of using categorical logic to define agents’ goals as formal predicates, which can be used to constrain and control self-organizing ensembles of agents."The authors state: “This promises a further important step towards safe artificial agents, as agents’ goals may be gated behind the certification (within bounds) of their safety [3,4], and their policies judged accordingly.”### ConclusionIn conclusion, the paper introduces a novel approach to active inference that addresses the limitations of existing models. By leveraging the power of categorical systems theory, the authors have developed a framework that is well-suited for modeling complex systems and agents, and for ensuring the safety and reliability of AI systems. The paper’s key contribution is the formalization of active inference using categorical systems theory, which opens up new horizons for research in this area."
