### OverviewThis paper investigates neural representation through the lens of active inference, a normative framework for understanding brain function. It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from "explicit" models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people—to "action-oriented models” that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates the formal constructs employed by active inference to explain how living organisms solve cognitive problems. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities – and the gradual transition from “pragmatic” to “detached” neural representations.### Methodology“My thinking is first and last and always for the sake of my doing.” – William JamesThe authors state: "The core of active inference is the generative model, which encompasses the statistical description of how observations stem from unobserved (hidden or latent) causes." They note: "This model supports perceptual inference and action control." The paper further elucidates the formal constructs employed by active inference to explain how living organisms solve cognitive problems. The authors state: "The key imperative, guiding living organisms, is the minimization of the discrepancy between predictions and observations." They note: "This is realized through action and perception, which jointly minimize variational free energy." The authors state: "The generative model encompasses the statistical description of how observations stem from unobserved (hidden or latent) causes." This model supports perceptual inference and action control.### ResultsThe authors state: “The key imperative, guiding living organisms, is the minimization of the discrepancy between predictions and observations.” They note: “This is realized through action and perception, which jointly minimize variational free energy.” The authors state: “The generative model encompasses the statistical description of how observations stem from unobserved (hidden or latent) causes.” This model supports perceptual inference and action control.
