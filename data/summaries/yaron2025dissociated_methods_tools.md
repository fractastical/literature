Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The core of this approach is the free energy principle, which posits that a system minimizes its free energy by predicting its sensory inputs”
*   Predictive Coding (exact quote from paper) – “This framework assumes that the brain actively constructs internal models of the world to minimize the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs”
*   Adaptive Learning (exact quote from paper) – “The network learns by adjusting synaptic weights based on the difference between predicted and actual responses”
*   Goal-Directed Behavior (exact quote from paper) – “The system’s ability to control its actions to achieve a specific goal, as demonstrated through closed-loop control experiments”
*   Deviance Detection (exact quote from paper) – “The network’s capacity to identify and respond to unexpected or anomalous stimuli”
*   Self-Organized Criticality (exact quote from paper) – “The system’s tendency to evolve towards a critical state, characterized by a power-law distribution of event sizes”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The network utilizes gradient descent to optimize synaptic weights and minimize the error between predicted and actual responses”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The system employs Bayesian inference to update its internal models based on new sensory evidence”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch was used to implement the neural network models and training algorithms”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy was used for numerical computation and array manipulation”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas was utilized for data analysis and preprocessing”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB was used for simulation and visualization”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn was used for machine learning tasks, including clustering and dimensionality reduction”
*   CUDA (exact quote from paper) – “CUDA was used to accelerate the training of the neural network models on GPUs”

## Datasets

*   Cortical Neurons (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were conducted using cultured rat cortical neurons”
*   Spatial Maps (exact quote from paper) – “Spatial maps were generated by recording the extracellular action potentials from multiple neurons simultaneously”

*   Multi-Electrode Arrays (exact quote from paper) – “The experiments were conducted using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) to record the activity of multiple neurons simultaneously”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “The accuracy of the network’s predictions was evaluated using the percentage of correctly classified samples”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “The F1-score was used to measure the balance between precision and recall”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision was calculated as the ratio of true positives to the total number of predicted positives”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall was calculated as the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positives”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “The MSE was used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
