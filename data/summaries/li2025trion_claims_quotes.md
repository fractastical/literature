Okay, let's begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The authors demonstrate that color-dependent attractive interactions in the three-color Hubbard model on a π-flux square lattice induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states.
2.  The key hypothesis is that increasing the coordination number (from the honeycomb lattice to the π-flux square lattice) enhances the Néel ordering due to increased off-site trion density.
3.  The authors propose a GL analysis, suggesting that the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders is stabilized by color-dependent Hubbard interactions.
4.  The paper investigates the thermal melting of the coexisting CDW and Néel orders, demonstrating a simultaneous vanishing of both orders at the critical temperature.
5.  The authors state that the π-flux square lattice provides an ideal platform for studying the influence of coordination number on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Nevertheless, unlike the repulsive SU(N) Hubbard model and the attractive SU(2) Hubbard model, multiple spin states in the attractive SU(N) Hubbard model suppress charge fluctuations, making the system classical-like.” (Introduction) – *This quote establishes the context of the study and highlights the key difference between the repulsive and attractive Hubbard models.*
2.  “We employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a π-flux square lattice at half-filling.” (Introduction) – *This quote identifies the core methodology used in the research.*
3.  “We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the attractive three-color π-flux Hubbard model.” (Introduction) – *This is a direct statement of the primary finding of the paper.*
4.  “In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the π-flux square lattice.” (Results) – *This quote specifies the mechanism driving the enhanced Néel ordering.*
5.  “The coexisting CDW and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously.” (Results) – *This quote describes the thermal behavior of the coexisting order phases.*
6.  “We also suggest a GL analysis, which implies that the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders is stabilized by color-dependent Hubbard interactions.” (Discussion) – *This quote indicates the theoretical framework used to interpret the results.*
7.  “The nearest-neighbor kinetic bond operator for one off-site trion is defined as” (Methods) – *This quote provides a specific definition of a key term used in the paper.*
8.  “We perform finite-size extrapolations of the order parameters D, M1, and M3” (Results) – *This quote describes the experimental approach used to obtain the results.*
9.  “The CDW order parameter is defined as (1)ix+iy+jx+jy C(i,j)” (Methods) – *This quote provides a specific definition of the CDW order parameter.*
10. “The coexisting CDW and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously.” (Results) – *This quote describes the thermal behavior of the coexisting order phases.*
