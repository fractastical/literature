Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Assertion:** The paper argues that the free energy principle (FEP) – as initially formulated – contains technical issues that require clarification and refinement. Specifically, it challenges the assumptions underpinning the FEP's claims about self-organization and Bayesian inference.

2.  **Solonoidal Coupling:** A central hypothesis is that certain types of solenoidal coupling (flow terms) are precluded when constructing Markov blankets, particularly in nonequilibrium systems. This is linked to the constraints imposed by the FEP’s assumptions.

3.  **KL Divergence and Evidence Bounds:** The authors highlight the distinction between “exact” and “approximate” Bayesian inference, emphasizing that the free energy principle relies on approximate inference, and the KL divergence (evidence bound) plays a crucial role in this approximation.

4.  **Markov Blanket Definition:** The paper proposes a more precise definition of a Markov blanket, emphasizing its role in separating internal states from external influences.

5. **Hypothesis:** The authors hypothesize that the free energy principle is not a universal explanation for all self-organizing systems, and that it requires careful consideration of the specific constraints and assumptions that are being made.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Biehl et al (2020) present some interesting observations on an early formulation of the free energy principle…” (Introduction) – *Significance:* This establishes the paper's response to a prior critique.

2.  “No one likes to be told that they have made mistakes. Fortunately, all of the observations in (Biehl et al., 2020) are interesting, some are correct and none confound the FEP.” (Introduction) – *Significance:*  Acknowledges the initial critique and sets the tone for a detailed response.

3.  “Technically, the free energy principle asserts that any ‘thing’ that attains nonequilibrium steady-state can be construed as performing an elemental sort of Bayesian inference.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  States the core claim of the FEP.

4.  “Informally, this can be described as self-evidencing; namely, anything that exists is actively seeking evidence for its existence.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Provides an informal interpretation of the FEP.

5.  “In short, life is its own existence proof (Colombo and Wright, 2018).” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Offers a concise, evocative summary of the FEP's central claim.

6.  “The free energy principle in brief… the gradient flows that underwrite nonequilibrium steady-state can be expressed as a gradient descent on surprisal or self-information (Friston, 2013).” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Details the mathematical basis of the FEP.

7.  “First, a thing is defined stipulatively in terms of a Markov blanket (Clark, 2017; Kirchhoff et al., 2018), such that something’s internal states are independent of its external states, when conditioned on its blanket states.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Defines the key concept of a Markov blanket.

8.  “The conditional independencies, implied by the Markov blanket, induces a particular kind of information geometry in the internal state space.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Explains the geometric implications of the Markov blanket.

9.  “For any blanket state, there must be an expected internal state – and a conditional density over external states, given that blanket state. This means there is a statistical manifold in the internal state -space, corresponding to the conditional expectations of internal states, given blanket states.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Further elaborates on the internal state manifold.

10. “This allows one to characterise autonomous behaviour (i.e., the dynamics of autonomous states) in terms of constructs from psychology and economics; e.g., risk in relation to the goal states encoded by the steady-state density (Fleming and Sheu, 2002; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Connects the FEP to concepts from psychology and economics.

11. “This means that the flow on the internal statistical manifold is a gradient flow on surprisal (i.e., the negative Bayesian model evidence) of the blanket (and internal) states.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Reinforces the gradient flow interpretation.

12. “In and of itself, this is just a theoretical exercise. Practically, things get more interesting when we use the free energy principle to engineer gradient flows by writing down a generative model, under which evidence can be evaluated.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Highlights the practical application of the FEP.

13. “The steady-state is operationally defined in terms of the priors over external or blanket states that are part of the generative model. Having said this, the application of the free energy principle and active inference (Da Costa et al., 2020a; Friston et al., 2017; Parr and Friston, 2017, 2018) is beyond the scope of the critique in Biehl et al (ibid). They focus on the tenets that underwrite the free energy Lemma.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Acknowledges the limitations of the FEP and its application.

14. “The key observation – here and in Biehl et al (ibid) – is that certain solenoidal coupling terms are precluded. One obvious example is the coupling between internal and external states.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  Highlights the central finding of the paper.

15. “The gradients of the evidence bound vanish for nonequilibrium steady-state flows on the internal manifold.” (Technical) – *Significance:*  States the key conclusion regarding the KL divergence.
