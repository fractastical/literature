Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Core Claim:** The paper proposes a novel approach for scene understanding leveraging an object-centric generative model based on active inference, enabling an agent to infer objects, their pose, and their appearance in 3D from raw sensory data.

2.  **Hypothesis:** By minimizing the expected free energy, the agent can balance epistemic foraging (exploring the environment to gain knowledge) and goal-directed behavior, leading to effective scene understanding.

3.  **Key Finding:** The proposed active inference framework outperforms supervised and reinforcement learning baselines in a benchmark environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

4.  **Key Finding:** The agent’s ability to actively explore the environment and adapt to novel observations is crucial for achieving robust scene understanding.

5.  **Key Finding:** The generative model’s ability to decompose a complex scene into its constituent objects, along with the incorporation of pose information, significantly improves the agent’s performance.
