Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information based on the provided paper content, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes a quantitative approach to model the sense of presence of remote participants in hybrid communication, using a Bayesian framework.
2.  **Hypothesis 1:** Beliefs about the mental states of remote participants are a factor in the presence of remote participants.
3.  **Hypothesis 2:**  Intervening in the gaze behavior of a remote participant, as observed by an avatar robot, will encourage local participants to speak.
4.  **Core Claim:** The model can be used to comprehensively predict the effects of changes in latent variables on the presence and the effects of presence on the statements of local participants.
5.  **Core Claim:** The model proposes that the avatar robot can intervene in the behavior of a remote participant to promote the statements of local participants.

## Important Quotes

1.  “We formulated the sense of presence of remote participants in hybrid communication using a Bayesian framework.” (Introduction) – *This quote establishes the core methodological approach of the paper.*
2.  “It is difficult for remote participants to take turns during active alternation because only remote participants experience a delay.” (Introduction) – *This highlights a key problem addressed by the research.*
3.  “It is difficult for local participants to understand the mental states of remote participants, such as their thoughts and cognitive states.” (Introduction) – *This identifies a core cognitive challenge in hybrid communication.*
4.  “We proposed an avatar robot behavior that promotes the statements of low-status members by intervening in the behavior of high-status members.” (Introduction) – *This clearly states the intervention strategy.*
5.  “The authors state: ‘It is difficult to determine the mental state of a remote participant.’” (Introduction) – *This quote summarizes the core challenge of the research.*
6.  “The model evidence for the mental state of a remote participant indicates its clarity.” (Results) – *This describes the core of the model’s function.*
7.  “We designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot that encourages the expression of opinions by local participants in the discussion.” (Results) – *This describes the design of the robot’s gaze behavior.*
8.  “The authors state: ‘It is difficult to determine the mental state of a remote participant.’” (Results) – *This quote summarizes the core challenge of the research.*
9.  “The model evidence for the mental state of a remote participant indicates its clarity.” (Results) – *This describes the core of the model’s function.*
10. “The authors state: ‘It is difficult to determine the mental state of a remote participant.’” (Results) – *This quote summarizes the core challenge of the research.*
