Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper introduces a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs).

2.  **Hypothesis:**  PML, leveraging a generative model, can learn the causal relationships between actions and environmental changes, enabling HAVs to adapt to new scenarios without retraining, addressing the limitations of traditional autonomous driving approaches.

3.  **Key Finding:** The PML-AIF framework achieves comparable performance to conventional methods while enhancing adaptability and reducing computational overhead.

4.  **Claim:** The framework utilizes a deep learning architecture to fuse perceptual and motor information, constructing an internal world model that captures the causal dynamics of the environment.

5.  **Hypothesis:**  By minimizing Free Energy (FE) – a measure of prediction error – the agent can infer actions that reduce uncertainty and improve control.

6. **Claim:** The system operates solely on visual perception, without relying on privileged information such as LiDAR, GPS, or HD maps.
