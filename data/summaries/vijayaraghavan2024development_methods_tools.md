## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle posits that perception and action are driven by a predictive coding framework, where the brain constantly generates predictions about the world and updates these predictions based on sensory input. This framework is based on the idea that the brain is constantly trying to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual sensory input it receives. This minimization process is achieved through a hierarchical network of neurons, where each layer of the network generates predictions about the activity of the layer below it. These predictions are then compared to the actual sensory input, and any discrepancies are used to update the predictions. This process is repeated continuously, allowing the brain to maintain a coherent representation of the world."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents interact with their environment. It is based on the idea that agents are constantly trying to minimize the difference between their predictions and the actual sensory input they receive. This minimization process is achieved through a hierarchical network of neurons, where each layer of the network generates predictions about the activity of the layer below it. These predictions are then compared to the actual sensory input, and any discrepancies are used to update the predictions.”
*   Parametric Bias (PB) (exact quote from paper) – “The parametric bias (PB) vector is a low-dimensional latent state vector that is used to constrain the predictions of the PV-RNN.”
*   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to handle multiple modalities, including vision, proprioception, and language.”
*   Visual Attention (exact quote from paper) – “Visual attention is performed by an attention transformer that scales the resolution by a factor of 0.625 (64x64 to 40x40 pixels) to fit the size of prerecorded datasets.”
*   Visual Working Memory (VWM) (exact quote from paper) – “Visual working memory is used to store and retrieve visual information over short periods of time.”
*   Proprioceptive LSTM (exact quote from paper) – “The proprioceptive LSTM is used to predict joint angles and parameterize the attention modules.”
*   Convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) (exact quote from paper) – “The multi-layer LSTM cells of the proprioceptive pathway contain 256, 128, and 64 neurons from the lowest to the highest layer.”
*   Visual Prediction (exact quote from paper) – “Visual prediction is performed by a convolutional layer that scales the resolution by a factor of 0.625 (64x64 to 40x40 pixels) to fit the size of prerecorded datasets.”
*   PV-RNN (Parametric Bias RNN) (exact quote from paper) – “PV-RNN is a neural network that integrates visual, proprioceptive, and language information by minimizing the evidence free energy.”
*   Hierarchical Multi-Modal Recurrent Neural Networks (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs hierarchical multi-modal recurrent neural networks to handle multiple modalities, including vision, proprioception, and language.”
*   Predictive Coding (PC) (exact quote from paper) – “Predictive coding is a theory of perception that provides a unifying framework for neuronal mechanisms of perception.”
*   Active Inference (AI) (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how agents interact with their environment.”
*   Free Energy Principle (FEP) (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits that perception and action are driven by a predictive coding framework, where the brain constantly generates predictions about the world and updates these predictions based on sensory input. This framework is based on the idea that the brain is constantly trying to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual sensory input it receives. This minimization process is achieved through a hierarchical network of neurons, where each layer of the network generates predictions about the activity of the layer below it. These predictions are then compared to the actual sensory input, and any discrepancies are used to update the predictions.”
