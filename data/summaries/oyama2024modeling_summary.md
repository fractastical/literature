"Theauthorsshowedthathighsettingofwgeneratesweakattentiontosensationandstrongertop-downwhichleadstoMWwhereinmoremovementaswellasneuralactivity."=== EXTRACTED CLAIMS ===1.The study investigates autonomous shifts between focus state and mind-wandering by conducting model simulation experiments.2.The authors extended the variational RNN model by introducing an adaptation mechanism for a meta-level parameter, the meta-prior w, which regulates the complexity term in the free energy.3.Mind-wandering occurs more frequently during tasks that are either too easy or too difficult.4.The transition from the focused state (FS) to the mind-wandering state (MW) often happens without conscious awareness.5.The probability of remaining in FS decreases over time during an FS-MW episode, as concluded by [9].6.The authors proposed a model where mental states alternate between FS and MW, with MW episodes ending when individuals consciously recognize their mind-wandering and return to the task.7.The authors state: “Theauthorsshowedthatlowsettingofwgeneratesstrongersensorybottom-upwhichleadstoFSwhereinmoremovementaswellasneuralactivityareobserved.”8.“Theauthorsshowedthathighsettingofwgeneratesweakattentiontosensationandstrongertop-downwhichleadstoMWwhereinmoremovementaswellasneuralactivity.”=== EXTRACTED FINDINGS ===1.Autonomous shifts between focused perception and mind-wandering take place when switching between low and high values associated with decrease and increase of the average reconstruction error over the past window.2.High w prioritizes top-down predictions while low w emphasizes bottom-up sensations.3.When w is adapted to a low value, stronger bottom-up sensory perception dominates, leading to a focused state.4.When w is adapted to a high value, top-down processing is enhanced, leading to a mind-wandering state.5.The number of sub-sequences increases, and the decline in the probability of FS becomes less pronounced.6.The authors state: “Theauthorsshowedthatlowsettingofwgeneratesstrongersensorybottom-upwhichleadstoFSwhereinmoremovementaswellasneuralactivityareobserved.”7.“Theauthorsshowedthathighsettingofwgeneratesweakattentiontosensationandstrongertop-downwhichleadstoMWwhereinmoremovementaswellasneuralactivity.”=== EXTRACTED METHODS ===1.The study models perception processes of continuous sensory sequences using the variational RNN model developed based on the free energy principle.2.The authors introduce an adaptation mechanism for a meta-level parameter, the meta-prior w, which regulates the complexity term in the free energy.3.The model incorporates two types of latent variables: probabilistic latent variables (z) and deterministic latent variables (d).4.The PV-RNN structure includes time constants (τl) to characterize temporal dynamics across layers.5.The generative model predicts sensory observations via a top-down pathway, while the inference model estimates the approximate posterior using the observed sensory data.6.The followingsubsectionsdescribethePV-RNNimplementationandtheuseofthemeta-priorw.7.Theauthorsintroduceanadaptationmechanismforameeta-levelparameter,themeta-priorw,whichregulatesthecomplexityterminthefreeenergy.8.Themodelincorporates twotypesoflatentvariables: probabilisticlatentvariables (z) anddeterministiclatentvariables (d).9.ThePV-RNNstructureincludes timeconstants (τl) to characterize temporal dynamics across layers.10.
