## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle aims to explain decision-making in biological agents using the minimization of a free-energy functional"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "The AIC uses gradient descent to minimize the free-energy"
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a mathematical framework that originated in computational neuroscience"
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "The generative model of the agent can be expressed as: p(x,y)= p(y|x) p(x)"
*   Gaussian Distribution (exact quote from paper) – "The generative model assumes that the observations y are generated from a Gaussian distribution"
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The mean-field approximation is used to simplify the model”
*   Kalman Filter (exact quote from paper) – “The AIC uses a Kalman filter to estimate the state”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is used for numerical computation"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks”
*   Matlab (exact quote from paper) – “Matlab is used for numerical computation”

## Datasets

*   2-DOF Robot Arm (exact quote from paper) – “The 2-DOF robot arm is used for the experiments”
*   Custom Collision Scenario (exact quote from paper) – “A custom collision scenario is used to test the fault-tolerant control”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) (exact quote from paper) – “The RMSE is used to measure the error between the predicted and actual states”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”

## Software Tools and Platforms
