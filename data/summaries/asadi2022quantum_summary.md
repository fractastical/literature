Okay, let's proceed with the extraction and summarization of the provided text.**1. Introduction**The paper introduces a novel approach to studying hadron properties – specifically, the ground state properties of hadrons – by treating them as systems exhibiting thermal entropy. It highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between the fundamental degrees of freedom (partons) and the resulting dynamics.
