Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free-energy principle is a fundamental principle of self-organization in living systems. It states that a system’s state is determined by minimizing the free energy, which is the difference between the system’s state and the state that minimizes the energy. This principle is used to explain how living systems maintain their internal order and adapt to their environment.”
*   Bayes’ Theorem (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes’ theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. It is expressed as P(y|x) = P(x|y)P(y) / P(x), where P(y|x) is the posterior probability, P(x|y) is the likelihood, P(y) is the prior probability, and P(x) is the normalizing constant.”
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (exact quote from paper) – “MLE is a method for estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the likelihood function, which is the probability of observing the data given the parameters.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active inference is a framework for understanding how systems interact with their environment to minimize their free energy. It involves predicting the causes of sensory input and actively manipulating the environment to reduce uncertainty.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It involves calculating the gradient of the function and moving in the opposite direction of the gradient.”
*   Variational Bayes (VB) (exact quote from paper) – “VB is a method for approximating the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. It involves using a simpler distribution that matches the true posterior, allowing for efficient computation.”
*   Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) (exact quote from paper) – “MAP is a method for estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the posterior probability, which is the probability of the parameters given the data.”
*   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (exact quote from paper) – “MLE is a method for estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the likelihood function, which is the probability of observing the data given the parameters.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.”
*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels.”
