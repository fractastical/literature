## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active Inference framework models perception and action as a unified process, where agents use probabilistic models to predict and minimize sensory discrepancies"
*   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (exact quote from paper) – "ACO, inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, utilizes a population-based metaheuristic to explore and exploit solution spaces"
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – "Gradient Descent is used to optimize the parameters of the model"
*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The Free Energy Principle posits that systems minimize their free energy by predicting and acting upon their environment"
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Bayesian inference is used to update the model parameters based on observed data"
*   Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (exact quote from paper) – "The Nearest Neighbor heuristic is used to construct a solution by iteratively selecting the closest unvisited node"

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – "PyTorch version 1.8.0"
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – "NumPy is used for numerical computation"
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – "Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis"
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – "Scikit-learn is used for machine learning algorithms"
*   Matplotlib (exact quote from paper) – "Matplotlib is used for data visualization"

## Datasets

*   Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) (exact quote from paper) – "The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard optimization problem defined on a graph G = (V,E), where V represents a set of vertices (cities) and E represents a set of edges (paths between cities)"
*   Randomly Generated Graphs (exact quote from paper) – "The paper uses randomly generated graphs with symmetric edge weights"
*   Graph Characteristics (exact quote from paper) – "The graphs are constructed with N nodes, where N is 100"

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Tour Length (exact quote from paper) – "The tour length is measured as the total distance traveled by the tour"
*   Standard Deviation (exact quote from paper) – "The standard deviation of the tour lengths is calculated to assess the variability of the results"
*   Improvement Percentage (exact quote from paper) – "The improvement percentage is calculated as the difference between the best tour length and the average tour length, divided by the average tour length"
*   Statistical Tests (exact quote from paper) – "Statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels are used to assess the statistical significance of the results"

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – "Google Colab is used as the computational environment"
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – "The research was conducted on a local cluster of computers"
