### OverviewThis paper investigates the sense of presence of remote participants in hybrid communication and its application to the design of avatar robot behavior. The authors formulate the sense of presence as model evidence for other’s mental states, proposing a Bayesian framework to model this phenomenon. The research focuses on designing avatar robots that can intervene in communication to promote the statements of low-status members in group discussions, where interpersonal risks are a key factor.### MethodologyThe study employs a hidden-profile task to investigate group information elaboration and team performance in learning. Participants were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group utilized an avatar robot designed to increase the presence of remote participants. The robot’s gaze behavior was carefully controlled, mimicking the attention of the remote participant. The authors utilized a Bayesian framework to model the influence of gaze behavior on the statements of low-status members. The core of the model is the idea that the presence of a remote participant increases the likelihood of a low-status member expressing their opinions. The model incorporates a key element: the risk of expressing an opinion is increased when the low-status member perceives that the high-status member is monitoring them. The authors used a hidden-profile task to investigate group information elaboration and team performance in learning. The robot’s gaze behavior was carefully controlled, mimicking the attention of the remote participant.### ResultsThe study found that the gaze behavior of the avatar robot significantly increased the presence of the remote participant, which restrained the statements of low-status members in group discussions. 

The authors measured this effect using a hidden-profile task, where participants were tasked with selecting the best candidate for a position, with information being shared differently between participants. 

The results showed that the gaze behavior of the avatar robot increased the presence of the remote participant, which restrained the statements of low-status members in group discussions
