Okay, let's begin. Here's the extracted information from the paper, following the specified requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **The Core Problem:** The paper addresses the problem of constructing consistent local energy maps (E[W|x]) for a system of interacting particles, where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies both the energy constraint (⟨p,h⟩ = U) and the consistency constraint (dp = 0).

2. **Bethe-Kikuchi as a Local Approximation:** The authors propose using the Bethe-Kikuchi formulation as a local approximation for the energy, where the local energy is defined as E[W|x] = −ln(q) + Fβ(V), where q is a local probability distribution and Fβ(V) is the local energy term.

3. **The Role of the Covariance:** The covariance (represented by the symbol "c") plays a crucial role in defining the local energy and is essential for achieving consistency.

4. **The Importance of the Projection:** The projection operator (ζ∗) is used to map the local energy to the correct domain, ensuring that the solution is consistent with the global energy constraint.

5. **The Construction of the Local Energy Map:** The authors propose a method for constructing the local energy map, which involves constructing the local energy, E[W|x], and then projecting it onto the domain of the local energy map.
