Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Claim:** The paper posits that any behavior complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation, minimizing risk and ambiguity. This is formalized as active inference.

2. **Hypothesis:** Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency, offering a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma.

3. **Key Finding:** Active inference can be universally applied to any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference, enabling a comparative analysis of different models of agency.

4. **Hypothesis:** The authors suggest that the key to understanding agency lies in the ability to accurately represent the environment and the agent's interactions within it.

5. **Key Finding:** The expected free energy functional (EFE) is a central component of active inference, encapsulating the agent’s objectives – minimizing risk and ambiguity.

## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "Is there a canonical way to think of agency beyond reward maximisation?"
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote establishes the central research question: whether a more fundamental approach to agency exists beyond reward-based mechanisms.

**Quote:** "any behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates explorationandexploitationinthesenseofminimisingriskandambiguityaboutstatesoftheworld"
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This is the core claim of the paper – that a fundamental principle underlies all agency.

**Quote:** “Active inference provides a generic framework to model biological and artificial behaviour that is widely used in neuroscience [13–17], RL [18–21] and robotics [22–25].”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This highlights the broad applicability and established use of active inference across multiple disciplines.

**Quote:** “a clear distinction is that human behaviour occurs at the macroscopic level and, thus, is subject to classical mechanics. In other words, people are precise agents:”
**Context:** Section 2
**Significance:** This establishes a key assumption: the agent’s behavior is governed by deterministic physical laws.

**Quote:** “An agent is precise when it responds deterministically to its environment, that is when h | s is a deterministic process.”
**Context:** Section 2
**Significance:** This formally defines the agent’s characteristics – deterministic response to environmental stimuli.

**Quote:** “−logP(a |h )=E [logP(s|a ,h )−logP(s,o|h )]”
**Context:** Section 3
**Significance:** This presents the core mathematical formulation of the expected free energy (EFE), the central objective function in active inference.

**Quote:** “minimisingriskandambiguity(i.e., anexpectedfreeenergyfunctionalofagent’spredictionsandpreferences)”
**Context:** Section 3
**Significance:** This clarifies the meaning of the EFE – it’s a measure of risk and ambiguity.

**Quote:** “Active inference provides a transparent recipe to simulate behaviour by minimising risk and ambiguity with respect to an explicit generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model.”
**Context:** Section 3
**Significance:** This highlights the interpretability and explanatory power of active inference – differences in behavior are directly linked to differences in the agent’s world model.

**Quote:** “we ask: is there a canonical way to think of agency beyond reward maximisation?”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This restates the core research question, emphasizing the limitations of reward-based approaches.

**Quote:** “In more detail, we factorise the state space X into states that belong to the agent H and states external to the agent S that belong to the environment.”
**Context:** Section 2
**Significance:** This describes the agent-environment decomposition, a fundamental aspect of the active inference framework.

**Quote:** “The description adopted so far could aptly describe particles interacting with a heat bath [28–30] as well as humans interacting with their environment (Figure 1.A).”
**Context:** Section 2
**Significance:** This illustrates the applicability of active inference to diverse systems, including physical and biological agents.

I have adhered to all the requirements outlined in your prompt, including strict adherence to verbatim extraction, accurate quoting, and a clear, structured presentation of the key claims and findings from the research paper.
