## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The free energy principle posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “the Helmholtz machine achieves its parameters via gradient descent”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “active inference by a selective sampling of the environment, which entails a modulation of attention reflected in the distribution of evidence”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “variational inference (VI) and the free energy principle”
*   Expectation Maximization (exact quote from paper) – “which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice”
*   Wake-Sleep Algorithm (exact quote from paper) – “the wake-sleep algorithm”
*   Hierarchical Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – “the forward and backward connections and hierarchical message passing are inherent in the implementation of the Helmholtz machine”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it uses real neurons specified by modern neural networks and updates its parameters via gradient descent”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas”
*   MATLAB (exact quote from paper) – “MATLAB”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “accuracy above 99%”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “accuracy above 99%”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “local clusters”
