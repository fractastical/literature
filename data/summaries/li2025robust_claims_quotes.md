Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the paper, formatted according to the requirements.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Main Claim:** Active statistical inference, when combined with robust sampling strategies, can produce estimators that are never worse than those obtained from uniform sampling.

2. **Hypothesis:** The performance of active inference is highly dependent on the quality of the uncertainty scores provided by the predictive model. Poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to highly noisy estimates and large confidence intervals.

3. **Key Finding:** By optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, based on the quality of the uncertainty scores, the robust sampling approach significantly outperforms standard active inference.

4. **Key Finding:** The method provides a robust framework for estimating parameters in M-estimation problems, which encompasses a broad class of estimation problems.

5. **Key Finding:** The method can be applied to a variety of real-world datasets, including those from social science research and survey research.
