Okay, let's begin extracting the key information from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Claim:** The paper demonstrates that, for a specific class of percept-action loops with a memoryless environment, it is possible to construct agents that are maximally predictive of their environment.

2. **Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the conditions under which a percept-action loop can be constructed with a maximally predictive agent.

3. **Key Finding:** The paper establishes a relationship between the entropy of the environment and the maximum achievable predictive capacity of an agent within a percept-action loop. Specifically, the maximum predictive capacity of an agent is equal to the entropy of the environment.

4. **Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the relationship between the entropy of the environment and the maximum achievable predictive capacity of an agent within a percept-action loop.

5. **Key Finding:** The paper demonstrates that the maximum achievable predictive capacity of an agent is equal to the entropy of the environment.
