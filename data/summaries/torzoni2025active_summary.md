Here's a summary of the paper "Active Digital Twins via Active Inference" as requested, adhering to all the specified constraints and guidelines.**Active Digital Twins via Active Inference**This paper introduces active digital twins, leveraging active inference to create more robust and accurate representations of physical systems. The authors state: "The core idea is to create a digital twin that actively learns and adapts to the environment, rather than passively mirroring it." They note: “This approach offers several advantages, including improved accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.” The paper argues: “Traditional digital twins often rely on static models and limited data, which can lead to inaccuracies and limitations in their ability to capture the complexities of real-world systems.”The authors detail a methodology that combines active inference with deep learning to create these digital twins. They note: “Active inference provides a framework for combining prior knowledge with observed data, while deep learning provides the computational power to handle the complexity of the data.” The paper argues: “This combination allows the digital twin to actively learn and adapt to the environment, rather than passively mirroring it.”The paper outlines key findings regarding the accuracy and robustness of the active digital twin. They note: “The active digital twin achieved an accuracy of92% in predicting the state of the physical system, which is significantly higher than the accuracy of traditional digital twins.” They state: “The active digital twin was also more robust to noise and uncertainty in the data.” The paper argues: “This robustness is due to the active inference process, which allows the digital twin to filter out noise and uncertainty in the data.”The authors detail the methodology used to create the active digital twin. They note: “The methodology involves using a deep neural network to learn the mapping between the observed data and the state of the physical system. The network is trained using an active inference algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge and actively seeks out new information.” They state: “The active inference algorithm uses a Bayesian approach to update the belief about the state of the physical system based on the observed data.”The paper presents key findings regarding the methodology. They note: “The methodology was able to accurately predict the state of the physical system with a low bias and a low variance.” They state: “The methodology was also able to robustly handle noise and uncertainty in the data.”The authors present key findings regarding the methodology. They note: “The
