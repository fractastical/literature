Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper text, formatted according to the requirements above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1. **Core Claim:** The paper demonstrates that a novel artificial neural network architecture, incorporating affordances, can be trained to perform goal-directed behavior in simulated agents.
2. **Hypothesis:** By incorporating a mechanism for learning and representing affordances—the behavioral possibilities offered by the environment—the agent’s planning and control will be significantly improved.
3. **Core Claim:** The architecture’s success stems from its ability to generate latent state encodings that capture the relevant aspects of the environment, allowing for more efficient and accurate action selection.
4. **Hypothesis:** The incorporation of a modular neural network architecture, with distinct components for visual processing, memory, and action selection, will facilitate the emergence of complex behavioral strategies.
5. **Core Claim:** The model’s ability to generalize to unseen environments, even with different obstacle configurations, highlights the robustness of its learned representation.
