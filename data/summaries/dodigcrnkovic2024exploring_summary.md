### OverviewThis paper, “Exploring Cognition through Morphological Info-Computational Framework,” investigates the nature of cognition across diverse systems, from single cells to complex organisms, proposing a novel framework centered on morphological computation and info-computationalism. The core argument is that cognition isn’t solely a product of complex neural structures but arises from the physical properties and organization of systems, viewed as information processing mechanisms. The authors advocate for a shift in perspective, moving beyond traditional symbolic models of computation to embrace a more embodied and material understanding of intelligence. The paper establishes a foundational framework for understanding cognition as a network of interconnected computational processes operating on informational structures, highlighting the role of physical embodiment and self-organization.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers on a multi-faceted approach, integrating insights from diverse fields including biology, physics, and computer science. They propose a framework that combines the principles of information theory with the concept of morphological computation. The authors’ approach is based on the idea that cognition is fundamentally about the processing of information, and that this processing can be understood in terms of physical systems. The study employs a computational approach to model and simulate cognitive processes, using algorithms to explore the dynamics of information flow and self-organization. 

The authors utilize a framework that combines the principles of information theory with the concept of morphological computation. 

The study incorporates a multi-scale approach, examining cognitive processes at different levels of organization, from the molecular to the behavioral
