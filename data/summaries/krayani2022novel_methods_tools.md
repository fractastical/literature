## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference (AIn) is a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in Cognitive Radio using active Bayesian inference” – described as a Bayesian inference framework that replaces reward functions with prior beliefs about desired sensory signals.
*   Generalized Bayesian Filtering (exact quote from paper) – “Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN)” – a hierarchical dynamic model.
*   Generalized Error (exact quote from paper) – “Generalized Errors” – used to measure abnormality.
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (exact quote from paper) – “MCMC” – used for Bayesian inference.
*   Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – used for evaluating the difference between distributions.
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayesian inference” – the core principle of the approach.
*   Dynamic Model (exact quote from paper) – “dynamic model” – the model that describes the evolution of the system.

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0” – used for implementing the Active-GDBN.
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy” – used for numerical computations.
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas” – used for data manipulation and analysis.
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn” – used for machine learning tasks.

## Datasets

*   No specific datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper. The simulation environment is described but not a specific dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – used for evaluating the performance of the proposed AIn.
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels” – used for evaluating the performance of the proposed AIn.

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab” – used for running the simulations.
*   Local Cluster (exact quote from paper) – “local clusters” – used for running the simulations.
