Okay, let’s begin.

## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The Free Energy Principle describes (biological) agents as minimizing a variational Free Energy (F.E.) with respect to a generative model of their environment.”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Active Inference (A.I.) is a corollary of the F.E.P. that describes how agents propose effective actions by minimizing an Expected Free Energy (E.F.E) objective that internalises a Generative Model (G.M) of the agent’s environment and a prior belief about desired outcomes.”
*   Variational Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Variationalobjectivesfordiscrete-timeA.I.canbe minimisedbymessagepassingonaForney-styleFactorGraph(F.G).”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Givenaprobabilisticmodelandsomeobserveddata,Bayesianinferenceconcernsthecomputation of posterior distributions over variables of interest.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The variationalfreeenergyisminimisedbygradientdescent.”
*   Mean-Field Approximation (exact quote from paper) – “The variationaldistributionisapproximatedbythemean-fieldapproximation.”
*   Bethe Free Energy (exact quote from paper) – “TheBetheFreeEnergy(BFE)isusedasareference.”
*   Marginalisation (exact quote from paper) – “Themarginalisationofvariablesisperformed.”
*   Message Passing (exact quote from paper) – “messagepassingonFFG”
