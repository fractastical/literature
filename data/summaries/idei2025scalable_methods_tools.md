## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – “The core principle of predictive processing is that the brain operates as an active inference system, continuously generating predictions about sensory inputs and updating its internal models to minimize prediction errors”
*   Variational Free-Energy Minimization (exact quote from paper) – “The model is grounded in the free-energy principle, which posits that the brain minimizes a variational free-energy to account for sensory inputs and internal states”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model is based on the free-energy principle, which utilizes Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of latent states”
*   Recurrent Neural Networks (exact quote from paper) – “The model employs a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network, which is a deep learning architecture that processes sequential data”
*   Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses GMMs to model the distribution of latent states”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “The model uses gradient descent to optimize the synaptic weights”
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – “The model is based on the free-energy principle, which utilizes Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of latent states”
