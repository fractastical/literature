Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, adhering to all the specified requirements:

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  The paper proposes an active inference approach to control and planning, shifting from optimal control to a biologically plausible model based on internal representations and prediction errors.
2.  The core hypothesis is that a hybrid active inference model, combining continuous and discrete representations, can effectively handle complex tasks like reaching and manipulating objects in dynamic environments.
3.  The authors hypothesize that hierarchical modeling, with interconnected units representing different levels of abstraction, is crucial for representing and controlling complex systems.
4.  The paper’s central claim is that the proposed model can achieve robust planning and control by dynamically integrating sensory information and generating predictions about the environment.
5.  The authors hypothesize that the model’s ability to handle dynamic environments stems from its ability to model the underlying dynamics of the system.
