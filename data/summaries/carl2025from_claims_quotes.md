Okay, here’s the extracted information from the research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Core Claim:** The paper proposes an alternative to representational models of the mind, arguing that translation isn’t about manipulating internal representations but rather an enacted activity.
2.  **Hypothesis:** The ABC framework (Affective, Behavioral, Cognitive) provides a more accurate account of translation processes, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of these dimensions.
3.  **Key Finding:** Translation is best understood as an “enacted activity” – a skillful participation in sociocultural practice, co-created in real-time through embodied interaction with text, tools, and context.
4.  **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper advocates for a radical enactive perspective, rejecting traditional representationalism and embracing the idea that cognition emerges through sensorimotor coupling and active inference.
5.  **Methodological Claim:** The authors propose a novel ABC framework as a means to capture the dynamic interplay of cognitive, behavioral, and affective processes in translation.
6.  **Theoretical Claim:** The authors propose that the mind emerges through dynamic entanglement, where the brain, body, and environment form a single, integrated system.
7. **Theoretical Claim:** The authors argue that the mind is a system collectively constituted by embodied, embedded, enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) processes.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes.” (Abstract)
    *   **Context:** Abstract
    *   **Significance:** This quote establishes the central claim of the paper – a move away from representational models to an enacted understanding of translation.

2.  “The authors state: “Cognition in this view, is fundamentally about the ongoing construction of meaning through the integration of sensory, motor, and cognitive processes.” (Introduction)
    *   **Context:** Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This quote highlights the core principle of the paper – that cognition is not a passive reception of information but an active process of construction.

3.  “In most of these approaches, the term ‘cognition’ is used in a broad, umbrella sense that includes all types of information processing and input-output transformations, such as memory, attention, reasoning, perception, etc. – essentially all mental processes.” (Introduction)
    *   **Context:** Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This quote defines the scope of "cognition" as used in the paper, setting the stage for the authors’ alternative approach.

4.  “The authors state: “Cognition in this narrower sense is related to deliberate or effortful mental processing, problem-solving, reasoning, or explicit learning.” (Introduction)
    *   **Context:** Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This quote clarifies the authors’ distinction between “broad” and “narrow” definitions of cognition, emphasizing the deliberate and effortful aspects.

5.  “The authors state: “Dual-process models differentiate between cognitive and intuitive (System 1) processes. Kahneman (2011) distinguishes intuitive (System 1) from analytical (System 2) processes.” (Introduction)
    *   **Context:** Introduction
    *   **Significance:** This quote references a well-known dual-process theory, providing a comparative framework for the authors’ approach.

6.  “The authors state: “Affective processes are feeling and emotion-related, providing an evaluative dimension that is crucial for successful agent-environment interaction. Affect and emotion are ways in which the organism enacts its concern-based engagement with the world.” (Section 2)
    *   **Context:** Section 2
    *   **Significance:** This quote defines the role of “affect” within the ABC framework, highlighting its importance in shaping translation behavior.

7.  “The authors state: “Behavioral processes encompass action- and sensation-related activities, including embodied skills and established behavioral routines.” (Section 2)
    *   **Context:** Section 2
    *   **Significance:** This quote defines the role of “behavior” within the ABC framework, highlighting its importance in shaping translation behavior.

8.  “The authors state: “Cognitive processes are reflection and thought-related, involving active sense-making that becomes prominent when automated behavioral routines no longer suffice.” (Section 2)
    *   **Context:** Section 2
    *   **Significance:** This quote defines the role of “cognition” within the ABC framework, highlighting its importance in shaping translation behavior.

9.  “The authors state: “The mind is a system collectively constituted by embodied, embedded, enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) processes.” (Section 2)
    *   **Context:** Section 2
    *   **Significance:** This quote summarizes the core concept of the ABC framework – a holistic view of the mind as an integrated system.

10. “The authors state: “Affective states do not represent truth but instead shape the way in which the translator’s cognitive processes are modulated.” (Section 2)
    *   **Context:** Section 2
    *   **Significance:** This quote highlights the role of affect in shaping translation processes.
