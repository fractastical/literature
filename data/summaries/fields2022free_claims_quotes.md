Okay, let’s begin. Here’s the extracted information from the provided paper text, formatted according to the requirements above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The FEP Drives Neuromorphic Development:** The central claim is that any system with morphological degrees of freedom and locally-limited free energy will, under the constraints of the Free Energy Principle, evolve toward a “neuron-like” morphology, supporting hierarchical computations.

2.  **Hierarchical Measurements Minimize VFE:** The paper hypothesizes that the key to achieving this “neuron-like” morphology is through hierarchical measurements, which minimize the variational free energy (VFE) by effectively “tomographically” reconstructing the environment.

3.  **Object Identification via Tomographic Computation:** The paper posits that objects are identified as sectors within the environment (B), and that the hierarchical measurement process effectively creates a “tomographic computer” – a system that uses spatial measurements to reconstruct the state of the environment.

4.  **TQNNs as General Neuromorphic Systems:** The authors argue that Topological Quantum Neural Networks (TQNNs) represent a general framework for neuromorphic computation, providing a mechanism for implementing the FEP.

5.  **Spatial Embeddings are Crucial:** The paper highlights the importance of spatial degrees of freedom (ξ) in the system’s architecture, arguing that they are essential for enabling the hierarchical computation.
