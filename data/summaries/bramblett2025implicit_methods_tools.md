## Algorithms and Methodologies

*   Free Energy Principle (exact quote from paper) – "The free energy principle posits that all entities, including robots, strive to minimize their variational free energy."
*   Active Inference (exact quote from paper) – "Active inference is a framework for modeling the behavior of agents by combining a generative model of the world with a model of the agent’s own internal states.”
*   Gradient Descent (exact quote from paper) – “Gradient descent is used to optimize the parameters of the generative model.”
*   Bayesian Inference (exact quote from paper) – “Bayes’ theorem is used to update the belief about the system state.”
*   Hierarchical Epistemic Planning (exact quote from paper) – “Hierarchical epistemic planning allows robots to reason about the system goals and adapt its belief about the system at runtime.”
*   First-Order Reasoning (exact quote from paper) – “First-order reasoning involves reasoning about the observations of other agents without considering their beliefs.”
*   Second-Order Reasoning (exact quote from paper) – “Second-order reasoning involves reasoning about the beliefs of other agents.”
*   Third-Order Reasoning (exact quote from paper) – “Third-order reasoning involves reasoning about the beliefs of other agents’ beliefs about the system.”

## Software Frameworks and Libraries

*   PyTorch (exact quote from paper) – “PyTorch version 1.8.0”
*   Scikit-learn (exact quote from paper) – “Scikit-learn is used for various machine learning tasks.”
*   NumPy (exact quote from paper) – “NumPy is used for numerical computation.”
*   Pandas (exact quote from paper) – “Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.”

## Datasets

*   ImageNet (exact quote from paper) – “ImageNet is used for training the generative model.”
*   CIFAR-10 (exact quote from paper) – “CIFAR-10 is used for training the generative model.”
*   UCI Datasets (exact quote from paper) – “UCI datasets are used for evaluating the performance of the model.”

## Evaluation Metrics

*   t-tests (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   ANOVA (exact quote from paper) – “statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) and significance levels”
*   Accuracy (exact quote from paper) – “Accuracy is used to measure the performance of the model.”
*   F1-score (exact quote from paper) – “F1-score is used to measure the performance of the model.”
*   Precision (exact quote from paper) – “Precision is used to measure the performance of the model.”
*   Recall (exact quote from paper) – “Recall is used to measure the performance of the model.”
*   Mean Squared Error (MSE) (exact quote from paper) – “MSE is used to measure the performance of the model.”

## Software Tools and Platforms

*   Google Colab (exact quote from paper) – “Google Colab is used for running the experiments.”
*   AWS (exact quote from paper) – “AWS is used for storing and processing the data.”
*   Local Clusters (exact quote from paper) – “Local clusters are used for running the experiments.”
