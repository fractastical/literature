## Important Quotes

**Quote:** "Neural dynamics under active inference are consistent with current models of neural population dynamics."
**Context:** Results
**Significance:** This establishes a key validation of the active inference framework.

**Quote:** “We show that the neuronal dynamics prescribed by active inference approximate natural gradient descent on free energy.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This is a central claim of the paper – that active inference can be mathematically described as a form of gradient descent.

**Quote:** “The free energy landscape for discrete state-estimation is convex.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This statement highlights a crucial property of the underlying mathematical model, which is essential for the convergence of the optimization process.

**Quote:** “It follows that the energetics needed for a change in beliefs may be quantified by the length of the path travelled by the agent’s beliefs in information space.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This quote introduces the concept of information length as a measure of the computational and metabolic cost of belief updating.

**Quote:** “The authors state: ‘We show that the neuronal dynamics prescribed by active inference approximate natural gradient descent on free energy.’”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This is a central claim of the paper – that active inference can be mathematically described as a form of gradient descent.

**Quote:** “The free energy gradient is a prediction error – plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations.”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This explains the link between the free energy and neuronal dynamics.

**Quote:** “To ensure metabolic and computational efficiency, an efficient belief updating algorithm should reach the free energy minimum via the shortest possible path on average.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This emphasizes the efficiency aspect of the active inference framework.

**Quote:** “The softmax activation function in neural population dynamics”
**Context:** Methods
**Significance:** This highlights the role of the softmax function in the model.

**Quote:** “The last decade has developed a theory of how the brain might be implementing active inference consistently with neurology [1,7,49,57].”
**Context:** Introduction
**Significance:** This provides the historical context for the paper’s claims.

**Quote:** “The key is that the agent does not know the free energy minimum in advance, she must find it using only local information about the free energy landscape.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This highlights the importance of local information in the process.

**Quote:** “In short, the neuronal dynamics associated with state-estimation are consistent with mean-field models of neural population dynamics.”
**Context:** Discussion
**Significance:** This summarizes the key finding of the paper.
