Okay, let’s begin extracting the key claims and important quotes from the provided research paper.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **Central Claim:** The paper demonstrates that real-world networks deviate from pure scale-free behaviour due to the constraints imposed by information processing during network formation.

2.  **Hypothesis:** Agents following free energy minimization principles generate network structures that exhibit deviations from scale-free behaviour, reflecting the interplay between information processing and network topology.

3.  **Claim:** The paper identifies three distinct information processing regimes – noise-dominated, optimal detection, and saturation – that shape network formation.

4.  **Hypothesis:** The attachment kernel, which describes how agents connect to neighbours, emerges from the interplay of these regimes, creating characteristic network structures.

5.  **Claim:** The observed knee-shaped degree distribution in many real networks is a direct consequence of these information processing constraints.

6.  **Hypothesis:** The model predicts that network growth will be super-linear in the optimal detection regime, reflecting the compound improvement in detection, belief, and action.

## Important Quotes
