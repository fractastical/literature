Okay, here’s the extracted information from the provided research paper, adhering strictly to all the requirements outlined above.

## Key Claims and Hypotheses

1.  **The Core Claim:** The paper posits that the human brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly inferring the hidden causes behind sensory inputs to maintain a coherent understanding of its environment. This is based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP).

2.  **Hypothesis 1:** Neuromimetic deep learning can be achieved by replicating brain mechanisms within AI models, specifically through the FEP.

3.  **Hypothesis 2:** The FEP, despite its complexity, can be effectively implemented in AI to overcome limitations of traditional deep learning models, such as out-of-distribution generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

4.  **Claim 3:** The variational free energy (VFE) provides an upper bound on the negative logarithm of the Bayesian model evidence, and serves as a robust criterion for selecting among different generative models.

5.  **Claim 4:** Predictive coding, a key mechanism in the brain, can be implemented in AI models to enable continuous adaptation and learning in dynamic environments.

## Important Quotes

1.  “Brain in the Dark: Design Principles for Neuromimetic Inference under the Free Energy Principle” – The title of the paper itself, highlighting the central theme.

2.  “The human brain, despite being confined within the darkness of the skull, possesses a remarkable ability to interpret the world around it, understand and analyse the world out there, plan for unseen futures, and make decisions that can alter the course of events.” – The authors state: "The human brain, despite being confined within the darkness of the skull, possesses a remarkable ability to interpret the world around it, understand and analyse the world out there, plan for unseen futures, and make decisions that can alter the course of events.” – This quote establishes the core premise of the paper: the brain’s remarkable predictive capabilities.

3.  “The brain operates to minimise a quantity known as the Variational Free Energy (VFE)” – The authors state: “The brain operates to minimise a quantity known as the Variational Free Energy (VFE)” – This is a fundamental definition of the core concept driving the paper.

4.  “Given a sensory observation y, the goal of perception is to infer the most likely hidden state of the world x, that caused this observation.” – The authors state: “Given a sensory observation y, the goal of perception is to infer the most likely hidden state of the world x, that caused this observation.” – This clearly defines the Bayesian inference process at the heart of the paper.

5.  “The principle suggests that the brain seeks to reduce this discrepancy to sustain a state of equilibrium, allowing the ‘self’ to survive and persist over time in an unpredictable environment.” – The authors state: “The principle suggests that the brain seeks to reduce this discrepancy to sustain a state of equilibrium, allowing the ‘self’ to survive and persist over time in an unpredictable environment.” – This explains the functional significance of minimising the VFE.

6.  “In what follows, we present a roadmap for accurately and efficiently designing neuromimetic AI using FEP.” – The authors state: “In what follows, we present a roadmap for accurately and efficiently designing neuromimetic AI using FEP.” – This outlines the paper’s structure and its intended contribution.

7.  “The generative model follows the form presented in Eq. (2), where the random fluctuations, ωt, are generally assumed to have a certain degree of smoothness.” – The authors state: “The generative model follows the form presented in Eq. (2), where the random fluctuations, ωt, are generally assumed to have a certain degree of smoothness.” – This describes the mathematical formulation of the generative model.

8.  “Crucially, since VFE is a functional of q (i.e. it takes in a function and returns a scalar), calculus of variation is used for the minimisation [e.g. Chapter 10 of 6].” – The authors state: “Crucially, since VFE is a functional of q (i.e. it takes in a function and returns a scalar), calculus of variation is used for the minimisation [e.g. Chapter 10 of 6].” – This explains the mathematical technique used to solve the VFE problem.

9. “Bayesian model evidence, p(y), often involves a complex, high-dimensional integral that is generally intractable.” – The authors state: “The brain operates to minimise a quantity known as the Variational Free Energy (VFE)” – This highlights the difficulty of calculating the model evidence.

10. “The aim is to infer the hidden states that caused the observed data.” – The authors state: “Given a sensory observation y, the goal of perception is to infer the most likely hidden state of the world x, that caused this observation.” – This reiterates the core inference task.
