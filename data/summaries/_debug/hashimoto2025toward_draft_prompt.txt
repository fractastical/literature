Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object ownership to correctly execute
instructions such as “Bring me my cup.” However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and
ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize
informationgain,therebyacquiringownershipknowledgeefficientlytoimprovelearningefficiency. Additionally,byleveraging
commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only
ownedobjectsaretargetedforquestioning. Throughexperimentsinasimulatedhomeenvironmentandareal-worldlaboratory
setting,ActOwLachievedsignificantlyhigherownershipclusteringaccuracywithfewerquestionsthanbaselinemethods. These
findingsdemonstratetheeffectivenessofcombiningactiveinferencewithLLM-guidedcommonsensereasoning,advancingthe
capabilityofrobotstoacquireownershipknowledgeforpracticalandsociallyappropriatetaskexecution.

Fig. 13 shows the average ARI and standard deviation
of C over 10 trials at each step. In the laboratory envi- n
ronment, where object types and appearances were highly
similaracrossusers,thediscriminativepowerofattributein-
formation was limited, making IG-based question selection
less effective. Even so, by lowering the weight of the at-
tribute modality, our method achieved slightly higher ARI
thanIG-minandRandom,suggestingthatadjustingmodality
contributions can improve adaptability in challenging envi-
ronments. Moreover, the proposed method outperformed
bothNo-LLMandLLM-onlyinclusteringconsistency,indi-
cating that the combination of strategic question generation
and the probabilistic generative model remained effective.

Inthisstudy,weproposedActOwL,whichenablesrobots
to efficiently learn object ownership in domestic environ-

   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Toward Ownership Understanding of Objects: Active Question Generation with Large Language Model and Probabilistic Generative Model"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
