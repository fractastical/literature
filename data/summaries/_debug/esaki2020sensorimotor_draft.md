J.,2010;limited to only the central visual field of about5 degrees McGregor, S. et al.,2015; Friston, K. et al.,2017; Buckley, C.L. et al.,2017). The FEP mathematically describes the principlethat human visual field has this spatial limitation, it is necessary to that living things obey. The free energy in the FEP measuresmove the gazing position to obtain environmental information (see) the difference between the probability distribution ofin a wide area. This leads to a phenomenon called sensorimotor environmental states that act on a biological system and ancontingency (hereafter called SMC; O’Regan, J. K. and Noë, approximate posterior distribution of environmental statesA.,2001; Seth, A.K.,2015), which changes the interpretation encoded by the configuration of that system. The biologicalof “seeing” (Land, M. F.,2006; Friston, K. and Kiebel, S., system minimizes the free energy by changing its configuration2009; Seth, A.K. et al.,2012; Adams, R.

These twovisual perception makes “seeing” knowing about things to do changes correspond to action and perception, respectively, andrather than making an internal representation. In other words, lead to “active inference” and “perceptual inference.” Theexperience is not something we feel but something we do biological system thus encodes an implicit and probabilistic(O’Regan, J.

This is because human sensorimotor model of the environment.visual perception makes “seeing” knowing about things to do Although the FEP has successfully described a biologicalrather than making an internal representation. In other words, system of performing active and perceptual inferences,experience is not something we feel but something we do mathematical description of the FEP is not enough to modelhuman sensorimotor visual perception. An embodiment of thissystem is the key to achieving sensorimotor visual perception.The embodiment provides an interaction between the biologicalsystem and environment, resulting in sensory inputs andactions, and the causal relationship between these is stored inthe biological system (Fitzpatrick, P. et al.,2003; Cheng, G.et al.,2006; Friston, K.,2011; Gallagher, S. and Allen, M.,2018).In this paper, we propose an embodied system based on FEPto achieve sensorimotor visual perception. The proposedembodied system is configured by a body, which partiallyobserves the environment, and memory, which has classifiedprior knowledge about the environment as a generative model.By limiting body and memory abilities and operatingaccording to the FEP, the proposed embodied systemrepeatedly takes action to obtain the next sensory inputbased on various potentials of future sensory inputs.Figure1 shows the processing flow of sensorimotor visualperception with proposed embodied system.Sensorimotor Visual Perception on Embodied System Using Free Energy PrincipleKanako Esaki1, Tadayuki Matsumura1, Kiyoto Ito1 and Hiroyuki Mizuno11Center for Exploratory Research, Research & Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japankanako.esaki.oa@hitachi.comAbstract visual perception infers the environmental state, not the sensoryinput itself.
