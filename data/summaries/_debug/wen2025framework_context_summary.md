Abstract
This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with
Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches
to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering,
have fundamental limitations. We pr...
