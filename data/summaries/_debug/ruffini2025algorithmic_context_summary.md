Abstract
The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal con-

controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This
principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy
Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only
proven in limited settings. H...
