### OverviewThis paper investigates the subsumption thesis – the claim that expected utility theory, as applied in economics, is subsumed by active inference. The authors argue that while expected utility provides a useful framework, active inference offers a more comprehensive account of agency, particularly in complex, uncertain environments. The research establishes a formal bridge between these two approaches, demonstrating that active inference and expected utility arrive at similar conclusions when utilizing information-theoretic bounded rationality constraints. The paper highlights the significance of this connection for understanding the foundations of economic policy and the nature of intelligent behavior.### MethodologyThe authors employ a formal approach, utilizing Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) as frameworks for comparing expected utility and active inference. They define the key elements of each approach, including the free energy objective function in active inference and the expected utility calculation. Crucially, they introduce information-theoretic bounded rationality (ITBR) – a constraint that limits the amount of information an agent can process, mirroring real-world cognitive limitations. This ITBR constraint is then applied to both the expected utility and active inference frameworks, revealing a convergence in their results. The authors utilize a simplified example – a paraglider navigating a two-mountain environment – to illustrate the core concepts and demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches. The paper's methodology is centered on a rigorous, formal comparison, utilizing mathematical frameworks and constraints to assess the relative merits of each approach.### ResultsThe key finding of the paper is that, when constrained by ITBR, the expected utility and active inference frameworks yield identical agency behaviors in the paraglider example. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the agent, when faced with the two-mountain environment, will consistently choose the action that minimizes the free energy, regardless of whether it is modeled as an expected utility agent or an active inference agent. This convergence highlights the fundamental similarity between the two approaches when accounting for cognitive limitations. The authors quantify this convergence by stating that the expected utility agent will consistently choose the action that minimizes the free energy, while the active inference agent will also consistently choose the same action. The paper provides specific numerical results, stating that the expected utility agent will consistently choose the action that minimizes the free energy, while the active inference agent will also consistently choose the same action. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, supporting the central argument of the paper.### DiscussionThe authors conclude that the subsumption thesis holds true, but only under the condition of incorporating ITBR. They argue that this integration is essential for achieving a realistic and comprehensive understanding of agency. They further state that the convergence of the two approaches suggests that active inference may represent a more fundamental theory of agency, capturing the core principles of intelligent behavior. The authors highlight the implications of this finding for economic policy, suggesting that a move towards incorporating ITBR into economic models could lead to more robust and effective policies. The authors state that the convergence of the two approaches suggests that active inference may represent a more fundamental theory of agency, capturing the core principles of intelligent behavior.
