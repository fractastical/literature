### Towards Stochastic Fault-tolerant Control using Precision Learning and Active InferenceThis paper investigates the development of a fault-tolerant control scheme for robotic manipulators utilizing precision learning and active inference. The authors present a novel approach designed to circumvent the need for a priori threshold definitions when triggering fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, representing its health status, is learned online in a model-free manner, allowing the system to gradually and without abruptness exclude failing sensors. The core idea is to model the sensor precision and update it online in a model-free way, allowing the system to gradually and without abruptness exclude failing sensors.The authors build upon the framework of unbiased active inference (u-AIC), a promising approach for fault-tolerant control. The u-AIC is used to estimate the state of the system and generate control inputs. A key methodological contribution is the incorporation of precision learning, where the inverse covariance matrix of each sensor is updated online based on observed sensory data. Specifically, the authors employ a Gamma prior on the precision, facilitating Bayesian inference. The system is governed by a deterministic dynamic model of the system, which is not accessible to the agents. The authors utilize a Kalman filter to estimate the state and control inputs.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors tested the method on a2-DOF robotic manipulator, injecting a fault into one of the encoders. The results show that the system is able to reach the set-point without any threshold definitions or ad-hoc recovery mechanisms. The authors report the following key findings: “The authors state: ‘The precision learning is a promising approach for fault-tolerant control.’” They note: “The system is able to reach the set-point
