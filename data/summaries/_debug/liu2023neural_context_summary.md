Abstract. Thefreeenergyprinciple(FEP),asanencompassingframe-
work and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for
various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social
interaction, andhermeneutics. Asa computationalmodeldeeply rooted
in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on
variat...
