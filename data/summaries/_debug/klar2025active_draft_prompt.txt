Abstract. We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a com-
putational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI). We present an AIF agent with continu-
ous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional
mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic sys-
tem to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual de-
lay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the
agent’s actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely
based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing click-
ingabuttoncorrectly.Ourresultsshowthattheagentcreatesplausible

the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent

1 Introduction
Pointing is a fundamental interaction technique and Human-Computer Inter-
action (HCI) has a long history of studying human pointing behaviour [18].
Pointing is a way of communicating information through an interface by ma-
nipulating a user-controlled cursor into spatial partitions corresponding to ac-
tions; typically, these are discrete actions like selecting a menu item. Modelling
pointing behaviour is crucial in engineering interactions well-suited to human
capabilities,orinpredictingthebehaviourofusersinusinganexistinginterface

it has attracted substantial attention in the HCI literature. HCI has historically
focused on high-level descriptive models of pointing using summary statistics.

Fitts’ Law [5, 6, 14] is the classic model, and relates the expected time taken
to acquire a target (with a certain tolerated error rate) to the size and distance
of the target from the cursor origin. While such models are effective in explain-
ing movement time and are simple to apply, they do not attempt to model the
detailed process of target acquisition itself, and do not consider click dynamics.
Insights into complete cursor trajectories would enable more precise prediction
of user intentions and the development of improved assistive tools.
One way to improve this understanding is to build a fine-grained, compu-
tational, generative model of the human user that synthesizes the entire target
acquisition process. Approaches to model whole pointing trajectories have been
introduced, e.g. in [3, 16, 4, 15, 13], often with models derived from a control-
theoretic perspective, such as the Minimum Jerk model [7] or the E-LQG [25].
Other approaches have applied machine learning to derive policies that emulate
human behaviour from data [1, 2, 10]. These classical models typically rely on
thedesignofcostorrewardfunctions,whichareoftendefinedbyacombination
ofthedistancebetweenthecursorandthetargetandthecontroleffortrequired
to reach it. They are also typically deterministic in that they do not model
or represent uncertainty explicitly, some even requiring a predefined movement
time.Furthermore,incontrasttoourapproach,thesefocusoncursormovement
only and clicking is usually not included, or seen as a separate task.

of preferences over observations, rather than rewards. Different behaviour for
difficult targets, which occurs in real user data (see Fig. 1), should emerge from
greater uncertainty in the target acquisition rather than changed model and re-
ward parameters – which is often the case in the classical models of pointing
mentioned above. As an underlying model, we make use of the well-understood
Second-OrderLagmodelwhichiscommonlyusedtomodelhumanmousepoint-
ing[23,16,4].Usingsuchasimplesystemtorepresentthehumanmotorcontrol
system allows us to focus on the AIF agent’s inference and control. We addi-
tionally apply perceptual noise and delay in order to achieve a more human-like
behaviour [20, 21]. AIF is a widely-applicable model of the behaviour of or-
ganisms that unifies Bayesian models of perception with a probabilistic model
for action under uncertainty. It postulates behaviour as a process of reducing
surprise to drive the environment into preferred configurations and minimizing
uncertainty that might, in the future, lead to disfavoured states.
Recently there has been interest in bringing active inference concepts into
the study and practice of HCI, see reviews such as [17] and [26]. Stein et al. [24]
explored ordinal selection with AIF, i.e., selecting the target from a set of dis-
crete elements, but modelling pointing with AIF has not been explored. In the
context of pointing, AIF offers a fundamentally different perspective. An AIF
formulation frames pointing as a continuous process of minimizing prediction
error by continuously updating internal beliefs based on sensory input. Active
inference defines the goals of a (simulated) user in terms of a distribution over
desired observations. For example, rather than moving the cursor exactly to the

of clicking the button correctly. However, AIF has typically been applied in dis-
cretecontextsorinrestrictedforms.Modellingpointing,atthelevelofdynamic
trajectory generation, requires a continuous representation of actions (such as
potentials to be propagated to a simulated motor system), states, and obser-
vations (such as cursor position). We propose an AIF model that is capable of
modelling fine-grained pointing behaviour in this continuous setting, and which
generalises to different tasks and environments.
In summary, our contributions are:
– Acontinuousactiveinferenceformulationofpointandclickbehaviourwhich
does not rely on arbitrary discretisations, appropriately models perceptual
noiseanddelay,andprovidesprobabilisticpredictionsofcursortrajectories.
– An empirical study of a classical 1D pointing task with our active infer-
ence model, including a comparison of pointing trajectories with behaviour
observed in a user study.
2 Active Inference for Continuous Dynamic Systems with
Observation Noise and Perceptual Delay
Control of a human limb is an example of the general problem of control of a
dynamic system. Section A describes the notation for such continuous system
dynamics, how the agent constructs a belief about the states, dynamics and
noise, as well as how it updates them. Specific adaptations of the standard
general active inference approach in our model include:
4 M. Klar et al.
– System Dynamics:ThegeneralequationsaredescribedinSectionA.1.In
the context of modelling a human pointing with a mouse, the system state
may be a combination of the cursor’s position and velocity and whether the
mouse button is being clicked. The observation reflects the user’s visual,
proprioceptive, or haptic perceptions, which are noisy by nature.
– Probabilistic Beliefs of AIF Agent are constructed about the states,
dynamics and noise: 1. Belief about system state Qs := N(µs,Σs). 2. Be-
lief about parameters of the system dynamics Qθ := N(µθ,Σθ). 3. Belief
about noise in observations Qp := exp(N(µp,Σp)). Each of these beliefs is
represented by the mean and covariance matrix of a (multivariate) Gaus-
sian distribution. Since the belief about the noise Qp describes the standard
deviation of the different noise factors and thus needs to be positive at all
times, we choose a log-normal distribution for robustness.
– BeliefUpdatemechanismsaremostlystandard,andaredescribedinSec-
tion A.2. To efficiently update the agent’s belief after performing an action,
we use an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which can be used to propagate
Gaussian random variables through system dynamics [27, 11].
– Action Selection is based on minimising Expected Free Energy (EFE) as
describedinSectionA.3.Sincethesecalculationsrequirealotofcomputation
time,especiallywhenthehorizonN islarge,theevaluationinthisworkwill
exclude simulations with information gain.
– Perceptual Delay is modelled by constructing a belief about s(t−τ) for
a given perceptual delay of τ ∈ N timesteps and updating this belief using
theobservationo(t−τ)obtainedinstept.Beforeactionselection,theagent
uses its generative model and the last actions to create a temporary belief
about s(t) by sequential updates. Additionally, we let the agent know about
the exact target location only after the initial delay (see Section 3.2).

3.1 The Generative Process and Model
Tosimulatehumanpointing,weneedtobuildamodelforthepointingtechnique
and interface. In Active Inference terms, this means that we construct a gener-
ative process that plays the role of the ‘real world’. The agent can interact with
the process via a Markov Blanket which also defines what the agent observes.
Theagentalsoconstructsagenerativemodeloftheworld,whichcanbedifferent
fromtherealworld.Wedecidedtokeepthesystemdynamicsidentical,however,
the generative model is governed by the agent’s belief about system parameters
(which may be wrong or uncertain). Our model has two main components, the
armdynamicsandthefingerdynamics,andanadditionallogicformouseclicks.
Arm Dynamics As a basis for our simulated arm dynamics we choose a
Second-Order Lag model [23, 16, 4]. The state of this system is given by the
cursor position s and velocity s . The agent controls the acceleration a that
1 2 1
is applied to the cursor. When moving a computer mouse over a desk in a
reasonable area, there is no force pulling the mouse to a certain stable position.
Therefore we decided to set the cursor’s stiffness to zero. However, damping is
still applied with a factor of d>0.
FingerDynamicsTomodeltheindexfingerpressingtheleftmousebutton,
we use a simple First-Order Lag system [23] with stiffness k > 0. A click is
only initiated when the displacement applied to the mouse button exceeds a
threshold, requiring the agent to release the button before being able to click
again. Therefore, both the previous button displacement s and the current
3
button displacement s must be present in the system state. The agent can

increase or decrease this force with a second action a .

After time-discretisation with ∆t = 0.02, the combined system dynamics
which take state s and action a and obtain the new state are therefore given by

on the system parameters θ =[d,k,T,W,α ].

Click logic The observation of clicks works as follows. If the previous but-
ton displacement was below and the current button displacement is above the
threshold, a click is issued and c = 1. In any other case c = 0.1 If, addition-
ally, the cursor position is inside the target, i.e.,
(cid:0)

, the button is

clicked successfully, i.e., g(s) = 1 (otherwise g(s) = 0). The last entry of the
4 4
output represents a negative feedback for clicking outside the button, such as a
beep tone commonly used in studies [16]. As such, g(s) = −1 when a misclick
5
happens (otherwise g(s) = 0). We intentionally add this observation to allow
5
the agent to have a specific preference of not observing a misclick.
Since human perception is inherently subject to noise, we add Gaussian
noise to the agent’s observations of cursor position and button displacement.
We assume that the other components of output are observed without any
disturbances, leading to an observation of o = [o ,o ,g(s) ,g(s) ,g(s) ] with
1 2 3 4 5
o ∼ N (g(s) ,σp) and o ∼ N (g(s) ,σp). Except otherwise noted, we use the
1 1 1 2 2 2
parameters shown in Section B.1.
3.2 Belief Priors and Perceptual Delay
We explore agents that are supposedly well-trained in the pointing task, i.e.,
the means of the prior belief about the system parameters Qθ are close to the
real values while the uncertainty is small. However, to model the initial delay of
perceiving the target, we initialise the agent’s belief about the target location
to be centred at the initial position and have a high uncertainty, i.e., the agent
believes that the target could appear anywhere on the display. In summary, the
agent’s initial belief Qθ is given by
µθ =[d,k,0.0,0.03,α ], Σθ =diag (cid:16)(cid:2) 0.2,0.2,0.9,0.02,10−6(cid:3)2 (cid:17) . (4)

c
Notethatwekeepsomeuncertaintyaboutthedampingandstiffness.Thisisdue
to the fact that an agent with pristine knowledge about all system parameters
would not need to infer the system state from noisy observations. Instead, its
internal model of the world would allow for perfect prediction of the cursor
trajectoryandclicking,resultinginsuper-humanperformance.However,tokeep
the sources of uncertainty in check, we provide the agent with full knowledge
about the amount of observation noise, i.e. Qp is given by
µp =[σp,σp], Σp =10−8I . (6)
1 2 2
1 Following the convention that True is represented as 1 and False as 0.
An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour 7
In future work, Qθ and Qp might also be inferred by interacting with the
system over a longer time period.
The agent starts with a reasonable initial belief about the system state, that
is
µs =[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0], Σs =diag([0.001,0.0001,0.00005,0.00005]2) . (7)
We address the time a perceived signal takes to be processed by a human as
follows. We delay observations that the agent received from the system after
applying an action by τ = 5 timesteps (=100ms). To compensate for this per-
ceptualdelay,theagentkeepsabeliefaboutthestatebeforethedelay,Qs(t−τ)
(instead of t). Prior to planning its next action, the agent then predicts the
system state at time t using its internal model. This is achieved by sequentially
updatingatemporarycopyQ˜s(t−τ)ofQs(t−τ)byusingactionsappliedduring
the delay a(t+i),i = −τ,...,−1, until arriving at Q˜s(t) (see Section A.2, 1.).
After planning and performing the next action, the agent uses the “old” action
a(t−τ) and, if available, delayed observation from o(t−τ) to obtain the belief
Qs(t−τ +1). This belief then serves as an initial point for the next planning
step.

3.3 Preference Prior
The agent’s goal is to control the generative process described in Section 3.1
in the same way a human does, i.e., such that the target button is clicked as
accurately and fast as possible. To model this in a natural way with Active
Inference,wedefinetheagent’spreferencedistributionasamarginaldistribution

Pc =N [T,1.0,0.0],diag [0.01,0.01,0.001]2 . (8)
o1,o4,o5
The mean of this distribution is centred around the cursor being at the target’s
centre, the button being successfully clicked, and not getting negative feedback
on a misclick. Adding the additional preference of not observing a misclick en-
sures that the agent only clicks when it is certain enough that the cursor is on
the button. Scaling the diagonal values of the covariance matrix allows creating
agents that have different focus on speed versus accuracy, a classical trade-off
that is present in human aimed movements [5, 22, 9].
The parameters used in the results are manually fitted to the data of one
user performing the pointing task described in Section C.1 and more details
about the fitting process can be found in Section B.1. We additionally present
the effect of changing individual parameters in Section D. It is important to
mention that we – other than previous optimal control based approaches – use
the same parameter set for all targets. The qualitatively different behaviours
emerge from the properties of the AIF agent instead.
4 Results
We investigate whether the AIF agent is able to produce movements which are
similartohuman-controlledmovements,despitethesimplicityoftheunderlying
model. In particular, we are interested in the amount of variability produced by
the agent compared to a human performing the same task.
4.1 AIF Agent Performs Pointing Task
Fig.3showsatime-seriesviewofhowtheAIFagentperformsthepointingtask.
Before obtaining knowledge about the target position (before 0.1s), the agent
keeps the cursor close to the centre. During the fast surge movement (an initial
ballistic phase of a mouse movement, [16]), the agent’s perception of the cursor
position (left plot) is subject to increased uncertainty due to the larger impact
oftheperceptualdelay.Afterslowingdownclosetothetarget,theagentregains
a more precise belief about the cursor position and ultimately manages to click
on the target. The resulting corrective movements are commonly observed in
human pointing. In the right plot, the button displacement is represented. The
initiation of a click is prompted upon attaining a threshold of α =0.05. Given
c

button,theagentonlyclickswhenitbelievesthatthecursorisinsidethetarget.

4.2 AIF Agent Follows Fitts’ Law
Fitts’ Law describes a logarithmic relationship between the ratio of a target
distance to target width and the time for humans to reliably acquire it. It is

larger values indicate targets which are more difficult to acquire.
If our model is a plausible model of human pointing, it should follow this
relationship.Ifitiswell-tunedforaspecificconfiguration(suchthatweemulate
a realistic human motor system with a particular pointing device), we should
recover similar coefficients a,b as in experimental data. Fig. 4 shows the Fitts’

4.3 AIF Agent Shows Changing Behaviour for Different Targets
Fig.5showsthetrajectoriesproducedbytheAIFagentandahumanuser,split

human, are longer for more difficult targets, i.e., smaller targets (right plots) or
targets with larger distance from the initial position at 900px. Similar to the
human, if targets are smaller or further away, the agent-controlled cursor often
shows one or multiple sub-movements, i.e., shorter corrective movements, after
the surge phase.

Another characteristic of human behaviour is that it shows higher end-point
variance for larger targets. The end-point variance of the AIF agent’s move-
ments shows a similar trend, which is displayed via the error bars next to the
trajectories in Fig. 5. Similar to the user, for large targets (left plots in Fig. 5),
the endpoints of the agent’s movements are skewed towards the starting point,
showing that the agent makes use of the target size.
5 Discussion
Implications of the results The results indicate that a full active inference
model of target acquisition and click actuation with appropriate perceptual de-
lays leads to behaviours that are comparable to human performance. The gross
behaviour, as quantified by the Fitts’ law plots, indicates human-like pointing
capacity, even without precise calibration. The AIF agent also shows realistic
end-pointvarianceandmakesuseofthetargetsize.Unlikeoptimalcontrolmeth-
ods, where parameters have to be fit not just for each user but for each target,
a single parameterisation leads to plausible pointing behaviour across targets
spanning a range of indices of difficulty. The AIF agent’s predictive models can
compensate for the delayed observations with variability that appears to corre-
spond well to human pointing in the presence of the well-known latency in the
visual system. The combination of cursor movement and clicking enables inter-
esting interactions, even in a simple model as ours, such as updating the belief
about the cursor position by observing a click or misclick.
Limitations Our model has a radically simplified representation of human
perceptionandmotorcontrolasasecond-ordersystemwithGaussian-corrupted
observations and fixed perceptual delay. Our parameterisations are hand-tuned
and validated on the data of a single user. Our agent has a relatively short time

5.1 Conclusion
We presented an active inference simulation of human pointing and clicking
behaviour with continuous states, actions, and observations. Despite its simple
2OL forward model our model generates plausible trajectories across a range
of target sizes, and it includes a full model of actuation (“click”) planning and
predictive delay compensation.
While AIF control of even this elementary system is not straightforward
– our agent has a profusion of parameters and significant inference challenges
– our findings suggest that AIF is a promising model for fine-grained inter-
action models. The inherently probabilistic nature allows for a greater variety
of cursor trajectories than comparable methods, generating a wide variety of
plausible behaviours. Our model is the first step towards active inference-based
user modelling in HCI. Our results indicate that active inference is viable for
user behavioural models and highlight many open challenges in building more
sophisticated AIF-based synthetic users.

A.2 Belief Updates
A human user will usually only have access to a limited set of system states
thattheyobserveviaoutputdevicessuchasdisplays.Forinstance,althoughwe
cannot perceive the velocity of a mouse cursor directly (as in a speedometer),
it is still an important source of information to prevent overshooting a target
button. The agent infers this information by propagating its belief about the
cursor velocity through its internal model, as explained below.
The agent has two ways to update its belief about the system state Qs:
t
1. After performing an action, the agent uses its internal model of the world
to update its belief, resulting in a new belief Qs for timestep t+1. An ef-
t+1
ficient approach for this is to propagate the agent’s belief through time using
an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [11], which allows the estimation of states
under nonlinear transition functions with Gaussian belief distributions. It in-
volves choosing sigma points in the combined space of Qs and Qθ, evaluating
f on these with the chosen action a to obtain the corresponding s , and
θ t t+1
estimating the parameters of the updated belief distribution Qs directly from
t+1
the s using Maximum Likelihood. Note that during this step we fold in the
t+1
application of the action a into the transition function that the UKF applies
t
to make predictions of the future state under action a . This update usually
t
increases uncertainty, since the agent is uncertain about the current state of the
world as well as the dynamics.
2. After a new observation, the agent updates its belief using variational infer-
ence. This means, that the agent minimizes the variational free energy F with
respect to the belief distribution parameters and the noise belief,

where Qs is the variational belief prior to making the new observation (but
after having taken the last action), Qˆs is the posterior belief, and D the
KL
KL-divergence. The first term has an analytical solution for Gaussian belief dis-
tributions,whereasthesecondtermrequiressamplingfromQˆs.Foroptimization
via gradient descent, we use the reparameterization trick [12] to backpropagate
through nVI samples in each of the kVI update steps. Depending on the knowl-
s
edge of observation noise, this step may reduce the agent’s uncertainty.

B Implementation Details
B.1 Parameters
Our AIF agent has many parameters that can have an influence in the resulting
trajectories. The following Table 1 gives an overview of these parameters. To
find suitable parameters that lead to movements similar to those of a human,
we proceed as follows.
– We roughly estimate the necessary damping d and maximal hand control a
1
bycomparingthe99%percentileandmaximaofaccelerationsandvelocities
observed in the study to those created by applying the maximal activation
to the mouse cursor system Eq. (1) for one second.
– We aim to set the stiffness of the finger dynamic such that the earliest click
can not happen faster than observed in a user clicking as fast as possible,
that is ≈0.14s per click. However, this had to be relaxed slightly to ensure
that the agent can click the button consistently.
– We obtain the reaction time of the agent by computing the first timestep
after the user exceeds an acceleration threshold of 10px/s2, that is τ ≈0.1s.
– We tune the preference distribution PC such that the resulting behaviour
shows similar clicks and misclicks as humans.
The remaining parameters are tuned by visually comparing trajectories and the
Fitts’ Law results.
B.2 The Complete Algorithm
Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code for the complete interaction loop of an
AIF agent with the mouse model. Prior to planning the next action, the agent
compensates for the perceptual delay by estimating the system state at time
t. This is achieved by sequentially updating the temporary copy Q˜s using the
previously applied actions (for-loop in planning phase) and the agent’s internal
model of the system. After planning and performing an action, the agent uses
the ’old’ action and, if available, delayed observation from τ timesteps before to
update the belief Qs(t−τ).

D Additional Results
D.1 Changing Model Parameters
Changing individual parameters can affect the point and click behaviour of the
AIF agent heavily. Fig. 7 shows trajectories to the same target (T = 1750,
W =30px), while adapting only one parameter. Changing the damping param-
eter of the mouse cursor model (upper left) defines how steep the slope in the
surge phase can be, with higher damping leading to a gentler slope (red trajec-
tories, d=40). The influence of the planning horizon (upper right) is harder to
distinguish.Ifthenumberofsampledplansduringplanningisnotadjusted,the
chance of sampling a good plan with a higher horizon is decreased. Also, since
the agent only applies the first action of the best plan, having a longer plan re-
duces the influence of this action on the expected free energy, which might lead
to suboptimal control (long red trajectory). Similarly, adjusting the preference
(cid:113)
of observing a misclick, i.e., changing ΣC , (lower left) has no clear effect on
3,3
theresultingtrajectories.Nonetheless,lowervaluesleadtolessmisclicks(almost
(cid:113)
noblackcrosses, ΣC =10−6),whilehighervaluescanleadtomanymisclicks
3,3
(cid:113)
(many red crosses, ΣC =0.1). Increasing the agent’s perceptual delay (lower
3,3
right) increases the time to target in most cases (red lines, 0.2s reaction time).
Thisisnotsurprising,sincewithlongerdelaytheagentreceivesknowledgeabout
the target position later and has a higher uncertainty about the cursor position
after the surge phase (not shown).

   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
