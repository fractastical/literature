### Deep Active Inference Agents for Delayed and Long-Horizon Environments – Summary### OverviewThis paper investigates the application of Deep Active Inference (DAIF) agents for controlling complex, industrial systems characterized by delayed feedback and long-horizon planning challenges. The authors propose a novel architecture integrating a multi-step latent transition with a generative model and a policy network, enabling agents to effectively predict future outcomes and optimize control actions. The core of the DAIF framework lies in unifying perception, action, and learning through the free-energy principle, providing a robust and interpretable approach to decision-making in uncertain environments.### MethodologyThe DAIF agent architecture comprises an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder maps observations to a latent state space, and the decoder generates predictions of future observations. The generative model is trained end-to-end using a variational autoencoder (VAE) formulation, minimizing the negative evidence lower bound (ELBO) to learn a probabilistic representation of the environment. The agent employs a policy network to select actions based on the predicted latent state, utilizing a Monte Carlo sampling method to estimate the expected free energy. The model is trained using a replay buffer, storing past experiences to improve sample efficiency and stability. The authors leverage a key insight from the free-energy principle, which posits that agents minimize surprise—the difference between their predictions and actual observations—to guide their actions. The system is modeled as a stochastic process, with Poisson processes governing the arrival of parts and machine states. The agent’s control strategy is based on a preference mapping, which quantifies the agent’s desire to achieve a specific outcome. The agent’s performance is evaluated using a set of metrics, including throughput and energy efficiency.### ResultsThe DAIF agent demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving a10.21% improvement in energy efficiency and maintaining throughput while controlling a complex industrial system. The agent’s performance was validated across10 independent and randomly instantiated environments, showcasing robustness and generalizability. Specifically, the agent’s average energy efficiency was12.49% with a standard deviation of0.04, demonstrating a high degree of consistency. The agent’s performance was evaluated over a30-day simulation period, confirming its long-term stability and effectiveness. The agent’s performance was measured using a set of metrics, including throughput and energy efficiency. The agent’s performance was significantly better than that of baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DAIF approach.
