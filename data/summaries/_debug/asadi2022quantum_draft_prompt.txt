Abstract
This paper tests how effectively the bound states of strongly interacting gauge
theories are amenable to an emergent description as a thermal ensemble. This de-
scription can be derived from a conjectured minimum free energy principle, with
the entanglement entropy of two-parton subsystems playing the role of thermody-
namic entropy. This allows us to calculate the ground state hadron spectrum and
wavefunction over a wide range of parton masses without solving the Schr¨odinger
equation. We carry out this analysis for certain illustrative models in 1+1 dimen-
sions and discuss prospects for higher dimensions.

1 Introduction
The holy grail of nuclear physics is to predict the hadron spectrum and wavefunction
from first principles. While Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) accurately explains the
underlying UV theory, it can not answer these questions, primarily due to lack of any
systematic expansion parameter in the IR. The most natural candidate for such an
expansion is around a free theory. However, the running of this coupling to large values
in the infrared, thanks to asymptotic freedom, disqualifies a perturbative expansion
around the non-interacting theory.
As a result, many alternative novel proposals for studying strongly interacting theo-
ries have been put forward, e.g. see Refs. [1–14]. One possibility is to map the strongly
interacting theory to a weakly coupled one via dualities between two local theories, e.g.
between the Sine-Gordon and the Thirring model in 1+1 dimension (1+1D) [15] or the
AdS/CFT correspondence [16] (see also [17]). However, such dualities are exceptions
rather than the rule [18], and so far no dual theory to QCD has been discovered.
A renowned proposal [4] is to use the inverse of number of colors as a small expansion
parameter, i.e. the large N expansion. This was shown to simplify the calculation
considerably in 1+1D models [7, 11], but ultimately was unsuccessful in solving the
problem in higher dimensional gauge theories and has been only used for simplifying
certain calculations in higher dimensions such as the BK equation [19, 20].
1
Nevertheless, exactly solvable models in lower dimensions have enormous value as a
testbed for assaying new alternative approaches to non-perturbative physics. Models in
1+1D have the advantage of fewer degrees of freedom, e.g. no spin or transverse modes,
and that the renormalization of the structure functions is power suppressed. These
simplifications, along with certain exact dualities, have allowed analytic solutions to be
obtained for some models in 1+1D, e.g. see Refs. [3, 7]. The hope is that the nature
of the solution in such exactly solvable models can give us a clue about some simple
emergent principle that results from strong interactions between the free theory degrees
of freedom. Such a sought-after principle ought to be general enough that it is not tied
to the special properties of the model, and therefore be portable to theories in higher
dimensions. Nevertheless, for any proposed principle to ultimately have value, we need
to first be able to demonstrate its validity for distinct models in 1+1D.
We currently gather information about hadron structures mainly through scattering
experiments, such as Deep Inelsatic Scattering (DIS), in which the internal structure of
a hadron is accessed through universal, yet non-perturbative, functions such as parton
distribution functions (PDFs), transverse momentum PDFs (TMDPDFs), generalized
parton distributions (GPDs), etc., each carrying less information than the full wave-
function. These functions do not have any analytical solution and determining them is
almost completely reliant on experimental results and measurements. (Even first princi-
ple numerical calculations of PDFs is a very recent development [21–27].) So a natural
goal of any non-perturbative approach would be to reproduce the form of the PDFs by
comparison with data or numerical computations.
In this paper, we take the view that it is worthwhile searching for a physically
motivated principle that might arise out of the complex non-perturbative dynamics of
strongly coupled theories. If we think of hadrons as containing many partons that are
interacting within a limited phase space, it is reasonable to assume that, thanks to nu-
merous and strong interactions, this many-parton system traverses every corner of its
phase space, i.e. follows the ergodic hypothesis, and eventually approaches an equi-
librium distribution. While the ergodic hypothesis may not hold for all Hamiltonian
systems, we want to test the regime of its applicability for strongly coupled theories.
As taught in introductory statistical mechanics, for systems reaching an equilibrium,
macroscopic properties are derived from the maximum entropy principle, i.e. we can de-
rive the well-known (micro/grand-) canonical ensembles from maximizing the Shannon
entropy of the ensemble subject to various conservation constraints. This underscores
the (quantum) information theory roots of the statistical mechanics, see Ref. [28] for a
seminal work underlining this connection. More generally, the maximum entropy prin-
2
ciple can be considered a special case of the minimum free energy principle in studying
thermodynamics systems.
Followingtheanalogybetweensuchconventionalin-equilibriumsystemsandhadrons,
statistical and quantum information principles have already been used in the literature
to model various properties of hadrons with varying degrees of success [29, 30]. Further-
more, there has been enormous interest in trying to uncover the entanglement structure
of hadrons from scattering experiments [31–50] (see also Refs. [51–59] for use of entan-
glement entropy in studying phase transitions in confining theories).
In this paper, we treat the parton inside a hadron as an open quantum system
interacting strongly with its environment. For such a system the von Neumann entropy
of the reduced density matrix is just the entanglement entropy of the parton degree
of freedom with its environment. We formulate a version of the minimum free energy
principle for a hadron using the entanglement entropy of its two-parton subsystems, from
which both its mass and its PDF can be approximately predicted over a wide range of
parton masses. In the limit of massless partons, minimizing this free energy function
is equivalent to maximizing the entanglement entropy between every pairs of partons.
Said differently, we find that ground state hadrons minimize a free energy function.
Given the form of the resulting ansatz, we are effectively testing how accurately can a
hadronberepresentedasathermalgasofpartons. Wewillinvestigatetheuniversalityof
this principle by applying it to different models in 1+1D, both for massless and massive
partons. Using this ansatz we can make fairly accurate predictions for the massless case,
as well as for moderate to large parton masses.
We have less success for the case of small but finite parton mass in these models,
which is still an on-going area of research, see Ref. [60] for a recent study; we will point
out how, with our proposed principle, further progress can be made in this limit as well.
The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. In the next section we will introduce
our conjecture on use of the minimum free energy principle for studying hadrons. We
also review basics of PDFs in 1+1D and derive an ansatz for it from our proposed first
principle. In Sec. 3 (Sec. 4) we will use our conjecture to study mesonic (baryonic)
bound states in a few toy models in 1+1D. We conclude in Sec. 5.
2 Conjecturing an Alternative First Principle
Properties of various many-body systems are studied using maximum entropy principle
or minimum free energy. To properly formulate and use maximum entropy principle,
one needs to know the (Hilbert) space under study. Then one needs to decompose
3
this (Hilbert) space into a system and an environment, trace out the environment, and
calculate an entropy ansatz using the resulting reduced density matrix of the system;
usually the Shannon (von Neumann) entropy of a subsystem of the system under study
is used for classical (quantum) many-body systems, while many other entropy ansatzes
exist as well. When in equilibrium, by definition, the state of the system is such that it
maximizes this entropy subject to some constraints, e.g. conservation of average energy
or average particle number or other quantum numbers of the system.
The choice of the basis is decided by the nature of the interaction between the system
and the environment. Here we are interested in the bound state of strongly coupled local
quantum field theories. Since entropy is intuitively a measure of mixing in a system, we
use free theory momentum eigenstates, which are strongly mixed via local interactions.
This choice of basis is fortuitously suitable for our study of PDFs, which are defined as
the momentum distribution of partons. We will study these properties in a few exactly-
solvable models in 1+1D. In keeping with our goal to make connection with the PDF, we
work in the Infinite Momentum Frame (IMF) where the bound state is boosted to a very
large light-cone momentum (P−) and small P+ component such that P+P− = M2 .
hadron
In the IMF, P+ operator is identical to the Hamiltonian [61].
Theories in 1+1D enjoy a host of simplifications, foremost among them is the restric-
tion of the bound state Fock space to valence partons.1 In particular, the full Hilbert
space of a meson (baryon) can be decomposed into the Fock space of a single quark and
a single anti-quark (N identical quarks). Each single parton space is spanned by states
with different fractional longitudinal momenta in the light-cone frame; the contribution
from higher Fock states is suppressed (at least) for the lightest bound states [62]. Fur-
thermore, gluons are not propagating degrees of freedom and the PDF is independent of
scale [63]. This follows from the fact that the gauge coupling g is dimensionful and all
radiative corrections are power suppressed by g2/Q2, where Q is the high energy scale
at which the hadron is probed in a DIS experiment. Finally, there is no notion of spin
in 1+1D, thus we can only talk about unpolarized PDFs.
For asymptotically free theories in 3+1D, while there are no dimensionful couplings
in the UV, an intrinsic scale is generated in the IR via dimensional transmutation. The
internal dynamics of the bound state then depend heavily on how this scale, Λ, compares
with the bare parton masses. In 1+1D, the role of Λ is played by the gauge coupling g,
which is now dimensionful. In this case, two extreme limits arise.
In one limit, when parton masses are zero, we expect the dynamics to be dominated
by the potential term of the Hamiltonian, since the P+ vanishes in the IMF in this limit.
1The sea quark contributions are still non-zero, but are very suppressed, e.g. see Ref. [62].
4
It is natural to surmise that strong interactions between partons maximally entangles
them; thus, we conjecture that
• In the limit of massless partons in a confining gauge theory, internal dynamics of
the system maximizes the entanglement entropy between the partons of any two-
parton subsystem carrying a fixed total momentum. We will subsequently give
this statement a precise mathematical form.
In the other limit, when parton masses are much greater than Λ, the free part of
the Hamiltonian dominates and we expect the bound state to be made up of quasi-free
partons that are interacting relatively weakly. In order to interpolate between these two
extremes, we therefore propose our main conjecture:
• The ground state hadron of a confining gauge theory minimizes the free energy of
its two-parton subsystem with fixed total momentum, defined as
F = E −TS. (2.1)
Here T is an intrinsic temperature to be determined variationally, E is the expec-
tation value of free parton Hamiltonian in the light-cone frame (E → 0 as m → 0
q
with m denoting the parton’s mass [7]), and S is an entropy function capturing
q
the entanglement of pairs of partons in a hadron, see Secs. 2.1–2.2 for further
details about the entanglement entropy used.
We can think of our proposal as a standard variational method for finding the wave-
function(eigenfunction)andthemass(eigenvalue)ofhadronsHamiltonian,withT being
the variation parameter. Our innovation is to use the ansatz that minimizes the free
energy of two-quarks subsystems, as defined in Eq. (2.1). As we will see, effectively
we are proposing the interaction of a single parton with its environment is simulated
as a thermal bath, which is already proposed in Ref. [33] in a different context. We
find that this functional form accurately predicts the wavefunction and the mass of the
ground state hadron in certain limits of the parameter space, for various toy models in
1+1D with one flavor of fundamental fermions.2 These models include 1+1D QED, aka
Schwinger model [3], 1+1 SU(N) with N → ∞ [7] as well as 1+1 SU(N) with finite N,
i.e. ’t Hooft model. Analytic or numerical results for mass and PDF of the ground state
of these models exist in the literature, e.g. see Refs. [3, 7, 62–64].

tonian,andnotinthefreeenergyexpression. Thus,weexpectthefunctionalformofthewavefunctions
to be the same if the fermion representations are changed, yet the hadron intrinsic temperature and
mass will be modified.
5
In the following two sections, we apply our conjecture to mesonic (Sec. 2.1) or bary-
onic (Sec. 2.2) bound states. The discussion of Sec. 2.1 is applicable to any confining
model in 1+1D, while that of Sec. 2.2 applies only to non-abelian theories. Further
details of specific theories will enter our analysis in Secs. 3–4. In the upcoming calcula-
tion, for the sake of simplicity, we will assume the fractional momenta in the light-cone
frame take on discrete values and each momentum state is normalized to one. This can
be done by putting the system in a box of size L so that all momenta are quantized in
units of 1/L. This helps us look past cumbersome normalization factors as well. We will
go back to the continuous limit (L → ∞) when we compare against existing numerical
results in the literature.
2.1 Meson wavefunction
In keeping with our goal to make connection with the PDF, we work in the Infinite
Momentum Frame (IMF) where the bound state is boosted to a very large light-cone
momentum (P−) and small P+ component such that P+P− = M2 . The state of
hadron
partonscanthenbeexpressedintermsofthefractionofthelargemomentumcomponent
P−. Assuming discrete values for this fractional momentum, the general quark–anti-
quark state wavefunction can be written as
(cid:88)
|ψ(cid:105) = p δ |i,¯j(cid:105),
i,¯j i+¯j,1 (2.2)
i,¯j
where possible values of the discrete fractional light-cone momentum carried by the
quark and the anti-quark, respectively, are denoted by i and ¯j, and the δ function
enforces momentum conservation. This is essentially the two-parton subsystem referred
to in our conjecture. For non-abelian gauge theories, the quark and anti-quark appear
in a color anti-symmetric state, which suggests their momentum space wavefunction is
completely symmetric. Hence, we suppress any explicit color indices in our calculation.
The quark or the anti-quark reduced density matrix can be calculated as
(cid:88)(cid:88)(cid:88)
ρ = p p∗ δ δ |i(cid:105)(cid:104)i(cid:48)|
1 i,¯j i(cid:48),¯j i+¯j,1 i(cid:48)+¯j,1
i i(cid:48) ¯j
(cid:88)
= |p |2|i(cid:105)(cid:104)i|. (2.3)
i,1−i
i
It is clear that the reduced density matrix is diagonal in this basis.
As described in the previous section, the function that is actually extracted from
any experiment is the PDF, which can be related to wavefunction of the hadron. To see
6
that, note that the PDF of a fermion q in the hadron H (with momentum Pµ) is defined
as
(cid:90) ∞ dt (cid:68) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:69)
f (x) = e−itx(n·P) H(cid:12)O (cid:12)H , (2.4)

where x is the fractional momentum of the hadron carried by the parton q, O is a twist

with nµ being a lightlike vector whose spatial component is in the opposite direction of
the hadron’s spatial momentum vector, W (a,b) is a Wilson line of the confining gauge
n
group stretched between points a and b, and ψ(x) is the quark operator. In 1+1D, as
eluded to earlier, the radiative corrections are power suppressed so that the Wilson line
and any insertions from the Lagrangian drop out. The operator O is then just the
2
quark number density operator and the PDF simply counts the average number density
of quarks carrying a fraction x of the hadron momentum. Combined with Eq. (2.3) for
the case of the meson in 1+1D, |p |2 is the discretized quark PDF with x = i, i.e.
i,1−i
f (i) = |p |2. (2.6)
q i,1−i
In the continuous limit, we simply replace the discrete fractional momentum i with the
continuous variable x. Correct quark sum rule follows from Tr[ρ ] = 1.

|p |2 must also obey the (discretized) momentum sum rule for the PDF, namely
i,1−i
(cid:88) (cid:88)

By symmetry we infer that on average, the quark and anti-quark carry 1/2 of the hadron
momentum so that
(cid:88) 1

This is automatically guaranteed if the PDF |p |2 is symmetric under i ↔ 1−i, which

is a known property of meson wavefunctions in 1+1D models.
We will use the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix from Eq. (2.3),
namely

in Eq. (2.1) for mesons and minimize the resulting free energy. In deriving Eq. (2.10)
we use the fact that in the IMF, P+ operator is identical to the Hamiltonian [61]. Note
should be taken that since the parton reduced density matrix of Eq. (2.3) is diagonal,
the von Neumann and Shannon entropies of |p |2 distribution are identical. From

as would be expected for a thermal ensemble. For simplicity, we define
T 2 ≡ P−T. (2.12)
SinceP− andT appearinourcalculationalwaysinthiscombination, weworkwithT for
the rest of our calculation. Taking the continuum limit and normalizing the distribution,

The value of T is still to be determined and this is where the details of the specific model
will come into play. This will be determined by minimizing the expectation value of the
full hadron Hamiltonian with this thermal ansatz. In the upcoming section we use this
ansatz to predict mass and PDF of mesons in various models in 1+1D.
For massless partons (m = 0), Eq. (2.13) suggests f (x) is uniform in x, agreeing
q q
with existing results in the literature [7]. This PDF maximizes the entropy of Eq. (2.9),

2.2 Baryon wavefunction
Let us study our conjecture for baryonic systems in N = 3 theories. (The case of
larger gauge groups are addressed at the end of this subsection.) These baryons include
three identical quarks in a color anti-symmetric configuration. The state of the system
(ignoring the color indices) in discretized momentum space is written as
1
(cid:88)
|ψ(cid:105) = p δ |ijk(cid:105). (2.14)

The associated density matrix is

Now we trace over one of the quarks, say the one with momentum fraction k,

where l is the fraction of momentum carried by the traced out quark, and we have
used momentum conservation to put the 1−l upper bound on the sums. We can now

We apply our free energy ansatz for every two-parton subsystem (ρ ) independently

Note that Tr[ρ ] = 1 and it is a well-defined reduced density matrix. We stress that ρ

is not the reduced density matrix of a single quark if we had traced out the other two
quarks in the full baryon density matrix, rather it can be considered a fixed-momentum
single quark reduced density matrix within a two-quark subsystem of the hadron.
The von Neumann entropy of this fixed-momentum density matrix is given by
(cid:88)

Since the two-quark subsystem carried the total momentum fraction 1 − l, their free

where m is again denoting the bare quark mass and P− is the light-cone momentum.

We use Eqs. (2.23)–(2.24) in the free energy ansatz of our conjecture in Eq. (2.1).
In other words, we conjecture the baryon wavefunction minimizes free energy of
every fixed-momentum two-parton subsystems. An intuitive way to justify using this
particular density matrix is that we have based our free energy arguments on the nature
of interactions between quarks. In particular, it is the interaction between two quarks
that is local and, hence, would lead to maximum entanglement between them in the
momentum space.
Minimizing this free energy, we find

Since the quarks are identical, the normalization factor A(l) should take a form such
that the result is manifestly symmetric under interchange of any two of them. Thus, we

Let us emphasize again that the fixed-momentum single parton density matrix we
used is not the same as the reduced density of a single quark in the baryon. The latter
can be derived from Eq. (2.14) as3

Similar to the meson case in the previous section, we can show that in these toy

So far we assumed the momentum can only take discrete values. Going to the

Finally, we should note that our discussion in this section can be generalized to the
case of N (cid:62) 4 colors. To do this, we should first trace out a quark to get the fixed-
momentum (N − 1)-quark subsystem; this process can be repeated N − 2 times, as
illustrated above, to reach the fixed-momentum two-parton subsystem. We can then
minimize every such subsystems’ free energy and work our way back to the full wave-
function. The resulting PDF ansatz will look like

3 Meson Spectrum and PDF
3.1 Schwinger Model
The Schwinger model [3] is the simplest example of an exactly solvable gauge theory.
This is an abelian gauge theory and will be a stepping stone to non-abelian gauge
theories. We start with the action

where E is the field strength of the abelian gauge group. For the weakly interacting
fermion theory, m (cid:29) g, the spectrum can be obtained using perturbation theory [15,

65]. For the strongly interacting regime, g (cid:29) m , the Schwinger model can be solved by

In Eq. (3.1), the photon can be eliminated using gauge redundancy and equations of
motion, i.e. it is not a propagating mode in 1+1D. Keep in mind that we work in the
infinite momentum frame with P− → ∞, where P+ acts as the Hamiltonian. In this
frame the right-handed component of the fermion field, ψ , is not a propagating degree
R
of freedom either and can be eliminated using equations of motion. Having integrated
out these fields, we find an effective four-fermion interaction term in the Hamiltonian
written in position space as [15, 65]

by the quark, one way of solving for the spectrum is to look at the effective light-cone

where P indicates the principal value of the integral. However, as per our philosophy,
instead of solving this complicated equation, we want to see if a simple variational
principle can give us the correct answer. To do that, we need the expectation value of
the Hamiltonian (P+)

We now plug in the ansatz from Eq. (2.13) and minimize M2 over T to find
hadron
the mass and wavefunction of the meson. We assume the wavefunction is real, or has
a phase factor that is independent of the momentum fraction x. Note that this is
simply a variational method for calculating the meson wavefunction and mass, where
the wavefunction ansatz minimizes partons free energy defined in Eq. (2.1).
Results of this calculation, and comparison with existing numerical results in the
literature [66] are shown in Fig. 1. The left panel shows the bound state spectrum for

the lowest state as a function of the parton mass m . For large masses (m /g 1)
q q ∼
we find perfect agreement between the lattice result and our prediction. This can be
attributed to the fact that this is the weakly coupled regime and the theory behaves like
a pair of nearly free quark and anti-quark, which is essentially a system at zero effective
temperature. In this regime, we expect the system to be very weakly entangled and the
state is just a product state of quark and anti-quark each carrying half of the meson
momentum.
As we move towards smaller masses, the agreement with lattice worsens, although
even at masses as low as m /g = 0.25 the error is only at ∼ 10%. The deviation from

the lattice result can be traced to the behavior of our ansatz near the extremes x ∼ 0,1.
At x ∼ 0, the PDF goes as e−α/x, which drops more abruptly than suggested by the
Schro¨dinger equation from Eq. (3.4) (∼ xα) [7] (see also Ref. [60] for recent progress

ansatz (Eq. (2.13)) captures the general behavior of the PDF.

derivative of the wavefunction, asymptotes to a constant instead of dwindling to zero.

for finite but small m /g values. In the final section, we will discuss some plausible ways
q
in which our variational principle could be modified to have better agreement.
In the right panel of Fig. 1 we show the ratio of binding energy to the kinetic term.
We see non-negligible contribution from the potential term to the Hamiltonian of the
hadron. Note that this potential is not included in our free energy term. We also show a

is a more meaningful quantity to consider as against T , since we are trying to compare
the temperature of different systems (in terms of the mass of their constituents).
We also show PDFs for different values of m in Fig. 2. While in large m limit
q q
we find perfect agreement with existing results [63], at low quark masses the agreement
starts disappearing, even though the general shape of the PDF is still captured by our
calculation. In the limit of exact m = 0, our results again agree with the conventional
q
calculation.
While the kinetic term is shared between the free energy (Eq. (2.1)) and the Hamil-
15
tonian (Eq. (3.5)), the second term in each of these quantities (respectively the entangle-
ment entropy or the potential term) are ostensibly unrelated objects that do not know
anything about each other. Hence, our free energy and the Hamiltonian are distinct
quantities and the fact that our ansatz reproduces both the mass spectrum and the
wavefunction is highly non-trivial.
3.2 ’t Hooft model
The extension of the Schwinger model to the non-abelian case with large number of
colors is the the ’t Hooft model [7]. The action for the model is
(cid:90) (cid:18) (cid:19)

S = d2x − Fa Fµνa +ψ ¯ (iD/ −m )ψ , (3.6)
4 µν q
with ψ in the fundamental representation of the gauge group SU(N). The story for
mesons is similar as for the Schwinger model, in that we still have a quark–anti-quark
state but now in a linear combination of colors. It can be shown that the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian P+P− in a two-parton meson state can be written as [62]
(cid:90) (cid:18) 1 1 (cid:19) g2 N2 −1 (cid:90) (cid:90) |φ(x)−φ(y)|2

where φ(x) is the meson wavefunction in momentum space and f (x) = |φ(x)|2.
q
Similar to the Schwinger model, we can now put our ansatz for the meson wavefunc-
tion4 (Eq. (2.13)) in Eq. (3.7) to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian and
thereby calculate the intrinsic T and, thus, the wavefunction and the meson mass. For
m = 0, our ansatz in Eq. (2.13) predicts a uniform PDF and M = 0, in agree-

different m values to calculate the meson mass and PDF.

Figure 3 shows the comparison of the ground state meson mass spectrum (as a

4 Baryon Spectrum and PDF
For non-abelian gauge groups we also have baryonic states in the spectrum. For an
SU(N) theory, this is a state of N identical quarks in anti-symmetric color configuration,
so their momentum space wavefunction is symmetric. For simplicity, we focus on the
case of N = 3 in our study of the baryons.
As explained before, we decompose the total Hilbert space into the Fock space of
three individual quarks. For 1+1D, for the lightest baryonic states, the contribution
from higher Fock states is considerably suppressed [62]. Let us assume one of the quarks
carries momentum fraction x of the whole hadron, while another one carries the total
momentum fraction z; this leaves momentum fraction 1−x−z for the third quark.
For this state, we can once again compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
(P+P−) given the action Eq. (3.6),
(cid:90) 1 (cid:90) 1−z (cid:18) 1 1 1 (cid:19)

where factors of 3 refer to number of colors. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian
has the same form as that for a meson, now generalized to the baryonic state. In
particular, since we restrict ourselves to a Fock space of 3 quarks, the binding energy is
just the sum over the binding energies for three quark pairs. We can now use the ansatz
of Eq. (2.33) with the normalization from Eq. (2.34) in Eq. (4.1) and find minimum
M value, i.e. the ground state baryon mass, and the intrinsic temperature T that
hadron
minimizes the Hamiltonian. Putting this T back in Eq. (2.35), we find the final form of
the PDF for this state.

calculation for this quantity to cross check our results.
5 Summary and Outlook
This paper is an exploration of how well a hadron in 1+1D is represented as an effective
thermal state of free partons, with entanglement entropy of a single parton in a two-
parton subsystem playing the role of thermal entropy.

We showed that the mass and the wavefunction (PDF) of hadrons for gauge theories
in 1+1D could be derived by postulating an emergent minimum free energy principle.
This principle, in turn is motivated by the observation that all QFTs have local inter-
actions, which leads to entanglement in momentum space.
Inourstudyofmodelsin1+1D,wedecomposedtheHilbertspaceintotheFockspace
of valence quarks; this can be done rigorously in 1+1D since contributions from higher
Fock states is suppressed. At the same time, there is no equivalent DGLAP evolution
and gluons are not propagating degrees of freedom, further simplifying our calculation.
Weusedtheentanglemententropybetweentwopartonsofafixedmomentumtwo-parton
system and the kinetic energy of the free partons on the light cone in our free energy
ansatz.
The free energy principle can be considered a systematic expansion about the infinite
mass limit. In 1+1D theories this is the limit where the system is weakly coupled.
However, we see that the final PDF ansatz gives astonishingly accurate results even
when we enter the strongly coupled region, i.e. when the binding energy forms an O(1)
fraction of the bound state mass. In the limit of zero parton mass, our free energy ansatz
coincides with negative of entanglement entropy of a single parton. Hence, in this limit
the bound states follow a maximum entropy principle.
This observation holds across distinct models and bound states of models in 1+1D.
20
This leads us to conjecture that this general emergent principle, which does not rely on
the details of any theory, is successful in capturing the underlying dynamics of bound
states of any confining theory. We hope this new principle could be systematically
generalized to more complicated theories, in particular in higher dimensions.
Wecanalsointerpretourproposalasastandardvariationalmethodforfindingeigen-
functions and eigenvalues of a hadron’s Hamiltonian. The template functions used in
this variational method minimize the free energy of a weekly interacting gas of particles,
subject to known constraints on their quantum numbers. In our proposed free energy
ansatz we have introduced an intrinsic temperature for the hadron. We have calculated
its value by postulating that it minimizes the Hamiltonian of the bound state, i.e. it
is the optimization parameter in our variational method. Further investigation of a
physical interpretation of this quantity is left for the future.
Our work can be extended in many other interesting directions as well. We only
focused on the ground state hadrons of models in 1+1D. We can repeat this analysis
for states with different quantum numbers. Naturally, the sum rules change for that
system and the intrinsic temperature could also change. Furthermore, our results can
be extended to the case of multiple flavors of partons; while this has been studied for
the case of mesons [7], we are not aware of such a study for baryons.
The obvious elephant in the room is the limit of finite but small parton mass. At
present we cannot reproduce the existing results obtained by numerically solving light-
cone Schro¨dinger equations. This clearly means that our proposed free energy is not
the correct function to minimize for small masses, which in turn means that a thermal
density matrix simply does not work in this regime. But given that the maximum
entropy principle works at zero mass suggests that some variation of our principle should
be plausible when we systematically move away from the zero mass limit.
Ultimately we want to extend our analysis for gauge theories in higher dimensions.
The natural starting point for venturing into higher dimensions is the heavy quark
limit; this is motivated by our principle’s success in that limit and known results about
hadrons effective Hamiltonian in this regime (from effective theories such as Heavy
Quark Effective Theory [67–70]). One challenge we face here is the issue that the PDF
evolves with a renormalization scale. While our approach allows us to calculate bound
states wavefunction, making a connection with the expectation of the twist two operator
corresponding to PDFs will be more challenging in higher dimensions, primarily owing
to non-perturbative evolution effects.
What we would be interested in is whether a general principle can be found which
21
can describe this evolution. At the same time, gluons now become propagating degrees
of freedom and must be incorporated in any minimization principle. Furthermore, in
higher dimensions particles will have spins, adding to the number of degrees of freedom
and further complicating our numerical calculation. Finally, in higher dimensions the
hadron Hilbert space decomposes into valence and unsuppressed sea quarks’ Fock space,
further increasing the dimension of the Hilbert space.
Nevertheless, the fact that we could derive properties of bound states of various
confining models (Schwinger, ’t Hooft, and SU(N) with finite N) in 1+1D to within
a few percent, suggests our conjectured first principle could be universally applied to
accurately derive properties of other confining theories even in higher dimensions. Thus,
despite the challenges mentioned above, we believe it is worthwhile trying to generalize
our principle to higher dimensions.
If our results are successfully extended to theories in higher dimensions, it is worth
trying to make predictions about other properties of hadrons such as fragmentation
functions. As another phenomenological application of our principle, we can study the
form factors of confining dark sector hadrons that could enter various early universe
or direct detection observables. We leave all these studies, as well as many other phe-
nomenological directions, for future works.
