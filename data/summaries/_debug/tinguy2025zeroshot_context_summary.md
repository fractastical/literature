Zero-shot Structure Learning and Planning for Autonomous Robot
Navigation using Active Inference
Daria de Tinguy, Tim Verbelen, Emilio Gamba, Bart Dhoedt
Abstract—Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments
requires robots to simultaneously explore, localise, and plan
under uncertainty, without relying on predefined maps or
extensive training. We present a biologically inspired, Active
Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and
Planning (AIMAPP). Thi...
