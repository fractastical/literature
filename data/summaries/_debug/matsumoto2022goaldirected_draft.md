### OverviewThis paper investigates goal-directed planning and goal understanding by active inference, proposing a novel model that can generate action plans and understand goals by integrating sensory observations. The authors demonstrate the model’s capabilities through simulated and physical robot experiments, highlighting its key features: the ability to specify goals for static sensor states and dynamic processes, the capacity to infer goals by sensory observation, and the generation of future action plans based on the best estimate of the current state, inferred using past sensory observations.### MethodologyThe proposed model, T-GLean, is built upon a variational recurrent neural network (PV-RNN) architecture. The model operates in three modes: learning mode, online action generation mode, and goal inference mode. During learning, the model learns to predict sensory outcomes of actions using the forward dynamics model. In online action generation mode, the model generates future action plans by minimizing the expected free energy. In goal inference mode, the model infers goals by observing sensory sequences. The model utilizes a probabilistic latent variable distribution to represent the state of the environment. The free energy is minimized using the Adam optimizer.### ResultsThe experiments conducted using a simulated mobile agent demonstrated that the model could generalize in generating reaching movement to unexplored goal positions with a relatively small number of training trajectories. The model achieved a low deviation in reaching movement to the specified goal positions. The experiments using a physical humanoid robot showed that the model could perform goal-directed planning and execution, as well as goal inference by observation, with a slight performance degradation compared to the simulated mobile agent. The model successfully inferred the goal and future actions in both grasping-placing and grasping-swinging goal-directed actions. The authors observed that the model could accurately predict the goal and future actions when the goal was clearly defined.### DiscussionThe study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model for goal-directed action planning and goal understanding by active inference. The model’s ability to generalize in generating reaching movement to unexplored goal positions and to perform goal-directed planning and execution, as well as goal inference by observation, highlights its potential for applications in robotics and other fields.
