Abstract. This study aims to place Lorenzo Magnani’s Eco-Cognitive Computationalism within the broader
context of current work on information, computation, and cognition. Traditionally, cognition was believed to be
exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic
of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature
and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and
incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an
info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes
on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition
as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organization, and
autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains. We examine recent findings linking morphological
computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and active inference. We
establish a connection to Magnani’s Eco-Cognitive Computationalism and the idea of computational domestication
of ignorant entities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of conventional computational
models of cognition. The traditional models prioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent
constraints and potentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of organization. Gaining a
better info-computational grasp of cognitive embodiment is crucial for the advancement of fields such as biology,
evolutionary studies, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and more.
Lorenzo Magnani’s Eco-cognitive computationalism and the idea of
computational domestication of ignorant entities
Lorenzo Magnani's Eco-Cognitive Computationalism (Magnani, 2018) (Magnani, 2021) (Magnani,
2022b) (Arfini & Magnani, 2022) is a philosophical framework that explores the interplay between
cognitive processes and their environmental contexts, particularly emphasizing the role of
computational tools in enhancing human cognitive abilities. The concept of "computational
domestication of ignorant entities" within this framework can be interpreted as the use of computational
methods and models to harness and transform less understood or unorganized aspects of the environment
(which he refers to as "ignorant entities") into structured, intelligible forms that can be more easily
manipulated and understood by human cognition.
This approach suggests that computational tools not only extend our cognitive capabilities but also
reshape our cognitive environment, making it more open to human understanding and control. By
"domesticating" these ignorant entities through computational means, we effectively restructure our
cognitive landscape, enhancing our ability to solve complex problems and generate new knowledge.
Magnani's theory touches on themes common in the philosophy of cognitive science, such as the
extended mind thesis and situated cognition, but places a unique emphasis on the transformative power
of computational technology in these processes. This perspective is particularly relevant in the context
of today's data-driven science and technology, where computational tools play a critical role in
organizing, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets, effectively bringing clarity and insights from what
might initially appear as chaotic or overwhelming information.
In the contemporary landscape of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, Lorenzo Magnani's book
"Eco-Cognitive Computationalism: Cognitive Domestication of Ignorant Entities" presents a
groundbreaking perspective. The concept of eco-cognitive computationalism offers a novel approach to
understanding computation as an active process in physical entities, which are transformed into
cognitive mediators. The main themes and concepts presented in Magnani's work emphasize the
dynamic interplay between internal processes, the body, and the environment in the emergence of
information, computation, and cognition. Eco-cognitive computationalism views computation as an
active process in distributed physical entities that are transformed to encode and decode data. This
approach moves beyond the traditional notion of digital computation, encompassing a broader range of
computational activities performed by physical devices, including the brain. Magnani argues that this
perspective avoids reducing the analysis of computation to a rigid, one-sided view, instead proposing
an intellectual framework that respects the historical and dynamic nature of concepts of information,
computation, and cognition (Magnani, 2022b).
One of the central themes in Magnani's approach is the evolutionary emergence of information and
cognition as the result of dynamic interactions between internal processes, the body, and the external
environment. Magnani emphasizes that understanding computation requires acknowledging its context
within the ecology of cognition, which includes both organic and artefactual agents (Magnani, 2022b).
Turing's insights into the emergence of cognition and computation are fundamental in this discussion.
Turing's concept of unorganized machines, which can be educated through interaction with their
environment, illustrates the dynamic nature of cognitive development. This analogy between human
brains and computational machines underscores the coevolution of information, computation, and
cognition in both natural and artificial systems (Turing, 1948).
Magnani extends the discussion of eco-cognitive computationalism to include embodied and distributed
cognition. He argues that cognitive processes are not confined to the brain but are distributed across the
body and external environment. This view aligns with recent cognitive science theories that emphasize
the role of the body and environment in shaping cognitive tasks, (Clark, 1989, 1997, 2008, 2016). The
creation of mimetic bodies, which enhance computational capabilities through morphological features,
exemplifies this approach. These bodies simplify cognitive and motor tasks, highlighting the
interdependence of internal and external resources in cognitive processes.
Magnani (Magnani, 2022b) and (Magnani, 2022a) details the cognitive strategies employed by deep
learning machines, such as AlphaGo. Magnani distinguishes between locked and unlocked strategies,
examining how these approaches impact the creativity and adaptability of AI systems. Locked strategies,
which are limited in their eco-cognitive openness, contrast with the more flexible and creative reasoning
observed in human cognition.
The final chapter in (Magnani, 2022b) explores the domestication of physical and biological bodies
through computational means. Magnani introduces the concept of overcomputationalism, which
critiques the tendency to overextend computational applications to all aspects of life. He emphasizes the
need to protect and preserve the unique qualities of ignorant entities, advocating for a balance between
computational and human-centered approaches. The future of eco-cognitive settings, Magnani argues,
should be tailored to enhance both computational efficiency and human well-being.
Magnani's Eco-cognitive computationalism presents a comprehensive and dynamic framework for
understanding computation, information, and cognition. By integrating insights from cognitive science,
artificial intelligence, and philosophy, Magnani presents a holistic view of computational systems as
integral to both natural and artificial environments. His emphasis on the dynamic and distributed nature
of cognition and computation challenges traditional notions and opens new perspectives for research
and application in these fields.
Computation in a computing Universe. Nature as a network of morphological
info-computational processes (ICON) for cognitive agents
Magnani’s Eco-cognitive computationalism with cognitive domestication of ignorant entities can be
related to a broader computational perspective of Info-computationalism, which addresses nature in
computational terms. The info-computational approach (ICON) presents a view of nature as a network
of information-processing agents organized in a dynamic hierarchy of levels. This framework aims to
unify diverse understandings of natural, formal, technical, behavioral, and social phenomena through
the perspective of information and computation. The idea that, for us, information is the fabric of reality
goes back to Wheeler’s “it from bit” (Wheeler, 1990). Our reality is a result of the processing of
information of multimodal signals coming through our senses combined with information processes in
our bodies that unfold on several levels of organization/scale. Among prominent works on informational
reality are (Baeyer von, 2004)(Lloyd, 2006)(Seife, 2006)(Vedral, 2010)(Davies & Gregersen,
2010)(Burgin, 2010). A world exists on its own with human agents in it and we discover its structures
and processes, patterns and laws, by interactions and via self-structuring (self-organization) of
information obtained through morphological/physical computation processes (Pfeifer & Iida, 2005)
(Pfeifer & Gomez, 2009) (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2013). In this analysis, a natural philosophy framework is
presented that provides a foundation for connecting domain-specific knowledge obtained from a variety
of sciences and other knowledge fields into an interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary perspective.
Unlike old-day stand-alone calculating machines, represented by the abstract logical Turing Machine
Model, modern networked and concurrently executing computers are used for worldwide
communication, information processing, cyber-physical control, and data-, information-, and knowledge
management. They serve as cognitive tools of the extended mind (Clark & Chalmers, 1998a), facilitating
social interactions, decision-making, and control of physical processes. This interconnected concurrent
nature of computation aligns with the actor model of computation (Hewitt, 2007, 2012), emphasizing
distributed, reactive, agent-based, and parallel execution. Such systems operate continuously, focusing
on behavior, response to changes, and adaptability rather than predetermined algorithm termination.
History of the idea of the computing universe
Konrad Zuse first suggested that the physical behavior of the universe could be computed on a basic
level, using cellular automata (Zuse, 1970). A similar, pan-computationalist view is supported by
various scientists (Wheeler, 1990) (Wheeler, 1994)(Fredkin, 1990), (Wolfram, 2002) (Dodig-Crnkovic,
2012) who see natural phenomena as results of computational processes. This perspective aligns with
the idea that the universe computes its next state from its current state, with interactions and information
exchanges driving its evolution (Chaitin, 2006).
Natural, physical, and morphological computation
Natural computation encompasses a range of computational systems inspired by nature, including neural
networks, genetic algorithms, and quantum computing. This field promoted a generalized model of
computation beyond traditional Turing machines, recognizing the complexity of biological and
cognitive systems. Morphological computation, a key concept, explains how physical interactions lead
to the development of complex structures and processes in living systems.
(Dodig-Crnkovic, 2013)(Dodig-Crnkovic, 2017); (Dodig-Crnkovic & Lowe, 2017) (Pfeifer et al., 2006)
(Hauser et al., 2014) (Ghazi-Zahedi et al., 2017) (Pfeifer & Iida, 2005).
Natural info-computation provides a unified framework for understanding cognitive systems through
morphological info-computation across various levels of organization. It advocates for a new philosophy
of nature, integrating information and computation to explain diverse phenomena. By generalizing
computational models, this approach aims to encompass the full range of natural processes, from physics
to cognition, highlighting the essential role of agents in these systems. The framework necessitates
generalizing computational models beyond the traditional Turing machine model, requiring agent-based
concurrent resource-sensitive models to cover phenomena from physics to cognition.
In this approach, nature computes on a variety of levels of organization where informational structures
(as observed by diverse cognizing agents at different levels) dynamically change through interactive
processes of natural computation. Natural computing (Rozenberg & Kari, 2008) (Rozenberg et al., 2012)
encompasses a wide range of areas, including quantum computing, chemical computing, biological
computing, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, reservoir computing, thermodynamic
computing, and cognitive and intelligent computing. Each of these areas draws on principles and
phenomena observed in the natural world to inform and improve computational techniques.
Natural computing (unconventional computing) raises philosophical questions about the nature of
computation and intelligence, as it challenges traditional notions about where and how computation can
occur. Natural computing continues to grow as a field of research that bridges the gap between natural
sciences and computer science, enabling new solutions to complex problems by using the power of
natural processes. It exemplifies a profound shift toward computing that is not confined to silicon but is
increasingly interwoven with biological and quantum systems, (Denning, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010) (Paun
et al., 2017; Rozenberg, 2008; Rozenberg & Kari, 2008).
The necessity of an agent/observer/actor for the generation of knowledge
Information, a concept widely used and ambiguous, is essential for understanding both everyday
applications and formal definitions in various fields of research. Current understanding of matter/energy
also reflects ambiguity, as observable matter constitutes only a small percentage of the universe, with
the rest attributed to dark matter and dark energy. This indicates a need to re-examine our understanding
of the physical world. What is missing in the traditional picture is the model of a physical observer, such
as proposed in second-order cybernetics. As (Goyal, 2012) explains, an observer in classical physics is
a highly idealized omnipotent agent looking at the world from nowhere (a “God’s eyes” perspective).
Or, as (Fields, 2012) expresses it, a “Galilean observer” is a bare “point of view”, able to observe and
conceptualize the world without affecting it or being affected. There is a hope to gain more clarity on
the structures and dynamics of the universe by connecting information and matter/energy. Information
is defined as differences that make a difference, (Bateson, 1972), or “Information expresses the fact that
a system is in a certain configuration that is correlated to the configuration of another system. Any
physical system may contain information about another physical system.” (Hewitt, 2007) In other words,
information is relational, which is fundamental.
Relational info-computation as a reality for an agent
“What we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the
registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, all things physical are information-
theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.” (Wheeler, 1990)
We can find the relational view of information in Floridi’s work (Floridi, 2003, 2008b, 2008a) in the
form of Informational Structural Realism (ISR). This relational view in physics is formulated by Carlo
Rovelli, (Rovelli, 2015) (Rovelli, 2018). Even Stephen Wolfram’s “Project to Find the Fundamental
Theory of Physics” (Wolfram, 2020) is based on the relational view, as well as the approach of (Chaitin,
2006) (Chaitin, 2018).
Barry Cooper (Cooper, 2015) addresses the issue of informational structures, citing (Floridi, 2011):
“Structural objects work epistemologically like constraining affordances: they allow or
invite certain epistemic constructs (they are affordances for inforgs like us, who elaborate
them) and resist or impede some others (they are constraints for the inforgs), depending on
the interaction with, and the nature of, the informational organisms that process them. They
are exploitable by a theory, at a given LoA, as input of adequate queries to produce
information (the model) as output.“ (p. 340)
and
“all that physics – or science in general – tells us about, and hence all that we can know, on
the basis of that physics, is structure.” (p. 343)
This question of informational structures that are not “flat” is directly connected to models of
computation as elaborated in the article “From the closed classical algorithmic universe to an open world
of algorithmic constellations” (Burgin & Dodig-Crnkovic, 2012), indicating fundamental connections
between information and computation as well as the importance of morphological (structural and
material) aspects of both.
Matter and energy are higher-order concepts derived from interactions between observers and the
universe, including mutual interactions among observers. This does not imply that reality is merely an
agreed-upon fiction. The world exists independently, with human observers/agents discovering its
structures and processes through interactions and self-structuring of information. The reality for a
cognitive agent is built upon external information and the agent's information processing architecture,
leading to diverse realities for different types of agents (Uexküll, 1957). Every subsystem in the universe
interprets every other subsystem in a way dependent on their information processing capacities, (Friston
et al., 2010) (Friston et al., 2010)(K. Friston & Kiebel, 2009)(Isomura et al., 2023).
All living beings have the ability to adapt to the environment and learn so as to increase their chances
of survival. The life itself can be understood as a process of cognition (Maturana & Varela, 1980)
(Stewart, 1996). Building on Maturana and Varela’s understanding of cognition the author proposed an
info-computational constructive framework (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2011b)(Dodig-Crnkovic, 2011a) to
explain how increasingly complex structures develop as a result of information processing in nature.
These information processes can be modeled as natural morphological computation, in the network of
networks of physical processes where constant exchange (communication) of data (signals) among
agents establishes new structures on physical, chemical, and biological levels. Instead of symbol
manipulation, morphological computation is a result of physical object interactions. Natural
computation (Rozenberg et al., 2012) can be used to explain the emergent phenomena by
complexification of information through processes of signals exchange at different levels of organization
or scale. The new framework is used as a tool for studying cognitive systems such as living organisms
or artifactual cognitive agents on different levels of complexity.
For example, only recently we learned about the essential role of viruses and bacteria for the
development of life on Earth, (Witzany, 2012). Agents exchanged among organisms can be bacteria,
viruses, or pieces of DNA that can actively alter the organism that receives them, as they continue to act
within an organism. All those processes of communication along with self-organization (autopoiesis)
unfold in thermodynamically open living systems, and they need energy to persist, in the regime on the
edge of chaos (Prigogine & Stengers, 1984) (Prigogine, 1980).
Morphological info-computation in cognitive systems
Over billions of years, nature has developed information processing networks in living organisms,
enabling them to effectively cope with environmental complexity. The evolution from inanimate to
animate matter, though largely unknown, suggests that self-assembly and self-organization of
increasingly complex structures led to the first molecular machines and cells, eventually forming
multicellular organisms. Communication processes and self-organization unfold in thermodynamically
open systems, highlighting the significance of energy in maintaining these systems. Morphological
computation, a result of physical object interactions, provides a framework for understanding the
emergent phenomena in living systems (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2017)
Evolution in the framework of info-computationalism/computational naturalism (ICON)
Evolution in the framework of ICON is understood as the dynamic process of creating, transferring, and
transforming informational structures across multiple scales and levels of organization in nature. This
perspective views nature as a hierarchical network of informational agents engaged in computational
processes, where information processing (computation) occurs. Morphological computation considers
computation as the physical process of structural change in informational structures. Evolution is driven
by these dynamic processes, where informational agents (such as cells or organisms) interact with their
environment and with each other, creating new informational structures. Lower-level informational
processes give rise to higher-level emergent phenomena through self-organization, with top-down
control structures like the nervous system and the brain, regulating bodily functions.
The evolution of information is driven by multi-level interactions and information transfers between
hierarchical levels, aligning with the principles of the extended evolutionary synthesis (EES) (Laland et
al., 2015). (G. B. Müller, 2017) (Noble, 2002, 2012, 2016b, 2016a, 2020; Corning, Kauffman, et al.
2023) (Laland et al., 2015) (G. B. Müller, 2017) (Corning et al., 2023; Noble, 2002, 2012, 2016b, 2016a,
2020) (Torday et al., 2020; Torday & Miller, 2020).
The info-computationalism/computational naturalism/ICON framework provides a perspective on the
evolution of complex systems by viewing them as hierarchical networks of informational agents
engaged in morphological computation. Nature is organized into a dynamic hierarchy of levels, with
informational processes (computation) occurring at each level, from elementary particles to biological
systems. This hierarchical structure allows for the emergence of complex systems through interactions
and information transfer across levels. The physical form (morphology) of informational agents and
their interactions with the environment shape the computational processes underlying their behavior and
intelligence. These interactions across genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and cultural processes contribute
to the emergence and evolution of complex systems.
By grounding cognition in morphological computation and embodied dynamics, the ICON framework
provides a theoretical basis for rethinking and developing new approaches to artificial intelligence (AI)
that better capture the embodied and situated nature of intelligence as observed in biological systems.
Traditional AI has typically focused on disembodied, symbolic reasoning systems, but the ICON
framework suggests that truly intelligent systems should incorporate principles of embodied cognition,
where the physical form and environmental interactions play a central role in shaping computational
processes and cognitive behavior. Morphological computation could inspire the development of AI
systems based on the computational capabilities of physical structures and their interactions with the
environment, rather than relying solely on abstract algorithms and symbolic representations. This could
lead to more robust, adaptive, and context-aware AI systems that better mimic the intelligence observed
in natural systems.
Furthermore, the ICON emphasis on hierarchical organization, self-organization, and multi-level
interactions suggests the idea of developing AI systems that can exhibit emergent behavior and adapt to
complex environments through bottom-up and top-down interactions across multiple scales and levels
of organization.
The relationships between Magnani’s Eco-cognitive computationalism and other
views of cognition based on physical computation
The concepts of information, computation, and cognition are central to various branches of philosophy,
cognitive science, and computer science. Lorenzo Magnani, Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic, Gualtiero
Piccinini, Oron Shagrir, Marcin Miłkowski, Nir Fresco and Michael Levin —each provide different
perspectives on these topics.
Lorenzo Magnani’s Eco-Cognitive Computationalism (Magnani, 2018) (Magnani, 2021) (Magnani,
2022b) (Arfini & Magnani, 2022) and Gordana Dodig Crnkovic's Info-Computationalism both study
the integration of computation with cognitive and informational processes, but they focus on different
aspects of this integration and have distinct foundational perspectives. Magnani is particularly interested
in the concept of distributed cognition, which emphasizes that human cognition extends beyond the
individual and into the environment and artifacts used. This approach views information as something
not solely processed internally but also distributed across and manipulated by external media (Magnani,
2025).
Eco-cognitive computationalism, emphasizes the role of computational tools in reshaping human
cognitive processes and environments. While it recognizes the importance of computational methods in
extending and enhancing human cognitive capacities, it is more focused on the interaction between
humans and their cognitive tools in specific environments. Magnani’s approach is particularly
interested in how computational tools can domesticate complex, poorly understood, or "ignorant"
entities, making them more accessible and manipulable by human cognition.
Info-Computationalism (ICON), (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2007) (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2008) ((Ehresmann, 2014),
in contrast, views nature itself as computational, where information processing is fundamental to the
physical, biological, and cognitive processes that constitute reality for a cognizing agent. This
framework posits that all natural phenomena can be understood in terms of information processing and
that knowledge generation is a result of computational processes in the natural world. The universe,
from this perspective, is seen as a network of networks of computational processes where different levels
of physical, biological, and cognitive phenomena interact through computational dynamics. ICON views
information as a fundamental building block of reality for an agent, a perspective based on Informational
Structural Realism (ISR) (Floridi, 2008a). In this interpretation, information, and computation are seen
as essential for understanding natural and artificial processes, implying that computation is a broader
phenomenon than what happens in digital computers. Cognition is intrinsically connected to the
processing of information integrating this into the broader ecosystem, positioning cognition as an
information-processing activity at all levels of biological and artificial systems (what Levin calls a
“multiscale competency”)(Levin, 2023). This approach introduces an integrative dimension to the study
of cognition, with cognitive processes being more widespread in biology than previously thought. It
supports a view similar to that of Magnani's distributed cognition, where cognitive processes are not
confined to the brain but are distributed throughout the body and interact closely with the environment.
The relation between these two theories can be seen in how they both extend the traditional view of
cognition and incorporate computational thinking into the fabric of understanding and interacting with
the world. However, while Eco-cognitive computationalism focuses on the enhancement of human
cognition and the domestication of complexity through computational tools, Info-computationalism
proposes a foundational theory where computation and information processing manifest in all natural
processes.
Thus, while both frameworks elaborate the role of computation in understanding and interacting with
the world, Eco-cognitive computationalism is applied and focused on the enhancement of human
cognitive environments through specific computational interventions, whereas Info-computationalism
provides a foundational perspective on nature as it appears to us, including psychological and social
aspects. Both perspectives enrich our understanding of the computational nature of cognition and reality
but from complementary angles.
Gualtiero Piccinini's approach offers another important dimension to consider regarding varieties of
computationalism (Piccinini, 2012, 2020; Piccinini & Scarantino, 2011; Piccinini & Shagrir, 2014).
Piccinini focuses on the philosophy of mind and the foundations of cognitive science, specifically the
nature of computation in cognitive systems. He proposes a mechanistic view of computation, where a
physical system is computational if it manipulates data through a set of functional transitions as specified
by its architecture. Piccinini distinguishes between different kinds of computation based on how they
are implemented physically and the kinds of processes they involve, such as digital versus analog. His
theory is comprehensive in its definition and classification of computational processes, insisting on
clear, functional, and mechanistic explanations to demarcate what counts as computation and what does
not. Piccinini’s emphasis on the physical basis of computation aligns well with Magnani’s Eco-cognitive
computationalism as both see computational tools as extensions and enhancements of human cognitive
capabilities in tangible, real-world settings. Where Piccinini provides a framework for understanding
how computational processes operate mechanistically within cognitive systems, Magnani looks at the
outcomes of these processes—specifically, how they can domesticate "ignorant" entities to augment
human cognitive capacities and modify cognitive environments.
Oron Shagrir's views on computation (Shagrir, 2010, 2022) further enrich the discourse, by addressing
topics of physical computation, computational models, computational complexity, and
hypercomputation (physically realizable computational models that can solve problems beyond the
capabilities of Turing machines, including analog computation, quantum computation, and exploiting
physical phenomena like chaos). Shagrir highlights the importance of mapping computational
descriptions onto physical phenomena, asserting that a physical system is computational if there is a
coherent way to map computational states onto the states of the physical system. His approach extends
the understanding of computation beyond the strictly mechanistic framework of Piccinini, proposing a
more inclusive approach that can accommodate different types of computations based on their functional
realization in physical substrates. Shagrir extends the computational theory of mind by exploring how
various types of computations can explain different cognitive abilities. He discusses information in the
context of how it is represented and processed by the brain, viewing computation as a model for
explaining how cognitive processes are implemented neurally. Shagrir provides a comprehensive and
rigorous analysis of the physical foundations of computation, bridging the gap between theoretical
computer science and the physical realizability of computational processes. Shagrir's way of
approaching physical systems computationally complements Magnani’s emphasis on using
computational tools to extend human cognitive processes. In both frameworks, the physical instantiation
of computation plays a central role.
Marcin Miłkowski (Miłkowski, 2013b) presents a rigorous analysis of explanation in cognitive science
through his mechanistic theory of computation. He explores various computational explanations in
cognitive science through four diverse case studies: classical computational simulation, connectionist
modeling, computational neuroscience, and radical embodied robotics. Miłkowski outlines different
computational processes, emphasizing that computation in cognitive science is broader than traditional
symbolic representations. He argues for a mechanistic account of computation that includes digital,
analog, and even quantum computation, highlighting the importance of information processing rather
than mere symbol manipulation. He defends the view that computation in cognitive science is a physical
process that underlies cognitive phenomena. Miłkowski points out the importance of a clear definition
of computation that avoids pancomputationalism (the idea that everything computes). He advocates for
the mechanistic framework as the most suitable for elucidating computational explanations, although he
acknowledges the value of other explanatory frameworks. His approach to cognition is also mechanistic,
viewing cognitive processes as computational operations defined by their causal structure and
organization.
Michael Levin provides deep insights into cognition, particularly in non-neural biological systems
(Baluška & Levin, 2016; Bongard & Levin, 2023; Fields & Levin, 2020; Levin, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023;
Levin & Pezzulo, 2016; Manicka & Levin, 2019, 2022; Mcmillen & Levin, 2024; Pezzulo & Levin,
2015). His work significantly expands the conventional understanding of cognition by studying how
cells and non-neural organisms process information and exhibit behavior that suggests a form of basal
intelligence. Drawing parallels between his work and the concepts of information, computation, and
cognition, can provide a broadened perspective on these concepts. Levin’s research primarily focuses
on the bioelectric processes that underlie the decision-making and behavior in cells and tissues,
independent of the presence of a nervous system. His studies have shown that cells and groups of cells
can process information and make complex decisions, which are critical for morphogenesis,
regeneration, and cancer suppression. This suggests a form of distributed cognition that occurs at cellular
and tissue levels. In the context of information, Levin's work suggests that all living systems, not just
neural systems, engage in processing environmental signals (information) to maintain homeostasis and
to guide development and regeneration. This is akin to the information-centric view of ICON, where
information is a fundamental component of all natural processes. Regarding computation, Levin
demonstrates that non-neural and even single-cell organisms perform complex, goal-directed tasks by
using bioelectrical signaling pathways to process inputs and drive outputs, effectively computing
responses to their environment. Levin’s research implies that biological computation can be seen in
many forms and across various biological entities, supporting a broader, more inclusive definition of
computation. Regarding cognition, Levin’s work challenges the traditional brain-centered approaches.
He proposes that cells and tissues exhibit a form of cognition, evidenced by their ability to process
information, learn, make decisions, and remember states—behaviors typically reserved for organisms
with brains. This aligns well with Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, where organisms act to minimize
surprise by forming predictive models of their environment. Levin's studies suggest that even single
cells engage in predictive modeling and decision-making processes to minimize free energy, thus
displaying a rudimentary form of cognition.
Levin’s work shows that information processing and computation are basic life functions that occur at
multiple levels of biological organization, thereby enriching our understanding of cognition in a broad
biological context.
Magnani on the interrelatedness of information, computation, and cognition
(Magnani, 2025) explores the interrelated concepts of information, computation, and cognition,
highlighting their dynamic and evolving nature in the framework of Eco-cognitive computationalism.
Magnani views these concepts from the perspective of ecological interactions between the brain, body,
and environment, emphasizing their coevolutionary aspects. Information, computation, and cognition
are conceptually deeply intertwined and influence each other's evolution.
Magnani argues against viewing these concepts as static or isolated, suggesting instead that they
dynamically interact and evolve within cultural, technological, and biological contexts.
Eco-cognitive computationalism suggests that understanding computation should extend beyond
traditional digital computation to include a variety of physical systems and processes. Computation is
seen as active in various entities that have been transformed to encode and decode data, thus participating
in cognitive processes. Semiosis (the process of signification or meaning-making) is fundamental to the
development of information and cognition. Magnani integrates insights from processes of meaning-
making from the catastrophe theory of René Thom - topology, morphogenesis, and structuralism (Aubin,
2020) in conjunction with Peircean semiotics to explain how biological and physical phenomena emerge
as salient forms carrying information. Magnani discusses how changes in technology and cultural
practices impact the meanings and functions of information, computation, and cognition. These changes
facilitate the emergence of new forms of cognitive processes and information handling, reflecting a
coevolutionary development between humans and their technological environments.
Magnani explores practical instances, such as how signs and tools externalize and distribute cognitive
processes in the environment, a concept linked to extended cognition theories (Clark & Chalmers,
1998). He makes an important observation that the meanings of information, computation, and
cognition are not fixed but are subject to continual evolution and reinterpretation. This emphasizes the
need for an integrated approach that considers the historical, ecological, and semiotic aspects of these
concepts to fully understand their roles and impacts in both natural and artificial systems. These concepts
are not merely technical or theoretical but are deeply embedded in ecological, semiotic, and cognitive
frameworks.
Karl Friston’s work related to information, computation, and cognition
Karl Friston's work, with his formulation of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), provides a perspective that
relates to the concepts of information, computation, and cognition. Friston's theory is influential in
neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive sciences, and it offers a unifying framework that can be related
to the views of the other scholars mentioned earlier.
The Free Energy Principle suggests that all living systems (from single-cell organisms to human brains)
aim to minimize their free energy. In this context, free energy is a mathematical concept borrowed from
statistical physics but represents an upper bound on the surprise or unpredictability of sensory data
given a model of the world. Minimizing free energy can be understood as minimizing uncertainty or
prediction error about the sensory inputs received from the world.
In terms of information, Friston's approach can be seen as treating cognition as fundamentally an
information-processing problem. The brain continuously infers and updates its internal models of the
world to minimize the informational discrepancy (or "surprise") between its predictions and the actual
sensory input. This aligns with views like those of (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2012a, 2014c, 2014a), who also
see information as essential to understanding of cognitive processes.
Computation in Friston's theory is about the neural mechanisms that the brain employs to achieve this
minimization of free energy. It involves complex computational strategies such as predictive coding,
where the brain uses hierarchical models to predict sensory inputs and adjust its beliefs based on
prediction errors.
The FEP effectively offers a theory of how cognition functions: it is the process by which the brain
models the world to minimize the surprise associated with new sensory inputs. Cognition, therefore, is
about reducing uncertainty through perpetual inference and learning. Predictive coding is a central
aspect of Karl Friston’s work, and a theory primarily concerned with how the brain processes sensory
information. The key idea is that the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the
environment. This model is used to predict sensory input before it arrives. The brain then compares the
actual sensory input with its predictions and adjusts its model based on the differences. The process is
hierarchical. Higher levels of the neural network make predictions about what lower levels will
perceive. Lower levels send back the prediction error (the difference between the expected sensory input
and the actual sensory input) to higher levels. This feedback leads to the updating of the predictive
model. At each level of this hierarchy, the goal is to minimize prediction error. Minimizing prediction
error can be equated to minimizing free energy. Essentially, by minimizing the surprise or the prediction
error, the brain is trying to improve its model of the world to better predict future sensory inputs.
Predictive coding has implications for learning and adaptation. As the brain continuously adjusts its
model to minimize prediction error, it learns about the environment. This learning is the brain’s way of
becoming more efficient at predicting the world, which leads to better decision-making and behavior.
Neurobiologically, predictive coding is supported by the structure and function of the brain's cortex.
Neurons in higher cortical layers are suggested to represent the predictions, while lower layers represent
the prediction errors. These layers interact dynamically to update and refine predictions through synaptic
weight adjustments, reflective of learning. Predictive coding has implications not only for neuroscience
but also for psychology and cognitive sciences, explaining phenomena such as perception, motor
control, and even psychiatric disorders. Predictive coding offers a comprehensive and computationally
detailed account of how the brain might function as a prediction and error correction machine, within
the Free Energy Principle.
Friston’s framework thus provides a biological and theoretical foundation for discussing cognition as a
process rooted in the principles of information theory and computational neuroscience. It bridges the
gap between abstract computational theories and concrete biological mechanisms, offering a robust
model that explains both the adaptiveness and the efficiency of cognitive processes in terms of energy
minimization strategies.
Friston’s work can be seen as both complementary to the interpretations of information, computation,
and cognition discussed by Magnani, Dodig-Crnkovic, Piccinini, Shagrir, Miłkowski, and Levin. Each
brings a unique perspective, but together, they enhance our understanding of the complex interplay
between the brain, its computational processes, and the information it handles. Magnani focuses on how
cognition extends beyond the brain to include interactions with the world. Piccinini emphasizes the
mechanistic nature of computation in explaining cognitive functions. Shagrir elaborates on
computational theories to account for various cognitive capabilities. Miłkowski provides a precise,
mechanistic understanding of how computational processes underpin cognition. From the biological
point of view, Levin expands the conventional understanding of cognition by studying how cells and
non-neural organisms process information and exhibit behavior that suggests basal cognition and
intelligence. Dodig-Crnkovic integrates information and computation as structure and process aspects
into a naturalist framework. Their work collectively enriches the discourse of these foundational
concepts, offering diverse yet complementary perspectives that advance our understanding of the mind
and its processes.
Future developments, cognitive computing, and AI
Eco-cognitive computationalism, proposed by Magnani, studies the role of the environment and external
representations in shaping cognitive processes. It suggests that cognition is not only an internal process
but involves interactions with the external world, including the manipulation of physical objects and
representations. This perspective aligns with the embodied and situated cognition paradigm, which
recognizes the importance of an agent's physical form and environmental interactions in shaping
cognitive behavior. Similarly, the ICON (info-computationalism or computational naturalism)
framework, discussed before, highlights the concept of morphological computation, where the physical
structure and embodied interactions of agents shape their computational processes.
In the context of AI development, particularly for large language models (LLMs), eco-cognitive
computationalism could inform the design of more grounded and context-aware systems. LLMs are
trained on vast amounts of textual data, which means disconnected from the physical world of embodied
experiences.
By incorporating principles from Eco-cognitive computationalism, LLMs could be designed to integrate
external representations, such as images, diagrams, or physical objects, into their cognitive processes.
This would involve multimodal learning, where the model learns to associate textual information with
visual or other sensory inputs, potentially leading to more grounded and contextually relevant language
understanding and generation.
Furthermore, Eco-cognitive computationalism emphasizes the role of external representations in
cognitive offloading and distributed cognition. This could inspire the development of interactive AI
systems that leverage external representations and tools to augment their cognitive capabilities. The Eco-
cognitive perspective could inform the development of AI systems that can better adapt to and interact
with dynamic environments, as it recognizes the importance of environmental factors in shaping
cognitive processes. The principles of embodied and situated cognition, as well as the integration of
external representations and environmental interactions, could potentially contribute to the development
of more grounded, context-aware, and adaptive AI systems.
Similarly, the application of ICON framework to AI systems, with the principles of embodied and
situated cognition, hierarchical organization, self-organization, information dynamics, morphological
computation, and constructive approach offers insights and perspectives for rethinking the development
of AI systems, including LLMs, to better capture the embodied and adaptive nature of intelligence
observed in natural systems. Hierarchical Organization and Self-Organization could inform the
development of architectures that incorporate hierarchical representations and self-organizing
mechanisms, enabling the emergence of higher-level cognitive capabilities from lower-level
interactions. Such architectures could potentially exhibit more flexible and adaptive behavior, akin to
the self-organization observed in natural systems. The ICON framework adopts a constructivist
approach, where meaning and semantics emerge from the interactions between agents and their
environments, rather than being predefined or imposed externally. For LLMs, this could inspire the
development of models that learn to construct meaning and semantics through interactions with
multimodal data and environments, rather than relying solely on predefined symbolic representations.
Such models could potentially exhibit more flexible and context-aware language understanding and
generation capabilities. The concept of morphological computation could inform the design of LLMs
that leverage physical or virtual embodiments to shape their computational processes. Natural
computation is known for its energy efficiency and energy consumption and resource efficiency may be
the decisive factors for the future of AI.
Computationalism, its varieties, its critics and its raison d'être
The current article presents a new approach to cognition, framed in terms of information and
computation within the broader context of computing nature, specifically focusing on morphological
(physical, embodied) computation. It situates Lorenzo Magnani’s Eco-cognitive computationalism
within this wider discourse. Given the persistent critiques against computationalism since its inception,
one might wonder how anyone could venture to build upon the "quicksand" of computationalism—
particularly in its pancomputationalist form.
Computationalism in different forms has been criticized by so many, that it is impossible to address all
those criticisms. Gualtiero Piccinini e.g. provides a systematic critique of limited, unlimited, and ontic
Pancomputationalism (Piccinini, 2017) while the new book by Piccinini and Anderson provides a
critique of Ontic Pancomputationalism (Anderson & Piccinini, 2024). Piccinini advocates his own
mechanistic version of computationalism with the requirement of “robust mapping”. Under this
interpretation not even neurons compute as they do a variety of other life-sustaining tasks which do not
directly contribute to cognitive computing as described in Neural Computation and the Computational
Theory of Cognition by the same author, (Piccinini & Bahar, 2013).
Nir Fresco in Physical Computation and Cognitive Science (Fresco, 2014), and Marcin Miłkowski
(Miłkowski, 2013)(Miłkowski, 2018), navigate carefully avoiding Scylla and Charybdis of
pancomputational grounding, staying with the proposals that always leave space for processes in nature
that are not computational.
Dominic Horsman, Viv Kendon and Susan Stepney propose a concrete schema to explicitly define
conditions under which physical system computes in (Horsman et al., 2017). Similarly, the recent work
done by physicists proposes “a category theory-based framework to redefine physical computing in light
of advancements in quantum computing and non-standard computing systems” (Dehghani & Caterina,
2024) asking what physical systems can be considered computers and what constraints enable physical
systems to compute.
The Church–Turing-Deutsch principle, posits computation as inherently physical, (Deutsch, 1985).
On the other hand, Giuseppe Longo compares (certain applications of) computationalism to scientism
and mysticism, (Longo, 2020). He critiques symbolic, discrete computation but embraces geometry (and
by extension, continuous computation) as crucial for understanding embodied cognition, (Longo, 2024).
Longo suggests that cognition cannot be reduced to symbolic manipulation but instead involves
continuous, analog processes that are central to how humans perceive and act in the world.
There are even authors defending new directions of computationalism, like Matthias Scheutz (Scheutz,
2002) who in an edited collection of essays shows how computationalism evolved from the simplistic
idea that the mind is computable on the symbol manipulating Turing-Machine, to concurrent forms of
embodied computation beyond the abstract Turing Machine model.
One recurrent theme is that the assertion “all of nature continuously computes” is a vacuous statement.
Similar holds for the statement that “all of nature is an informational structure”, a position known as
Informational Structural Realism (ISR).
In the dialogue article (Dodig-Crnkovic & Miłkowski, 2023) I replied to Marcin Miłkowski’s objections
against computing nature / natural computationalism. Likewise, in the earlier dialogue article, Vincent
Muller presented similar objections to pancomputationalism (Dodig-Crnkovic & Müller, 2011). The
main stumbling block is that the assertion: “nature is an info-computational phenomenon for an
observer” evokes fears of a “grey goo” vision where no distinctions can be made in that info-
computational soup. However, I defend the position that natural computationalism is not trivial but a
very productive approach where our present computing machinery is used to leverage discovery
processes in nature organized in variety of levels of abstraction, with the help of a more general idea of
natural computation as envisaged in (Rozenberg et al., 2012) and (Rozenberg & Kari, 2008).
In 2008 Luciano Floridi wrote ´A Defense of Informational Structural Realism´, (Floridi, 2008a) article
defending ISR as a viable and coherent philosophical position that reconciles the strengths of both
Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR) and Ontic Structural Realism (OSR), arguing that the world can be
understood as a totality of informational objects interacting within a structural framework. Info-
computationalism adds to this “pan-informational” structure its “pan-computational” dynamics.
In conclusion, the diversity of interpretations—ranging from mechanistic computationalism to natural
computationalism—demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of this framework. The ongoing dialogue
between critics and proponents shows that computationalism's raison d'être lies in its ability to provide
new perspectives on cognition, nature, and the role of information. While critiques are numerous and
necessary to refine the theory, the continued development of embodied, physical, and natural
computational paradigms ensures that computationalism will remain a productive and evolving area of
inquiry.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Rethinking Cognition: Morphological Info-Computation and the Embodied Paradigm in Life and Artificial Intelligence"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
