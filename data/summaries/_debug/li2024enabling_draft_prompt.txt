Abstract
Building upon prior framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis with the
theory of active inference, this paper aims to further explore the concept of self-
identification and its potential applications. Beginning with two classic paradigms in
psychology, mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion, we suggest that
imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal
free energy. Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification
(sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference
accounts. To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural
network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to
showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery
underlying identification formation. We then introduce Lacan’s Graph II of desire,
unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model
called FreeAgent. In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential
of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial
intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the
Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with
self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism.
Introduction
Identification is the core mechanism in the development of one’s personality and social
identity, expanded by Lacan, differentiating between the Imaginary and Symbolic
orders (Miller, 1988). The imaginary identification is closely linked to the Mirror Phase,
where a child identifies with their reflection in the mirror, forming the ego. In contrast,
symbolic identification is characterized by the internalization of societal norms and
language, which interpellates the individual into specific social roles. These two
identifications collaborate to shape an individual into unconscious subject who
recognizes themselves as an agent with free will. This manuscript delves into the
computational modeling of both imaginary and symbolic identifications, as well as a
comprehensive theory that unites them through the lens of active inference. We
employ deep learning architectures to simulate these models.
Active inference is an emerging theoretical framework in neuroscience to model
behaviors of living systems like neurons, brain, and mind (Parr, Pezzulo, & Friston,
2022). It assumes that each living system maintains an internal model, continuously
generating predictions about the hidden states of the current environment, and testing
these predictions against actual perceptions and behaviors. For an organism to survive,
it must achieve considerable predictability through optimization of its internal model,
which is quantified as minimizing free energy, known as free energy principle. Free
energy F, originally a thermodynamic concept, quantifies the energy available in a
system to alter its properties, and the change of free energy ΔF determines the
direction of spontaneous change of system. In the context of active inference, free
energy is processed as the efforts required to modify its internal model, and the ΔF
determines the possibility of specific belief or behavior, i.e. less F higher possibility.
We previously presented a framework for computational Lacanian psychoanalysis via
active inference, suggesting several fundamental parallels between active inference
and Lacanian theory considering: i. they are both theories on how subjects represent
the world and themselves; ii. the unpresented drives subjects change their beliefs or
behaviors; and iii. The temporal structure of representation is logical time that
intertwines anticipation with retroaction (Li & Li, 2023).
Here, we further enrich this framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis
with self-identification. We firstly introduce imaginary and symbolic identification
and put forward corresponding active inference models. Respective simulations are
implemented through employing a stickman agent with active limbs and a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for vision to simulate the imaginary
identification, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to simulate
the mastery of language. Subsequently, an intelligent agent called FreeAgent based on
the unified theory of two identifications is proposed1 . In concluding remarks, we
discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis in
mental health and artificial intelligence including digital twin mind, large language
models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of achieving human-level
artificial general intelligence with self-awareness.
Mirror Stage and Imaginary Identification
Jacques Lacan invoked the metaphor of the inverted bouquet (Figure 1. A) to explicate
ego formation during the mirror stage. In the optical model, the vase symbolizes the
body, the bouquet signifies instinct and desire, and the spherical mirror represents the
cortex. Gazing from the proper vantage point, the imaginary bouquet appears in the
neck of vase, creating a unified image despite the actual disconnected stems (Miller,
1988). This optical trick mirrors ego development, as the child identifies with this
coherent specular image rather than their fragmented bodily experience. Through this
primordial misrecognition, the ego emerges. The right place of eye in the optical model
denotes the position of subject in the Symbolic order, which will be discussed in the
next section. Due to the subject as an eye, the unity can only be perceived “from outside
in an anticipated manner” (Lacan, 1988). So, there are at least two features in imaginary
identification: anticipated mental mastery of body, and mistaken equating of the
mirror image (an alter-ego) with the ego itself. Before modelling this dynamic via free
energy principle, we shall break it down in a fashion of neuropsychoanalysis.

inverted bouquet model (A) and the symbolic identification via graph of desire (B).
The rubber hand illusion (RHI) has been a widespread paradigm in psychology for
probing ownership and self-recognition. Subjects readily identify a rubber hand
placed before them as their own when they feel synchronized tactile stimuli on it and
their real but obscured hand. Like the mirror stage, the RHI demonstrates the mind's
capacity to create a unified sense of embodiment from discontinuous sensory inputs.
As Matthew and Manos put it, the unexpected feeling (synchronized stimulus)
propagates surprisal to cortex, and the misrecognition occurs through top-down
interpretation to reduce the surprisal (Apps & Tsakiris, 2014). Then they highlighted
the “me” is represented probabilistically – one’s body is a set of components with
minimal free energy. However, this perspective overlooks key developmental aspects,
especially in children who perceive bodily unity despite poor motor control. The fact
on ego is long lasting surprisal from the mismatch between the bounded and integral
body in the mirror and uncontrollable body in reality. In other words, there has been
an ego when it is highly unstable even chaotic.
According to Solms, selfhood and intentionality, two properties of consciousness is
generated only when a self-organizing system monitors its internal states to resist
entropy, and the system must meet three conditions including boundaries separating
system from environment, capabilities of measuring entropy (sensory), and
capabilities to resist entropy (action) (Solms, 2019). Consistently, the boundary of ego
as Lacan holds is image of body, setting the first form allowing subject to distinguished
ego from others and environment (Miller, 1988). Moreover, this image of body is given
to the child as Gestalt from outside, which is “more constituent than constituted”
(Lacan, 2001), highlighting the image of body, boundary of the ego-system, is
precepted and monitored as a whole (i.e., constituent) rather than constructed
collection of parts (constituted).
Lacan’s depiction of the spherical mirror in the scheme as cortex elucidates perception
of the mirrored image as a gestalt. Remarkably, the discovery of mirror neuron system
(MNS) aligns with this principle of mirror stage. Due to the characteristics of MNS that
it fires both during executing and observing, it plays significant roles in social
cognition, perception, motor action, emotion and so on (Bonini, Rotunno, Arcuri, &
Gallese, 2022). Keromnes et al. mentions that MNS contributes to the development of
self-consciousness through identifications and differentiation (Keromnes et al., 2019).
We can further elucidate the detailed mechanism of the MNS as a spherical mirror.
Developed by Gordan Gallup in 1970, mirror self-recognition (MSR) involves exposing
an animal to a mirror, marking it in a visible (only in mirror) but unfelt way, and then
observing whether the animal recognizes the mark on itself, as test of self-
consciousness (Gallup, 1970). Many species are proved to pass MSR test, ranging from
non-human primates to cleaner fish and even mice, which suggests the capability of
representing the reflected body as self is not unique in human (Chang, Zhang, Poo, &
Gong, 2017; Kohda et al., 2022; Yokose, Marks, & Kitamura, 2023). As suggested by
Keromnes et al., recognition of the others takes place before that of self in infants, in
other words, the neural representation of other’s body occurs earlier (Keromnes et al.,
2019). Although not scientifically rigorous enough, the logic behind the MSR is aligned
with MNS: the mirrored self is represented exactly in the way of representing others.
Because the object recognition is unified, the same way will the children represent
themselves facing to the image in mirror – unity as result. More importantly, the way
of self-representation directly determines the overall dialectic of relationship between
children and others, called imaginary intersubjectivity that reveals a clear duality. For
example, children say they are struck when they hit others in fact, and cry when they
see others falling(Lacan, 2001), confirming the MNS logic behind imaginary
identification again.
What follows and indeed distinguishes human from other species is (primary)
narcissism, a typical characteristic of imaginary identification. Lacking minimum
motor functions to survive, premature birth is the vital feature of human, and for a
long time, swaddled infants depend on the care of parents completely. In the mirror
stage, children begin to explore the relation between movements “assumed in the
image” and the reflected reality including their “own body, and the persons and things
around him” (Lacan, 2001). This exploration yields intellectual satisfaction, thus has a
salutary value, when their functions are far from completed (Miller, 1988). Aligning
with Solms’ theory on consciousness, consciousness is defined as affective in essential,
and the increased certainty produces pleasure because the predictable conditions are
“good” upon the biological ethic (Solms, 2019). We here find the structure of primary
narcissism: the premature infant initially grasps some certainty through the match
between intentional movements and corresponding performances in mirrored reality,
that is, the primary narcissism is RHI-like. In this sense, free energy principle parallels
pleasure principle of Freud, interpreted by Lacan as a tendency to “lower the excitation
to a minimum” (Lacan, 1988). The ultimate goal of primary narcissism is thus total
certainty along the pleasure principle which goes against the reality, and this “original,
irreducible, and constituent discord” will force a transformation into reality principle
later via various traumatic cuts (Žižek, 2013).
Before diving into that transformation, we shall firstly simulate the dynamics of
imaginary identification. Reflecting the whole story, what comes first is the neural
representing capability of other’s body via visual observations of infant, then the
model represents his own body as a unified image, setting the boundaries of “self”.
Then the Gestalt body begins to explore itself by testing the relation between intentions
and performances, and the optimization (decreased surprisal) is felt as pleasure.
Therefore, the simulation consists of two parts mainly including visual representation
and sensorimotor integration. A minimalist ‘body’ is modelled, a stickman consisting
of head and four movable limbs. The visual domain comprises 1000 generated
stickmen as observational stimuli to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) is to
recognize the limbs configurations. For the motor domain, intentions are target limb
angles, executed with variance resembling poor infant control. This variance gradually
reduces over time to simulate the development of motor skills. The executed
movements are precepted ‘from outside’ using the CNN model. This sensorimotor
loop is iterated over 1000 time-steps with each step adjusting the certainty based on
the variational free energy, and the increased certainty is felt as ‘pleasure’.
As displayed in Figure 2.A, the CNN model satisfyingly recognizes the angles of each
limb of stickman in test dataset. In Figure 2.B & C are plots representing the trajectory
of pleasure and the course of free energy, respectively, both decreasing over time. At
the beginning, we observe a high level of free energy which indicates a significant
mismatch between the intentions and executions. But so is the level of fluctuation in
pleasure. This is because, at this time, the certainty about the world is low, yet the
stickman finds certainty in the physical movements and intentions during its play,
where even a small amount of certainty can bring significant joy. Meanwhile, these
intense fluctuations are also in line with psychoanalytic assertions about the mental
world of pre-linguistic stage children. As the simulation progressed, both measures
converge towards a state of equilibrium due to the increasing motor skills. This
signifies the formation of a stable ego, from the perspective of active inference, the ego
is a body that stably maintains the minimized free energy.

However, the ego and imaginary identification simulated here is a sense of agent at
best, still far beyond a sense of ‘I’ due to the eye in the scheme neglected previously.
The eye - the position of subject, as Lacan says – is related to the Symbolic order.
Although we tend to discuss the Imaginary order priorly, the Symbolic order
influences one’s life earlier, even earlier than birth because infant has been given a
name and lots of expectations by his parents. Only rolling into the Symbolic order, the
infant could attribute the image in mirror to a Jackie, a Magie, or an “I”. In the next
section, we are going to introduce the child into symbolic identification.
Ideology and Symbolic Identification
In contrast to the mirroring and unity logic of imaginary identification, the symbolic
identification is based on difference and uniqueness. There are three juxtaposed
dimensions in the Symbolic order: the sociological / anthropological, the linguistic, and
the psychoanalytic. At the sociological level, the Symbolic order consists of laws,
norms, cultures – namely the Other (with capital O). Undoubtedly, the society exists
prior to and dominates the constitution of the subject, and the subject has to acquire
its identity by identifying with the social norms and internalizing it, a process called
‘interpellation’. As Althusser’s example illustrates, a person heard a police officer
shouting “Hey, you there!”, then he turned around and recognized himself in the hails.
Various institutions including families, schools, and media play a key part in
interpellation, by disseminating ideology, which are named as ideological state
apparatuses (ISAs) (Althusser, 2006). What is closely related to our work, Althusser
also argues that children internalize ruling ideology through years of schooling
besides learning skills for production. Despite subsequent divergences, the concept
interpellation has been adopted and developed by Zizek and other researchers in the
field of Lacanian theory (Mandelbaum, 2023). In the context of neuroscience, a similar
process can be found in the functional differentiation of neurons that infer their
functional roles based on external inputs (Ramstead et al., 2021). Additionally, this
internalization of the Other (or ideology) not only implants the fundamental alterity
within the subject, causing the subject to be thoroughly alienated, but also interpellates
the subject to be (self-perceived as) a free agent (Mandelbaum, 2023).
Among Lacan’s four graphs of desire, the Graph I, ‘elementary cell of desire’ (Figure
1. B), encapsulates the formation of the symbolic identification in the simplest form.
As Zizek elucidates, the elementary cell illustrates the logic of the Other --
interpellation of individuals into subjects (Zizek, 2019). To be more specific, the Other,
as ‘treasures of signifier’ interprets the intention of individual (denoted as Δ)
retrospectively (from S2 to S1), rendering them a (barred) subject. This bar indicates
that the subject is actually unconsciously shaped by the Other, essentially being a
divided subject, which is why Lacan says that 'the unconscious is structured like a
language’. Take baby’s crying as example, the crying for demand of love is interpreted
by the mother -- first subject occupying the position of the Other for child, thus
denoted as mOther—as need for food, in the form of speaking “you want food?”.
Obviously, the demand of love can never be satisfied because the mother cannot
provide unconditional love but only contingent things like drink, food, or toys, not to
mention that the mother is not even present sometimes. This long-lasting frustration
promotes the child to identify the mOther – the first moment of Oedipus complex.
Then the attempt to become the desire of mother is deprived by father, which forces
the child turns to identify with father, and goes through the Oedipus complex (Lacan,
2011). Critically, the resolution of Oedipus complex represents an adoption of society
norms and formation of Symbolic identification.
In the previous work, we proposed an active inference account of Graph I (Li & Li,
2023). And we can further interpret the psychoanalytic dimension of Symbolic
identification utilizing active inference and free energy principle. The initial generative
model is as immature as the child’s physic body, causing high level of free energy. To
minimize the free energy, the infant has to optimize its generative model through
learning. Meanwhile, since the mother is also an active inference agent, this leads to a
synchronization between the infant's generative model and that of the mother. If it
weren't for the presence of the father, this synchronization would have been sufficient
to minimize free energy. Therefore, the child's generative model, by identifying with
the father, accepts the existence of a rival, thereby freeing itself from the innate
aggressivity of imaginary identification.
The Symbolic identification is meditated by language, which leads current topic to
linguistic dimension. From linguistic perspective, the development of Symbolic
identification can be viewed as the mastery of language. The earliest moment
representing the entry into the Symbolic order is described with the Fort/Da game. By
tossing the object away and then retrieving it while vocalizing “Fort!” and “Da!”, the
child symbolically controls the comings and goings of the mother. The anxiety
associated with aforesaid frustration is alleviated through the predictable
correspondence between the environment and these two syllables, and thus Lacan
interprets this game as “subjectivity brings together mastery of its dereliction and the
birth of the symbol”, and the moment in which “the child is born into language”
(Lacan, 2001). Only after entering the symbolic order can the mechanism of Graph I
can render the child as a subject proper: desires are mediated into signifiers via the
internalized Other's interpretation, enabling symbolic interaction with the world.
Considering the active inference accounts for such linguistic interactions,
communication is modelled as the process of generalized synchronization between
general models of individuals, and agents have to predict the generative model of
others under shared narrative or dynamic to ensure an effective communication (Karl
J. Friston & Frith, 2015). Parallels can be found between the psychoanalytic ‘the Other’
and collective dynamics (or ‘shared narrative’) in the field of active inference,
providing inspirations for modelling the Other computationally.
An integrated active inference model of Symbolic identification emerges from
surveying the sociological, linguistic, and psychoanalytic dimensions and connecting
them to the free energy principle. The Symbolic identification begins with the
requirements for eliminating free energy caused by the mismatch between demand of
unconditional love and constraints of reality. By synchronizing with interpretations of
mOther, the subject acquires the linguistic representation of objects, and thus enters
language world. Over ensuing decades of interpellations by ISAs, the subject
continuously infers his social position based on preferences, priors, and responses, and
finally identifies the position with minimal free energy. This developed identification
results from the cooperations of Imaginary and Symbolic order, which thus will be
discussed in the next section, and following simulation focuses on the first part –
entering language world.
As Figure 2. D illustrates, we implement the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT of
OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo) to play the mOther, interpreting meaningless cries as specific
needs. The generative model of infant is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), mapping
abstract intentions to vocalizations. So, our focus is not on general communication, but
rather on the process of gradually mastering language, in other words, entering the
Symbolic order, which is not only an issue of language, but always related to the
demand and intention in real world. Two free energy items arise: the first item
(denoted as FE1) is calculated based on outputs of MLP and ChatGPT, and the second
(FE2) is calculated based on input of MLP and feedback of ChatGPT, presenting the
differences of the individual's intention and feedback of environment. Obviously, the
basic objection of subject is to get what the individual want, i.e. the minimal FE2. To
minimize FE2, the individual must optimize the MLP to precisely express what he
wants, i.e. the minimal FE1, which induces the mastery of language. The Figure 2. E
shows reductions of two free energy items along with optimization of MLP, intuitively
depicting our model.
Towards an integrated theory of self-identification
In the first optical model of imaginary identification (Figure 1.A), the eye is symbolic
of subject, which is fundamentally situated in the Symbolic order. Incorporating
symbolic identification, Lacan then introduced the second optical model for an
integrated theory on self-identification (Figure 3.A) (Lacan, 1988). The left side of the
illustration is described earlier, albeit with the positions of the bouquet and vase
swapped; the middle of the illustration shows a plane mirror, interpreted by Lacan as
the position of the Other; the right side of the illustration represents the virtual image
in the virtual space of the plane mirror. In front of the concave mirror is the barred
subject, indicating an unconscious subject. To summarize, the imaginary identification
provides the expected form to be identified in the Symbolic order retrospectively.
The second graph of desire (Graph II, Figure 3. B) further elaborates the mechanisms
of interaction between two self-identifications in a more complicated way. Taking a
first glance at this illustration, it depicts how the barred subject (starting point) attains
an ideal self or symbolic identification (ending point, I(O)), and the vector from i(o) to
ego denotes imaginary identification. Key insights revealed by this graph include:
➢ symbolic identification is identifying with s(O), signification provided by the
Other interpreting the demands of unconscious subject (red route);
➢ there exists a short circuit of identification (the green vector), which means the
constitution of ideal self is intervened by imaginary relationships;
➢ the object of imaginary identification (i(o)) is ‘certain gaze in the Other’, depicted
with the blue route (Zizek, 2019). For example, the punk group identifies with the
signifier of piercing because of the pursue of rebellion;
➢ the yellow circuit, as Lacan says, emphasizes that the ego is “only completed by
being articulated not as the I of discourse, but as a metonymy of its
signification”(Lacan, 2001). To be more specific, the imaginary identification must
submit to the Symbolic order as mentioned in the point 3. On the other hand, since
that the ego is self-recognized as agent narcissistically, acceptance of signification
s(O) is disguised as active seeking in the imaginary level, driving ceaseless
running of this circuit from one significance to another, which is called metonymy
linguistically (Eidelsztein, 2018).

Compositions of FreeAgent and the environment of simulation. D. Excerpts of initial
identification and further metonymic operating.
Through the mechanism that Graph II reveals, the subject is ‘interpellated as free agent’
in society, and hence the aim here is to further design an illuminating intelligent agent
(named as FreeAgent) that computationally instantiates the coherent theory of self-
identification depicted in the Graph II. The previous sections have respectively
explored the imaginary and symbolic identifications along with their computational
models. We employ a stickman with four active limbs and one CNN acting as the
visual capability to simulate the imaginary identification, and a MLP supervised by
ChatGPT to simulate the mastery of language, where the ChatGPT play the role of
mOther. Integrating these components, the FreeAgent comprises a stickman body,
CNN, MLP, and ChatGPT as internalized Other (Figure 3. C).
Initially, we generate 10 characters with distinct identities using ChatGPT-4 and then
assign different images for them, simply represented as the angles of limbs. Firstly,
FreeAgent perceives others’ images and symbolic identities learns the links between
the two modeled with an MLP, and then takes one image as the object he identifies,
which is in an expected and imaginary way, that is, the other’s image turn into his
intentions. Then the image-intention is transformed by the MLP as identity-intention,
which is further interpreted by the Other firstly (the red route in Graph II) to form his
own symbolic identification. At the same time the image-intention plays the role of i(o),
contributing to the ego (green vector) and engaging into the metonymy which
continuously adds new components on the self-identification (yellow circuit and blue
route). Part of results is excerpted in Figure 3. D which shows the imaginary
identification and further metonymic operating of symbolic identification.
This designation echoes the distinct logics of imaginary (mirror and unity) and
symbolic (difference and uniqueness) identifications. Additionally, although the object
of identification in this enlightening simulation is chosen arbitrarily to limit the
complexity, the process is related to planning and decision-making in fact, and thus
can be formulated in the context of active inference with expected free energy and
intentional behavior (Karl J Friston et al., 2023). When agent facing multiple choices,
expected free energy quantifies which choice minimizes free energy in the future,
replicating the mechanism of Lacanian logical time, as described that ‘the past
anticipates a future within which it can retroactively find a place’ (Hook, Neill, &
Vanheule, 2022). Intentional behavior further defines the decision making based on
specific intention or goal, named as inductive planning. In Graph II, the temporal
structure of self-identification between barred subject and ideal self (I(O)), ‘a
retroversion effect by which the subject becomes at each stage what he was before and
announces himself – he will have been – only in the future perfect tense (Lacan, 2001)’,
is exactly aligned with active inference, including two facets: (i) the current self-
identification is the posterior belief about subject with minimal variational free energy,
and (ii) the preferred state of self-identification is the one that would minimize
variational free energy in the future, i.e., minimal expected free energy. Therefore, a
more realistic and autonomous designation of FreeAgent should consider these
different free energy terms simultaneously.
Concluding remarks
In this interdisciplinary work, we propose a novel approach to understanding self-
identification bridging Lacanian psychoanalysis, active inference, and artificial
intelligence (AI). Firstly, we elucidate the free energy principle within Lacanian
identification theory, enriching current framework of computational Lacanian
psychoanalysis. Under this framework, we suggest that the Graph II of desire provides
core mechanism for autonomous intelligent agents with active inference furnishing
more refined models. In the future, such agents could be applied in the field of mental
health via enabling digital twin minds of patients to predict risks of mental disorders.
Unlike bottom-up methods of digital twin brain that simulates physiological activities
of brain like neurons spikes and circuits, digital twin mind aims to mirror the psychic
phenomena guided top-down by psychological theories. For example, the
mathematical model of general escape theory of suicide could reproduce suicide
ideations in time series data, and hence is considered to promote prediction and
prevention of suicidal risks in the future (Wang, Robinaugh, Millner, Fortgang, &
Nock), but this mathematical model defined by a set of differential equations cannot
fully involve enough factors influencing thoughts and decisions due to outrageous
complexity of human mind. However, as revealed in this paper, deep learning models
with massive parameters stand for powerful solution to digital twin mind that
comprehensively emulates real-world lived experience.
Additionally, this paper demonstrates computational Lacanian psychoanalysis’s
potential to interpret and advance AI. We employ the ChatGPT as an avatar of the
Other throughout this work, which reveals a novel perspective on the role of LLMs, a
topic that sparks heated discussion as LLMs gaining increasing public visibility. LLMs
are trained on huge amount of data from Wikipedia, books, journals, reddit links,
common crawl and other accessible resources (Thompson, 2023), i.e., they represent
the collective dynamics within the Symbolic order (Buttrick, 2024). On the other hand,
due to their distinguished capabilities in understanding and generating language,
reasoning, creativity, knowledge modeling, and planning (Wu et al., 2023), LLMs are
more likely to be unconsciously anthropomorphized by users (Bao, Zeng, & Lu, 2023).
Therefore, when lots of users nowadays engage with these models to seek information,
guidance, or validation, LLMs interprets their queries into specific significations
through responses, occupying the position of the Other. Psychoanalytically, what
happens in the process is exactly identification between human and AI models (Possati,
2020).
Another intriguing issue involved in this paper and field of AI is artificial general
intelligence (AGI). To be more specific, by computationally instantiating Lacanian
identification dynamics, this work provides conceptual foundations and a potential
framework for constructing artificial agents with robust self-models and first-person
perspectives, which are significant components of human-level AGI (Goertzel, 2014).
Just as Foucault suggests that ‘man is an invention of recent date’, which means that
the modern concept of man as self-aware subject is actually social and linguistic
construct (Han ‐ Pile, 2010), contextualizing AGI development within a post-
structuralist frame enables the engineering of machine self-awareness.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Enabling self-identification in intelligent agent: insights from computational psychoanalysis"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
