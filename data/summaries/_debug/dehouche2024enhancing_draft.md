### OverviewThis paper investigates enhancing population-based search algorithms with Active Inference. The authors state: "The Active Inference framework models perception and action as a unified process, where agents use probabilistic models to predict and actively minimize sensory discrepancies." They note: "In complement and contrast, traditional population-based metaheuristics rely on reactive environmental interactions without anticipatory adaptation." The paper argues: “This approach presents a compelling approach for understanding perception and action across systems and scales.” According to the research, “Active Inference has been applied across several application domains.” The study demonstrates that Active Inference can yield some improved solutions with only a marginal increase in computational cost.### MethodologyThe authors describe the core philosophy behind population-based metaheuristics (PBMH) search, stating: “The core philosophy behind PBMH search is the collaborative and competitive interplay among a population of agents.” They note: “Operationally, a PBMH involves a series of procedures that can adaptive balance the exploration of new solutions, with the exploitation of known good solutions.” The authors outline the key components of this collective process: social-cooperation, self-adaptation, and competition. They state: “Social-cooperation represents the collaborative effect among individual agents in the population, enabling them to exchange information and learn from each other.” They note: “Self-adaptation involves each individual adjusting itself independently based on its own experience and surroundings.” The authors further explain: “Competition deals with the selection and updating of the population for the next iteration.” The authors detail the algorithm’s implementation, stating: “This approach presents a compelling approach for understanding perception and action across systems and scales.” The authors describe the core philosophy behind population-based metaheuristics (PBMH) search, stating: “The core philosophy behind PBMH search is the collaborative and competitive interplay among a population of agents.” The authors outline the key components of this collective process: social-cooperation, self-adaptation, and competition.
