Abstract
In this commentary, we respond to a technical analysis of the Free Energy Principle
(hereafter: FEP) presented in "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Prin-
ciple" by Aguilera et al. In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely
coupled stochastic differential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities
are claimed—in previous FEP literature—to have a Markov blanket. The authors
demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse
coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling
andMarkovblanketsinthecaseofGaussiansteady-statedensities. Wepreciselyderive
conditions under which causal coupling leads—or does not lead—to Markov blankets.
Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differen-
tial equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to
have Markov blankets. Future work should focus on verifying whether these sorts of
constraints are satisfied in realistic models of sparsely coupled systems.

entail conditional independence between states (i.e. Markov blankets [2]) in the steady state
distribution. The authors used these considerations to explore the limits and applicability
of the Free Energy Principle (hereafter: FEP) in linear stochastic sytems. Previous FEP
literature has intimated that sparse coupling structures (absent causal coupling between two
subsets of states) lead to the emergence of Markov blankets [3]. Further developments ex-
panded on this statement to require additional sparsity constraints on the functional form
of the flow [4, 5].
The authors analyzed the ‘canonical loop’ that is claimed to generically give rise to
Markov blankets in [3]. The authors show that in general Markov blankets are not guaran-
teed, and that ‘such a cyclic structure can generate couplings that propagate beyond causal
interactions’. Although the exact relationship between sparse coupling and conditional inde-
pendence was not rigorously defined in [3], subsequent work has constrained the implication
of sparse coupling to conditional independence by invoking particular restrictions on the
nature of the solenoidal coupling that connects different variables to one another [4–6]. The
current commentary in many ways serves as a supplementary set of derivations that expands
upon and explains mathematical relationships that have previously been shown.
Inthiscommentarywepreciselyderivetheconditionsunderwhichcausalcouplingleads—
or does not lead—to conditional independence. Importantly, our derivations hold for both
the linear case (the same class of systems investigated by the target article) as well as in the
general, nonlinear case [4, 7]. We show how conditional independence (Markov blankets) and
causal coupling have a well-defined relationship that depends on the form of the solenoidal
flow operator, which underlies the breaking of detailed balance [2, 8, 9].
We show that the relationship between sparse coupling and conditional independence is
particularly strengthened when one assumes the state-dependence of the solenoidal flow (a
crucial feature underlying stochastic chaos and itinerancy in random dynamical systems [2,
4]) has a ‘locality’ constraint, whereby the coupling between any two pairs of states does not
depend on other states besides the two that are interacting. This mathematical result may
shed light on the sorts of systems we expect Markov blankets to emerge from sparse coupling.
The ‘locality-of-coupling’ constraint may particularly apply to the case of spatially-localized
interactions (e.g. neighbouring particles or individuals interacting in a collective). The
simple geometry of spatially-distributed systems characterized by short-range interactions
may tend to enforce the locality conditions of solenoidal state-dependence and thus generally
ensure that sparse coupling gives rise to Markov blankets. Future work, building along the
lines of [4], should focus on verifying whether these sorts of locality constraints on solenoidal
dependence are satisfied in realistic models of locally-interacting systems.
2 Sparse coupling in stochastic systems
Most treatments of the FEP [3, 5, 7, 10] start by considering the evolution of a system
defined over some state-space x, whose trajectories can be described using a Langevin-style
2
(Itô) stochastic differential equation:
x˙ = f(x )+ω (1)
t t
where x˙ represents a partial temporal derivative and ω is additive Wiener noise.
We assume that the solution admits a (non-equilibrium) steady-state density p, i.e., a
solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation [11]
0 = ∇·(Γ∇p(x)−f(x)p(x)), (2)
whereΓ = E[ωω(cid:62)]/2isthediffusiontensor, expressingthecovarianceofrandomfluctuations.
Thus, we can express the flow f of the stochastic differential equation as a sum of dissipative
(curl-free) and conservative (divergence-free) terms, using a Helmholtz decomposition [2,
Appendix B]1:
f(x) = Γ(x)∇logp(x)+∇·Γ(x)−Q(x)∇logp(x)−∇·Q(x) (3)
(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)
dissipative conservative
Here and throughout, ∇ · Q denotes the divergence of the matrix field defined as (∇ ·
Q) = (cid:80) ∂ Q .2 In the FEP literature, we often re-write the flow decomposition of f(x)
i j ∂xj ij
succinctly using the gradients of the negative log stationary density or surprisal I(x) =
−logp(x):
f(x) = Ω(x)∇I(x)−Λ(x)
where Ω(x) (cid:44) Q(x)−Γ(x), Λ(x) (cid:44) ∇·Ω(x). (4)
To ease notation, we will omit writing the dependency on x of Q and Ω in subse-
quent derivations, noting that this does not imply they are assumed to be constant, state-
independent functions. However, we will assume constant, diagonal Γ throughout. Imposing
a constant, diagonal Γ is the equivalent of forcing random fluctuations ω perturbing the
system to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
Using this expression for the flow, we can then write the Jacobian of the system J where
J = ∂fu as follows:
uv ∂xv
J = ΩH+∇Ω∇I−∇Λ. (5)
The Hessian H is a matrix whose entries encode the double partial derivatives (or ‘cur-
vature’) of the surprisal, with respect to the states: H =
∂2I(x)
. In the case of a Gaussian

steady-state (i.e., a quadratic surprisal, where I(x) is a second-order polynomial), then a
zero-entry in H implies conditional independence and vice-versa [2, 4]:

⇔ I(x ,x |b) = I(x |b)+I(x |b)
u v u v
⇔ (x ⊥ x )|b : b = x (6)
u v u˜,v˜
where the tilde notation u˜ denotes the complement of a set of states u. We can then use
the matrix form of the Jacobian (5) to determine how the flow of one variable x depends
u
on the state of another x :

When we assume a particular partition of the state-space x into internal, active, sensory,
and external states, respectively x = (µ,a,s,η), and further defining autonomous α =
(µ,a) and non-autonomous states β = (s,η) = α˜, we can then investigate the conditions
under which sparse coupling is sufficient for conditional independence between variables, i.e.,
Markov blankets in the stationary density p.
One sort of coupling structure that can be related to conditional independence (under
extra constraints on the flow operator), is the so-called ‘canonical loop’ described in the
targetarticle[1,Figure4A],whichwasintroducedinearlierliterature[3,4,6]. Thisstructure
assumes that sensory paths do not depend on internal paths, and active paths do not depend
on external paths [7]. This is best expressed in terms of the Jacobian:
 
J J J
ηη ηs ηa
J =   J sη J ss J sa   (8)
 J as J aa J aµ
J J J
µs µa µµ
Given this sparse coupling structure and our expression for the Jacobian in terms of the
Hessian in Equations (5) and (7), one can then ask: what kinds of constraints must be in
place on the flow operator Ω in order for sparse coupling to imply conditional independence?
By setting the left-hand side of Equation (7) to 0, we can determine the conditions under
which an absence of coupling from state v to state u, implies a corresponding 0 in the entry
of the Hessian H .

⇐⇒ H = −(Q +Γ )−1 H Q (12)

Thus, we can completely characterise conditional independence under the absence of
couplings in both directions:

i∈η˜

Assuming J = 0 : H = 0 ⇐⇒ H Q = 0
µη ηµ ηi iµ

These expressions simplify when we assume the so-called ‘normal’ or ‘canonical’ form
of the flow [4–7], in which the Jacobian is sparse because solenoidal couplings between
autonomous (α = (µ,a)) and non-autonomous (β = (η,s)) states are assumed to be absent:

Assuming the canonical form of the flow (14), certain terms in (13) vanish and the
conditional independence condition is simplified

For example, if we assume absent off-diagonal solenoidal flow, then Markov blankets are
guaranteed from sparse coupling.
An open question, which the authors of the target article touched on in their analytic
expressions for the drift matrices (or Jacobians) of linear systems, is whether linear systems
that satisfy conditional independence under sparse coupling are ‘rare’ or not. The classifica-
tion of a particular linear system as ‘rare’ depends on an underlying assumption about the
distribution of (sparse) drift matrices from which we expect such diffusions to be generated.
In particular, if we assume that both statistical and solenoidal coupling in real systems is
local, then both Q and H will become sparser as dimension increases, and the entries of
the inner products in (15) will vanish with high probability. This can be easily shown by
observing that the probability of sparse vectors being orthogonal (their inner-product van-
ishing) asymptotically approaches 1.0 as dimension increases. Whether it is fair to assume
locality (and thus sparsity) in the Q and H operators, depends on prior assumptions about
the nature of solenoidal coupling and covariance relationships that characterize real systems
with Gaussian steady state [15, 16]. For example, we may expect solenoidal operators Q to
be sparse for complex systems defined by localized (and thus sparse) interactions across a
network of spatially-segregated components.
In the more general non-linear case where ∇ Ω(x) (cid:54)= 0, additional terms (corresponding
x
to the summands of the correction term Λ(x)) appear in (10) and propagate into (13) and
(15).
The sparse coupling conjecture
We now examine the conditions under which one can impute conditional independence from
not only absent coupling J = J = 0, but also from unidirectional or non-reciprocal
uv vu
coupling, i.e., J = 0,J (cid:54)= 0. The so-called sparse coupling conjecture [4, 7] conjectures
uv vu
the following implication in a generic class of systems:
J J = 0 =⇒ H = H = 0. (16)
uv vu uv uv
Expanding the case of J (cid:54)= 0,J = 0 from (14), we can see why this implies conditional
ηa aη
independence between η and a. If assume there is a Markov blanket between internal and
external states (i.e. the constraints in (15) hold) then we can simplify the expressions for
the coupling between η and a:

i∈a˜

aa a aη
The only way for J to vanish while H(cid:62) = H is non-zero, is for Q H(cid:62) = Γ H(cid:62),
aη aη ηa aa aη a aη
which cannot hold because these terms are by definition orthogonal to another and can only
6
be equal if they both vanish, which is impossible due to the the positive-definiteness of Γ
a
and H. Therefore H(cid:62) = H = 0 and the sparse coupling conjecture is verified for the
aη ηa
normal form laid out in Equation (14). Similar reasoning can be used to expand the entries
for J and J to re-write the normal form with a fully-sparse Hessian and Jacobian:
sµ µs

Now, for generality, we refine these conditions for the fully nonlinear case, assuming for
simplicity that the only component of the flow operator that is state-dependent is Q (Γ is
state-independent and diagonal, as before):

We can now derive explicit conditions on the nature of the solenoidal flow’s state depen-
dence that guarantee, barring edge cases, an implication of conditional independence from
sparse coupling. We once again assume a Markov blanket between η and µ, i.e. the nonlinear
equivalent of (15) is satisfied.
Taking coupling between internal and sensory states as an example, the sparse coupling
in Equation (20) assumes J = 0. We can expand its expression in the Jacobian, now
sµ
including the gradients and curvatures of the solenoidal flow:
J = (Q −Γ )H +∇ Q ·∇ I(x)+∇ Q ·∇ I(x)−∇2 Q −∇2 Q . (22)
sµ ss ss sµ µ sη η µ ss s sµ ss ηµ ηs
The final two terms ∇2 Q and ∇2 Q vanish under the assumption that the solenoidal
sµ ss ηµ sη
flow depends at most linearly on ‘non-local’ terms.3 If we restrict this flow further, such
3By ‘non-local’ dependence we mean if the solenoidal coupling Q between two states u and v depends

that Q only depends on s and η, then all the partial derivatives of the solenoidal flow with
sη
respect to other states (here, µ) vanish, meaning the expression for the Jacobian reduces to:
J = (Q −Γ )H . (23)
sµ ss ss sµ
Therefore J will be 0 if and only if s and µ are conditionally independent, i.e., H = 0.
sµ sµ
If we however allow the solenoidal flow to have ‘non-local’ state-dependence, then the
presence of the remaining partial derivatives in (22) could render the normal form a counter-
example to the sparse coupling conjecture, unless the extra terms all cancel. This means
that even in the case of conditional independence between s and µ, the coupling between s
and µ could be non-zero, if the solenoidal flow depends on more states than only those that
it ‘connects.’ This has interesting implications for the constraints we might expect in natural
systems, where the interactions mediated by solenoidal flow should be ‘locally-dependent’
(only depend on the states that are interacting) if Markov blankets are to be implied by
sparse coupling. This may be a natural tendency in the case of spatially-extensive systems
(e.g. cells, neurons, collectives of individuals) where localized interactions may be expected
to only depend on states that are participating in the interaction.
Assuming edge-cases are not satisfied, we can now re-write Equation (20) with the flow
respecting the assumption of local state-dependence, and the Hessian expressing more strin-
gent conditional independence relationships:

where the state-dependent flow operator Ω = Q−Γ, as before, lacks coupling between
autonomous and non-autonomous states as in Equation (20).
3 Concluding remarks
We hope the derivations provided here in addition to those in the target article contribute to
animprovedunderstandingoftherelationshipbetweendynamicalandstatisticaldependence
in Langevin equations with a steady-state.
Our derivations suggest that the lack of coupling between two states only implies con-
ditional independence in certain cases, as specified in Equation (15). In that sense, we find
general agreement with the target article that in general, causal coupling does not have a
straightforward relationship to conditional independence or the presence of Markov blankets.
8
However, we note that in the limit of increasing dimensionality and sparse Q and H, then
Markov blankets are likely to be implied by sparse coupling, specifically because the inner
products in (13) are expected to vanish, by virtue of being equivalent to the dot products
(or sums thereof) of sparse vectors. We also show (in agreement with statements made in [4,
7]) that even unidirectional coupling can imply conditional independence, but further con-
straints on the flow operator and the nature of its state-dependence are required in order for
this to hold true. Interestingly, the functional form of the state-dependence of the solenoidal
flow, that is required in order to sustain conditional independence from sparse coupling, may
agree with the sorts of ‘locality constraints’ we would expect in natural systems, where any
nonlinear coupling between interacting states should only depend on the states participating
in the interaction. This result may provide a formal basis for the ‘local’ nature of interactions
in spatially-extended, self-organizing systems, whose state-space can often be decomposed
into causally-coupled sub-systems.
We conclude by celebrating the words of the authors of the target article, on how these
sorts of investigations offer an opportunity to study in detail "the connection between non-
trivial dynamics and the statistical properties of coupled systems" [1].

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Sparse coupling and Markov blankets: A comment on "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz and Buckley"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
