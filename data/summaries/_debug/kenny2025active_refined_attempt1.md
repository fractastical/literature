This paper presents a first principles approach to active inference, specifically tailored for discrete state spaces, leveraging the principles of variational inference and the Free Energy Principle. We aim to provide a robust and computationally tractable approach to active inference, addressing the limitations of traditional methods which often rely on simplifying assumptions.**1. Introduction and Motivation**The Free Energy Principle (FEP) [1], as articulated by Friston [1], posits that all biological systems, including the brain, operate by minimizing a free energy functional. This functional, often interpreted as the free energy in thermodynamics, represents a trade-off between minimizing prediction error and minimizing the energy associated with uncertainty.In the context of active inference, the free energy functional represents the agent’s subjective experience of the world.Active inference, as originally conceived by Dayan and colleagues [2], provides a framework for agents to make decisions in complex environments where the state of the world is fundamentally uncertain. The core idea is that agents actively shape their internal models of the world to minimize prediction error. This approach is particularly well-suited to discrete state spaces, where the state space can be represented as a set of distinct states, each with a probability distribution.This paper builds upon these ideas, presenting a first principles approach to active inference specifically designed for discrete state spaces. We aim to provide a robust and computationally tractable approach to active inference, addressing the limitations of traditional methods which often rely on simplifying assumptions.**2. The Core Principles**Our approach is built upon several key principles:***Discrete State Space:** We assume that the state of the environment can be represented as a discrete set of states. This allows for the use of Markov models and other discrete state space models.***Bayesian Inference:** We use Bayesian inference to update our beliefs about the state of the world.***Variational Inference:** We use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the state of the world.***Free Energy Principle:** We minimize the free energy functional, which represents the trade-off between minimizing prediction error and minimizing the energy associated with uncertainty.**3. The Free Energy Functional**The free energy functional, denoted as F(q) [1], is a central concept in active inference. It is defined as:F(q) = E[lnp(x|q)] - E[H(q)]where:*E[lnp(x|q)] is the expected log-likelihood of the observation x given the posterior distribution q(x) over the state of the world.*H(q) is the entropy of the posterior distribution q(x) over the state of the world.The first term, E[lnp(x|q)], represents the agent’s error in predicting the next observation. The second term, H[q(x)], represents the agent’s uncertainty about the state of the world. Minimizing this free energy functional allows the agent to effectively shape its internal model of the world.**4.Mathematical Formulation**Let x(t) be the state of the world at time t, and let q(x(t)) be the posterior distribution over the state at time t.We can express the free energy functional as:F(q) = E[lnp(x | q)] - E[H(q)]where:*E[lnp(x |q)] is the expected log-likelihood of the observation x at time t given the posterior distribution q(x) at time t.*H[q(x)] is the entropy of the posterior distribution q(x) at time t.**5.Implementation Details**The implementation of active inference involves several steps:1.**Define the State Space:**First, we must define the state space, which is the set of all possible states that the system can be in.2.**Define the Transition Probabilities:** Next, we must define the transition probabilities between states. These probabilities represent the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another.3.**Define the Observation Model:** Finally, we must define the observation model, which specifies the probability of observing a particular observation given the state of the world.**6.Computational Challenges**The computational challenges of active inference stem from the fact that the posterior distribution over the state of the world is often intractable.This means that we cannot explicitly calculate the posterior distribution.To overcome this challenge, we use variational inference.**7.Variational Inference**Variational inference is a technique for approximating intractable probability distributions. In the context of active inference, we use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the state of the world.We choose a family of distributions, q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q(x) q
