Okay, here’is a revised summary of the paper, addressing all of the points above.**Is the free-energy principle a formal theory of semantics? From variational density dynamics to neural and phenotypic representations**The free-energy principle (FEP) offers a radical new framework for understanding cognition and consciousness, proposing that the brain’s primary function is to minimize surprise – or, more precisely, to minimize free energy – by generating predictive models of the world and acting on those models. This paper critically examines the FEP’s implications for semantics, arguing that it provides a robust, mathematically-grounded account of how meaning arises and is used, and that this account can be formalized as a theory of semantics. The paper challenges the conventional view that semantic content is a property of mental representations, and instead proposes that meaning is generated by the process of generating predictive models of the world.The core of the argument rests on the idea that the brain doesn’t simply represent the world – it actively generates models of the world that it can use to predict and interact with the world. These models are not merely representations of the world; they are active processes that generate predictions about the world, and the brain’s goal is to minimize the error between these predictions and the actual world. This process of generating and testing predictions is what gives rise to meaning.The paper argues that the FEP provides a naturalistic explanation for how we understand and use language. It does so by providing a framework for understanding how language is used to generate predictions about the world. In this view, language is not simply a tool for communicating ideas, but rather a tool for generating predictions about the world.The paper challenges the conventional view that semantic content is a property of mental representations, and instead proposes that meaning is generated by the process of generating predictive models of the world. The FEP suggests that the brain doesn’t simply represent the world – it actively generates models of the world that it can use to predict and interact with the world. This approach offers a naturalistic explanation for how we understand and use language, as it provides a framework for understanding how language is used to generate predictions about the world.The FEP offers a naturalistic explanation for how we understand and use language. It does so by providing a framework for understanding how language is used to generate predictions about the world. The FEP suggests that the brain doesn’t simply represent the world – it actively generates models of the world that it can use to predict and interact with the world. This approach does not require us to invoke any special cognitive mechanisms, such as the concept of “intentionality” – it simply requires that the brain is generating models of the world that it can use to predict and interact with the world.The FEP provides a naturalistic explanation for how we understand and use language.
