### OverviewThis paper investigates the challenges of autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in pedestrian-rich environments, focusing on the cognitive risk integration for safe and efficient decision-making. The authors propose a novel framework that combines the Free Energy Principle with a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to model interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. The framework leverages a fused risk signal, derived from both physical and cognitive uncertainty, to guide the AV’s decision-making process. The study demonstrates that this approach improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness compared to existing methods.### MethodologyThe proposed framework consists of two main components: a cognitive process modeling approach based on the Free Energy Principle and a graph-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The cognitive process modeling approach quantifies cognitive uncertainty, which is used to adjust the AV’s behavior based on its perceived uncertainty about other agents’ intentions. The GCN is integrated into both the actor and critic networks to capture structured multi-agent interactions. The GCN operates on a dynamically constructed interaction graph, where nodes represent the AV and surrounding pedestrians, and edges encode the interaction intensity between agents. The risk-encoded adjacency matrix is constructed based on a fused measure of physical risk and cognitive uncertainty. The cognitive process modeling approach is implemented using a closed-loop process, as described in Algorithm1. The framework is trained using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which maximizes the expected cumulative reward while maintaining high entropy to encourage exploration and robustness. The GCN is used to enhance the state representation by capturing the complex interactions between the AV and surrounding pedestrians.### ResultsSimulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves AV performance compared to baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed model achieves a success rate of94%, a collision rate of6%, and a average maximum absolute acceleration/deceleration of0.524 m/s2. These results indicate that the framework effectively enhances safety, efficiency, and smoothness during AV navigation in pedestrian-rich environments. The model’s performance is attributed to the integration of cognitive risk modeling, which enables the AV to account for uncertainty in other agents’ intentions and adapt its behavior accordingly. The quantitative results are presented in Table II, which compares the proposed model’s performance to that of the UAW-PCG, S-SAC, and G-SAC-NoCog models. The results clearly show that the proposed model outperforms the other models in terms of all key performance indicators. The model’s ability to generate smooth and predictable trajectories is particularly noteworthy.### DiscussionThe study highlights the importance of incorporating cognitive uncertainty into AV decision-making. By explicitly modeling the AV’s subjective perception of other agents’ intentions, the framework enables the AV to make more informed decisions and avoid potentially dangerous situations. The use of a graph convolutional network allows the framework to capture complex interactions between the AV and surrounding pedestrians, leading to more robust and adaptive behavior. The framework’s performance demonstrates the potential of combining cognitive modeling with deep reinforcement learning to address the challenges of autonomous navigation in complex, dynamic environments. Future research could explore the application of this framework to other pedestrian-rich environments, such as campuses and residential areas. Further investigation into the optimal design of the cognitive uncertainty model and the graph convolutional network could also lead to improved performance. The framework’s modular design allows for easy integration of new features and algorithms, making it a promising platform for future research in autonomous navigation.
