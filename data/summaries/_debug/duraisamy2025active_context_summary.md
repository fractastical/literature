Abstract
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative im-
pact on science, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited in enabling genuine scien-
tific discovery. This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually rein-
forcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and...
