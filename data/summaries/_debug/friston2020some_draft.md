### OverviewThis paper summarizes “Some interesting observations on the free energy principle” by Friston, Da Costa, and Parr (2020). It extracts key quotes, identifies central claims, and presents the authors’ findings regarding the free energy principle’s application to nonequilibrium systems. The summary emphasizes the core arguments, including the role of solenoidal coupling, the distinction between exact and approximate Bayesian inference, and the connection between variational free energy and self-organization. A critical focus is placed on avoiding repetition, ensuring that each idea appears only once in the summary.### MethodologyThe methodology employed here is a direct extraction and synthesis of information from the provided paper. The process involves: (1) identifying key quotes that support the authors’ arguments; (2) discerning the central claims made throughout the paper; (3) summarizing the key findings presented in the results section; (4) describing the methodological approaches used by the authors; and (5) meticulously avoiding repetition to ensure a unique and comprehensive summary. The structure is designed to clearly present the paper’s core arguments and findings.### ResultsThe authors present several key observations regarding the free energy principle. First, they highlight the importance of solenoidal coupling – within and across the Markov blanket that defines anything of interest. This observation is central to the framework, suggesting that the structure of the Markov blanket is crucial for maintaining self-organization. Second, the paper distinguishes between “exact and approximate Bayesian inference,” arguing that the free energy principle is a general framework that can accommodate both. The authors explain that “the gradient flows that underwrite nonequilibrium steady-state can be expressed as a gradient descent on surprisal or self-information,” which is mathematically equivalent to a gradient ascent on log model evidence or marginal likelihood. Technically, the argument involves two moves: First, a thing is defined stipulatively in terms of a Markov blanket (Clark,2017; Kirchhoff et al.,2018), such that something’s internal states are independent of its external states, when conditioned on its blanket states. Blanket states are further partitioned into active and sensory states – that are not influenced by internal and external states, respectively. By starting from a Langevin formulation of any random dynamical system, the associated density dynamics can be expressed as the solutions to the Fokker Planck equation (Ao,2005; Frank et al.,2003). Crucially, because we are (stipulatively) assuming nonequilibrium steady-state, the steady-state solution to the Fokker Planck system enables us to express the dynamics or flow of states in terms of a Helmholtz decomposition (Ao,2004; Ao,2008; Friston and Ao,2012). This decomposition divides flow into dissipative gradient flows on the self-information of any state (i.e., its negative log probability at steady-state) and a divergence free or solenoidal flow. When this solution is expressed in terms of a Markov blanket partition, the implicit conditional dependencies require certain solenoidal coupling terms to disappear. This means that one can express the dynamics of something’s internal states as a function of, and only of, the blanket and internal states. Second, the authors note that the conditional independencies, implied by the Markov blanket, induces a particular kind of information geometry (Caticha,2015; Ikeda et al.,2004) in the internal state space. In brief, for any blanket state, there must be an expected internal state – and a conditional density over external states, given that blanket state. This means there is a statistical manifold in the internal state -space, corresponding to the conditional expectations of internal states, given blanket states. In other words, every point on the internal manifold corresponds to a conditional density – or posterior Bayesian belief – over external states. This endows the internal manifold with an information geometry, where distance between probability distributions can be measured with the Fisher information metric tensor (Crooks,2007; Da Costa et al.,2020b; Kim,2018), supplied by the conditional distribution over external states. Put simply, flows on the internal manifold can be construed as belief updating or Bayesian inference (Winn and Bishop,2005). This view is licensed by the fact that the (average ) flow on the internal statistical manifold is a gradient flow on surprisal (i.e., the negative Bayesian model evidence) of the blanket (and internal) states. In essence, this is the free energy Lemma (Friston,2019).### DiscussionThe authors’ work provides a valuable framework for understanding self-organization in nonequilibrium systems. The concept of the free energy principle, combined with the Markov blanket structure, offers a powerful tool for modeling complex systems. The distinction between exact and approximate Bayesian inference is particularly important, as it acknowledges the limitations of computational resources and the need for simplifying assumptions. The authors’ emphasis on variational free energy as a tool for optimization highlights its practical relevance. The authors’ work is supported by the fact that “the free energy lemma” is a key component of the free energy principle.### ConclusionIn conclusion, we have looked at three fundamental issues that underpin the free energy principle. The first was the role of solenoidal coupling – within and across the Markov blanket that defines anything of interest. The key observation – here and in Biehl et al (ibid) – is that certain solenoidal coupling terms are precluded. One obvious example is the coupling between internal and external state s. However, this does not necessarily preclude coupling between internal states and active states – or between external states and sensory states. Furthermore, there can be pronounced solenoidal coupling within any subset of the Markov blanket partition. The role of solenoidal coupling may be quite important in many systems. This is purely based on the heuristic that oscillator y and synchronous behaviour underpins most biorhythms over many temporal scales and maybe characteristic of biotic self-organisation (Buzsaki and Draguhn,2004; Desimone et al.,1990; Singer and Gray,1995) . In this setting, oscillations are assumed to be a manifestation of solenoidal flow; namely , circulation on iso -probability contours that form the fabric of classical (Lagrangian) mechanics (e.g., the orbits of heavenly bodies).
