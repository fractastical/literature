Abstract
Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests
an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC
framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static
interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective,
behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and
(En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator’s mind emerges, rather than being
merely extended, through loops of brain–body–environment interactions. This non-
representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural
practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with
texts, tools, and contexts.
1 Introduction
The classical representationalist view of the mind considers cognitive processes to
remain confined to the brain, where ‘mind = brain’. Classical internalism argues that
cognition involves manipulating internal representations which then trigger actions that
modify the world. In the functionalist view, however, the mind is defined by functional
patterns rather than the location of the processes. Under this view, external tools can
perform cognitive functions, which can become genuine parts of cognitive systems. Thus,
some extended mind (EM) theorists (e.g., Clark & Chalmers 1998) argue that if external
tools fill the equivalent functional roles as internal processes, they are on a par with the
internal elements.
However, EM hypotheses have been identified with three evolving versions (Kirchhoff &
Kiverstein, 2019). The initial version is parity-driven, primarily focusing on the
functional similarities between external and internal elements (Clark & Chalmers, 1998).
In other words, external resources bearing the equivalent functional roles should be
treated as part of the mind. The later version of EM (Menary, 2010; Sutton, 2010) shifted
the focus to complementarity principles, highlighting cooperative and transformative
roles of external elements. External resources act as scaffolds that shape, extend, and
sometimes constitute cognitive processes, depending on the degree of integration with
the organism. Clark’s later works (e.g., Surfing Uncertainty, 2016, 2023) also edge towards
this second ‘wave’ of EM thinking and emphasize a predictive processing (PP) model, in
which cognitive processes are primarily brain-based, while the mind may incorporate
external elements as scaffolds or tools. Despite the advancements made, the first two
versions of EM still view external and internal elements in terms of their own functional
characteristics. As we will lay out in section 3, enactivists, by contrast, reject these EM
frameworks and push the discussion into a third version. They view the mind as
embodied sense-making activity rather than representation-processing (internal or
extended).
Kirchhoff & Kiverstein (2019) propose a radical enactive perspective that conceptualizes
the mind and cognition as distributed across brain, body, and environment, which play a
constitutive role rather than a mere causal aid (scaffolds). Here, the brain, body, and
environment form a single, integrated system where the boundaries of cognition and
mind are fluid and context dependent. The environment is not a passive backdrop but
actively participates in the generation of subjective meaning through its interaction with
affective and cognitive processes. This view posits a mind-cognition continuum, rejecting
strict hierarchies and instead seeing the mind and cognition as mutually constitutive: the
mind enables cognitive processes, while cognitive processes define and continually
reshape the mind. The mind is a system collectively constituted by embodied, embedded,
enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) processes.
In most of these approaches, the term “cognition” is used in a broad, umbrella sense that
includes all types of information processing and input-output transformations, such as
memory, attention, reasoning, perception, etc. - essentially all mental processes.
However, the term “cognition” can also be opposed to other mental processes, to
introduce a distinction between automatic processes and affective responses. Cognition
in this narrower sense is then related to deliberate or effortful mental processing,
problem-solving, reasoning, or explicit learning.
Dual-process models differentiate between cognitive and intuitive/affective processes.
Kahneman (2011) distinguishes intuitive (System 1) from analytical (System 2) processes.
Evans & Stanovich (2013) propose an interaction model of affective and cognitive
systems in decision-making, while Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior links
attitudes to behavioral intentions and actions, integrating subjective norms and
perceived control. Building on radical enactivism, in section 2 we introduce a novel ABC
theory of mind, addressing affective (feeling/emotion-related), behavioral/automated
(action/observation-related), and cognitive (reflection/thought-related) processes (Carl,
2025). Behavioral/automated patterns are here embodied skills that established coupling
patterns with the environment. Cognitive activity is the process of active sense-making
that is called upon when automated behavioral routines turn out to be insufficient, while
the affective dimension provides an evaluative aspect of all sense-making. These
processes are considered components of the mind, alleviating the need to decide what
"extends" because the mind, in this view, emerges dynamically with the processes that it
includes.
In Translation Studies, recent theoretical frameworks of cognition have also moved
towards a more holistic view, recognizing that emotion and context are integral to
mental processes of translation (Risku & Rogl 2022, Muñoz Martín 2016). The translator’s
dynamic interaction with texts and the environment defines the extended mind, which
includes the body, and surroundings. These situated cognition models of translation
incorporate social context (e.g., Sannholm & Risku 2024) to account for both mental and
environmental aspects of translation processing within socio-cognitive frameworks,
where human cognition is considered fundamentally social and relational, and where
there are no clear boundaries between the individual mind and the social environment.
However, most (if not all) translation scholars endorse a representational view of
translation, in which items in the environment are mapped onto internal symbols and
mental models which stand for these elements and guide production in the target
language.
In this article, we suggest an alternative non-representational view in which the
translator does not store or manipulate (static) symbolic correspondences but instead
enacts translation through situated, embodied, and affectively modulated interaction
with text, tools, and context. On this view, meaning emerges from the dynamic coupling
of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes. Rather than mapping external stimuli to
internal representations, translation in this view is a process of skillful participation in a
sociocultural practice, where text comprehension and production are jointly realized in
the translator’s embodied engagement with their environment.
2 The ABC layers of the translating mind
We propose a novel ABC theory of mind that categorizes translation processes into three
functionally distinct, yet interdependent layers of affective, behavioral, and cognitive
dimensions (see Figure 1). This model provides a granular view of how the ongoing
activity of sense-making unfolds on different timelines:
• Affective processes are feeling and emotion-related, providing an evaluative
dimension that is crucial for successful agent-environment interaction. Affect and
emotion are ways in which the organism enacts its concern-based engagement with
the world. Grounded in embodied, biological attunement, they modulate how the
organism couples with the environment, foregrounding what sustains its activity and
shaping further sense-making.
• Behavioral processes encompass action- and sensation-related activities, including
embodied skills and established behavioral routines. They manifest as observable
actions—such as eye movements, typing, or gaze shifts—through which the translator
engages with the environment. Through repeated practice, these sensorimotor
couplings become consolidated into routinized cognitive-affective patterns that
support fluent interaction and reduce the need for deliberative control.
• Cognitive processes are reflection and thought-related, involving active sense-
making that becomes prominent when automatized behavioral patterns are
insufficient to address the situation. This includes belief updating, memory,
reasoning, and counterfactual simulation. Cognition is functionally defined by its role
in creating meaning, which can occur even at a pre-reflective level, especially when
an organism needs to navigate uncertainty or resolve indeterminacy.
The different types of Affective, Behavioral and Cognitive processes can be
conceptualized as hierarchically organized system of belief states (see Figure 1). Rather
than representing an external translation task the belief states embody the translator's
structural coupling with the translation environment through action-perception loops.
Figure 1 Relation in the ABC architecture and its relation to external environment.
The Behavioral Layer
On the behavioral level, belief states can be understood as embodied expectations that
guide skilled action. While representational accounts view behavioral patterns as
encoded symbol routines, enactivist approaches see them as enacted dispositions of
sensorimotor coupling. In translation, these automated routines surface in process data
as stretches of fluent typing or stable gaze trajectories.
Within the ABC model, the behavioral layer mediates the coupling between procedural
routines and sensory inputs, comparing top-down predictions with sensory evidence
from the source and target texts. Behavioral patterns—such as gaze and keystroke
dynamics—embody priors that shape how information is weighted and actions selected.
For instance, long pauses followed by rapid typing may reflect a “think–then–type”
policy, whereas alternating between texts and resources signals a “consult–then–revise”
policy. These behavioral policies represent learned expectations that define what counts
as “normal” interaction with the translation environment and thus bias how translators
interpret cues and regulate their activity.
The Cognitive Layer
In the ABC framework, cognitive belief states are understood as deliberate
reorganizations of ongoing sense-making that arise when habitual or automated
translation routines no longer suffice. Rather than representing external truths, these
belief states function as dispositions that stabilize and guide the unfolding translation
process. They articulate expectations about which continuation will maintain coherence
under the present conditions. They regulate self-organization through re-organization of
the environmental coupling determining whether and how to:
• Maintain the current engagement patterns vs. reorganize
• Expand the environmental coupling (seek new resources) vs. consolidate existing
patterns
• Shift between different modes of environmental interaction (analytical, intuitive,
collaborative)
Cognitive belief states may be activated proactively—as anticipatory structuring of the
translation flow—or reactively, when the translator encounters a disruption, such as
when a chosen rendering no longer fits the emerging context.
Anticipatory Cognitive Belief States
Anticipatory cognitive engagement operates at multiple reflective levels—ranging from
predicting how a segment aligns with discourse or genre conventions, to foreseeing how
readers, clients, or institutions may evaluate a choice, and recognizing when intended
solutions conflict with contextual or stylistic norms. Such anticipation relies on
metacognitive awareness of the reliability of one’s expectations. Depending on expertise,
task demands, and text difficulty, anticipations may involve:
• affordances of linguistic structures
• coherence emerging from translator–text interaction
• pragmatic effects of translation choices
• lexical and syntactic mappings across languages
• temporal dynamics of the translation process
Behavioral Correlates of Cognitive Processes
Evidence of cognitive processing in translation process data appears as dynamic
reconfigurations of the translator’s coupling with the environment. Such reorganizations
may involve consulting external resources (dictionaries, parallel texts, web searches)
alongside exploratory gaze behavior and extended keystroke pauses, indicating
information gathering. Reorganization patterns may also coincide with increased
keystroke variability, dispersed visual attention, or complex revision sequences before
stabilizing into new patterns of translation production.
Higher-order metacognitive control manifests as anticipatory (re)organization of
translator–environment relations, opening new possibilities for action, for example:
• strategic pauses at meaningful boundaries rather than mere difficulty points
• proactive resource use, where gaze shifts to reference materials precede emerging
translation problems.
The Affective Layer
Whereas cognitive belief states can be described as anticipatory readiness-to-think and
behavioral belief states as embodied readiness-to-act, affective belief states are felt
orientations that signal “this is workable,” “this feels wrong,” or “this matters.” They are
states of confidence, surprise, anxiety, trust, curiosity, and similar affective tones that
structure how cognitive and behavioral beliefs unfold over time.
Affective belief states do not represent truth but instead scaffold the direction of thought
and action. They orient attention and behavior by providing signals that bias what seems
relevant, urgent, or sufficient. Translators must be able to notice their own affective
stance, modulate it, and sometimes realign it with task demands or audience
expectations.
Affective beliefs are closely tied to somatic awareness. According to Damasio’s Somatic
Marker Hypothesis (1994), emotional processes are guided by bodily markers, which are
physiological signals that shape decision-making. When facing a choice, somatic markers
generate felt tendencies that steer a person toward advantageous options and away from
disadvantageous ones. It requires proprioceptive sensitivity to one's own affective-motor
readiness, i.e., the ability to register bodily responses to environmental situations, as well
as interoceptive skills in detecting the emotional significance of situations.
Within the ABC framework, affective belief states function as internal markers of
confidence, doubt, or hesitation and regulate when a translator settles on a solution or
keeps searching. Affective beliefs surface in translation process data in the form of:
• Fluent typing and keystroke bursts are indicative of high confidence states.
• Frequent deletions/revisions/refixations suggest surprise and low-confidence states.
• Extended pauses may reflect momentary affective struggle or indecision, a need for
epistemic affordances.
3 The Enacted Mind
Kirchhoff & Kiverstein (2019) distinguish between several “waves” of thinking about the
extended mind and develop an enactive third EM wave that draws on enactivism. Our
ABC theory will be based on their third wave EM perspective.
Extended Mind (EM) Theories and the Enactivist Perspective
First wave EM theorists recognize that external artifacts can be constitutive of cognition
when functionally integrated. In their view, the mind is in the head, which can be
extended with external resources. Clark & Chalmers (1998) use the coupling argument
which states that when a system is tightly and reliably coupled with an external element
(e.g., a translator with a CAT tool, or Otto with a notebook and a GPS), that element
becomes part of the cognitive system itself. The internal and external elements function
as a unitary cognitive process.
Second wave EM suggests that external resources such as tools, language, and cultural
practices are complementary to the organic parts of the mind, as they actively participate
in shaping and constituting how these enactments unfold. In line with the second wave,
Littau (2015) posits that “Media are not merely instruments with which writers or
translators produce meanings; rather, they set the framework within which something like
meaning becomes possible at all.” (emphasis in the original), seeing translation as
materially scaffolded and socially embedded.
The third-wave EM framework conceptualizes the mind as unfolding through continuous
loops of sensorimotor engagement with technological and cultural practices. The notion
of sensorimotor contingencies (O’Regan & Noë, 2001) emphasizes that perception is not a
passive registration of external “states of affairs,” but an active process of inference
about the causes of sensory signals (Seth 2014:98). Since the actual causes of sensory
input are conditioned on anticipated and past actions, perceptual inference concerns
observations that are themselves generated through action of the observing agent. In this
sense, the self-evidencing system can be described as “the author of its own sensations”
(Ramstead et al., 2022:234).
For translation, this implies that translators navigate sensorimotor contingencies shaped
by reading, writing, tool use, and socio-cultural expectations. Each “sensory signal” (a
string of words, a fuzzy match, a client instruction) is interpreted in light of anticipated
responses. Just as sensory inputs depend on action (what I do changes what I perceive),
the translator’s interpretive stance depends on their translational actions: consulting a
dictionary, choosing a draft phrasing, testing a formulation in the target language (TT), or
interacting with CAT tools. Each action reshapes the available “input.”
Ramstead et al.’s idea that the system is the “author of its own sensations” parallels how
translators generate the very conditions under which they construct meaning. By
segmenting the text, trying out equivalents, or by foregrounding certain stylistic features,
they partially create the interpretive signals they then act upon.
The thesis of Dynamic Entanglement (DEUTS) is central to the third wave.
Dynamic Entanglement Thesis (DEUTS)
The Dynamic Entanglement of the Unit of Experience and Sense-making (DEUTS, Hurley,
1998, 2010; Kirchoff & Kiverstein 2019) describes how the mind becomes reciprocally
coupled with features of the environment. The DEUTS argument comprises two core
theses:
1. The Dynamic Entanglement Thesis: Sensorimotor contingencies unfold in a way that
yields the dynamic entanglement of the brain, body, and world. This entanglement
involves non-linear causal interactions among neural, bodily, and environmental
elements, where sensory and motor channels enter into reciprocal causal influence
based on the agent's interaction with the environment.
2. The Unique Temporal Signature Thesis: Sensorimotor contingencies are
characterized by unique temporal signatures which entail that the brain cannot be
unplugged from the body and the world while keeping the phenomenal character of
experience fixed.
The mind emerges in this view as a pattern of patterns within the ongoing entanglement
of brain, body, and world. It is not a substance but a relational property of the embodied
system in action. This pattern is affectively and normatively structured, orienting the
organism toward what matters and sustaining meaningful interaction with its
environment. This view mirrors Ryle’s (1949) Concept of Mind as a set of capacities and
patterns, logically different from the material–biological–social domain, but an
emergent, relational property that exists only when those components are appropriately
and dynamically coupled.
4 Predictive Processing (PP) and Enactive Inference
The EM can be modeled in terms of Predictive Processing (PP). PP offers a powerful
framework for understanding how biological agents regulate their sensorimotor
interactions with the environment. It is a prominent idea in computational neuroscience
that proposes the brain performs approximate Bayesian inference (Friston, 2010; Parr et
al., 2018), constantly generating predictions about the causes of sensory stimuli and
updating these predictions by minimizing "surprise" (prediction error) or "uncertainty"
(expected free energy). Ramstead et al (2020) provide an “enactive interpretation” of PP
in which the predictive brain is not a representational device but an action-oriented
engagement machine (Clark 2023) that selects frugal, action-based routines to reduce
demands on neural processing and facilitate adaptive success. Action is a generative
process that changes the environment and therefore a precondition and enabler of
perception. However, action is also steered by an internal “generative model”. As
Ramstead et al. (2020:234) clarify such internal “generative models are more about the
control and regulation of action than they are about figuring out what is ‘out there’ …
They enable survival, rather than tracking truth. They model the acting organism, and
are used by living systems to modulate their behaviour.” Agents maintain viable
coupling by constantly minimizing prediction errors within a temporally thick horizon
where past, present, and anticipated future co-inform each other. In translation, this
temporal thickness allows coherence and flow between source comprehension and
target production.
Temporal Thickness
The notion of “temporal thickness” (Seth, 2014) is crucial within PP, which enables agents
to engage in "proactive, purposeful inference about their own future" (Davies 2017).
Friston (2018) refers to temporal thickness as counterfactual depth, the ability to simulate
counterfactual possibilities, and likely consequences of action by integrating information
across different timescales. In the context of translation, temporal thickness is evident
when translators coordinate short-term resources, such as the immediate co-text of a
word or phrase, and long-term considerations, including cultural and conceptual
mismatches between the source text (ST) and target text (TT).
Moreover, translators frequently make semantic and syntactic inferences during TT
production, and the cognitive effort involved in such predictive processes can be
reflected in their gazing and finger-based activities. These behavioral indicators offer
empirical support to the fact that translation is a temporally thick and inferentially
anticipatory cognitive activity.
Figure 2 Plot of the nested ABC architecture, showing internal and external states and
their linkage via the Markov Blanket.
Markov Blanket (MB)
A Markov blanket (MB) is a statistical boundary between a system and its environment.
Figure 2 shows an MB that consists of Sensory States (the input to the translator) and
Active States (how the translator acts on the environment) which conceptually separate
the translator’s Internal ABC states from the External/environmental States. Together, the
Internal, External, Sensory, and Active states comprise the closed perception–action loop.
MBs can be (and in biological systems usually are, Kirchhoff et al 2018) hierarchically
nested where each layer maintains some autonomy but still participates in the larger
dynamics. For instance, the ABC architecture is a hierarchically organized system (Carl et
al., 2025) in which each of the ABC layers is separated through MBs. This nesting
structure ensures that the system maintains its integrity and sustains stable coupling
with the environment. The layered internal structure also facilitates the temporal
thickness, which allows simulating the possibilities and consequences across different
timescales. The temporal thickness combined with nested MBs, helps to formally identify
the boundaries of the system.
Affect and Message Passing
Interaction between the ABC strata is mediated through reciprocal message passing (Parr
et al. 2022), a mechanism by which the activity at one level modulates the readiness,
salience and action tendencies of other layers. These ‘messages’ self-organize the
translator’s affective, behavioral, and cognitive layers by reducing uncertainty (through
the minimization of free energy), to maintain a workable flow, and continuously
adjusting attention, effort, and strategy in response to emerging cues from the text and
the translation environment.
Affective states express the translator’s expectations about how reliable incoming
sensory information and ongoing predictions are. Affect functions here as a higher-level
state, modulated by a precision-weighted signal. Each state carries an implicit precision
estimate, how much trust to place in predictions compared to sensory evidence and
behavioral tendencies at that moment. By continuously recalibrating this precision,
affect dynamically tunes the translator’s readiness to shift attention, change strategies, or
sustain effort. In this way, affect keeps behavioral routines and cognitive operations
flexibly aligned with the evolving demands of the translation task.
For instance, assume a translator is working on a legal contract where most of the
clauses are routine. Suddenly she encounters an ambiguous phrase with several
plausible renderings. Based on her prior experience, the translator predicts the target
equivalent, but then the sensory input does not fully match this prediction, creating a
prediction error. Depending on her affective attitude, the translator may feel calm and
confident, and the prediction error is treated as a small noise. In this case, the affective
state encodes a high precision in their predictions, where the translator need not
substantially update their model, continuing with the routine translation.
However, the translator may also feel anxious or uncertain. In this case the affective
state encodes lower precision for their prediction and higher precision for incoming
evidence, making the prediction error more salient. The translator then slows down, she
may seek additional context (e.g., parallel texts or legal dictionaries) and revise the
candidate translation.
Following ideas from computational phenomenology, these affective precision beliefs act
as a “phenomenological charge” - a weight or intensity of affective experience - which
shapes the ways in which experience is sampled and subsequently articulated (Ramstead
et al., 2023). In this view, affective states are not descriptions of inner symbolic
computation or internalist representations, but rather manifestations of extended,
affectively modulated interaction loops that determine how strongly prediction errors
“echo” through the hierarchy of embedded ABC layers. High trust in predictions
dampens the bottom-up error signal, promoting stability; low trust in one’s own
predictions amplifies the sensory errors signals, prompting re-evaluation.
Figure 3: The Progression Graph shows a segment of approx. 105 seconds for translator
(i) producing a linear translation from English to Japanese. The x‑axis denotes
translation time (605 – 710); the left y‑axis lists source words. The plot visualizes gazing
and keystroke behavior. Blue dots mark fixations on the ST; green dots mark fixations
on the TT; Japanese characters are the keystrokes. The plot also shows OHRF states
(Orientation, Hesitation, Revision, Flow) and their grouping into policies. The graph
shows that the translation was produced in five policies: three OF followed by two OFR,
marked alternating in green and red striped boxes.
Figure 4 : The Progression Graph shows a segment of approx. 64 sec. for translator (ii)
producing a reversed translation for the same ST that was achieved by means of three
policies: OF-OFHF-OF.
5 An Illustration
The illustration of a translation for an English ST sentence into Japanese is shown in
Figures 3 and 4. Both Figures show the same English ST sentence which consists of four
chunks, shown in Table 1:
# English Chunk Translation (i) Translation (ii)
① As a result, その結果、 結果、
full‑time leaders,
② bureaucrats, or 絶対的リーダーや官僚、職人が 常任の指導者や官僚、職人は
artisans

③ 必要とされない

by hunter‑gatherer そのような社会では
④ 狩猟採集民族社会から
societies
Table 1. English chunks and their Japanese translations
This sentence has been translated into Japanese by translator (i) in Figure 3 in a linear
order ① , ② , ④ , ③ that reproduces the ST ordering to a high degree, moving the
translation of the verbal phrase ③ to the final position, in line with Japanese syntactic
constraints. Translator (ii), by contrast, has chosen a reverse‑order translation ① , ④ , ②
, ③ which brings to the front the prepositional phrase ④ in the Japanese translation.
While both versions are valid Japanese translations, but they have different behavioral
implications.
Translation Styles
Translator (i) can be characterized as ‘head starter’ (Dragsted & Carl 2013), choosing to
read and type the translations chunk by chunk as they go along in the text. Epistemic
states of orientation are short, with a preference for pragmatic flow states. For instance,
until around time=628,000, the translator only fixates chunk ① while typing its
translation, indicating minimal lookahead.
On the other hand, the translator (ii) begins with a much longer orientation phase,
indicating higher need for cognition, where the entire sentence is scanned before any
words are typed. This translation strategy can be characterized as “large context
planner” (Dragsted & Carl 2013). Note that the successive orientation states are relatively
short.
The two different translation styles of translator (i) and translator (ii) result in different
policy cycles. For translator (ii), the need for epistemic value results in a long initial state
of orientation, whereas the head starter engages immediately in pragmatic translation
typing. While the head starter produces more subsequent revisions (marked R, in the
Figures), the more cautious large context planner has more hesitation (H, e.g. Figure 4
around time=710,000).
The Orientation State
During the orientation state, the translator actively familiarizes herself with (a part of)
the ST, scanning its structure, style, and potential difficulties. A state of orientation is
more than simply reading; it calibrates the translator’s perceptual and cognitive systems
to the task at hand. As comprehension deepens, the precision of subsequent predictions
for the most salient cues, terminology, and syntactic patterns, is increased, amplifying
their impact on downstream processes. In this sense, orientation is not a passive stage,
but a dynamic redistribution of attentional and affective resources: attention is
selectively heightened for features judged relevant, while irrelevant noise is dampened.
A state of orientation thus constitutes a coordinated Affective–Behavioral–Cognitive
reconfiguration: Affective states (interest, curiosity, tension, etc.) tune the sensitivity of
perception and memory, behavioral routinized gazing patterns enact the process of
exploration, and cognitive processes establish a provisional landscape of expectations
about how the translation will unfold. Taken together, these processes enable the
translator to set the stage for later action in a Flow state, reducing uncertainty and
increasing the efficiency of subsequent decision-making.
The Hesitation State
During a hesitation state, the translator experiences a moment of uncertainty in which
predictions are assigned low precision. That is, the system registers doubt based on the
current sensory or contextual evidence. Such hesitation often arises when lower layers
(behavioral routines / sensory inputs) produce inconsistency due to noisy signals (e.g.,
conflicting input from terminological resources), or when discrepancies between
expected and observed patterns become too large to be resolved automatically.
In a state of hesitation, automated processing temporarily suspends, keystrokes slow,
gaze fixations linger, and the translator may pause reading, thus to avoid committing to a
premature or error-prone choice. Simultaneously, the affective layer signals increased
vigilance or mild discomfort, which may, in turn, encourage additional information-
seeking or reinterpretation of the ST or TT. Decision-making is thus delayed until either
the incoming data become more coherent or alternative cues raise the reliability of the
available evidence.
Once prediction errors are reassessed, the system can transition out of hesitation. This
transition may then take the form of a state of orientation, or, as in Figure 4, a flow state.
A hesitation thus serves as a self-regulating checkpoint: it is neither failure nor inertia
but a protective recalibration mechanism ensuring that subsequent translation steps
proceed under conditions of higher certainty and precision.
The Revision State
During a revision state, the translator actively re-engages with already produced text,
treating it as fresh sensory input. The translator reallocates attention and precision
toward previously written target-text segments, signaling a readiness to detect
discrepancies, improve fluency, or adjust meaning. This typically arises when the
translator senses (often affectively) that something “doesn’t fit” or when a better
formulation becomes available.
At the behavioral layer, revision manifests gaze fixations on the TT, probably back
through text, or increased gaze dwell time on earlier segments, deletions, retyping, or
modifications. Automated routines give way to slower, more deliberate actions, enabling
the translator to test alternative expressions and re-align the translation with emerging
intentions. At the affective layer, mild tension, curiosity, or heightened alertness may
guide the revision process, prompting exploratory reformulation rather than mere error
correction.
The cognitive layer becomes more prominent, drawing on memory, inference, and
contextual integration to evaluate how revised segments fit within the whole. Revision
thus operates not as a simple “post-processing” stage but as an enactive loop in which
earlier outputs become new inputs. By re-entering already produced text as sensory
evidence, the translator can recalibrate their behavioral routines and refine affective
orientations. This cyclical process helps stabilize the unfolding translation, improves
coherence, and strengthens the translator’s evolving sense of how the text should sound
and mean.
6 An Enactive Simulation
This section discusses an enactive‑inference (EAIF) model that illustrates the two
translation strategies: (i) linear translation (source‑like word order) and (ii)
reverse‑order translation (substantial reordering). As depicted in Figure 2, the EAIF
architecture comprises four components—Internal states, External states, Sensory states,
and Active states—that form closed perception–action loops. The translator’s internal
belief states (the “generative model”) select sensory inputs from a shared external
environment (the “generative process”) and, in turn, inform subsequent action selection.
Conversely, active behavior perturbs the external states, which results in changes to the
sensory states that are then observed.
Mizowaki (forthcoming) casts the generative model as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP, Heins 2022, Parr et al. 2022) with two levels: a word level
(Level 1) and a chunk level (Level 2). Internal beliefs are modelled as probability
distributions over a finite set of candidate options, continually shaped by bottom-up
sensory evidence. Affective cues modulate the perceived relevance of updates,
behavioral responses enact searches or reformulations, and cognitive processes integrate
the evidence into revised hypotheses—together driving the translator’s ongoing
adaptation.
Simulation and Evaluation
Here, we present a high-level description of the enactive inference process based on the
ST and TT inputs from Table 1. We only discuss word order choices in the target
language, putting aside for the moment the difficult problem of lexical selection. While
lexical translation ambiguity plays an important role in policy selection, for the sake of
simplicity we focus here on word-order. Thus, based on the four chunk translations from

we generated the six Japanese translation candidates (TT to TT , in Table 2) by holding
0 5
the vocabulary constant and manipulating only the chunk order. Here, TT reproduces
0
the linear translation (i), while TT reproduces the reverse-order translation (ii), albeit
3
with a different vocabulary. All together, these four chunks can be combined into six
Japanese translations in different ways:

Table 2. Chunk orders for translations TT –TT . The source chunk order (for reference) is
0 5
①, ②, ③, ④. We consider commas (“、”) to be one of the chunks as well.
As shown in Table 2, TT –TT preserve an order relatively close to the source — phrase
0 2
④ appears in the latter half — whereas the position of phrase ② varies across
candidates. TT –TT implement substantial reordering: phrase ④ appears in the first
3 5
half, again with candidate‑specific positions. The verbal chunk ③appears sentence final
in all translations.
Because the chunk translations are identical across all candidates, the lexical entropy is
zero for all translations. By contrast, the positional entropy is larger than zero for all
chunks except for ③, since the word translations appear in different positions across
translations from TT to TT . In particular, the chunks ② and ④ exhibit large positional
0 5
variability across candidate translations and therefore carry high positional information.
In ABC terms, the Affective layer’s precision tunes how strongly such entropy reductions
influence subsequent policy selection at the Behavioral layer and belief concentration at
the Cognitive layer.
Translation Strategies
Before the translator starts reading any ST words, the mapping between ST chunks and
TT positions is highly uncertain, and thus the chunk-order entropy is high. Successively,
as the translator reads chunk by chunk sequentially, the (posterior) entropy reduces
because each new chunk narrows the distribution of possible TT orderings. When
reading Chunks ① and ③ the model entropy drops quickly because their positions are
relatively stable. Chunk ① translation can only appear in position 1 and 2 in the
Japanese sentence, while chunk ③ translation appears only at position 5. When reading
Chunks ② and ④ the entropy reductions happen more slowly, as they carry most of the
“informational load” in the mapping task, these chunk translations can occur in all target
position, except in position 5.
Conversely, when typing the chunk translations, the biggest entropy drop happens when
placing ② and especially ④, since those chunks have the highest positional variability
across the six candidate translations. Their placement will hence decrease most of the
variability in the sentence. By contrast, placing chunk ① reduces the sentence entropy
only slightly and typing chunk ③ does no reduce the word-order entropy at all, as there
is no positional uncertainty related to the placement of this chunk.
Head-starter vs. Large-context Planner
The head-starter and the large-context planner follow two opposite strategies. For the
head-starter, entropy is resolved through action. Thus, placing the translation of chunk
① immediately after ST reading also makes the entropy drop immediately. As Japanese
sentences can start with an adverbial phrase ①, this might be a good strategy. It enables
(potentially) quicker throughput and fits the incremental interpreter model (e.g., Chater
et al 1995) in which ST comprehension and TT production unfold in tandem and thus
relieves the translator’s memory and (potentially) reduces effort. However, when
decisions are made early, they may need revision if later chunks force a reordering (e.g.
if ④ needs to go first). There is also a risk for the translator to produce a TT structure
that becomes awkward when late-arriving ST chunks demand non-canonical placement.
For the large-context planner, the model entropy is resolved before action. This enables
stable predictions but demands higher working memory. The translator can plan TT
structure more globally, for instance, placing ④ optimally without risk of backtracking
and may thus produce a more coherent TT. However, the large-context planner requires
holding more content in working memory (all four ST chunks) which implies higher
upfront cognitive load. It is slower to start typing, and infringes a cost in production
onset, less fluent and less efficient workflow. In turn, large-context planner may avoid
reordering errors and costly revisions but pays with a higher memory/attention burden.
Each layer has a different role in this context: the behavioral layer chooses and executes
policies, that is, sequences of actions, such as typing, reordering, dictionary lookup, etc.
The cognitive layer maintains and updates the generative model, which is, in the ABC
conception, a structure that regulates action–perception loops and constrains trajectories
of action (e.g., “Chunk ① is likely to go first”), without requiring an internal symbol that
stands for the “true” order.
The affective layer regulates precision weighting and modulates how much confidence is
given to certain predictions and error signals. Precision modulation decides how costly
uncertainty feels at different points, thereby biasing the translator toward either early
entropy reduction through action (head-starter) or delayed entropy reduction through
model refinement (large-context planner).
Crucially, head-starter vs. large-context planner is not categorical, but reflects where
precision is assigned along the model/action axis. The head-starter prefers incremental,
high precision on sensory-action loops, while the large-context planning focuses on high
precision on model-based priors.
7 Conclusion
Hutchins’ (1995) “Cognition in the Wild” can be considered a precursor of the “The
Extended Mind” (EM) hypothesis which is, however, strongly rooted in classical
cognitivism. Hutchins maintains that cognition is a form of computation which implies
the “propagation of representational state[s] across representational media” (Hutchins
1995:118) These representational states are propagated across different internal and
external media “by bringing them into coordination with one another.” Some of the
structure, he says, “is internal to the individuals and some is external.” (ibid. 117) The
truthful re-representation of these structures across the different media is thereby based
on a set of “axiomatic propositions and a set of rules”, which “preserve the truth of the
axioms.” (ibid.) External tools and artifacts enter this chain of mediated structures,
which form a rich network of mutual computational and representational dependencies,
in which “each tool creates the environment for the others” (ibid. 114) With the
extension of the mind into the ‘Wild’, humans “create their cognitive powers by creating
the environments in which they exercise those powers” thereby dissolving the
“boundaries of the skin.” (Hutchins 1995: xvi)
Kirchhoff & Kiverstein (2019) analyze successive extensions of the EM hypothesis. They
make out three “waves” of thinking about the extended mind. According to them, the
first wave EM framework (Clark & Chalmers 1998) stipulates the functional similarities
between internal and external tools, such when a notebook takes over or replaces
internal biological memory. Second-wave EM “stresses different but complementary
functional properties” (Kirchhoff & Kiverstein 2019:11) of the brain and external
resources, in which “non-biological scaffolding” augments the brain’s biological modes of
processing. These external ‘scaffoldings’ are “transformatory of our cognitive capacities”,
they produce “new cognitive powers … because of the different functional properties”
(ibid. 12).
The third wave conceptualizes the mind as “diachronically constituted.” That is, the mind
is not fixed or static, but negotiable and fragile. It is constituted through the unfolding
history of engagements with cultural practices and conditioned on how the agent has
been historically embedded in practices. The diachronic perspective rejects “the idea of
complementarity” (Kirchhoff & Kiverstein 2019:16) which is part of the second EM wave,
and which stipulates a “fixed-properties view” of internal and external elements. In the
third wave, Kirchhoff & Kiverstein (2019) endorse a notion of “active externalism” in
which elements of the environment play “an active role in driving cognitive processes.”
(ibid. 7) Cognition is here a pattern of active coupling in which the agent’s movements,
attention, affect, and environment jointly bring forth cognitive states.
While this echoes Hutchins’s point that cognition is the propagation of activity across
various internal and external ‘media’, the third wave EM rejects representationalism all
together. Third wave EM protagonists refute the notion of “mental representation” as
unnecessary or even misleading: meaning emerges from temporally thick, skillful
engagement, not from internal symbolic encoding. The mind just is a set of dynamic
patterns across brain, body, and world. Ramstead et al. (2020) build on this third wave
EM, re-formulating key-components of Active Inference (Parr et al. 2022) in which the
“generative model” (i.e., the agent’s internal believe structure) is not a representational
device but a control structure that allows to optimize interaction by reducing the free
energy (Friston 2010). In this “enactive inference” framework, the brain does not
represent, but it controls and regulates mental processes, i.e., processes that stretch into
the environment.
Instead of modelling translation as “inner representation + output,” we suggest, in line
with the third wave EM and enacative inference, seeing translation as an ongoing
practice in which text, translator, tools, and sociocultural norms form a single extended
loop. While cognition is the ongoing extended process, the mind is the emergent,
affectively and normatively structured pattern of that process, not a separate substance,
but the system’s self-organized identity. Cognition is the mechanism, while the mind is
the emergent organization of that mechanism.
The ABC model frames translation not as an inner symbolic process aided by tools, but as
an extended, affectively attuned practice in which brain, body, tools, and cultural norms
co-realize meaning in real time. In this view, the translator’s embodied and affective
attunement to their work environment (software interfaces, source texts, glossaries,
client expectations, time pressure, ergonomics, etc.) is part of the cognitive–affective
loop, not just a backdrop.
We discuss an example in which we model translation as Predictive Processing/Enactive
Inference: each translation step can be seen as the minimization of prediction error
across multiple layers of the ABC system. At the affective layer, precision weighting
determines how strongly certain cues (e.g., translator habits, stylistic conventions)
modulate decision-making. At the behavioral layer, gaze movements, typing, and pauses
reflect the agent’s ongoing adjustments to minimize discrepancies between expected and
actual task progress. At the cognitive layer, higher-level inferences about semantic fit,
coherence, and adequacy are continuously revised as new linguistic material is
processed.
Affect is thereby conceptualized not as discrete emotional episodes but as encompassing
the physiological and psychological underpinnings of emotion, including stress, arousal,
and embodied responses to linguistic stimuli. In this view, affect shapes the allocation of
attentional resources, the efficiency of decision-making, and the quality of translational
output, while cognitive activity is inseparable from affective influences. This is largely in
line with recent discussions of emotions in cognitive translation and interpreting studies
(e.g., Rojo López & Caldwell-Harris, 2023)
The ABC framework is also compatible with empirical findings in CTIS, e.g., that affect
can both facilitate and hinder translational performance. In this respect, studies of
affective congruence suggest that alignment between translators' own emotional states
and the emotional valence of the source text, fosters fluency, creativity, and narrative
engagement, while incongruence can impede comprehension and slow response times
(e.g., Lodge & Taber, 2005; Rojo López & Ramos Caro, 2014; Naranjo & Rojo López, 2020).
In the ABC view, this results from the interaction among the three layers, where signals
from lower levels - through action-perception loops and engagement with the
environment - incur levels of surprise and uncertainty at the affective layer, modulating
the actions taken by the translator. This modulation, additionally, is subject to individual
differences, task demands, and L1/L2 directionality (e.g., Zoë et al 2025).
The ABC framework posits that mental processes encompass not only the source text,
speakers, or multimodal stimuli, but also the emotions of others, which may evoke
empathy or stress. The affective states can either mobilize cognitive resources
(facilitating performance) or overwhelm them, depending on intensity. Other than the
textual or multimodal materials, affect can also emerge through interpersonal and
contextual processes, and this also means that translators and interpreters can be
susceptible to "emotional contagion" -- the emotions embedded in source texts or
conveyed by speakers are internalized and mirrored physiologically. Interpreting in
traumatic or highly emotional contexts can induce vicarious stress or even secondary
trauma, while more subtle contexts, such as politically charged discourse, can bias
decision-making in ways aligned with translators' own ideological stance. All these
aspects can be described as the consequences of expected free energy minimization
which in turn, is strongly influenced by affective precision modulation. Precision
modulation determines how strongly affective states weigh the relative influence of the
epistemic and pragmatic drive, thereby constraining the minimization of expected free
energy. For example, when affect is calm and confident, greater precision is assigned to
predictions. This increases the expected pragmatic value through preferences at the
layers below and reduces exploratory behavior. On the other hand, a cautious, anxious,
or fatigued affective state increases uncertainty, thus increasing the epistemic
component of expected free energy, driving information-seeking behaviour.
In summary, our ABC framework treats affect not as an incidental by product but as a
constitutive element of how translators process linguistic input, interact with the
external environment, regulate attention, construct meaning, and produce the target
text.
The ABC framework, like Predictive Processing (PP), should not be regarded as a narrow
theory but more as a principled framework for understanding the dynamics of
translation. Still, for it to have scientific credibility, it must articulate conditions under
which its claims could be challenged. These falsifiability criteria include:
• Precision-modulation claims. The framework posits that the Affective layer tunes
the precision with which the Behavioral and Cognitive layers weigh alternative
mappings. This could be falsified if experimental evidence showed that translators’
affective states (e.g., stress, confidence, fatigue) have no measurable effect on
decision-making speed or variability in translation choices.
• Entropy-reduction dynamics. The framework assumes that translation unfolds as a
progressive reduction of uncertainty (model entropy) coupled with fluctuating
process entropy during action. It would be challenged if empirical data showed no
systematic entropy reduction as translators advance through text chunks.
• Layer interaction. If Cognitive (belief-updating), Behavioral (policy selection), and
Affective (precision modulation) layers could be empirically shown to operate fully
independently, with no measurable influence across layers, the core principle of
integrative coupling would be falsified.
It must be acknowledged that the present study demonstrates only the basics of an ABC
framework. While we provide an example that illustrates how uncertainty reduction and
precision-modulated action can be modeled, it does not capture the full integration of
Affective, Behavioral, and Cognitive dynamics in real-world translation.
