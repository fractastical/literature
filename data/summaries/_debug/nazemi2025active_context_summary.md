Active Inference for Energy Control and Planning in Smart
Buildings and Communities
Seyyed Danial Nazemi 1,*, Mohsen A. Jafari 1, and Andrea Matta 2
Abstract— Active Inference (AIF) is emerging as a powerful struggle with inaccuracies in forecasts, and RL models, which
framework for decision-making under uncertainty, yet its require significant computational resources for training, AIF
potential in engineering applications remains largely employs Bayesian principles to handle uncertainty and mak...
