### OverviewThis paper, “Blankets, Heat, and Why Free Energy Has Not Illuminated the Workings of the Brain,” offers a commentary on Bruineberg et al. (2021), critically examining the application of the free energy principle to neuroscience. The authors argue that the principle, as currently interpreted, lacks a meaningful physical – and neuronal – basis and fails to illuminate the complexities of brain function. They propose a shift in perspective, advocating for an “inside-out” approach to systems neuroscience.### MethodologyTo determine the implications of applying free energy principles to the study of the brain, it is worth examining how free energy arises in physics in the first place, and then considering the implications for studies of the brain. We focus on two questions: What is the functional content of applying a free energy principle to the brain? If the free energy principle does work phenomenologically, can it tell us about the underlying workings of the brain? Free energy arises in thermodynamics, the field that describes the bulk behavior of large systems. Statistical mechanics, in turn, is the field that derives thermodynamics from more fundamental principles. Via the ergodic hypothesis, statistical mechanics says that the bulk properties of a system (macrostates) can be found by ignoring the detailed dynamics of the intractably large number of microstates, and instead performing ensemble averages over the possible microstates (with equal likelihoods in isolated systems, which implies Boltzmann weightings at finite temperature). The bulk properties found by ensemble averages in statistical mechanics can alternatively be found thermodynamically, by minimizing the quantity known as the free energy. The power of free energy is thus not that it is optimized at equilibrium; after all, there are non-thermodynamic optimization problems. It is that there is a language of macrovariables which can characterize a system, while the underlying microvariables evolve in a way functionally indistinguishable from randomly. But as invoked in the target article, the free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.### Results & ClaimsThe authors state: "The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain." They argue that the current interpretation of the free energy principle is fundamentally flawed, lacking a connection to specific neuronal dynamics. They claim: “The authors state: “The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.”” The paper argues that focusing on minimizing free energy, as presented by Bruineberg et al., does not provide a useful framework for understanding brain function. They claim: “The authors state: “The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.””Furthermore, they state: “Imagine thermodynamics had been invented before Newtonian mechanics. Could one deduce Newton’s laws of motion from this formalism? The answer is no.” This illustrates their point: that thermodynamics alone cannot explain the fundamental dynamics of physical systems. They argue: “The authors state: “Imagine thermodynamics had been invented before Newtonian mechanics. Could one deduce Newton’s laws of motion from this formalism? The answer is no.””### Findings & AnalysisThe authors highlight the potential for a misinterpretation when applying thermodynamic principles to complex systems like the brain. They note: “The authors state: “The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.”” They argue that simply minimizing free energy doesn’t provide a mechanism for understanding how neurons actually function. They claim: “The authors state: “The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.””### Discussion & ConclusionThe authors advocate for an “inside-out” approach to systems neuroscience, suggesting that understanding the brain’s dynamics is key to unlocking its secrets. They state: “The authors state: “The free energy principle does not point to any macro- or microvariables, which are needed for either a high- or low-level understanding of the workings of the brain.”” They conclude that the current interpretation of the free energy principle is not a viable framework for understanding brain function.
