### OverviewThis revised summary of “Free Energy and the Generalized Optimality Equations for Sequential Decision Making” by Ortega and Braun investigates the application of the free energy principle to bounded rational decision-making, since it instantiates a natural trade-off between utility gains and information processing costs that can be axiomatically derived. The paper derives generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. The authors show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalizedoptimality equations that accountfor both adversarialand stochastic environments.### MethodologyThe authors apply the free energy principle to general decision trees that include both adversarial and stochastic environments. The paper derives generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. The authors state: “The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalizedoptimality equations that accountfor both adversarialand stochastic environments.” In two-player zero-sum games where strictly competitive players make alternate moves, an agent shouldusetheMinimax strategy. Themotivation underlyingminimax decisions is that the agent wants to optimize the worst-case gain as a means of protecting itself against the potentially harmful decisions made by the adversary. Finally, there are games that mix the two previous interaction types. For instance, in Backgammon, the course of the game depends on the skill of the players and chance elements. In these cases, the agent bases its decisions on the Expectiminimax rule (Michie,1966). The authors state: “When an agent interacts with a stochastic system, the agent chooses its decisions based on Expectimax.” Essentially, Expectimax is the dynamic programming algorithm that solves the Bellman optimality equations, thereby recursively maximizing expected future reward in a sequential decision problem (Bellman,1957). The authors highlight: “The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalizedoptimality equations that accountfor both adversarialand stochastic environments.”### Free Energy and Equilibrium DistributionIn Ortega and Braun (2011) and in Ortega (2011) it was shown that a bounded rational decision-making problem can be formalized based on the negative free energy difference between two information processing states represented by two probability distributions P and Q. The decision process then transforms the initial choice probability Q into a final probability P by taking into account the utility gains (or losses) and the transformation costs. This transformation process can be formalized as P(x)= Q(x)eαU(x), where Z = Q(x)eαU(x). Accordingly, the choice pattern of the decision-maker is predicted by the equilibrium distribution P. Crucially, the probability distribution P extremizes the following functional (Callen,1985; Keller,1998): Definition1 (Negative Free Energy Difference) Let Q be a probability distribution and let U be a real-valued utility function over the set X. For any α ∈ R, define the negative free energy difference F [P] as α1 P(x) F [P] := P(x)U(x)− P(x)log . α α Q(x) Xx Xx The parameter α is called the inverse temperature. Although strictly speaking, the functional F [P] corresponds to the negative free energy difference α1 P(x) F [P] := P(x)U(x)− P(x)log . α α Q(x) Xx Xx The parameter α is called the inverse temperature. When inserting the equilibrium distribution (1) into (2), the extremum of F yields: α1 log Q(x)eαU(x) . (3) α (cid:18) (cid:19) Xx The different values of α, this extremum takes the following limits:1 logZ = maxU(x) (maximum node) α→∞ α x1 logZ = Q(x)U(x) (chance node) α0 α→0 Xx1 logZ = minU(x) (minimum node) α→−∞ α x The case α → ∞ corresponds to the perfectly rational agent, the case α →0 corresponds to the expectation at a chance node and the case α → −∞ anticipates the perfectly rational opponent. Therefore, the single expression1 logZ can represent the maximum, expectation α and minimum depending on the value of α. The inspection of (2) reveals that the free energy encapsulates a fundamental decision-theoretic trade-off: it corresponds to the expected utility, penalized—orregularized—by the information cost of transforming the base distribution Q into the final distribution P. The inverse temperature plays the role of the conversion factor between units of information and units of utility. If we want to change the temperature α to β while keeping the equilibrium and reference distributions equal, then we need to change the corresponding utilities from U to V in a manner given by the following theorem. Temperature changes will be important for the application of the free energy principle to the general decision trees in Section3.### Resource CostsConsider the problem of picking the largest number in a sequence U ,U ,U ,... of i.i.d. data, where each U ∈ U is drawn from a source with probability distribution M. After α draws the largest number will be given by max{U ,U ,...,U }. Naturally, the larger the number of draws, the higher the chances of observing a large number. The distribution over the maximum of α samples is equal to F (x) = F(x)α, where F is the cumulative distribution F(x ) = M(x ). Defining F(x ) :=0, one has M (x ) = F(xn)α, where n is the number of samples. The authors state: “The free energyprinciple therefore provides the normative basis for generalizedoptimality equations that accountfor both adversarialand stochastic environments.”### Discussion and ConclusionsThe authors highlight: “The free energyprinciple therefore provides the normative basis for generalizedoptimality equations that accountfor both adversarialand stochastic environments.” The key finding is the ability to derive Expectimax, Minimax, and Expectiminimax from a single free energy principle. The authors state: “These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node.” The resource parameters themselves are amenable to interesting computational, statistical and economic interpretations. In the first sense they measurethe number of samples needed from a distribution before applying the max operator and therefore correspond directly to computational effort. In the second sense they reflect the confidence of the estimate of the maximum and therefore they can also express risk attitudes. Finally, the resource parameters reflect the control an agent has over a random variable. These different ramifications need to be explored further in the future.
