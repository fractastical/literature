Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating ac-
tive inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities,
their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We
address this by implementing an active inference ...
