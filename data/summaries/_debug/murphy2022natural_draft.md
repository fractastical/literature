## Natural Language Syntax Complies with the Free-Energy PrincipleThe free-energy principle (FEP) posits that the brain minimizes surprise (or free energy) by constructing an internal model of the world. This paper investigates how this principle manifests in natural language syntax (NLS). The authors argue that NLS is not merely a formal system for representing meaning, but rather a mechanism for actively constructing and maintaining a coherent representation of the world, minimizing prediction errors and thereby reducing the overall “surprise” experienced by the system. The authors propose that NLS is a fundamental aspect of cognition, and that the principles of the FEP are directly applicable to understanding the structure and function of language.The authors state: “The core idea is that the brain actively constructs a model of the world, and that this model is constantly updated to minimize prediction errors.” They note: “This model is not simply a passive representation of the world, but an active construction that shapes our experience.” The paper argues that NLS is a crucial component of this process, providing a framework for understanding and interacting with the world.The authors argue that NLS is not merely a formal system for representing meaning, but rather a mechanism for actively constructing and maintaining a coherent representation of the world, minimizing prediction errors.
