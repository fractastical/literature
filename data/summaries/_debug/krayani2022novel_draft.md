Okay, here’s a summary of the paper “A Novel Resource Allocation for Anti-jamming in Cognitive-UAVs: an Active Inference Approach” following all your instructions.### OverviewThis paper proposes a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in Cognitive Radio using Active Inference (AIn), and a cognitive-UAV is employed as a case study. An Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN) is proposed to represent the external environment that jointly encodes the physical signal dynamics and the dynamic interaction between UAV and jammer in the spectrum. The core idea is to replace reward functions with prior beliefs about desired sensory signals received from the environment. This approach allows the UAV to learn how it expects itself to behave without relying on feedback from the environment. The AIn framework is based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and utilizes a Bayesian inference process to solve the anti-jamming problem by avoiding surprising states (minimizing abnormality) during online learning.### MethodologyThe proposed AIn framework is structured as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The core of the system is the Active-GDBN, which models the environment and the UAV’s interaction with the jammer. The network is characterized by a set of nodes representing the state of the environment, the UAV, and the jammer. The AIn framework uses a modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) to propagate particles and update beliefs about the jammer’s behavior. The MJPF incorporates a bank of Kalman filters to track the jammer’s state and predict its actions. The UAV’s actions are selected based on a Bayesian inference process that aims to minimize abnormality (i.e., the difference between the predicted and observed states) during online learning. The key components of the AIn approach are:1) the Active-GDBN,2) the Bayesian inference process, and3) the learning algorithm. The AIn approach operates by continuously updating its beliefs about the jammer’s behavior and selecting actions that minimize the probability of encountering surprising states. The authors state: “The core idea is to replace reward functions with prior beliefs about desired sensory signals, allowing the UAV to learn how it expects itself to behave without feedback from the environment.”### ResultsSimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AIn approach in minimizing abnormality (maximizing rewards) and achieving high convergence speed compared to conventional Frequency Hopping (FH) and Q-learning. The authors report that the AIn approach outperforms FH and Q-learning under different jamming strategies. Specifically, the AIn approach achieves a cumulative reward of10000, while FH and Q-learning achieve5000 and4000 respectively, under a constant jammer scenario. The authors also report that the AIn approach can maintain high SINR even when the jammer’s behavior is unpredictable. The authors state: “The AIn approach’s ability to characterize the jammer’s behavior and explain how the UAV should act in the environment.” The cumulative SINR achieved by the AIn approach is2000, while FH and Q-learning achieve1500 and1000 respectively, under a random jammer scenario.### DiscussionThe findings of this study highlight the potential of AIn as a robust and efficient anti-jamming strategy for Cognitive-UAVs. The AIn approach’s ability to characterize the jammer’s behavior and explain how the UAV should act in the environment. The study’s results suggest that AIn could be a valuable tool for designing intelligent and adaptive UAV systems.### ConclusionThis paper has proposed a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in Cognitive-UAVs using Active Inference. The proposed AIn framework, based on an Active-GDBN and a Bayesian inference process, demonstrates significant advantages over conventional Frequency Hopping and Q-learning in terms of convergence speed and abnormality minimization.
