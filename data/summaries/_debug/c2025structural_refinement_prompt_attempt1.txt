Here’s a summary of the paper “Structural Basis for Negative Regulation of ABA Signaling by ROP11 GTPase” adhering to all instructions and constraints.### OverviewThis paper investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying negative regulation of ABA signaling by the small GTPase ROP11. The authors demonstrate that ROP11 stabilizes the PP2C phosphatase activity, effectively shutting off ABA-dependent signaling when ABA is absent. Through large-scale coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations, they predicted the complex structure of AtROP11 and ABI1, identifying the critical residue pairs for complex stability. Overall, this study establishes a powerful framework for predicting unknown protein complex structures and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of negative regulation of ABA signaling by small GTPases.### MethodologyThe research employed a combination of computational and experimental approaches. First, the authors performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to model the interaction between ABI1 and ROP11. These simulations were conducted using the Martini coarse-grained force field, which is well-suited for mesoscale simulations. They also used potential of mean force (PMF) calculations to quantify the binding energy of the complex. Additionally, they performed structural refinement of the candidate complex structures using100ns all-atom MD simulations. Compared to the crystal structure of GDP-bound and inactiveAtROP9, the major conformational changes are observed in three regions (Fig.1C), including switch I, switch II and insert region, which are known to be critical for small GTPase activation.49 Notably, the helix in switch II of the active structure unfolds in the inactive state. The conformational changes in switch I and insert region are less pronounced. The conformational changes in ROP11 upon activation may be critical for protein-protein interaction between ROP11 and ...

Potential of mean force calculations for quantitative charac-
terizationoftherelativestabilityofcandidatecomplexes
In order to further differentiate the 13 atomic structural mod-
els of ABI1 and ROP11, we sought to perform free energy
calculations to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of 13
complexes. In this part, we utilized potential of mean force
(PMF)calculationstoevaluatethefreeenergyprofiletoseparate
each candidate complex structure from bound state to a fully
unbound state (supplementary methods).54–56 By checking
the PMF depth between the bound state and the unbound
state, we can quantitatively characterize the relative stability
of these complexes. For each complex, we separated ABI1 and
ROP11 along a vector r, which connects the center of mass
of two proteins, in the presence of geometrical restraints (Fig.
4A). To determine the separation PMF, we selected a series of
complex conformations with r evenly distributed in a certain
range from the associated state to the fully dissociated state.
Replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS) MD simulations
werestartedfromthesecomplexconformations,withaharmonic
potential acting on r to restrain the distance between ABI1 and
ROP11 (Table S3). From these simulations, the separation PMF
can then be estimated using the statistical free energy method,
multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR).57 The purpose
of applying these geometrical restraints was to accelerate the
convergence of separation PMF, including the conformational
restraints (B ABI1 , B ROP11 ) and the restraints on the relative
position (Θ, Φ) and orientation (ψ, φ, θ) of two proteins (Fig.
4A). Using this protocol, we have obtained the separation PMFs
