### OverviewThis paper investigates the development of compositionality and generalization in robots through interactive learning of language and action. The authors propose a neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language to achieve this goal. The model learns to generate visuo-proprioceptive sequences to achieve linguistically specified goals, demonstrating that robots can learn to understand and execute complex behaviors by combining sensory and linguistic information.### MethodologyThe authors propose a hierarchical generative model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language. The model consists of a single PV-RNN layer with256 neurons and20 stochastic units. The PV-RNN layer is used to generate visuo-proprioceptive sequences and to bound the language network. The language network consists of a single LSTM layer with40 neurons and a10 dimensional parametric bias. The model is trained end-to-end using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The authors use a dataset of400 visuo-proprioceptive sequences, collected from a physical robot arm. The dataset contains sequences of different types, including grasping, moving, and stacking objects. The model is evaluated by measuring its ability to generate visuo-proprioceptive sequences to achieve linguistically specified goals. The authors use a metric called success rate to evaluate the performance of the model. The model achieves a success rate of72.5% in achieving the linguistically specified goals.### ResultsThe model demonstrates significant generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions. Specifically, the model shows that the compositional structure that emerges in the linguistic latent state representation is significantly influenced by sensorimotor learning. The model achieves a success rate of72.5% in achieving the linguistically specified goals. The authors also find that the model’s ability to accurately generate visuo-proprioceptive sequences is significantly impacted by the presence of visual attention and working memory.
