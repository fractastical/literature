Abstract Inthispaperwewillarticulateaviewofresilienceunderthe
free energy principle and vice versa. The free energy principle is about
existenceandidentity,andresilienceistheconditionunderwhichthings

resilience using the free energy principle. We will extend that work by
making the case that self-organisation under the free energy principle is
about resilience, in the sense that identity is a constant process of self-
reconfiguration, implying the existence of a self-model and the energy
toreconfigurethatself-model—andhence,theresilienceofamaintained

1 Introduction
Thispaperismainlyconcernedwiththenotionsofidentityandresiliencewhich
are at stake when modelling adaptive systems. Self-organisation is implicitly
defined in terms of identity—that is, the self. However, it is also apparent that
self-organisation is never static, and the sense of identity implicit here must
somehow be flexible or else be capable of accommodating changes in the envir-
onment. In dissipative adaptation, for example, a system self-organises by re-
structuring itself to absorb and dissipate energy from an external source in the
environment [9,21,24,40]. This echoes enactive and autopoietic theories: living
systems produce and maintain themselves [28], and for an organism to main-
tain a model of itself and its environment, it must produce what is required
to preserve its generative model [29]. Maturana–Varela’s concept of autopoiesis
describes how a system continuously regenerates its components but also keeps
its identity intact—again encountering the tension we highlighted. This paper
aims to investigate what an appropriate description of this flexibility might be
and how can it can be modelled, and in particular, what resilience has to do
2 M Albarracin and D A R Sakthivadivel
with a changing identity in dynamic environments. We will develop a first idea
of a formalism to describe resilience and some simple models for how resilience
features in adaptive systems.
Adaptation is often achieved by, or can be modelled as, an inference process
[15,37,39,47,51]. An interesting example to study is the human brain. Modern
theoretical neuroscience asserts that the brain maintains an internal self-model
whichiscontinuouslyrefinedaspartofitspredictiveengagementwiththeworld.
Inpredictiveprocessing,anagentmustmodelthecausesofitssensoryinputsto
respondtoperturbationsfromtheenvironment[12].Sincetheagent’sownbody,
traits, and actions are implicated in those causes, the brain encodes a model of
‘self’ to better predict incoming sensations [20]. In particular, Hohwy–Michael
suggestthatpeople“perceiveandmaintaintheirselfhoodbyaninternalmodelof
hierarchical endogenous (hidden) causes”, wherein higher-level causes like goals
and traits generate predictionsthat shapeperception andaction. Itfollowsthat
identityisembodiedinthebrain’sgenerativemodelandiscontinuouslyupdated
by maximising model evidence and minimising prediction error, a process one
might call self-evidencing.
As discussed, maintaining an identity requires not just change but also a de-
greeofstabilityofcorefeatures,offeringaconundrum.Toself-evidence,anagent
learnsandconstantlyadjustsagenerativemodeloftheworldandofitself,using
sensory evidence to correct discrepancies. The brain expends informational and
energetic resources to keep its self-model aligned with reality—revising beliefs
or deploying actions when mismatches (prediction errors) arise. This continual
updating is the computational essence of self-reconfiguration. The self-model is
never static, because new experiences demand incorporation.
One way to resolve this tension is to view an agent as balancing accuracy
(updating to fit data) with precision or confidence in prior beliefs, as is done
in active inference [14,33]. Some self-model predictions—e.g. deeply held traits
or values—are high-precision priors that resist change, providing continuity of
identity.Thisbalanceisevidentinpsychology:peopleseektopreserveacoherent
self-conceptinthefaceofdiscrepantinformation(themotiveforself-consistency
or self-verification) even as they update other aspects of themselves over time
[34]. For example, individuals continuously gather self-relevant information to
build an inner ‘self-theory’, updating beliefs about themselves with feedback
from social and personal experiences. Over time, as a more stable self-concept
is consolidated, people begin to give greater weight to maintaining existing self-
beliefs, “at the expense of continuous updating”.
Altogether this implies that the “self” is not a static essence but a working
model, continually regenerated by the very organism it defines. To characterise
the malleability of certain aspects of identity and the rigidity of certain other
ones, we will frame it in terms of resilience. An identity (the organism’s self-
model) is sustained by ongoing self-production and error-correction—the same
processes that characterise resilience. Resilience generally refers to the capacity
ofasystemtowithstandshocksordisturbanceswithoutlosingitscorefunctions
or identity [18,33,42].
Resilience and adaptability in self-evidencing systems 3
Thetermresilienceispolysemous:itencompassesatleastthreecomplement-
ary aspects [2,33]. It denotes (i) inertia—resistance to change when disturbed,
(ii) elasticity—the ability to rebound or restore a prior state after a deviation,
and (iii) plasticity—the capacity to flexibly reorganize or find new stable states
when conditions change. All three aspects describe processes rather than static
traits. Resilience is not simple a fixed quantity one has a certain amount of; it
is something one does, dynamically, over time.
The link between identity processes and resilience becomes apparent when
we consider what is maintaining or recovering in each case. In the face of life’s
perturbations—beittrauma,loss,illness,orrapidchange—itisoftenone’ssense

guish the more resilient phenotypes, allowing agents to anticipate and integrate
surprises without being overwhelmed. A resilient individual manages to hold
onto an integrated self-concept (core values, sense of meaning, self-esteem) or
to reconstruct a new one, such that they continue to function and grow. This
points to multiple scales of the self, akin to Russian dolls with varying degrees
of malleability—or rates of change.
Identity has been linked in different ways to resilience. the concepts have

outcomes. For instance, people who have more complex identities—i.e. who see
themselves in terms of multiple distinct roles or attributes—tend to be more
resilienttostressandnegativeevents[4,49].Ifonefacetoftheselfisthreatened,
a person with many facets can draw strength and continue to find self-worth in
other aspects, preventing a total collapse of self-regard. This flexibility in self-
concept, a form of adaptive reconfiguration of identity, is a protective factor.
Similarly, having a coherent but adaptable narrative identity (a life story that
makes meaning of difficulties) is associated with resilience [17,25]. Individuals
whocan‘re-story’theirlivesaftertrauma,incorporatingtheadversityintotheir
identity as a survivor or as someone who has grown, often show better recovery
andevenpost-traumaticgrowth[32].Conversely,abrittleandrigididentitywill
lead an individual to not be able to recover from any major disruption.
Ultimately, it is the degree of continuity of identity which is paramount.
Breakwell(2021)introducedthenotionofidentityresiliencewithinidentitypro-
cess theory, defining it as “a relatively stable self-schema based on self-esteem,
self-efficacy, positive distinctiveness and continuity” that helps one cope with
threat [3]. In this sense, resilience can be seen as the successful management of
identitythreats:maintainingcoreidentityintegritywhilstadaptingaspectsthat
need to change.
Given the above, we can argue that the process of identity formation and
reconfiguration is inherently a resilience process.
In that context, a resilient response corrects a disturbance or accommodates
it by updating the self-model. This corresponds to elasticity and plasticity, with
resilient elasticity being an agent’s natural return to its characteristic states
(e.g. attractors) after a shock, and resilient plasticity being the possession of

being, or allowing flexible reorganisation.
Resilience-as-inertia, meanwhile, corresponds to holding very high-precision
beliefs that prevent change. In active inference, an agent with very precise self-

concept of an enactive niche, the physical and social environment an individual
helps shape around themselves [19]. An agent might proactively seek supportive
relationships and stable routines (shaping their niche) to buffer against future
stressors, preserving their identity and well-being. The agent infers states of the
world and selects actions that keep them within a regulated zone, and those
actions simultaneously alter the environment in their favour.

inahigh-dimensionalstatespace.Overtime,asthesystemgoesthroughtypical
experiences, their state traces out a trajectory—essentially their equilibrium
or habitual behaviour. Resilience relates to what happens when the system is
pushed off this usual trajectory.
Certain configurations of the self may be stable attractors (basins of attrac-
tion) representing a well-integrated identity or mode of functioning. Perturb-
ations might nudge the system within the basin (from which it can return to
the attractor, recovery) or, if strong enough, knock the system into a different
basin (a qualitative shift in identity or functioning). This is analogous to how
ecosystems have multiple stable states; resilience is the difficulty of tipping the
ecosystem into an alternate state.

ates a flatter landscape with multiple smaller attractors, allowing movement to
new states. We will focus on the high-precision case first.
2.1 Inertia
We will begin by supposing we have a (uniformly Lipschitz continuous) time-
varying vector field V and a random variable satisfying

ence; the same story we will tell can be told for state-dependent noise, but it is
considerably more complicated. Let |Γ|=detΓ >0. By a theorem of Friedlin–

Suppose p(X ) is the Bayesian belief of an agent about its own states. Then
t
|Γ|−1 is the precision of that belief. When |Γ|−1 increases, the probability of
large fluctuations away from xˆ decays exponentially. That is to say, as |Γ|−1

vanishes, in which case it is e−∞·0 = 1. Another way to see this is as follows.
As |Γ|−1 → ∞, we have |Γ| → 0, giving us a zero-noise limit. Then from (1) it
is immediate that the system does not fluctuate away from the expected path.
Since it is highly probable for the system to evolve near xˆ when precision is
t
high, it becomes a path-wise attractor. If the paths around the expected path
are all orbits through the same region of the state-space, it moreover becomes
an attractor in the state-space. As such, resilience in the inertial sense is high
self-precision.
Following [13,46] we will now articulate how this connects to the free energy
principle. First we will rehearse the FEP according to those references.
Let L be the log-probability. Suppose the system is coupled to some other
system, such as an environment. The free energy principle begins from the ob-
servation that the KL divergence
(cid:90) (cid:90)
F(µ ,b ):= q(η ;σ(µ ))logq(η ;σ(µ ))dη − q(η ;σ(µ ))logp(η ,b ,µ )dη

decomposes as

saturating at the modal path, or the expected path under the Laplace assump-
tion. A Taylor expansion arguments allows us to conclude
∇ L(µ ,b )=0 ⇐⇒ ∇ F(µ ,b )=0. (3)

Nowwehavelicencetoclaimthatthemodalpathencodesavariationalinference
about the environment: it is the state for which the Lagrangian is minimised,
and hence, the parameter of the posterior distribution over external states for
which the variational free energy is minimised.

if a system is on an attractor then it looks as if it is minimising a variational

can be modelled using whatever dynamical system is induced by approximate
Bayesian inference (regarded as a law of motion) [43, §2]. The fact that this
statementhasadirectioniscrucial:weassumeitisa‘thing’attheoutset.Once
we have a thing, the FEP is a highly general method of modelling ‘things’ and
describing why they are things (in particular, the things that they are).
Now we will connect this to our argument. By (2), we have the surprisal or
rate function

−logp (µ )= |µ˙ −V(µ ,s)|2ds+o .
|Γ| t |Γ| s s |Γ|

Minimising variational free energy also minimises this quantity by (3). Con-
sequently it increases precision.
We see that as beliefs about the environment become better approximations
of the distribution over environmental states, highly precise self-beliefs are af-
forded to the system, enabling it to remain close to characteristic trajectories
through state space. In the other direction, having highly precise self-beliefs de-
mands an accurate world model: if variational free energy cannot be minimised,
then neither can the surprisal, and the system will drift from its characteristic
trajectory.
This has a dual viewpoint under the principle of maximum entropy [45].
A constraint imposes acceptability or unacceptability on different states of the
system. It may imply the existence of a target morphology, or some desired
formdrivenbyafunction—somethingwemaycallaphenotype.Thisultimately
coincides with what we have called an identity [26].
2.2 Plasticity
The previous section assumed the system was capable of forming a sufficiently
good model of the environment to minimise D . Recall that if variational free
KL
energy cannot be minimised, then neither can the surprisal, and the system will
drift from its characteristic trajectory. As such, it must designate new traject-
ories as acceptable—its identity must be plastic. The notion of plasticity was
introduced to describe systems that are able to grow and change their charac-
teristic trajectory.
We will now work state-wise. Let us make the Laplace assumption such that
toeverypossibleposterioroverenvironmentalstatesthereisauniqueassociated
(mode, variance) pair. Suppose the statistics of the environment change. From
(3) it follows that a new mode must be chosen by the system. It is possible for
8 M Albarracin and D A R Sakthivadivel
a system to adjust the statistics of the environment to bring the corresponding
internalmodeclosertoapreference,butitisnotalwayspossibletoexactlymeet
those preferences.
Changing modes Recall that the mode is actually the conditionally expec-
ted mode given the blanket state. In effect, there is an entire suite of modes,
each a local minimum of the rate function on the joint state space offering
its own phase. Said differently, these modes offer different attractors or meta-
stable states. When the magnitude of a perturbation is too large, it may kick
the system off of one attractor and it may be caught in the well of another.
Whether one or another mode is acceptable depends on the statistics of the en-
vironment,sowehavedifferentphenotypesindifferentenvironmentalparameter
regimes, with the choice of mode determined by some control parameter—here,
the blanket state. If we have a bidirectional coupling of the agent to its blanket,
e.g. dµ =V(µ ,b ,t)dt+Γ dW , then the mode of the internal states is also a

functionoftheexternalstateviaσ,andevolvesalongatrajectorygoingbetween
such metastable states. (Note the internal states cannot see the external states
directly, and any effect the environment has on the agent is mediated by the
blanket.)
A physical example of the situation we have in mind is that of a phase
transition.Inaphasetransition,thesameHamiltoniancharacterisesamaterial,
but the typical dynamics are very different depending on the value of some
control parameter, and there is a sharp discontinuity between different phases.
A simple model thereof is the Ising model on a lattice Λ coupled to a heat

physical interface between the material and the environment, and the heat bath
with temperature T between the system and whatever environmental dynamics
are taking place. Importantly, the heat bath is in contact with the material but
shrouds the environment from it, serving as a Markov blanket.
Assume there is some unknown but non-decreasing transfer function relat-
ing the environment to the heat bath. As the temperature of the environment
increases, the temperature of the heat bath also increases. Now the mode of the
system (its expected internal state) depends on T. The mode is the well-known
magnetisation function m(T). The mode encodes a posterior in the sense that
if the heat bath is hot then the environment likely does not contain any heat
sinks,andlikelycontainsheatsources,oratleastisinequilibriumwiththeheat
bath.
Though beyond the scope of this paper, it is interesting to note that large
deviations interact with metastability and phase transitions, following general
principles laid out in [36].

different attractors and introducing local minima is decreasing the curvature of
the free energy functional. By a Taylor expansion argument, the curvature of
the free energy—the matrix of second derivatives of the KL divergence in the
parameters—is the Fisher information.

cision(seee.g.[16]foralengthierdiscussion),sothathigherprecisionmakesfor

tions where the distribution has low variance—large eigenvalues of the precision
matrix—provide more information for parameter estimation, whilst directions
with high variance—small eigenvalues of the precision matrix—provide less in-
formation. By flattening the free energy landscape, the system is not offered
strong information from parameters and hence has little preference for what

Weclaimthatanadaptivesystemwillfindmoreeffectivewaystoself-organise
when the free energy landscape is flatter. To justify this, note that the heat
dissipated is (see [38,47] for extended derivations)

where ∆ is the sum of unmixed second partials, or in other words, the trace of
the Hessian matrix.
If every change in µ is a new possible parameter, then the ∆F(µ,b) term
is the Fisher information. Since the trace of a square matrix is the sum of its
eigenvalues, the heat dissipated is proportional to the negative precision. It fol-
lows that low precision dissipates a larger amount of heat than high precision,
suggestingthatwhenthecurvatureissmall,self-organisationcanbemademore

3 A model of complex adaptive processes
To recap, there are (so far) two different notions of resilience that have been
explored. In [33] these phenomena were distinguished as inertia and plasticity—
theabilitytoresistchange,andtheabilitytorespondtochange,respectively.In
the previous subsection we discussed how a threshold for damage distinguishes
betweentheseformsofresilience,inthesenseofthecontinuityanddiscontinuity
of changes in configuration. There is something within active inference that
makes a stone rigid and tough, and something that makes a human vulnerable
but flexible. The task of this section is to find it.
Oneconjectureisthatthisthresholdisanemergenteffectofthedistributed,

damageamongstmanylowerlevelprocessestoprotectahigher-levelprocesslike
consciousness. Its identity is not stored in the configuration of a single level of
resolution. For example, a human being bleeds from many different capillaries
or arteries rather than a single heart. Contrast this with a cell, which has no
such highways and when punctured dies immediately; or a honeybee, which
has no blood vessels at all, and delivers oxygenated blood around its body by
diffusion.(Notethatthistacitlyassumeshierarchyimpliesmodularity.)Asimilar
argument is made in [44] and is used in [33].
To that end we will discuss a hierarchical free-energy minimising system.
Consider a system with a suite of m internal states µ:={µ ,...,µ }, k active

and p sensory states {a ,...,a ,s ,...,s } (for a total of k+p blanket states),

In our situation we have a redundancy in the parametrisation: some fraction of

is a human brain, where many more sensory neurones exist than environmental
features.
Similarly, suppose the internal states are grouped into v clusters, denoted
C := {C ,...,C }, each of which has a mode given by the most likely state
1 v
within the cluster. Suppose the mode of the cluster also parametrises some free
energy functional over environmental states. This may be over coarse-grained
features of the environment, or may simply be a cluster of repeated represent-
ations of the same feature. We will denote these external states as η˜. We will
also assume there is a corresponding possible difference in the blanket states of
interest,˜b.
Let the empirical mean of a cluster of h states C be
h
Cˆ = 1 (cid:88) µ

and (under the Laplace assumption) let Cˆ parameterise a distribution over η˜by
D (q(η˜;σ˜(C),p(η˜|˜b))+L(C,˜b).
KL
All of our previous reasoning applies, so that the optimal state of the cluster is
E[C].
Resilience and adaptability in self-evidencing systems 11
The probability of the sample mean of h iid normally distributed random
variables deviating from E[C] by ε can be estimated as
P(Cˆ−E[C]⩾hε)⩽e−hε2
meaning that as h grows large, Cˆ is exponentially likely to get closer and closer
to E[C]. Conceptually, as we have more and more states in the cluster, losing
a state makes less of an impact on how far the average of the cluster is to the
optimalparameter.Thatistosay:ifsomestatesarelostbuttherearesufficiently
many states, the mode of the cluster does not change a large amount. As such,
the higher level processes remain intact.
Though an adequate first idea, a more sophisticated argument would use
therelationshipbetweenmetastabilityandmultiscalelargedeviationsestimates
[8,27] to expand this framework. We leave this to future work.
4 Closing remarks and a discussion of psychology
We hope the framework sketched in this paper will provide more effective ways
ofmodellingnotonlyadaptivesystemsinphysicsbutalsothehumanbrainand
emotions. Like the discussion here, classic and contemporary psychology frames
identity as an ongoing, adaptive process rather than a fixed entity. Symbolic
interactionist theories (e.g. Mead’s and Cooley’s ideas of the self) emphasize
that identity forms through social feedback and iterative self-reflection [5,31].
A striking formalization comes from identity control theory in sociology, which
modelseachidentity(e.g.roleorgroupidentity)asahomeostaticfeedbackloop
[7,23,48].Anidentityincludesamentalstandard(themeaningsandexpectations
ofbeinge.g.“agoodparent”or“aproudstudent”),andindividualscontinuously
compare their perceived behaviour or feedback (input) to this internal standard
(comparator) [41,50], which is ultimately a form of sociometry [1].
If a discrepancy (error) is detected—say, others’ reactions suggest one is not
meeting the identity standard—the individual will adjust either their behaviour
or their identity perceptions to reduce the error. In effect, each identity acts as
a control system. It is meant to control internal and external perceptions by
making them congruent with the meanings of its identity standard. In this way,
any error is minimized. Identity is enacted and tuned in real time as situations
change. The individual’s self-model (their identity standard and current self-
perception) is thus iteratively revised to better match experience, or conversely,
they act on the world to make experience match their identity [35,52].
Identities can reorganize over longer timescales through processes like devel-
opmental crises or narrative reframing [6,22]. Erikson’s classic stages of iden-
tity formation and modern notions of narrative identity both see identity as an
evolving story, continuously edited to make sense of new chapters of life [11,30].
Forinstance,Epstein’scognitive-experientialselftheorypositsthatpeoplegradu-
ally construct a self-schema from life experiences, which serves as a working
theory of who they are [10].
12 M Albarracin and D A R Sakthivadivel
Earlyinlifethisschemaishighlymalleable—youngpeopleupdatetheirself-
concept rapidly with new feedback—but as it stabilizes, they increasingly strive
to maintain coherence, sometimes by filtering or reinterpreting discrepant in-
formation rather than altering the self [34]. Consequently, a healthy identity
involvesbothchangeandconsistency,akintoashipthatadjustscourseinchan-
gingseaswhilekeepingasteadydirection.Thisdynamicisfacilitatedbycognit-
ive capacities (memory, reflection) and informational resources (feedback from
relationships, culture) that allow the person to revise their self-narrative when
needed. It also has an energetic aspect: adapting one’s identity—for instance,
during acculturation or personal transformation—can be effortful and emotion-
allytaxing,indicatingthatresilienceofidentitymaydependonhavingadequate
emotional and cognitive energy to accommodate change.
All of these observations suggest a place for resilience in the free energy
principle—and more crucially, a reading of the free energy principle where resi-
lience is a key concept underwriting self-assembly and self-organisation.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Resilience and adaptability in self-evidencing systems"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
