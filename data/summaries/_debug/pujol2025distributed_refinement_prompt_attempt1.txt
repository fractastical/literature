### OverviewThis paper investigates the application of Active Inference (AIF) for distributed intelligence within the Computing Continuum (CC). The authors present a novel approach to managing service needs across a distributed system, leveraging AIF agents to autonomously adapt and optimize performance. The core idea is to model each service as an AIF agent, enabling it to continuously monitor its state, infer its environment, and take actions to fulfill its objectives. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of this approach through simulations and experiments, highlighting the benefits of AIF in terms of adaptability, resilience, and efficiency.### MethodologyThe authors propose a framework based on Active Inference (AIF) to manage distributed services within the Computing Continuum (CC). The core of this framework consists of AIF agents, which are modeled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). These agents continuously evaluate their state, and select actions to fulfill service objectives. The key elements of this framework are:The authors define the state space of each service as a set of variables, including but not limited to: FPS, Resolution, and W-consumption. These variables are used to represent the state of the service and are continuously monitored by the AIF agent. The AIF agent uses these observations to infer the state of its environment and to select actions that will optimize its performance.The AIF agents use a POMDP to model their environment. The POMDP defines the transition probabilities between states, as well as the observation probabilities. The transition probabilities are defined by the authors, and are based on their understanding of the CC. The observation probabilities are defined by the authors, and are based on their understanding of the sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the services.The AIF agents use a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for each service.

ABSTRACT
TheComputingContinuum(CC)isanemergingInternet-basedcomputingparadigmthatspansfrom
localInternetofThings(IoT)sensorsandconstrainededgedevicestolarge-scaleclouddatacenters.
Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support
the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and
dynamicnatureofCCplatformsdemandsdistributedintelligenceforadaptiveandresilientservice
management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case,
where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to
fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives
that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider
the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and
deployedalongsidedistributedservicestomanagethemautonomously. Ourexperimentsshowthat
AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around
80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-
agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar
results,MARLrequiresextensivetraining,whereasAIFagentscanoperateeffectivelyfromthestart.
Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong
capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in
CCplatforms.

1 Introduction
The next generation of Internet-based applications is poised to change how we live as a society: Au-
tonomous driving will revolutionize urban transportation, demanding ultra-low latency to enable real-time decision-
making [Linetal.(2018)]. E-Health applications will allow for remote and detailed patient care, but will also re-
quire local data processing to protect patient privacy [Makinaetal.(2024)]. Fleets of robots will autonomously
clean and maintain city streets, ensuring efficient urban management [Zahidietal.(2024)]. Resource usage, such
as electricity and water [Shahraetal.(2024)], will be optimized through advanced distribution systems, and AR/VR
technologies will reshape how we interact with people and objects, necessitating rapid processing of large data
streams [Sukhmanietal.(2019)]. All these applications share the need for near-real-time computations while pro-
cessinglargeamountsofdata,whichtheCloudalonecannotprovideduetotransmissionlatency[Huetal.(2020)].
The Computing Continuum (CC) is considered by the community as the emerging platform with the potential ca-
pabilities to bring the required performance to these new applications [Beckmanetal.(2020), Dustdaretal.(2023),

networking units, data modalities, system providers, and the variety of services within applications. Device hetero-
geneity, for example, hinders centralized auto-scalers because adaptations must be tailored to each device’s capac-
ityandcharacteristics[Zhangetal.(2019)]. Similarly, managingmultiplesystemprovidersrequiresagreementsand

As a unified computing fabric that integrates all current computational tiers (i.e., IoT, Edge, Fog, and Cloud),
the CC paradigm holds great potential to meet application requirements by harnessing the strengths of each
tier [Beckmanetal.(2020)]. The CC achieves this by placing the services’ elasticity strategies directly where they
are most needed, i.e., where services execute. Elasticity strategies refer to the ability of software services to adjust
theirconfigurationinresponsetochangingconditionstomaintainperformance[Fu¨rstetal.(2018)]. InCloudenviron-
ments,acommonelasticitystrategyisscalingthenumberofservicereplicas. IntheComputingContinuum,however,
strategies like offloading services to other devices or adapting the quality of data for processing are more common
and effective [ManaouilandLebre(2020)]. Local adaptation of services becomes essential to ensure the necessary

In this section, we discuss the three concepts that are fundamental to the contributions made in this paper. First,
we present SLOiDs as prevalent mechanisms for ensuring high-level service requirements. To ensure SLOiDs, we

In more detail, we introduce how these AIF-driven decision-making processes are modeled and optimized during
runtimeusingPOMDPs.
2.1 ServiceLevelObjectivesinDevices–SLOiDs
InCloudcomputing,thepromisedservicequalitybetweeninfrastructureproviderandapplicationdeveloperisspec-
ified within a Service Level Agreement (SLA). There, both entities agree on specific service-related measurements
(ServiceLevelIndicators-SLIs)thatmustbehaveinaspecifiedmanner(ServiceLevelObjectives-SLOs),e.g.,the
CPU utilization of a computing node must stay under 80% [Beltran(2016)]. Then, the number of good events, e.g.,
number of measurements where the CPU stayed under 80%, is divided by the number of valid events, e.g., num-
ber of measurements considered, for a determined period of time [Beyeretal.(2016)]. For a Cloud business model,
thisvalueprovidesanotionofreliabilityoftheservice,whichisusedtodefinepenalties(e.g.,monetarycompensa-
tions)fortheinfrastructureproviderincaseSLOsareviolated. Indeed,theinfrastructureproviderwilluseelasticity
strategies, e.g., scaling system resources up, when the SLO is not being fulfilled to reestablish the system’s desired
behavior[Dustdaretal.(2011)].

ApplicationsdistributedovertheCCposeavarietyofrequirements(e.g.,latencyand/orquality)thatdefinehoweach
deviceandcomponentshouldoperate. However,contrarilytotraditionalCloudcomputing,enforcingSLOsintheCC
requires orchestration over numerous heterogeneous devices [Nardellietal.(2024)]. To capture the complexity this
adds,weextendtheSLOdefinitionandcallthemServiceLevelObjectivesinDevices. Inthatregard,thekeyaspects
thatcharacterizeSLOiDs,alsoinrelationtoregularSLOs,areasfollows:
• Hardware heterogeneity directly dictates SLOiDs feasibility. Unlike the abstracted and relatively homoge-
neousresources intraditionalCloud environments, theCCis characterizedbyhardware diversity. SLOiDs
cannotbepracticallydefinedwithoutconsideringthespecificcapabilitiesandlimitations(e.g.,CPUpower,
memoryavailability,energyconstraints,networkbandwidth)ofthetargetdeploymentdevices. Forinstance,
a latency SLO (e.g., response time below 50ms) achievable on a powerful Edge server is impracticable on
aresource-constrainedIoTsensor. Therefore, SLOiDsmustbetailoredtospecificdeviceclasses. Ignoring
this leads to perpetually unachievable objectives on lower-end devices or over-provisioning on higher-end
devices.
• ScarceresourcesnecessitatedecentralizedSLOiDsevaluation. Thelimitedprocessingpower,memory,and

deviceswouldoverwhelmboththedevicesthemselves(consumingscarceresources)andthenetwork(caus-

device or at a nearby edge node. This hardware-imposed limitation forces SLOiDs definitions to rely on
metrics that can be efficiently computed and evaluated locally, potentially sacrificing global consistency or

• ConstrainedhardwarenecessitatesincorporatingSLOiDselasticitytrade-offs. OnmanyCCdevices,particu-

ploymentrealities. Toensureserviceobjectives,elasticitymustinvolveadjustmentsinquality(e.g.,reducing
data fidelity, frame rate) or performance (e.g., accepting higher latency). Therefore, SLOiDs and elasticity

In the context of this work, fulfilling SLOiDs maintains the system in homeostasis, or equilib-
rium [Sedlaketal.(2024a)], as we called it in previous works. This is a preferred steady state that spans across

To handle such intricacies, we often employ a factored representation. In this approach, the overall state space S is
defined as the Cartesian product of multiple state factors or modalities: S = S ×S ×...S . Thus, a specific
1 2 N
state s is defined as tuple s = (s ,s ,...,s ), where each element s represents the value of the i-th factor (e.g.,
1 2 N i
resource level, computation complexity) within its respective domain S . This factored structure naturally leads to

manage this complexity, we utilize the factored nature of the state space to represent the transition dynamics B in a

2.3 ActiveInference–AIF
AIF is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), that describes how agents resolve uncertainty in their un-
derstanding of the world by minimizing their variational free energy [Parretal.(2022)]. More generally, the FEP
applies to all kinds of adaptive agents that learn accurate world models, also called generative models, because
they allow agents to understand and interpret observations generated by unobservable latent variables. Hence,
agents are able to minimize the discrepancies between their generative model and the actual generative pro-
cess that governs the environment [Friston(2013)]. To minimize their free energy, agents take epistemic actions
that allow them to resolve uncertainty, but they also change the environment to move it into a state that ful-
fills its internal preferences, achieving homeostasis. This describes the exploration-exploitation tradeoff inherent

to agent-based systems. For more details about the FEP, the interested reader can check the following references
[Fristonetal.(2016),Kirchhoffetal.(2018),Fristonetal.(2009),Fristonetal.(2024b)].
In AIF, agents compute the expected free energy (EFE) for different policies (π), which are sequences of actions
consideredovervariousplanninghorizons. ThisallowsagentstosimulatetheirplanbycomputingtheEFEforeach

4 Methodology
In this article, we demonstrate how intelligence can be distributed across CC services by modeling agents using
AIF, enabling them to manage services autonomously and collaboratively, an essential capability for decentralized
application management in the CC. Now, we formally define the AIF agents as POMDPs, describe the tools and
simulationsetup,andconcludewithadescriptionoftheexperiments.

Preferred Ouctomes (C) In this work, we consider the Producer to have no preferences over the FPS and Res-
olution sets. The preferred outcomes of the requests from the Worker and the Consumer are to receive a Stay,
meaning their configuration requests are satisfied. More in detail, the vectors are initially defined as follows:
CWF = {0.25,1.5,0.25}; CCF = {0.5,3.0,0.5}; and CCR = {0.5,3.0,0.5}. It is worth mentioning that the re-
quests from the Consumer have a higher maximum value than the ones of the Worker, to indicate the ultimate goal
is achieving satisfaction at the end of the pipeline, and considering that the Worker might have other capabilities to
satisfyitsgoals.

4.1.2 Worker’sPOMDPmodel
State modalities (S) The Worker has six state (S) modalities. Two of them are SLOiDs: Latency and W-
consumption, as in Table 1. The others are state variables: Execution Time, FPS, Share Information, and GPU,
all can be seen in Figure 4. Each modality can take specific values based on the system’s behavior. Latency is a
booleanmodality: ittakesthevalueTruewhenthecomputationiscompletedwithinthedeadline,andFalsewhenthe
computation exceeds the deadline. Execution Time is a categorical modality representing the time required to com-
plete the computational task. It can take the values {LOW, MID-LOW, MID, MID-HIGH, HIGH}, corresponding to
thefollowingdurationsinmilliseconds: (0, 15],(15, 30],(30, 45],(45, 60], and(60, ∞). TheFPSstatemodality
is defined as for the Producer. W-consumption is a state modality that reflects the energy consumption of the de-
vice,consideringGPUusageandtheactivationoftheupstreamcommunicationchannel. ThelevelsareLOW,MID,
and HIGH, corresponding to an overall consumption below 7W, between 7–8W, and above 8W, respectively. Share

4.1.3 Consumer’sPOMDPmodel
State modalities (S) The Consumer’s state (S) consists of six modalities. Three of them are SLOiDs: Success,
Smoothness, and C-consumption, as in Table 1. The other three are system variables: FPS, Resolution, and Share
Information, as can be seen in Figure 5. Each modality can take specific values based on the system’s behavior.
Success is a boolean modality: it takes the value True if the service has properly applied the privacy filter, and
False otherwise. Smoothness is a categorical state modality representing the distance shift of a pixel between two
consecutiveframes. Itcantakethevalues(SHORT,MID-SHORT,MID,MID-LONG,LONG),whichcorrespondtoa

theactivationofupstreamcommunication. BoththeFPSandtheResolutionstatemodalitiesaredefinedsimilarlyto

Further,thedatasetwasgeneratedbyindependentlyadjustingkeysystemparameters—imageresolution,videoframe
rate, and GPU status— providing an independent set of behaviors for each parameter combination. This makes the
dataset particularly well-suited for our simulation experiments, as it allows us to model independent behaviors and
interactionsbetweenvariables.
The dataset is used to simulate different operational scenarios for the pipeline, helping to validate the performance
of the active inference agents under varying conditions. Since the dataset missed few combinations of resolution
and FPS, some missing FPS values were approximated. Specifically, the missing FPS values were interpolated by
averagingtheneighboringvalues. Thestandarddeviationoftheseneighboringvalueswasalsoconsideredtoensurea
realisticapproximationofthemissingdata.

results from the previous experiment (Figure 6), we observe that all agents stabilize their SLOiD fulfillment rates
also around the 50 time steps. The overall fulfillment rate of the agents is lower than in the previous case. This
indicates increased difficulty in finding performance-maximizing policies when the model is unknown and must be

5.3 Comparisontomulti-agentreinforcementlearning(MARL)
The same three agents were implemented within a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using
RLlib[Liangetal.(2018),Wuetal.(2021)]andthePPOalgorithm[Schulmanetal.(2017)]. ConsistentwiththeAIF
experiments, we did not fine-tune any parameters, allowing us to assess each method’s general capabilities in this
scenario. We consider two distinct training regimes: minimal (400,000 time steps) and extensive (40 million time
steps),mirroringtheexplorationoftwoscenarioswiththeAIFagents. Evaluationisperformedover200timesteps.

correspondtoagentstrainedundertheminimaltrainingregime. Inthiscase,theirperformanceisclearlylowerthan
that of the AIF agents. The Producer agent fails to stabilize consumer satisfaction with resolution, and the Worker

cleardegradationintheW-consumptionSLOiDforbothWorkeragents.Thisdegradationismorepronouncedforthe

whichcanbeattributedtoitssuperioradaptability. Furthermore, Figure9bpresentstheexpectedfreeenergy(EFE)

However, the EFE suddenly increases due to the environmental change, after which the agent successfully resumes
its EFE reduction. In contrast, Figure 9d depicts the EFE for the AIF Worker non-learning agent. This agent also
experiences a change in its EFE, primarily characterized by a substantial reduction in its variance. This suggests a
narrowedrangeofpossibleactionsfortheagentfollowingtheoffloadingprocess.

tolearnthetransitionswithapolicylengthof1, agentsachievedfulfillmentratescomparabletothosewithapolicy
lengthof3,seeFigure10. Surprisingly,theProducer agentfulfillmentrate(Figure10b)wasconsistentlyhigherfor
length-1 policies than for length-3, which was unexpected. This result may stem from the relatively small number
of repetitions (10) and the stochastic nature of the environment, where identical actions in the same state can yield
different outcomes. Additionally, most agent actions are boolean, and the environment exhibits limited temporal
dependencies. Asareminder,environmentalresponsesarebasedontheagent’sactioninthepreviousstate,andnew
states are sampled to fulfill constraints without necessarily maintaining temporal continuity. Consequently, in this

6 Discussion
The results indicate that AIF agents effectively support distributed intelligence in the CC, enabling interdependent
servicestocollaboratewhilemaintainingconsistentperformance,quality,andcost. Thisworkrepresentsafirststep
towardrealizingthatvision.Inwhatfollows,weexaminethegapbetweenourcurrentimplementationandthebroader
potential of intelligence distribution using AIF in the CC. We organize the discussion into design-time and runtime
considerations,whileacknowledgingthatseveralaspectsspanboth.
6.1 Design
6.1.1 AIFAgentModel
This work introduces an AIF agent model for supervising services based on predefined SLOiDs. Defining these
SLOiDs is critical to ensure service compliance with performance expectations in its execution environment. This
taskissimplerwhenpriordeploymentknowledgeexists;otherwise,changesinhostdevicescancompromiseSLOiDs
fulfillmentduetomismatchedassumptions.
Modeling the AIF agent requires identifying dependencies between SLOiD variables and system vari-
ables. These dependencies—especially those involving inter-service interactions may remain hidden with-
out cross-service analysis [CasamayorPujoletal.(2024)]. Causal discovery methods like those by Mariani et
al. [MarianiandZambonelli(2024)] offer potential support, although typically post-deployment. In this study, we
modeledservicedataasBayesianNetworks(BNs)andderivedMarkovBlanketsasaprerequisiteforbothlearnedand
predefinedtransitionmodels[Sedlaketal.(2024a)].
Once dependencies are identified, they must be quantified, leading to two key design choices: (i) whether to model
variablesasdiscreteorcontinuous,and(ii)howtoacquiretherelationshipparameters.
We chose discrete variables for computational tractability. This required determining variable granularity, num-
ber of classes and class thresholds, effectively coarse-graining the agent’s model and limiting behavioral resolu-
tion. Continuous modeling, while more expressive, demands richer data and assumptions on variable distribu-
tions[C¸ataletal.(2020)],andiscomputationallyintensive.
Regardingquantification,weexploredbothdeterministic(expert-based)andlearnedapproaches(seesubsections5.1
and5.2). Expert-basedmodelsarestablebutrigid,andincreasinglyinadequateassystemcomplexitygrows. Learned
modelsofferadaptabilityandautonomy,butincurhighcomputationalcostanddemandlongerconvergencetimes.
6.1.2 Deployment
Although our experiments relied on simulations, deploying AIF agents alongside services within a real CC infras-
tructureisessential. Thisrequirestightintegrationbetweenservicesandtheirsupervisoryagentstoenablereal-time
SLOiD adaptation or parameter adjustments. Such integration promotes a novel design paradigm in which services

tion.
6.2 Runtime
At runtime, a core challenge is the combinatorial explosion of state-action pairs. To mitigate this, we used binary
actions(e.g., Switchoff, Switchon), andoccasionallyaneutraloption(Stay), whichreducedcomplexitybutlimited
precision. This trade-off can hinder the agent’s ability to reach target states efficiently when fine-grained control is
needed.Theeffectworsenswithlongerpolicylengths,makingitcriticaltomatchactiongranularityandpolicyhorizon
totheenvironment’sdynamics.Weproposeaddressingthiswithhierarchicalaction-selection:AIFagentschoosehigh-
level actions, while a secondary controller handles precise execution [Pezzatoetal.(2020), ParrandFriston(2018),
Tschantzetal.(2022)]. Such hybrid strategies, as suggested in [Collisetal.(2024)], could improve adaptability and
efficiency.
Flexibility is also vital in dynamic settings. Services may adjust preferences based on context or stakeholders. AIF
agentsaccommodatethisviadirectupdatestoexpectedoutcomes(C),adaptingtoruntimegoals. Softwareupdates,
common in CC, may alter service behavior or capabilities. While minor behavior changes can be handled through
continual learning, new capabilities may obsolete the agent’s model. Detecting and adapting to such changes—or

7.1 AdaptiveMechanismsfortheComputingContinuum
The CC is an emerging paradigm that has only been developed and extended over the last recent years of
research [Dustdaretal.(2023)]; in particular, there remain multiple challenges in orchestrating such large-scale
systems [CasamayorPujoletal.(2023)], which require intelligent adaptation mechanisms. As such, Filinis et
al. [Filinisetal.(2024)] present an intelligent auto-scaling agent for the CC, which scales the replicas of serverless
functionsthataredeployedoveracontinuum. Closelyrelatedtothat,Zafeiropoulosetal.[Zafeiropoulosetal.(2024)]

7.2 DistributedIntelligencethroughActiveInference
While AIF as a concept has been developed and enhanced over recent years [Fristonetal.(2024a),
Fristonetal.(2023a)], its transition towards applications is still at a relatively early stage [Fristonetal.(2024b)].
Outside of neuroscience, AIF was mostly applied to robotics, as shown by the work of Lanillos et
al. [Lanillosetal.(2021)] and Oliver at al. [Oliveretal.(2022)], who use it as a framework for sensing and per-
ception. Inparticular,Oliveretal. giveacomprehensiveoverviewofhowAIFallows(robotic)systemstoactunder

8 Conclusions
Inthisarticle,weexploredtheuseofAIFtodistributeintelligenceacrossamulti-serviceapplicationwithintheCC.
Specifically, we focused on a video stream processing pipeline requiring face blurring before delivery to the final
consumer. ThiswasachievedbydeployinganAIFagentforeachserviceandequippingthemwithmechanismsfor

Our findings suggest that AIF is a promising approach for managing distributed applications in the CC. The AIF

In summary, this study demonstrates that Active Inference offers a powerful foundation for distributed intelligence
in the Computing Continuum. AIF agents can not only fulfill predefined service-level objectives but also adapt au-

A Producer’stransitionmodel
WF Modality The transition probabilities for the WF modality specify the distribution
P(WF |WF ,FPS ,Change FPS ). These probabilities depend on the current state of the modality (WF ),
t+1 t t t t
thecurrentFPSstate(FPS ),andtherelevantactioncomponent(Change FPS ). Fullyspecifyingthecorresponding
t t
Conditional Probability Table (CPT) explicitly would require defining a 3x3 transition matrix for each of the 5 FPS
values and 3 Change FPS values (15 matrices total). However, we define the CPT completely and more compactly
usingthefollowingrules:
1. IfChange FPS =Stay,thestateremainsunchanged: WF =WF .
t t+1 t
2. The state also remains unchanged if boundary conditions for FPS prevent the action’s effect: i.e., if
Change FPS =IncreaseandFPS isalreadythehighestvalue,orifChange FPS =DecreaseandFPS is
t t t t
alreadythelowestvalue.
3. IfChange FPS =Increase(andFPSisnotmaximum):
t
• IfWF =DecreaseorWF =Stay,thenWF =Decrease.
t t t+1
• IfWF =Increase,thenWF =Stay.
t t+1

4. IfChange FPS =Decrease(andFPSisnotminimum):
t
• IfWF =IncreaseorWF =Stay,thenWF =Increase.
t t t+1
• IfWF =Decrease,thenWF =Stay.
t t+1
Note that these rules simplify the dependency on the FPS state, using it only to check boundary conditions. The
precise dynamics might vary with specific hardware configurations in practice, but this expert model captures the
intendedbehaviour.
CF & CR Modalities The transition dynamics for CF are defined analogously, depending on itself at t,
FPS , and Change FPS . The dynamics for CR follow the same pattern but depend on CR , Resolution , and
t t t t
Change Resolution .

FPS & Resolution Modailities The transitions for the FPS and Resolution modalities them-
selves are fully deterministic. These dynamics are defined by P(FPS |FPS ,Change FPS ) and
t+1 t t
P(Resolution |Resolution ,Change Resolution ), respectively. Their dependencies are shown in Figure 3,
