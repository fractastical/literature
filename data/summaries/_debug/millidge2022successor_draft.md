### OverviewThis paper investigates the successor representation (SR) as an active inference agent, offering a model-free approach to reinforcement learning. The authors argue that the SR, which expresses the value function in terms of a successor matrix of expected future state occupancies, provides a significant advantage over traditional active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost. The research demonstrates the SR’s ability to generalize to changing reward functions and highlights its potential for dynamic trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.### MethodologyThe authors derive the probabilistic interpretation of the SR in terms of Bayesian filtering, designing a novel active inference agent utilizing successor representations instead of model-based planning. They establish a duality between control and inference, similar to Todorov (2008,2009), wherein the optimal control problem can be cast as a Bayesian filtering problem. Specifically, the SR is defined as the successor matrix, which represents the discounted sum of expected state transitions. The authors state: "The successor representation provides an alternative way to estimate the value function." They note: "Instead of estimating the value function directly, the SR estimates the successor matrix." The authors further argue that the SR can be computed analytically at initialization, without the need for exhaustive future simulations. The authors state: "The key advantage of the SR is that it allows us to compute the value function analytically at initialization." The SR is defined as the successor matrix, which represents the discounted sum of expected state transitions.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that active inference successor representations have significant advantages over current active inference agents intermsofplanninghorizonandcomputationalcost. Moreover, they demonstratehowthesuccessor representation agent can generalize to changing reward functions such as variants of the expected freeenergy. The authors state: "We show that SR-AIF has significant computational complexity benefits over standard AIF." They demonstrate that SR-AIF can be used to dynamically trade-off exploration and exploitation at runtime. The authors state: "The SR method can flexibly represent the value function of the EFE and can be used to dynamically trade-off exploration and exploitation at runtime." The authors show that SR-AIF can be used to dynamically trade-off exploration and exploitation at runtime.### DiscussionThe authors present a novel approach to active inference by leveraging the successor representation.
