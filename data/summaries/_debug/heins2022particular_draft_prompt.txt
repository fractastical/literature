Abstract
In this commentary, I expand on the analysis of the recent article "How particular
is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?" by Aguilera et al. by studying the flow
fields of linear diffusions, and particularly the rotation of their attracting sets in the
presence of different types of solenoidal coupling. This analysis sheds new light on
previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that
the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on
variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if
internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I express
general agreement with the target article’s statement that the marginal flow of internal
statesdoesnotpointalongvariationalfreeenergygradientsevaluatedatthemostlikely
internal state (i.e., the conditional mode). However, in this commentary I focus on the
flow of particular states (internal and blanket states) and their variational free energy
gradients, and show that for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the
average flow of these systems do indeed point along variational free energy gradients.
This licenses a different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular
states as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state
space, not just at the conditional modes.

1 Introduction
The target article, "How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle" [1], investi-
gates the Free Energy Principle (hereafter: FEP) in the context of linear diffusion processes,
i.e., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes [2, 3]. Using this class of systems as a testbed for the
FEP’s claims, the authors carefully deconstruct various assumptions and their consequences,
which they claim are made (implicitly or explicitly) in the existing FEP literature, specif-
ically in works such as [4–6]. In this commentary, I offer an additional perspective on the
claims of the target article regarding the marginal flows of the conditional modes [1, Sec-
tion 3.2], which afford the inferential interpretation of the FEP described in [4, 5]. Here I
study system-level flows by focusing on the average flow of so-called ‘particular states’, and
specifically analyze the conditions under which they license an inferential interpretation of
the FEP, particularly the case when particular states can be described as flowing along the
gradients of the variatonal free energy.

where ω ,ω ,ω are independent Wiener processes. Let us assume the existence of a steady-
η b µ
state distribution p such that b is a Markov blanket between external and internal states
η ⊥ µ | b ⇐⇒ p(µ,η|b) = p(µ|b)p(η|b).
Henceforth, the conditional modes refer to the most likely internal (respectively external)
states, conditioned on blanket states, assuming they exist [7]
µ(b) (cid:44) argmaxp(µ | b), η(b) (cid:44) argmaxp(η | b). (2)
The marginal flow of the system given a blanket state refers to the flow averaged over
external and internal states given blanket states [1, Equation 15]
µ˙(b) (cid:44) E [f (µ,b,η)], η˙(b) (cid:44) E [f (µ,b,η)]. (3)
p(η,µ|b) µ p(η,µ|b) η
The authors analyze the marginal flows of linear systems and contest what they claim is
a central tenet of the FEP: namely, that the marginal flows of internal states µ˙ point down
the gradients of the free energy F [1, Equation 22],
µ˙(b) ∝ −∇ F(µ(b),b), (4)
µ(b)
where the variational free energy F allows one to relate the dynamics of random systems
with approximate Bayesian inference in [4, 5].
Here I will expand on the target article’s discussion about the relationship between vari-
ational free energy gradients and the marginal flow of internal states µ˙(b) in linear systems,
2
offering a slightly different perspective in terms of particular states. Specifically, I use the
flows of particular states f (µ,b,η) to demonstrate the space of flows that operate on
µ,b
particular states — including, importantly, the flow at the conditional mode µ(b). This
analysis reveals a complex relationship between solenoidal flow, the particular flows and
the variational free energy gradients. This analysis also finds agreement with target arti-
cle’s overarching result that the dynamics of the conditional modes are not representative of
system-wide behaviour1.
However, these results also supplement the discussion about marginal flows, and suggest
that the relationship between solenoidal flows and the gradient flows of internal states is
more nuanced than either the target article or previous FEP literature suggests. I show
that the flow of particular states f (µ,b,η) under different external conditions is always
µ,b
pulled to a linear attracting set, but importantly, this attracting set is only aligned with
the line of conditional modes µ(b) in special cases. These cases depend on the nature of
solenoidal couplings. Thus, the flow of internal states (and thus the marginal flow) does not
generally point along variational free energy gradients, consistent with the demonstrations of
the target article [1]. I thus express general agreement with the target article in questioning
the generality of statements made in earlier FEP literature (e.g., [4, Equation 8.26] and [5,
Equation 3.3]).
However, the conditions under which internal states flow along free energy gradients
are also not as restrictive as the target article suggests. Indeed, I show in the context of
simple linear diffusions with a Markov blanket between internal and external states that
the presence of solenoidal couplings do not always misalign the attracting sets of particular
states with the line of the conditional mode µ(b). This implies that the flow of the particular
states (which crucially includes the internal states and their conditional mode) can still point
along variational free energy gradients even in the presence of solenoidal coupling. Indeed,
our results suggest that the attracting set of particular states is identical to the line of
the conditional modes for a large class of solenoidal couplings. For instance, I show that
solenoidal coupling between external and blanket states rotates the linear attracting set of
particular states relative to the line of the conditional modes, but in doing so also contracts
the effective volume of state space that particular states visit. This solenoidal coupling
helps particular states accelerate their flow towards (and maintain their proximity to) the
free energy minimum. This is in line with investigations into the importance of solenoidal
coupling in augmenting the speed of convergence of diffusions to their steady-state [8–11],
and hints at the importance of the ‘canonical’ or ‘normal’ form of the flow introduced in
previous FEP literature [4, 6, 12, 13].

where J is the Jacobian of the flow f in Equation (1). Assuming that the spectrum of
the Jacobian has negative real parts, we have the existence of a Gaussian (non-equilibrium)
steady-state p(x) = N(x;0,Π−1) with precision matrix Π [3]. Thus, the flow can be rewrit-
ten via the Helmholtz decomposition [7, Appendix B] as
Jx = −(Γ+Q)∇ lnp(x), (6)
x
into a dissipative, curl-free component Γ∇ lnp(x) and a conservative, divergence-free com-
x
ponent Q∇ lnp(x), where each component depends on the gradients of the stationary den-
x
sity p(x). The diffusion tensor Γ is a positive-definite matrix that determines the ampli-
tude and covariance of random fluctuations Γ (cid:44) E[ωω(cid:62)]/2. The skew-symmetric matrix
Q = −Q(cid:62) mediates conservative, rotational dynamics in the system’s flow.
I begin by analyzing linear systems that allow for non-zero solenoidal coupling between
internal and blanket states, and between blanket states and external states. As in the earlier
FEP literature [4–6, 12–14], and consistent with one of the ‘canonical flow constraints’ also
entertained in the target article and mentioned in a FEP literature [4, p. 12.11], I assume
there is no solenoidal coupling between internal and external states Q = −Q(cid:62) = 0. Given
ηµ µη
these constraints, one can parameterize the solenoidal matrix Q as follows
   
0 γ 0 0 Q 0
ηb
Q(γ,λ) = −γ 0 −λ = −Q
ηb
0 Q bµ. (7)
0 λ 0 0 −Q 0
bµ
Under this simple parameterisation, γ determines the strength of solenoidal coupling
betweenbandη, andλthestrengthofsolenoidalcouplingbetweenbandµ. Forallnumerical
demonstrations, I fix the inverse of the stationary covariance—also known as the precision
matrix Π—and the diffusion tensor Γ to the following values
   
2 1 0 2 0 0
Σ−1 (cid:44) Π = 1 2 1, Γ = 0 2 0. (8)
0 1 2 0 0 2
Note that Π = Π = 0 is equivalent to the existence of a Markov blanket between internal
µη ηµ
and external states [7, Equation 2.2] (note that this holds independently of solenoidal flow).
In the case of Gaussian distributions, the product of the precision matrix with the state
of the system x is a vector whose entries contain the gradients of the log probability density
4
Πx = ∇ lnp(x). This affords a simpler expression for the flow f(x)

Note that this construction means that although there is a Markov blanket between
internal and external states (because of Π = Π = 0), in the presence of any solenoidal
µη ηµ
coupling(eitherγ orλisnon-zero),thentherewillbeatleastunidirectionalcouplingbetween
internal and external states (J (cid:54)= 0 or J (cid:54)= 0, or both). Note that according to recent
ηµ µη
work [12, 13], ‘sparse coupling’ entails either absent or unidirectional coupling, so a system
where J = 0,J (cid:54)= 0 still technically satisfies sparse coupling.
ηµ ηµ
In Figure 1 I explore how γ and λ determine the attracting set of the particular flow,
defined as
{(µ,b) s.t. f (x) = 0 for some external state η}.
µ,b
In the top row of Figure 1, one can see that particular states are attracted to a line that is
misaligned with the line {(b,µ(b))}—the set at which the free energy is minimised [7]. In
particular, the angle between the attracting set of particular states and the line {(b,µ(b))}
grows with increasing γ. When γ = 0, both are aligned and the flows of µ,b are attracted
towards {(b,µ(b))}. However, as soon as γ (cid:54)= 0, the particular states are pulled towards an
attracting set that is misaligned with {(b,µ(b))} and thus does not point along variational
free energy gradients, i.e.,
f (µ,b,η) (cid:54)∝ −∇ F(µ(b),b)
µ µ(b)
(cid:54)∝ −∇ F(µ,b). (10)
µ
Note that in this expression I include both the gradients of the free energy evaluated at
the conditional mode F(µ(b),b) as well as that defined over the space of particular states
F(µ,b). Although statements concerning the gradients of the second quantity F(µ,b) are not
central to the claims of the target article or the previous FEP literature, I include it as an
interesting case to examine, because as we will see below, there indeed are parameterizations
ofsystemswheresuchgradientsdo alignwiththeflowofparticularstates. Ialsoremarkthat
the gradients of the variational free energy evaluated at the conditional mode, with respect
to the conditional mode ∇ F(µ,b) are trivially 0, so that quantity isn’t of particular interest
µ
when we are trying to compare it to the marginal flows of internal states. Assuming any
non-zero marginal flows in different parts of state-space, then the equality of these marginal
flows with the variational free energy gradients (evaluated at the conditional mode, and with
respecttotheconditionalmode)willtriviallynothold. Thisiswhyexpandingouranalysisto
thefreeenergygradientsoftheparticularstates, withrespecttoarbitraryinternalstates(not
just the most likely ones) ∇ F(µ,b) is both a stronger and more interesting interpretation,
µ
because those gradients can be non-zero.

γ = Q was fixed to 0.0. The attracting set of particular states does not change as a function of λ, but
ηb
they are shown vertically offset from one another for visibility. The alignment between the attracting set
andthelineoftheconditionalmodepersistsdespitechangesinsolenoidalcoupling,demonstratinghowsuch
dynamics do not preclude an inferential interpretation of such systems.
Alignment of the flow of internal states (including that of the conditional mode µ(b))
with the line {(b,µ(b))} does not require an absence of solenoidal coupling. In the current
example, all that is required for alignment is the absence of certain solenoidal couplings, in
6
particular that between external and blanket states Q = 0. In general, arbitrary solenoidal
ηb
coupling between internal and blanket states will not ‘misalign’ the attracting set with the
line {(b,µ(b))}, provided there is no solenoidal coupling between external and blanket states.
That means that in such systems, internal and blanket states do flow along the gradients of
the variational free energy F(µ,b), towards their attracting set which lies along (b,µ(b)).
It is clear from the top row of Figure 1 that γ rotates the attracting set of particular
states. Interestingly, this rotation goes hand-in-hand with a simultaneous contraction of the
attracting set’s effective volume, which is evident from inspecting the change in length of
the colored lines in Figure 1, which span the attracting points of f (x) evaluated over the
µ,b
same range of external states. The bottom row of Figure 1 shows the same attracting sets
while varying the solenoidal coupling between blanket and internal states. In this case, the
attracting set of particular states remains aligned with the line of conditional modes, and
the volume of this attracting set does not change. This alignment persists for all strengths of
the coupling parameter λ between internal and blanket states, provided solenoidal coupling
between external and blanket states is constrained to be absent (i.e. γ = 0).
These simple demonstrations show how solenoidal coupling relates to the alignment of
flow fields with the variational free energy gradients and the line of the conditional modes
(thepointatwhichthevariationalfreeenergygradientsvanish). Forinstance, ourresultscall
into question the claim of the target article that only systems with block diagonal solenoidal
coupling sustain marginal flows of internal states that minimize free energy. Indeed, in the
linear diffusions I examined here, the only constraint that is needed for the attracting sets to
alignandhenceforinternalstatestominimizefreeenergyisanabsenceofsolenoidalcoupling
between external and blanket states (γ = 0). In the other cases where λ is unconstrained,
the particular flows find their conditional minima along the line of the conditional modes for
different settings of η, and hence point along variational free energy gradients.
I suspect (and this is intimated in more recent FEP literature such as [12, 13]) that
this result generalises to the setting of particular partitions, where the state space is fur-
ther partitioned into autonomous states (internal and active) and non-autonomous states
(external and sensory). In general, I speculate that such alignment would persist in systems
where solenoidal coupling is absent between autonomous and non-autonomous states, but
unconstrained within either subset.
