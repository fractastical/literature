### OverviewThis paper, “Belief sharing: a blessing or a curse,” investigates the potential pitfalls of sharing beliefs within multi-agent systems, specifically under the framework of active inference. The authors demonstrate that naive belief sharing can lead to undesirable social dynamics, including echo chambers and self-doubt, significantly impairing collaborative performance. The paper proposes a novel strategy – likelihood sharing – to mitigate these issues, arguing for a shift from sharing posterior beliefs to sharing interpreted observations.### MethodologyThe research employs a simulation-based approach to model communication between agents. The experimental setup centers around an object-finding task within a graph environment, where multiple agents search for a rewarding object. Each agent utilizes a generative model based on active inference, characterized by variational message passing and Bayesian updating. The model incorporates a three-dimensional tensor representing agent movement and a likelihood mapping between observed states and latent states. The core of the methodology involves simulating the agents’ interactions and observing the emergent behavior.
