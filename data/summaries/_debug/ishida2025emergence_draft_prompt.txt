Abstract: How could primordial life, before the evolution of genetic systems, adapt to
fluctuating environments and achieve homeostasis? This study proposes a minimal, chemically
plausible model where homeostasis emerges from a simple chemical reaction network. It utilizes
an internal Lotka-Volterra chemical oscillator as a "search engine" to periodically vary a
protocell's pigmentation. The system then optimizes its internal state by evaluating the temporal
correlation between these internal fluctuations and a single global metric—the cell's self-
replication rate—through a mechanism termed "antagonistic memory molecules." Numerical
simulations demonstrate that the model can autonomously converge to and maintain the optimal
temperature for its self-replication, even amidst significant environmental fluctuations. These
findings provide a constructive proof-of-concept for how a core process of active inference can
emerge from a simple physicochemical system, offering a concrete scenario for the acquisition of
adaptive capabilities at the origin of life.
Background
Pre-genetic Adaptation: A Fundamental Question in the Origin of Life
The capacity to maintain internal homeostasis and persist within a constantly changing
environment is a fundamental characteristic of life. In extant organisms, this capacity is
underpinned by an intricate genomic blueprint, realized through mechanisms such as feedback
control of gene expression and epigenetic modifications (1, 2). However, given that this genetic
system is itself a product of Darwinian evolution over vast timescales, a critical question
emerges: How did primordial life, prior to the establishment of a stable genetic blueprint, adapt
to its environment and acquire homeostasis?
Darwinian evolution is a powerful optimization process, but it operates on a relatively slow
timescale, driven by random mutations and subsequent natural selection. Consequently, this
process is too slow to allow an individual organism to respond to rapid environmental changes
within its lifetime. This suggests that a more rapid adaptive mechanism, one not directly reliant
on genes, must have existed from the earliest stages of life. This notion is supported by the work
of Kussell et al. (3), who demonstrated that the ability to flexibly alter phenotypes is critical for
survival in fluctuating environments. Exploring the physicochemical basis of this "rapid, non-
genetic adaptation" is therefore an indispensable step toward understanding the origin of life.
Theoretical Framework: The Free Energy Principle and the Bottom-Up Challenge
In recent years, the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposed by Karl Friston, has gained
prominence as a unifying framework for understanding self-maintenance and adaptation in living
1
systems (4). According to the FEP, living systems must maintain their existence by acting to
minimize their long-term "surprise"—or prediction error—relative to their own generative model
of the environment. This minimization of prediction error is achieved through two
complementary pathways:
• Perception: Updating the internal model (or beliefs) to better align with sensory inputs.
• Action: Intervening in the world to alter sensory inputs, thereby making them conform to
the system's predictions.
This process of inference through action is known as "Active Inference" (4).
The scope of the FEP extends beyond the cognitive functions of the brain. Recent theoretical
advances have expanded its application, offering new perspectives on the behavior of biological
systems that lack a nervous system. For instance, biological phenomena such as morphogenesis
in multicellular organisms (5) and chemotaxis in single-celled organisms (6, 7) are being
reinterpreted through the lens of active inference.
This expansion of the FEP resonates deeply with the burgeoning field of "Basal Cognition"
(8). Basal cognition challenges the traditional neurocentric view that cognitive functions such as
thinking, learning, and decision-making are exclusive to organisms with brains. Instead, it
explores the remarkable problem-solving abilities demonstrated by non-neuronal life forms such
as bacteria, slime molds, plants, and the somatic cell colonies that constitute animal bodies (9).
This approach posits that cognition is not a later evolutionary addition but a fundamental
property inherent to life itself.
The FEP serves as a normative (top-down) theory for the phenomena uncovered by basal
cognition, providing a unified mathematical and physical foundation to explain why and how all
living systems behave as they do (7). However, while the FEP specifies the principles that living
systems ought to follow, it leaves a significant bottom-up question unanswered: "How does such
teleological (goal-directed) behavior—that is, basal cognition—self-organize and 'emerge' from
simple physicochemical systems?" This remains a major mystery. Bridging this gap between the
normative theory and physicochemical reality is crucial for a deeper understanding of both the
origin of life and the principles of intelligence.
Our Approach: Emergence of Active Inference through Chemical Computing
To address the challenge outlined above, this study adopts an approach from the framework of
"chemical computing." Chemical computing, a field that utilizes molecular interactions for
information processing, is broadly divided into two major paradigms. The first is the "Design"
approach, which aims to meticulously engineer molecular-level equivalents of digital computer
logic. The second is the "Emergence" approach, which instead seeks to leverage the intrinsic
properties of chemical reaction systems, such as nonlinearity and self-organization, to enable the
autonomous emergence of adaptive behaviors (10, 11).
This research is positioned within the latter "Emergence" paradigm. Rather than implementing
specific logic gates, this study explores how a homeostatic function equivalent to active
inference can self-organize from a simple chemical reaction network. To this end, we propose a
constructive model, the "Minimal Cognition Engine," to test the following hypothesis: a system
can autonomously discover and maintain an optimal state without explicit goals or direct sensory
information by utilizing a simple chemical oscillator as a "search engine" to actively explore its
parameter space and adjusting its internal state based solely on the temporal correlation between
these explorations and the resulting overall system success (e.g., self-replication rate).
In this paper, we demonstrate through simulation a concrete mechanism by which a pre-genetic,
primordial life form could achieve homeostasis in a fluctuating environment via the simple loop
2
of "exploration through oscillation and optimization through correlation". We thereby show that
this model serves as a minimal, chemically plausible, constructive model of basal cognition that
embodies the FEP, offering new insights into its potential physicochemical underpinnings.
Overview of the Minimal Cognition Engine
This study proposes a constructive model to investigate the minimal mechanisms by which a
primordial chemical system, devoid of genetic information and complex sensory organs, could
adapt to its environment and acquire homeostasis. The model comprises two core components: a
"body" that physically interacts with the environment, and an "adaptive mechanism" that controls
the body.
Physical Model: A Single-Celled Organism in a Daisyworld-like Environment
The physical environment of the model is a hypothetical planet inspired by Lovelock's
Daisyworld model (12).
• Environment: The planet orbits a sun with periodically fluctuating luminosity and features
oceans on its surface. The ocean water temperature varies in response to fluctuations in
solar luminosity.
• Agent: The ocean surface is populated by single-celled organisms (agents) devoid of genes.
Each agent can continuously vary its surface pigmentation, from white to black, based on
its internal chemical state. This level of pigmentation determines the cell's albedo (solar
reflectivity) and, consequently, its own temperature.
• Survival and Replication: The cell's self-replication rate depends on its temperature. The
rate is maximized at a specific optimal replication temperature, T , and decreases at higher
opt
or lower temperatures, following a concave-down parabolic curve. The cells proliferate
according to this replication rate while also dying at a constant, temperature-independent
rate.
The model's objective is to demonstrate the emergence of a homeostatic function that allows the
agents to autonomously maintain the optimal temperature, T , which maximizes their
opt
replication rate. This must be achieved without the agents directly sensing either their own
cellular temperature or the external environmental temperature.
Adaptive Mechanism: The Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model
To achieve homeostasis, the agents employ an adaptive mechanism named the "Antagonistic
Memory Molecule Model". This model was developed to achieve self-optimization through a
continuous, chemically plausible process, moving beyond an earlier algorithm-based approach
that relied on conditional logic (see Appendix A-2). By minimizing such algorithmic branching,
the model achieves self-optimization through continuous dynamics.
This mechanism consists of three core components (see Fig. 1):
1. Chemical Oscillator as a Search Engine: The model assumes an internal chemical reaction
network within the cell, described by the Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations. This network functions
as a chemical oscillator with periodically varying concentrations of chemical species X and Y.
The LV system was chosen for its simplicity and its capacity for the oscillation center to be
shifted by altering parameters such as reaction rates. By utilizing this ability, the oscillator
functions as a "search engine" to actively explore the system's parameter space. Specifically, the
production rate of an oscillator product, P, drives cyclic variations in the cell's pigmentation
(albedo). (For details, see Appendix A-1).
3
2. Physical Interaction: The output of the oscillator (the production rate of P) alters the cell's
physical property of pigmentation (albedo). This allows the cell to actively vary its own
temperature, which in turn affects its self-replication rate. Through this process, the internal
chemical "exploration" generates a physical "action" and a corresponding survival-relevant
"outcome." (For details, see Appendix A-2).
3. Memory Molecules for Correlation-Based Learning: At the core of the adaptation are two
types of hypothetical "memory molecules," M and M . These molecules chemically
good bad
accumulate evidence of whether the cell's state is trending in a "good" or "bad" direction.
• Production of Memory Molecules: The production of these molecules is controlled by the
temporal correlation between the trend in the internal state (change in P production rate)
and the trend in the resulting success (change in self-replication rate, β). When the
directions of change align (e.g., an increase in P production leads to an increase in β),
reactions that produce M are promoted. Conversely, when the directions are opposed,
good
reactions producing M are promoted.
bad
• Parameter Adjustment: The concentration balance between M good and M bad continuously
adjusts the LV oscillator's parameters (reaction constant k ) and the baseline pigmentation
1
(albedo center value). For instance, if the concentration of M exceeds that of M , the
good bad
current direction of exploration is deemed "correct," and the parameters are updated to
reinforce exploration in that direction.
This continuous loop of "exploration through oscillation" and "correlation-based learning via
memory molecules" chemically implements the essential process of active inference—learning
from past experience to optimize future actions—without requiring rigorous probabilistic
calculations. (For details, see Appendix A-3).
Chemical Plausibility
The proposed "Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model" was designed for both simplicity and
chemical feasibility. The model's correlation-based learning mechanism is situated within a
broader line of research, including the work by McGregor et al. (13) on the emergence of
associative learning in chemical reaction networks, which demonstrates that simple chemical
systems can acquire the ability to modify their behavior based on experience.
Two key aspects underscore the model's plausibility:
• Biochemical Analogy: The process by which the memory molecules M and M
good bad
adjust the parameter k is analogous to feedback mechanisms universally found in
1
biochemical reactions, such as allosteric regulation (14) and enzyme
activation/inactivation (15).
• Description by the Law of Mass Action: The entire model can be described by the law
of mass action as a system of coupled differential equations governing the production and
degradation of each chemical species (for details, see Appendix A-3). This formulation
suggests that the adaptive mechanism presented in this model can emerge from the
fundamental principles of chemical kinetics without requiring complex decision-making
logic.
This paper will demonstrate through simulation that this chemically plausible model enables
the emergence of homeostasis, allowing for the autonomous maintenance of an optimal
temperature under a fluctuating external environment.
4
Fig. 1. Schematic overview of the model. The model features a population of single-celled,
non-genetic agents on the surface of an ocean on a hypothetical planet. The environment is
characterized by periodically fluctuating solar luminosity and water temperature. The self-
replication rate (β) of each cell is temperature-dependent, maximized at an optimal temperature
(T ) and decreasing otherwise. Internally, a Lotka-Volterra (LV) chemical oscillator drives
opt
cyclic changes in pigmentation (albedo) by altering the production rate of a substance P. This
allows the cell to actively modulate its own temperature, which in turn affects its replication rate.
This entire process forms a feedback loop where internal exploration (oscillation) generates an
action (pigmentation change) that influences a success metric (replication rate), thereby enabling
the system to converge toward the optimal temperature.

Results
This section presents the results of simulations conducted to test whether the "Antagonistic
Memory Molecule Model," as proposed in previous section, can lead to the emergence of
homeostatic functions. To objectively evaluate the model's performance, we define two
quantitative metrics, calculated after the simulation reaches a steady state:
• Accuracy: Defined as the time-averaged value of the cell temperature (T cell ) in the steady
state. This metric assesses the proximity of the cell temperature to the target optimal
replication temperature (T ).
opt
• Stability: Defined as the standard deviation of the cell temperature (T cell ) in the steady
state. This metric quantifies the effectiveness of the homeostatic mechanism in suppressing
external environmental fluctuations and maintaining a stable internal state.
Using these metrics, we tested the following three hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: Emergence of a Basic Homeostatic Function
[Hypothesis 1] The model can generate a basic homeostatic function by autonomously
converging to the optimal replication temperature (T ), which maximizes its replication rate,
opt
even under a fluctuating external environment.
To test this fundamental hypothesis, a simulation was performed using a standard set of
parameters: an optimal replication temperature of T = 22.0 °C, a mean sunlight intensity of 0.7,
opt
and an amplitude of 0.21. Fig. 2A shows a representative result of this simulation. After the
simulation begins, the cell temperature (T , orange line) clearly converges toward the optimal
cell
replication temperature (T = 22.0 °C) through the adaptive learning mechanism, despite the
opt
influence of the periodically fluctuating external water temperature (T , light blue dashed
water
line). This convergence results from the automatic adjustment of the adaptive parameters—the
central albedo value and the number of memory molecules—to values that maximize the self-
replication rate (see Appendix A-5-1 for details).
Particularly during the initial phase of the simulation (steps 0–200), the parameters fluctuate
significantly as they search for the optimal value. This behavior is attributable to the adjustment
from the initial values of the memory molecules. Subsequently, the system transitions to a stable
state that maintains a temperature around T . This result strongly supports Hypothesis 1,
opt
demonstrating that the model can achieve homeostasis based on the simple principle of
"exploration by oscillation and optimization by correlation" without being explicitly given a
target value.
Hypothesis 2: Adaptability to Diverse Target Temperatures
[Hypothesis 2] The model's homeostatic function is not fixed to a specific target; it can adapt
flexibly to different optimal replication temperatures (T ).
opt
To test the model's adaptive flexibility, the optimal replication temperature (T ) was varied
opt
from 20.0°C to 24.0°C. The results, presented in Fig.2B, show that the cell temperature
successfully adjusts to the corresponding optimal temperature in each case.
Table 1 summarizes the mean (Accuracy) and standard deviation (Stability) of the cell
temperature for each T setting, calculated during the final phase of the simulation (from time
opt
step 801 to 1000). In all settings, the mean cell temperature closely approximated the target T ,
opt
demonstrating the model's high accuracy. Furthermore, the standard deviation remained stable
across all cases, converging to approximately 0.6°C.
These results support Hypothesis 2, demonstrating the model's capability to self-optimize for
diverse target states without high dependence on specific parameter values.

Hypothesis 3: Robustness Against Environmental Fluctuations
[Hypothesis 3] The model's homeostatic function remains robust, not failing even under more
severe environmental fluctuations.
Finally, we tested the ability of the model's homeostatic function to operate under more
demanding conditions. In this test, the system's response was evaluated while varying the
amplitude of sunlight intensity, a key factor in environmental fluctuation. As shown in Table 2,
the model demonstrates high robustness. Even as the amplitude of sunlight fluctuations was
increased from 0.1 to 0.4, the stability (standard deviation) of the cell temperature remained low.
Importantly, even under the most severe condition tested (a 0.4 amplitude, corresponding to a
water temperature fluctuation of approximately 5°C), the homeostatic function was not
compromised, and the cell temperature was maintained around the optimal temperature.
These results strongly support Hypothesis 3, demonstrating that the model is not only
functional but is also robust enough to maintain its adaptive capability and preserve homeostasis
against significant changes in the external environment. (For the influence of other parameters,
see Appendix A-5-2).

Discussion
This study has demonstrated through simulation that a simple chemical reaction network can
lead to the emergence of homeostasis in a fluctuating environment, based solely on the principle
of "exploration by oscillation and optimization by correlation," without reliance on externally
provided genetic information or predefined target values. These findings extend beyond the mere
presentation of a hypothetical model of life; through the underlying adaptive mechanism, they
offer significant implications for multiple disciplines, including theoretical biology, the origin of
life, and information science. In this section, we discuss the significance of our findings from
four distinct perspectives.
Biological Plausibility of the Adaptive Mechanism: An Analogy with Bacterial Chemotaxis
The adaptive mechanism in this model is a remarkably simple heuristic that relies solely on
the correlation between two time-series trends: the trend of the internal state and the resulting
trend in the system's success (the self-replication rate). This algorithm is consistent with adaptive
strategies observed in living organisms.
The most prominent example is the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli. E. coli does not calculate
its optimal direction by spatially differentiating a nutrient gradient. Instead, it employs a search-
biasing strategy based on temporal correlation. Following its own movement (a "run" or a
"tumble"), the bacterium evaluates only temporal changes—in essence, asking whether the
situation has improved recently. If conditions are improving (i.e., the nutrient concentration is
increasing), it increases the probability of continuing its straight-line movement (a "run").
The accumulation of the "memory molecules," M and M , in our model can be interpreted
good bad
as a chemical-level implementation of this bacterial strategy. This strong analogy with a well-
established biological algorithm suggests that the model is not merely a thought experiment but
represents a realistic and powerful adaptive strategy that could have been employed by
primordial life before the establishment of genetic information.
The Chemical Oscillator as a Search Engine: An Analogy with Robotic CPGs
This research offers a new perspective on the functional role of chemical oscillators. In
previous studies, such as those using the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, the propagation of
chemical waves was often used to perform computations or implement logic gates (17). In
contrast, the Lotka-Volterra (LV) oscillator in this model functions not as the final computational
output, but as a "search engine" that drives adaptive learning. This autonomous and continuous
internal fluctuation actively generates the "action" and "outcome" data that the learning
mechanism evaluates.
This concept is strongly analogous to the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in robotics (18).
Just as a CPG generates rhythmic motor patterns for animal locomotion, the LV oscillator in our
model generates a rhythmic "metabolic search." However, a key difference exists: while adaptive
CPGs require direct sensory feedback, such as joint angles or ground contact, the agent in our
model learns by relying solely on a single, global success metric—its self-replication rate. This
remarkable simplicity of information input significantly enhances the plausibility of this
mechanism functioning within a primordial chemical system possessing only limited sensory
capabilities.
As a Model for the Chemical Emergence of Active Inference
9
This model can be interpreted as a concrete "bottom-up" or "constructive" model of the Free
Energy Principle (FEP), proposed by Karl Friston, and particularly of active inference. The
model's behavior can be viewed as a process of minimizing "prediction error" (the imbalance
between M and M ) in its sensory input (the replication rate, β) by changing its "action" (the
good bad
center of albedo oscillation), while simultaneously updating its "internal model" (parameters
such as k and pigment levels). This constitutes the core loop of "minimizing prediction error
1
through action," a process fundamental to active inference. The correspondence between the
components of our model and the key concepts of the FEP is detailed in Appendix A-6.
Many applied FEP studies take a top-down approach, presupposing goals (technically, prior
distributions) that are pre-encoded in neural circuits or genes. In contrast, our model starts from
simple chemical and physical rules without explicit goals or prior distributions, demonstrating
that FEP-like behavior (i.e., the minimization of variational free energy, leading to homeostasis)
emerges as a result. This presents a scenario that addresses a more fundamental question of great
importance in the FEP context: the "origin of priors." That is, how does a living system discover
and learn its own preferred states (setpoints)? This interpretation is not merely an analogy. As
shown by Poole et al. (19), a chemical reaction network following the law of mass action can
itself function as a Bayesian inference machine that autonomously learns a generative model of
the world. Our Antagonistic Memory Molecule model can be interpreted as a physical
implementation of this abstract theory, applied to the concrete problem of biological
homeostasis.
Furthermore, the model suggests that this learning algorithm can be implemented as a concrete
chemical reaction network governed by the law of mass action. As recent research indicates,
chemical kinetics can itself be interpreted as a form of Bayesian inference (19), and our model
attempts to build a concrete bridge between this abstract theory and physical reality. The essence
of the discrete-time decision logic implemented in our simulation (i.e., generating M if the
good
trends of change align) can be captured by the following continuous differential equations:
𝑑[𝑀 ]
𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑
=𝑘 ∙𝜎(𝑐𝑥̇𝑦̇)−𝑘 ∙[𝑀 ]
𝑑𝑡 𝑝 𝑑 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑
𝑑[𝑀 ]
𝑏𝑎𝑑 =𝑘 ∙𝜎(−𝑐𝑥̇𝑦̇)−𝑘 ∙[𝑀 ]
𝑑𝑡 𝑝 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑑
Here, [M ] and [M ] are the concentrations of the memory molecules, x is the rate of change
good bad
of the internal state (P production rate), and y is the rate of change of the success metric
(replication rate β). The term σ(z) is a sigmoid function that provides an abstract representation
of the algorithm and serves as a continuous approximation of the conditional logic used in the
simulation (i.e., generating M if the directions of the trends match). The coefficient c
good
determines the steepness of the switch. The negative sign in the M production term, σ(-cxy),
bad
ensures that this term becomes large when the trends are opposing. This mechanism can be
implemented concretely by a common biochemical motif: multi-input control by an allosteric
enzyme, an example of which is shown in Appendix A-7.
On the other hand, the search mechanism proposed in this study has limitations inherent in its
simplicity. The Lotka-Volterra oscillator used as the search engine is, in essence, a deterministic
periodic oscillator. This functions efficiently under simple conditions where the fitness landscape
is unimodal—that is, where only a single optimal solution exists. However, in more realistic
biological scenarios with multiple favorable states (local fitness maxima), such as different
nutrient sources or temperature conditions, this deterministic search is highly likely to become
trapped in the local optimum closest to its starting point. This represents a significant limitation
to the model's generality, and a mechanism for escaping such local optima is indispensable for
10
considering the emergence of higher cognitive functions. The key to overcoming this problem is
the introduction of stochastic fluctuations, as we will discuss in next section.
A Model Bridging Active Inference and Basal Cognition
The "Minimal Cognition Engine" proposed in this study is more than just an optimization
algorithm for achieving homeostasis. By reinterpreting its operating principle through the lens of
important theoretical frameworks in modern cognitive science, such as the Free Energy Principle
(FEP) and basal cognition, a deeper significance emerges, shedding light on the origin of life's
intelligence. Our model can be positioned as a constructive model that bridges different
hierarchical levels: the universal principles described by the FEP (the "Why"), the biological
phenomena revealed by basal cognition (the "What"), and the underlying physicochemical
implementation (the "How").
This chemical implementation of active inference embodies, in a remarkably minimal form,
the core features of "basal cognition"—a field exploring the learning and decision-making
capabilities of non-neuronal organisms. Research in basal cognition has revealed a toolkit of
cognitive abilities in these organisms, including goal-directedness, learning, and memory (8,9).
● Goal-Directedness: The agent behaves autonomously to maximize an intrinsic success
metric—its replication rate, β—without explicit knowledge of the target value, the optimal
temperature T . This represents the most fundamental form of goal-directedness, where
opt
goal-oriented behavior emerges from rules that themselves have no explicit goal.
● Learning and Memory: The "antagonistic memory molecules" accumulate the correlation
between past actions and their outcomes as chemical concentrations. This represents a
simple form of learning that alters behavioral biases through experience, with the
concentrations themselves functioning as a short-term chemical memory.
Embodied Computation: Cognition (the discovery of the optimal temperature) is a dynamic
process emerging from the entire loop of internal chemical reactions, the body (albedo), and the
environment, requiring no centralized processor. This adaptive process embodies the concept of
"embodied cognition" as proposed by Varela et al. (20).
The preceding discussion offers important implications for the origin and evolution of life.
Our model demonstrates how, in a "Metabolism-First" world preceding the establishment of a
genetic system, a self-sustaining metabolic cycle (the LV oscillator) could have acquired
information-processing and learning capabilities.
Furthermore, the "memory molecules" in our model can be regarded as an analogue of
primitive epigenetic memory. These molecules hold information not as a polymer sequence but
as a chemical "state," which in turn controls the phenotype (e.g., k and albedo). This chemical
1
state can be considered a form of "soft inheritance" that could be transmitted to daughter cells
during cell division. It is conceivable that such unstable adaptive marks could, through chemical
instability, be converted into and fixed as more stable genetic mutations (21). In this sense, the
rapid individual learning demonstrated by our model suggests a potential mechanism capable not
only of waiting for Darwinian evolution but also of directing and accelerating it.
Conclusion and Future Directions
In this study, we proposed a chemically plausible, constructive model that uses an internal
chemical oscillator as a search engine, adjusting its parameters based solely on the temporal
11
correlation between its activity and the overall success of the system. Simulation results
demonstrated that this simple mechanism enables the autonomous emergence of homeostasis in a
fluctuating environment, without direct knowledge of target values.
These findings not only present a concrete scenario for how primordial life could have adapted
to its environment but also serve as a minimal model for how the cognitive loop underlying
active inference can emerge from simple physicochemical processes. The contributions of this
research extend beyond theoretical biology's exploration of the origin of life and principles of
intelligence, offering insights for engineering fields where self-adaptive system design is
required.
• Introducing the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off: The current model continues to
explore (oscillate) even after reaching an optimal state. A future goal is to chemically
implement the "exploration-exploitation trade-off," a universal challenge in adaptive
systems. We aim to develop a more sophisticated mechanism by introducing a feedback
loop where a "stabilizing molecule S," which suppresses the LV oscillator, is produced
when the success rate (replication rate, β) is high. This would allow the system to reduce
exploration and enhance stability once an optimal state has been found.
• Expansion into Spatial Dimensions: While this study used a simplified one-dimensional
model for proof-of-principle, we plan to extend this adaptive mechanism to 2D or 3D
reaction-diffusion systems or cellular automaton models. This will allow us to investigate
how morphogenesis, driven by self-optimization, interacts with homeostatic functions under
spatial constraints.
⚫ Exploring Chemical and Physical Implementation: The ultimate validation of this model
lies in its physical implementation. The logical structure of the "antagonistic memory
molecule model" could, in principle, be constructed in vitro using, for example, DNA strand
displacement (DSD) reactions. Verifying whether the self-optimization phenomenon
demonstrated in our simulations can be physically reproduced by constructing such a "wet"
artificial life system is a highly challenging yet crucial future task. Furthermore,
compartmentalizing this chemical system within protocells and examining its impact on
evolution would be a promising line of research for deepening our understanding of the
origin of life (22).

Appendix
Appendix A-1: The Lotka-Volterra Chemical Oscillation Model
A-1-1. Overview of the Standard Form of the Lotka-Volterra Equations
The standard form of the Lotka-Volterra equations, which represents the most classic
predator-prey model, is a system of nonlinear differential equations describing the change over
time in the population (or concentration) of two biological or chemical species.
X: the population or concentration of the prey (or a self-replicating chemical species).
Y: the population or concentration of the predator (or a chemical species that consumes X
to replicate).
The equations are expressed as follows:
𝑑𝑋
= 𝑋(𝑎−𝑏𝑌)
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑌
= 𝑌(𝑐𝑋−𝑑)
𝑑𝑡
Here, the parameters have the following meanings:
a: the intrinsic growth rate of the prey, X (related to its growth rate in the absence of the
predator, Y; a>0).
b: the efficiency of predation of the prey, X, by the predator, Y (b>0).
c: the efficiency of the increase in the predator, Y, from consuming the prey, X (c>0).
d: the intrinsic decay rate of the predator, Y (its decay rate in the absence of the prey, X;
d>0).
This model was originally proposed to explain the periodic population fluctuations of predators
and prey in ecosystems, but it is also applicable to chemical reaction systems that exhibit similar
dynamics, such as networks of autocatalytic or enzymatic reactions. The most notable feature of
this model is that, for an appropriate range of parameter values, the populations (concentrations)
of X and Y oscillate periodically.
A-1-2. Chemical Reaction Scheme for the Lotka-Volterra Equations
The standard Lotka-Volterra differential equations can be represented by the following
elementary chemical reaction scheme.
1. Self-replication of Prey (X) This reaction corresponds to the growth term, aX.
𝑎
𝑋→ 2𝑋
15
This describes a molecule of prey X replicating itself. In the context of the full model, the rate
constant a is determined by the concentration of a nutrient source, [A], and a rate constant, k ,
1
such that a = k [A].
1
2. Predation and Replication of Predator (Y) This single reaction corresponds to both the
prey consumption term, −bXY, and the predator growth term, +cXY.
𝑘2
𝑋 +𝑌 → 2𝑌
This describes a molecule of predator Y consuming a molecule of prey X to produce two
molecules of Y. The rate constant k corresponds to both parameters b and c in the standard
2
equations.
3. Decay of Predator (Y) This reaction corresponds to the decay term, −dY.
𝑑
𝑌 → 𝑃
This describes a molecule of predator Y decomposing into an inert product P. The rate
constant d is equivalent to k in the full model.
3
Applying the law of mass action to this reaction scheme yields the standard Lotka-Volterra
equations. The correspondence between the general parameters and the specific rate constants
used in our model's implementation is as follows: a = k [A], b = k , c = k , and d = k .
1 2 2 3
A-1-3. The Oscillation Center
The center of oscillation for X and Y in the standard Lotka-Volterra equations is the system's
non-trivial fixed point (or equilibrium point). This is the point where the rates of change are
zero for both species simultaneously, i.e., where dX / dt = 0 and dY / dt = 0, for X ≠ 0 and Y ≠ 0.
From the system of equations:
𝑋(𝑎−𝑏𝑌) = 0
𝑌(𝑐𝑋−𝑑) = 0
the non-trivial solution is found by solving:
𝑎
𝑎−𝑏𝑌 = 0 ⇒ 𝑌 =
𝑠 𝑏
𝑑
𝑐𝑋 −𝑑 = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 =
𝑠 𝑐
Therefore, the center of oscillation, which is the non-trivial fixed point (X , Y ), is given by:
s s
𝑑 𝑎
(𝑋 ,𝑌) = ( , )
𝑠 𝑠 𝑐 𝑏
16
Substituting our model's specific parameters (a = k [A], b = k , c = k , d = k ):
1 2 2 3
𝑘
3
𝑋 =
𝑠 𝑘
2
𝑘 [𝐴]
1
𝑌 =
𝑠 𝑘
2
This relationship is crucial as it demonstrates that the equilibrium concentration of Y, denoted
as Ys, can be controlled by the concentration of the nutrient source, [A], and the rate constant k .
1
Since the production rate of the output substance P is given by k [Y], its average production rate
3
(i.e., the center of its oscillation) can therefore be actively controlled by modulating [A] or k .
1
This type of fixed point is known as a center. The trajectories around it are neutrally stable,
meaning they neither spiral toward nor are repelled from the fixed point. Instead, the system
oscillates periodically along a closed orbit whose specific shape and size are determined by the
initial conditions.
A-1-4. Numerical Method
This model uses the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4). This method was chosen over
simpler techniques, such as the Euler method, as it provides higher accuracy and stability, even
with a relatively large time step (dt).
Appendix A-2. An Early Algorithmic Approach (Heuristic Model)
Note: This section describes an early, heuristic algorithm that was considered during the model's
development. The final simulations presented in this paper are based on the more chemically
plausible "Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model," which is detailed in Appendix A-3.
In the Lotka-Volterra oscillation model, an external nutrient, A, drives the chemical
oscillation, causing the concentrations of substances X and Y to vary periodically. Consequently,
the production rate of the product, P, also oscillates. This production rate is linked to the cell's
pigmentation, which in turn affects its temperature.
The conceptual goal of this model is to enable a cell to spontaneously approach its optimal
temperature, T . This is achieved by having the cell "explore" its environment via the
opt
oscillations in the production rate of P. An adjustment loop then modifies the cell's albedo and
the LV parameter k based on the outcome of this exploration. This entire process operates under
1
the key premise that the cell has no explicit knowledge of its own temperature (T ) or the
cell
optimal temperature (T ).
opt
In this heuristic approach, a mechanism varies the albedo in proportion to the oscillating
production rate of P. Instead of causing large swings, the albedo is designed to oscillate within a
narrow range, allowing for fine-tuning of the cell temperature (e.g., within 1–2 °C).
Specifically, the cell temperature would be adjusted according to the following logic, evaluated
over one oscillation cycle of P:
• If trends are anti-correlated (i.e., the trend of P is positive while the trend of the
17
replication rate, β, is negative, or vice versa):
o Increase k 1 and decrease albedo (action to raise cell temperature).
• If trends are correlated (i.e., the trends of P and β are both positive or both negative):
o Decrease k 1 and increase albedo (action to lower cell temperature).
(Note: Since a higher production rate of P is linked to a higher albedo, this change in albedo
results in an opposite change in cell temperature.)
Through this feedback mechanism, the cell's temperature would asymptotically approach the
optimal temperature by continuously shifting the oscillation center of P in the direction that
maximizes its replication rate. (This algorithm assumes a unimodal fitness landscape with a
single optimal temperature. If multiple local maxima existed, a mechanism to introduce
stochasticity would be necessary to escape them; however, this feature was not included in this
conceptual model.)
This hypothetical k adjustment loop would, therefore, realize a process of observation →
1
belief update → action optimization.
Appendix A-3. The Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model: A Chemically Plausible
Implementation of Inference
The heuristic algorithm detailed in Appendix A-2, which relies on conditional "if-then" logic,
was an initial consideration . Although this approach could theoretically guide the system to an
optimal temperature, it has two significant drawbacks: it is algorithmically complex and, more
importantly, lacks chemical plausibility .
To address these issues and to enhance both chemical feasibility and implementation
simplicity, we developed the "Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model," which was used for all
simulations presented in this study . The guiding principle behind this new model was to replace
the discrete, algorithmic decision-making process with a continuous, dynamic system governed
by simple chemical reactions. Specifically, the mechanism for adjusting the parameter k and the
1
baseline albedo—a process analogous to Bayesian inference—was reformulated entirely in terms
of chemical reaction equations .
A-3-1. The Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model
This model introduces two types of hypothetical "memory molecules," whose production and
degradation are tied to the cell's overall success. The balance in the concentrations of these
molecules continuously adjusts the parameter k and the baseline albedo value (albedo center).
1
• M good : A molecule that accumulates evidence that the cell's state is trending in a "good"
direction (i.e., the self-replication rate, β, is improving).
• M bad : A molecule that accumulates evidence that the cell's state is trending in a "bad"
direction (i.e., the self-replication rate, β, is worsening).
The model's logic can be interpreted as the following set of processes:
1. Production of Memory Molecules The production of M and M is controlled by the
good bad
temporal correlation between the trend in the production rate of P (P rate) and the trend in the
self-replication rate, β.
• When P rate and β are positively correlated (i.e., both are increasing or both are
decreasing), the production of M is promoted.
good
• Conversely, when they are anti-correlated (i.e., one is increasing while the other is
18
decreasing), the production of M is promoted.
bad
•
2. Degradation of Memory Molecules Both M and M are assumed to degrade naturally at
good good
a constant rate. This ensures that the memory is not permanent, allowing the system to gradually
forget past information.
M → degradation products
good
M → degradation products
bad
3. Adjustment of k and Baseline Albedo The parameter k and the baseline albedo (albedo
1 1
center) are continuously adjusted based on the concentration difference between M and M .
good bad
• If [M good ]>[ M bad ]: k 1 is decreased and the baseline albedo is increased (action to lower
cell temperature).
• If [M good ]<[ M bad ]: k 1 is increased and the baseline albedo is decreased (action to raise cell
temperature).
The advantages of this new model include the following:
1. Chemical Plausibility: This model can be interpreted in terms of mechanisms that are
ubiquitous in biochemistry, such as enzymatic activation/inhibition and feedback control
loops.
2. Simplicity and Robustness: It eliminates the need for complex, discrete logic, such as the
explicit detection of oscillation cycles or conditional "if-then" statements. Instead, the
concentrations of the two memory molecules change continuously, and their balance
smoothly adjusts the system's parameters. This dynamic process makes the system more
robust to noise and leads to more stable operation.
3. Continuous Learning: The system does not need to wait for a full oscillation cycle to
complete an update. It continuously evaluates the correlation between its internal state and
success rate at each time step, allowing for more rapid and continuous adaptation.
Therefore, the Antagonistic Memory Molecule model represents the concept of a "Bayesian-
like mechanism via simple chemical reactions" in a more direct and feasible manner.
A-3-2. A Hypothetical Chemical Reaction Scheme for Correlation Detection
The correlation detection mechanism, which was represented abstractly by the differential
equations in Section 4.3, can be implemented by a plausible series of elementary reactions .
Here, we outline a hypothetical reaction scheme for this mechanism, using the production of
M as an example. Although our simulation employed the discrete algorithm described in
good
Appendix A-3-1, this scheme demonstrates how its core function—detecting the correlation
between two trends—can emerge from standard chemical kinetics .
Step 1: Conversion of Trends into Chemical Signals It is assumed that the rate of change of
the internal state (x) and the rate of change of the success rate (y) drive the production of signal
molecules, Sx and Sy, respectively .
• Production of signal molecules (driven by positive trends):
𝑥
∅ → 𝑆
𝑋 𝑥
𝑦
∅ → 𝑆
𝑌 𝑦
• Degradation of signal molecules:
19
𝑘
𝑑1
𝑆 → ∅
𝑥
𝑘
𝑑2
𝑆 → ∅
𝑦
(Note: For simplicity, only the case where trends are positive is described. A similar system, in
which other signal molecules such as Sx′ and Sy′ are produced when x and y are negative, can be
readily conceived.)
Step 2: Cooperative Signal Detection by an Enzyme (An "AND" Gate) The enzyme
responsible for producing M exists in an inactive state, E . It transitions to its active form,
good inactive
E , only when both signal molecules, Sx and Sy, bind to it cooperatively .
active
E + Sx ⇌ E (Reversible binding)
inactive Sx
E + Sy ⇌ E (Reversible binding)
inactive Sy
E + Sy ⇌ E (Cooperative binding)
Sx active
E + Sx ⇌ E (Cooperative binding)
Sy active
Step 3: Production of the Memory Molecule Only the active form of the enzyme, E ,
active
possesses the catalytic function to convert a generic Substrate into M .

𝐸 + Substrate → 𝐸 + 𝑀

This series of reactions demonstrates that M is produced efficiently only when Sx and Sy are
good
present simultaneously. It thus represents one plausible example of how the multiplicative x × y
term in the abstract differential equation can be implemented through concrete chemical kinetics.
Appendix A-4. Model Implementation Details
A-4-1. Implementation Overview
• Technology: The simulation was implemented using HTML and JavaScript.
• Model Dimensionality: The model is one-dimensional.
• Environment: The external sunlight intensity is set to fluctuate exogenously, following a
sinusoidal pattern.
• Population Dynamics: The model simulates the total cell population, which starts from a
fixed initial value. However, the absolute population size is treated as a supplementary
quantity. The primary focus of this study is the homeostatic regulation of the cell's
replication rate, not complex population dynamics. To stabilize the population for analysis
and prevent unrealistic exponential growth or extinction, cell growth is constrained by a
logistic function.

A-5-1. Verification of Model Operation
This section verifies that the model operates according to the specified algorithm by
examining the dynamics of a representative simulation run, as shown in Supplementary Figure
1. The left panel of the figure shows the results for the first 200 time steps, while the right panel
provides a magnified view of steps 100–120.
Description of Left Panel (Overall Behavior)
• A. Lotka-Volterra Oscillation: The internal LV model generates stable oscillations in the
concentrations of X and Y, which in turn drives the oscillation in the production rate of P.
• B. Temperature Convergence: The cell temperature progressively converges toward the
set optimal temperature (22°C), effectively decoupling from the fluctuating external water
temperature.
• C. Replication Rate: Consequently, the replication rate, β, is maintained near its
maximum value of approximately 1.0.
• D. Memory Molecules: The concentrations of the memory molecules, M good and M bad ,
fluctuate antagonistically to regulate the system and maintain the optimal temperature.
• Initial Phase: The period up to time step 70, where the cell temperature deviates
significantly from the optimum and β is low, is considered an initial adjustment phase due
to the low initial values of the memory molecules.
Description of Right Panel (Core Adaptive Logic) The magnified view details the core
adaptive mechanism at work:
• The yellow-shaded region highlights a phase where the production rate of P and the
replication rate β are positively correlated (both increasing). As per the model's rules, this
promotes the production of M , which increases the albedo and in turn lowers the cell
good
temperature toward the optimum.
• The green-shaded region highlights a phase where the trends are anti-correlated (P
production is decreasing while β is increasing). This promotes the production of M ,
bad
which decreases the albedo and thereby raises the cell temperature, again moving it toward
the optimum.
22
This step-by-step analysis confirms that the model is operating as designed, successfully
adjusting its temperature via the correlation-based feedback loop.

Appendix A-7. A Hypothetical Implementation via Allosteric Enzyme Control
Proposed Chemical Scenario
The following is a hypothetical, yet plausible, chemical scenario for implementing the
correlation-detection mechanism described in Section 4.3.
1. First, we assume that the rate of change of the internal state (x) and the rate
of change of success (y) are represented by the concentrations of distinct chemical
signals, let us call them Sx and Sy. For example, in a system where the production
rate of Sx is proportional to x and its degradation rate is constant, the concentration
[Sx] would effectively track the value of x .
2. Next, we consider an enzyme, E , that produces the memory molecule
good
M . This enzyme is proposed to have allosteric binding sites for both Sx and (as
good Sy
25
depicted in Supplementary Figure 2) .
3. The crucial point is that E only exhibits catalytic activity when Sx and Sy
good
bind cooperatively. This mechanism functions as a chemical "AND" gate, activating
the enzyme to produce M only when the trends of the two signals align (i.e., when
good
x and y are both positive).
4. Conversely, the production of M can be explained in a similar manner, by
bad
postulating a different enzyme, E , that is activated only when the trends of x and
bad
y are opposed .
In this way, the sigmoid-like switching response, σ(cxy), described in Section 4.3 can
emerge from the fundamental biochemical principle of enzyme cooperativity. This
suggests that the adaptive mechanism of our model is implementable as a simple chemical
reaction network that obeys the law of mass action. This interpretation is theoretically
supported by recent studies that demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between
chemical kinetics and Bayesian inference (19).
Supplementary Figure 2. Conceptual diagram of an allosteric enzyme for correlation detection.
The enzyme E good has distinct binding sites for a signal Sx (representing the trend in the internal
state) and a signal Sy (representing the trend in the success rate). The enzyme is activated to
produce M only upon the cooperative binding of both signals. This system functions as a
good
chemical "AND" gate, generating M only when the directions of the two trends align.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Emergence of Active Inference from a Chemical Oscillator: A Constructive Approach to Pre-genetic Homeostasis"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
