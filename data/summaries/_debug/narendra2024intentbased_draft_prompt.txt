A. Rapid Resource Allocation and Scheduling
Rapid (typically sub-millisecond) resource allocation and
scheduling in programmable networks is crucial for several
reasons:
• Quality of Service (QoS): Programmable networks need
to maintain specific QoS parameters. Rapid scheduling
helps prioritize critical traffic and ensures that service
level agreements (SLAs) are met.
• Network Slicing: With the emergence of 5G and eventu-
ally6G,networkslicing[28]allowsdifferentapplications
to run on the same physical infrastructure while meeting
diverse performance requirements. Rapid resource allo-
cation is essential for managing these slices effectively.
• LatencySensitivity:Manyapplications,suchasreal-time
communications,onlinegaming,andUAVs(asevidenced
fromtheexampleinSectionIIIabove),requireextremely
low latency. Delays in resource allocation can lead to
degraded user experiences.

In addition to the above, in large-scale real-life pro-

to potential conflicts, which would degrade network perfor-

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Intent-based Meta-Scheduling in Programmable Networks: A Research Agenda"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
