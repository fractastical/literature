This paper explores the core concepts of world models and predictive coding, examining their application within the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. The authors argue that a fundamental challenge in robotics lies in creating systems that can effectively learn, adapt, and interact with complex environments, a task that requires the ability to construct and maintain internal representations of the world.The authors state: “A key challenge in robotics is to develop systems that can learn and adapt to changing environments.” They further note, “The ability to predict future states is crucial for effective action planning.” The core of this approach rests on the concept of world models – internal representations of the external world that allow robots to anticipate events and react accordingly. These models are not static; they are constantly updated based on sensory input and experience.The paper outlines several key aspects of this approach. First, the concept of hierarchical representation is introduced, where information is organized in a layered manner, with higher levels of abstraction building upon lower levels. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient processing of complex information and facilitates the integration of different sensory modalities. The authors state: “A hierarchical structure is essential for processing complex information.”Second, the role of predictive coding is highlighted. Predictive coding is a mechanism by which the brain generates predictions about sensory input and compares these predictions with actual sensory input. Any discrepancy between the prediction and the actual input is then used to update the internal model. This process is crucial for learning and adaptation. The authors state: “Predictive coding is a mechanism for generating predictions about sensory input.”The paper details several key elements of this approach.
