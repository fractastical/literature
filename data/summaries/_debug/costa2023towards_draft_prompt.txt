Following the typology of particles introduced in the target article [1], we introduce a further distinction
between cognitive and metacognitive particles. Metacognitive particles are called as such because they have
beliefs about (some of) their own beliefs.

lower level, i.e. µ ) are hidden from internal states (at the higher level, i.e. µ ). In other words, higher level

internal states must infer the lower level internal states via the sensory states, leading to the metacognitive
belief qm.

The form of the coupling is summarised in Figure 1. We will call µ the higher-level internal states and µ
1 2
the lower-level internal states in virtue of the fact that µ will be seen as encoding beliefs at a higher level,
1
i.e. some sort of metacognition.
Analogously to the discussion on strange particles [1, eq. 29], the form of the coupling (1), means that
sensory states are a Markov blanket between higher- and lower-level internal states:
(µ⃗ ⊥⃗η,⃗a,µ⃗ )|⃗s (2)
1 2
In particular, the lower internal states can only be inferred vicariously by the higher internal states via the
sensorystates. Sowecandefinemetacognitive beliefsencodedbythehigher-levelinternalstatesqm(⃗η,⃗a,µ⃗ ),

Thissortofbeliefsencodedbythehigherinternalstateaboutthelowerinternalstateisinterestingbecauseit
implies that the higher internal states encode beliefs about beliefs, licensing the metacognitive terminology.
Indeed, recall that a particle holds beliefs q (⃗η) about the external world encoded by the internal states,
µ⃗
where by definition [1],
q (⃗η)=p(⃗η |⃗s,⃗a)
µ⃗
(4)
µ⃗ ≜argmaxp(µ⃗ |⃗s,⃗a)
µ⃗
(See [2] for an explicit construction). It then follows that metacognitive beliefs encode information about
the parameters of beliefs about the world, evincing a form of parametric depth [3]. Perhaps the easiest way
to see this is when the particular beliefs factorise according to a mean-field approximation:
q (⃗η)=q (⃗η)q (⃗η) (5)
µ⃗ µ⃗1 µ⃗2
Then the (marginal) metacognitive belief qm(µ⃗ ) is a belief about the belief q (⃗η). The upshot is that once
µ⃗1 2 µ⃗2
we have beliefs about some of our own internal states, we are bound to exhibit a form of metacognition that
influences behaviour. For example, a person who is surprised by their sudden inability to taste coffee (a
possible sign of pancreatic cancer) might introspect and act accordingly [4]. In summary:
Definition 1 (Cognitive and metacognitive particles). A metacognitive particle is a particle which holds
metacognitive beliefs, i.e. beliefs about beliefs, e.g. as in (3). Any non-metacognitive particle, on the other
hand, is a cognitive particle, given that it holds beliefs about the world.
Note also that we could study higher levels of metacognition, by considering particles with a unidirected
chain of internal states µ → µ → ... → µ , cf. Figure 1. In this case the internal states at the highest
1 2 n
level, i.e. µ , may encode beliefs about beliefs about beliefs etc (n times).

In conclusion, we believe that the typology of particles laid down in the target article [1] is promising, not
least for a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle [5]. As a result, we
are starting to be able to derive formal descriptions of cognition that are increasingly specific to entities
possessing higher forms of cognition, such as, we hope, the human being.

   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Towards a Bayesian mechanics of metacognitive particles: A commentary on "Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things" by Friston, Da Costa, Sakthivadivel, Heins, Pavliotis, Ramstead, and Parr"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims

   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
