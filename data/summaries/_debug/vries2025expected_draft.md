### OverviewThis paper investigates the problem of planning under uncertainty, proposing a solution based on Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization as a variational inference framework. The authors argue that traditional approaches to planning often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing EFE, a cost function that combines instrumental (goal-directed) and epistemic (information-seeking) components. The central contribution is to demonstrate that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. The formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.### MethodologyThe authors state: "The core of our approach is to cast planning under uncertainty as a problem of variational inference." They note: "Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP), provides such a foundation." The authors argue: "Central to this framework is the Expected Free Energy (EFE), a unified objective that combines instrumental (goal-directed) and epistemic (information-seeking) components." They explain: "Minimizing EFE yields behavior that simultaneously pursues preferred outcomes and resolves uncertainty, providing a theoretically grounded solution to the exploration–exploitation trade-off." The authors further state: "In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors." The authors also note: "The generative model is defined as p(yxθu)." The authors explain: "The variational free energy functional F[q] is defined as F[q] = E log q(u) +E (cid:2) log q(yxθ|u) (cid:3) , where q(yxθ|u) is the variational posterior." The authors also introduce the complexity term C(u) which accounts for bounded computational resources. The authors state: "The generative model is augmented with preference and epistemic priors."### ResultsThe authors state: "We show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors."

[2021]." They note: "Conceptually, it is somewhat inelegant to alternate between different cost functions depending on the location of computation within the factor graph."
