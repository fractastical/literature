### OverviewThis paper investigates a fundamental drive within humans to understand and be understood, even in the absence of extrinsic rewards. Through simulations of the perceptual crossing paradigm, the authors explore how intrinsic reward functions, such as artificial curiosity and reciprocal understanding, can drive agents to prioritize interaction and cooperation. The research suggests that this intrinsic motivation, rooted in primary intersubjectivity, can facilitate collaborative tasks where only one agent receives an external reward.### MethodologyThe authors employ a multi-agent interaction scenario within a1D “Perceptual Crossing” environment. Two agents, each with an LSTM model, attempt to predict and elicit crossings from the other agent. The agents receive reward signals based on their ability to anticipate and influence the other agent's actions. Specifically, the reward function is designed to incentivize agents to minimize prediction errors when the other agent crosses their shadow, or when the other agent crosses their own stationary object. The agents are trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms, with a key feature being that the agents are rewarded for mutual information, and the reward is only given when the agent is able to predict the other agent’s actions. The authors also implement a delay of2 timesteps between the observation and action of the agents, to allow the agents to anticipate the other agent’s actions.### ResultsThe results demonstrate that agents, when driven by intrinsic motivation, prioritize interaction with each other, even when only one agent receives an external reward. 

The authors observed that the agents learn to coordinate their actions to elicit crossings from the other agent, effectively creating a shared understanding without explicit extrinsic rewards. 

The agents’ learning curves show a clear preference for interacting with the other agent, and the mutual information reward function is key to th...

reward as in Figure 4. This is because agents
learn to take it in turns to obtain reward, first
agent0 influences (or is influenced by) agent1,
and then agent1 influences (or is influenced by)
agent0. Also, in the PCP, agent0 influencing 1
makes it more likely that agent1 can influence
agent0, because they are closer together, and so
a separate drive to be influenced does not seem
to be needed4

=== REVISE TO ===
PROFESSIONAL TONE: Begin directly with content - NO conversational openings like 'Okay, here's...'

1. Fix all issues above
2. Title: "Wanting to be Understood"
3. Include 10-15 quotes from paper text
   - Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
   - Use consistent quote formatting: 'The authors state: "quote"' or vary attribution phrases
   - Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition
   - CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
4. ELIMINATE ALL REPETITION - each sentence must be unique
   - Check before each sentence: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary attribution phrases - do NOT repeat 'The authors state' multiple times
5. Extract methodology, results with numbers, key quotes
6. 1000-1500 words, structured with ### headers
