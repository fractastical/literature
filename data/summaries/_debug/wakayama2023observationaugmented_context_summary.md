Observation-Augmented Contextual Multi-Armed
Bandits for Robotic Search and Exploration
Shohei Wakayama and Nisar Ahmed∗
Abstract—We introduce a new variant of contextual multi-
armed bandits (CMABs) called observation-augmented CMABs He wanted to observe hydrate
(OA-CMABs) wherein a robot uses extra outcome observations
from an external information source, e.g. humans. In OA-
CMABs,externalobservationsareafunctionofcontextfe...
