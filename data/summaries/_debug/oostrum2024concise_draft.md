### A Concise Mathematical Description of Active Inference in Discrete Time – Summary### OverviewThis paper presents a concise mathematical description of active inference in discrete time, aiming to provide a clear and accessible introduction to the topic. The authors emphasize precise and standard mathematical notation, ensuring consistency with existing literature. The paper is structured into an introduction, a detailed discussion of the mathematical details, and a worked example illustrating the action selection mechanism. The authors provide a Python implementation of the action selection and learning mechanisms, compatible with pymdp environments.### MethodologyThe core of active inference, as presented here, relies on a generative model that represents the environment's dynamics. This model is characterized by a state variable ‘s’ and an observation variable ‘o’. The agent selects actions based on a policy π, which is determined by minimizing the expected free energy function G(π |o ,a ). The free energy function is defined as the sum of two terms: the epistemic value, representing the information gain about the future states, and the utility, representing the similarity between the expected future observations and the preferred observation distribution. The agent updates its beliefs about the current state and future states using Bayes’ rule, and the learning mechanism updates the parameters of the generative model based on the observed data. The authors use a mean-field approximation, assuming that the state factors and observation modalities are independent given the state factor. The model is parameterized by a Dirichlet prior, and the update rules are derived from this prior. The authors provide a Python implementation of the action selection and learning mechanisms, compatible with pymdp environments.### Key Findings & ClaimsThe authors state: "The core idea of active inference is to model the agent’s perception and action selection as a process of minimizing the expected free energy."1. They note: "The agent is more likely to sample policies that have a low expected free energy, which corresponds to high information gain and utility."2. The paper argues: "The agent’s belief about the future states is updated using Bayes’ rule."3. The authors state: “The agent selects its next action by sampling a policy from the following distribution: σ(−G(π |o ,a )).”4. The study demonstrates: “The KL divergence between the posterior distribution and the prior distribution is a key component of the free energy function.”5.

The Python implementation includes a function to compute the free energy, a function to sample a policy, and a function to update the parameters of the generative model. The Python implementation is designed to be easy to use and understand. The authors also provide a worked example of action selection in a T-maze environment. The T-maze environment is a standard benchmark for active inference algorithms. The authors demonstrate that the action selection mechanism can successfully guide the agent to the correct arm of the T-maze. The authors use a mean-field approximation, assuming that the state factors and observation modalities are independent given the state factor. The authors use a Dirichlet prior to parameterize the generative model. The authors update the parameters of the generative model based on the observed data. The Python implementation is designed to be easy to use and understand.### DiscussionThe authors’ approach offers a concise and mathematically rigorous framework for understanding active inference. The use of the free energy function provides a clear and intuitive way to quantify the agent’s uncertainty and reward. The mean-field approximation simplifies the calculations while still capturing the essential features of the model. The Python implementation provides a practical tool for exploring and experimenting with active inference algorithms. The authors’ work represents a valuable contribution to the field of active inference, and their paper is likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners in a wide range of disciplines.
