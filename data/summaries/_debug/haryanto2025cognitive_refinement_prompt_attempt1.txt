principlesofexistencethathavebeenarticulatedacrossdifferentdomains.

CognitiveSilicon WORKINGPAPER
Aristotle’s notion of teleology—the idea that entities have inherent purposes or ends toward which they naturally
develop—couldfindmathematicalexpressionintheFEP’sconceptualizationofsystemsminimizingpredictionerrors
relativetoagenerativemodel. WhatAristotleidentifiedasanentity’stelosmightbecome,inFEPterms,theattractor
statestowardwhichasystem’sdynamicsconvergethroughpredictionerrorminimization. TheAristotelianconceptthat
entitiesacttofulfilltheirnatureconceptuallyalignswiththeFEP’sformulationofactiveinference,wheresystemsact
tomakesensoryinputsconformtotheirpredictions.
Similarly,Aristotle’sconceptofenergeia(actualization)—theprocessthroughwhichpotentialbecomesactual—parallels
the FEP’s description of how systems actively modify their environments to bring sensory evidence in line with
predictions. Thisactiveinferenceprocesswouldrepresenttheactualizationofthepossibilitiescontainedwithinthe
system’sgenerativemodel.
Aristotle’shylomorphism—thetheorythatbeingconsistsofbothmatter(hyle)andform(morphe)—resonateswiththe
FEP’sintegrationofphysicalembodimentandinformation-theoreticmodelstructure. Thephysicalsubstratewould
providethematerialbasis,whilethegenerativemodelwouldsupplytheformalorganizationthatguidesthesystem’s

entity’scontinuedexistence—directlyparallelstheFEP’scorepremisethatself-organizingsystemsmustminimize

This theoretical convergence suggests that what the Free Energy Principle offers is not merely a novel theory of

8 DiscussionandImplications
8.1 NavigatingtheUnfinishedBlueprint
Thetensionsexploredpreviouslyaren’tdesignflawsbutfundamentalphilosophicalchallengesinherenttocognitive
architectures. Ratherthanpretendingcleverengineeringcanresolvethem,ourblueprintacknowledgesthemasessential
designconsiderations.
The specified architecture represents a direction rather than an answer—a hypothetical framework for navigating
tensionsacrossdiverseapplicationcontextsratherthaneliminatingthem. Cognitivesilicon’struechallengewould
lie not merely in technical implementation but philosophical navigation—finding balance between constraint and
emergence,governanceandautonomy,certaintyandcreativity.
Whatisparticularlystrikingishowourdialectically-derivedarchitecturetheoreticallyconvergeswiththemathematical
framework offered by the Free Energy Principle. This convergence suggests that the tensions and imperatives we
identifiedmightnotbearbitrarydesignchoices,butcouldreflectfundamentalpropertiesofself-organizingcognitive
systems. TheFEPpotentiallyprovidesformalgroundingforwhatourdialecticalprocessrevealedthroughdifferent

8.2 IntegrationwithSocialandEcologicalSystems
Ouroutlinedcognitivearchitecturewouldultimatelyneedtointegratewithbroadersocialandecologicalsystems. As
exploredinpreviouspost-scarcityframeworkwork[Haryanto,2025],technologicalcapabilityrequiresphilosophical
purposeguidancetoservehumanflourishing.
The transition toward cognitive computing architectures coincides with other fundamental transformations—from
scarcitytoabundanceeconomics,fromextractivetoregenerativenaturalsystemrelationships,andfromcompetitionto

acknowledgment:
1. Speculative Timeframe: The 2035 projection is highly speculative, based on subjective technological
trajectoryassessment. Thedescribedarchitecturalevolutionactualtimelinemaybeshorterorlonger.
2. ImplementationGaps: Whileoutliningarchitecturalprinciplesandrequirements,thepaperdoesnotprovide
detailed implementation specifications. Significant research and development work would be needed to

4. CulturalandContextualVariation: Thepaperinadequatelyaddressesarchitecturalrequirementvariation

5. InteractionwithRegulatoryFrameworks: Thepaperdoesnotfullyexplorehowtheproposedarchitecture
might interact with emerging AI governance regulatory frameworks. Future work should examine these
relationshipsmoreclosely.
Severalpromisingfutureresearchdirectionsemerge:
1. EmbodiedCognitive-SubstrateFeedback: Developingpracticalimplementationsofthehypotheticaltwo-

9.1 Meta-PromptingTechniquesforEnhancedDialecticalExploration
Thedialecticalmethodologyemployeddemonstratesstructuredhuman-AIpartnerships’potentialforexploringcomplex
architecturalquestions. However,ourapproachcouldbenefitfrommoresystematicmeta-promptingtechniques. We
proposeseveralfutureresearchapproaches:
1. ExplicitRoleAssignment: AssigningspecificdialecticalrolestoLLMs(thesisadvocate,antithesisadvocate,
synthesizer)couldcreatemorestructureddialecticaltension. Exampleprompts:
• "ArgueforpositionX,presentingthestrongestpossiblecasebasedonprinciplesA,B,andC."
• "Criticallyexaminethepreviousargument,focusingspecificallyonassumptionsaboutY."
2. RecursiveCritiqueChains: CreatingexplicitargumentationchainswhereeachstepinvolvesLLMcritiquing
previousresponseatincreasinglymeta-levels:
• "Analyzeyourpreviousresponseforhiddenassumptionsorunexaminedtrade-offs."
• "Identifywhichstakeholderperspectiveswereprivilegedormarginalizedinyouranalysis."
3. EpistemicStateTracking: Maintainingexplicitbeliefstaterepresentationsateachdialoguestage:
• "Beforecontinuing,summarize:(1)whatwenowbelievewithhighconfidence,(2)whatremainsuncertain,
and(3)whichperspectiveswemaybeoverlooking."
• "Createalabeledmapofourcurrentunderstandingshowingfixedpoints,probableconjectures,and
openquestions."
4. Multi-Model Triangulation: Systematically comparing responses from different models with different
trainingcharacteristics:
• "Basedonthesedivergentmodelresponses,identifywhereconceptualconsensusexistsversuswhere
differenttrainingorarchitectureleadstodifferentconclusions."
24
CognitiveSilicon WORKINGPAPER
5. TemporalProjectionTesting: Explicitlyexploringhowperspectiveswouldevolveunderdifferentfuture
conditions:
• "HowwouldthisarchitecturalapproachneedtobemodifiedifassumptionXprovedfalsein2030?"
• "Project three different evolution paths for this component based on different rates of progress in
capabilitiesversusalignment."
These meta-prompting techniques could formalize dialectical processes, creating more rigorous epistemic friction
andpotentiallyrevealingdeeperinsights. Furthermore,theycouldbecodifiedintoreusabletemplatesfordifferent
architecturalexplorationphases,frominitialproblemframingthroughsolutionsynthesis.
Futureworkshoulddevelopthesetechniquesintocomprehensivehuman-AIdialecticalresearchmethodology, po-
tentiallycreatingnewcollaborativeknowledgecreationformsleveragingbothhumanwisdomandmachinepattern

Beyond identified future research directions, multi-agent simulation offers a promising cognitive architecture pre-
deploymentevaluationframework. RecentworkbyParketal. demonstratedcomplexsocialbehaviorsemergingfrom
simulationscontainingmultiplelanguage-model-poweredAIagents[Parketal.,2023]. Their"smalltown"simulation
featured 25 generative agents that "wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write;
theyformopinions,noticeeachother,andinitiateconversations"similartosocialsimulationgamesbutAI-driven.
Withminimalseedinstructions,theseagentsproducedcoherentsocialpatterns—spreadinginvitations,coordinating
events,andformingrelationships. ThisapproachsuggeststwovaluableCognitiveSiliconframeworkextensions: First,
multi-agentsimulationscouldserveasevaluationenvironmentswhereAIsystemcopiesinteractincontrolledscenarios,
potentially revealing emergent behaviors, coordination patterns, or alignment failures not apparent in single-agent
testing. Second,thearchitectureitselfmightincorporatemulti-agentprinciplesinternally,usingspecializedsub-agent

10 Conclusion: TowardsTrustworthyCognitiveSystems
Thisexploratorypaperilluminatesaprofoundhypotheticaltransformation—apossiblejourneyfromsiloedcomponents
toward integrated, full-stack cognitive systems. The 2035 projection represents an architectural possibility driven
by current paradigm limitations and demand for more efficient, adaptable, and trustworthy AI rather than trend
extrapolation. Architecturespotentiallyconvergingaroundstate-awarestreamprocessing,layeredsymbolic-parametric
models,mortality-constrainedhybridhardwaresubstrates,andagent-nativeruntimesmayemergeovertime.

Whatbecomesclearthroughthisexplorationisthatourdialectically-derivedframeworksuggestsstructuresthatcould

suggeststhatthearchitecturewe’veoutlinedmightnotbemerelyonepossibledesignamongmany,butcouldreflect

AppendixA:TheMeta-DialecticalMethodologyBehindThisArchitecture
This appendix documents the recursive epistemic process through which the Cognitive Silicon architecture was
developed. Ratherthandescribingthearchitectureitself, wedetailthemeta-dialecticalmethodologyemployedto
interrogate,refine,andvalidatetheconceptualframeworkacrossabstractionlayers.
A.1FormalMethodOverview
ThedevelopmentoftheCognitiveSiliconarchitectureemployedastructuredmeta-dialecticalapproachdesignedto
identify,elaborate,andresolvetensionsacrosscomputational-philosophicalboundaries. Unliketraditionalresearch
methodologiesthatseekdirectconvergenceonsolutions,thisapproachdeliberatelycultivatesepistemicfrictionto
exposehiddenassumptions,blindspots,andconceptualinconsistencies.
Formally,themethodcanbedefinedasfollows:
D(T,C,A,P,M)→A∗ (1)
Where:
• Drepresentsthedialecticalprocess
• T isthesetoffoundationalthesesandinitialconditions
• C definesthecoreconstraints(mortality,human-alignment,etc.)
• Arepresentsthearchitecturalhypothesisspace
• P isthesetofprojectionoperators(testingviabilityacrosscontexts)
• Misthesetofmeta-levelevaluationcriteria
• A∗istheresultantarchitecturalframework
Theprocessproceedsthroughstructurediterationsofthesisproposal,antithesisgeneration,andsyntheticreconciliation,
withthecrucialadditionofcross-contextualrobustnesstestingandsymbolicintegrityverificationateachstep.

28: endwhile
29: returnA i
30: endprocedure
A.4TerminationLogic
Thedialecticalprocessterminatesunderthefollowingconditions:
• PositiveTermination:
∀p∈P,∀m∈M:Project(p,A )satisfiesm (2)
i
Thisoccurswhenthearchitecturewithstandsallprojectionsaccordingtothemeta-criteria,withnoidentified
leakages,inconsistencies,orunresolvedtensions.
• NegativeTermination:
∃c∈A :¬MoralCoherence(c,C)∧¬CanRevise(c) (3)
i
Thisoccurswhenacomponentviolatesacoreconstraintinawaythatcannotberevisedwithoutundermining
theentirearchitecture.
• TimeoutTermination:
i>MAX_ITERATIONS (4)
Thisoccurswhentheprocessexceedsapredefinediterationlimit,indicatingpotentialirresolvablecomplexity
orfundamentalantinomies.
A.5EvaluationGuarantees
Themeta-dialecticalmethodologyprovidesthefollowingguaranteesabouttheresultantarchitecture:
• Symbolic Coherence: All architectural components maintain internal consistency and cross-component
compatibility.
• MortalityAwareness: Thearchitectureexplicitlyacknowledgesandaddressesitsownfinitudeandlimitations.
• Devil’sAdvocacySurvival: Eachcomponenthaswithstoodthestrongeststeelmannedoppositionarguments.
• Cross-DomainIntegrity: Thearchitecturemaintainscoherencewhenprojectedintodiversedomainsand
contexts.
30
CognitiveSilicon WORKINGPAPER
• ReflectiveEquilibrium: Thearchitectureachievesbalancebetweenconcreteimplementationspecifications
andabstractprinciples.
These guarantees do not ensure optimality or completeness, but rather a form of robust adequacy in the face of
foundationaltensions.
A.6TheDevil’sAdvocateasEpistemicOperator

2. Steelmanningalternativeapproaches
3. Exploringedgecaseswherethecomponentmightfail
4. Testingforalignmentwithcoreconstraints
5. Surfacingcross-architecturalinconsistencies
Thisprovidessignificantlystrongervalidationthanconfirmation-biasedanalysis. InthedevelopmentoftheCognitive
Silicon architecture, this role was shared between human researcher and AI system, with each applying different
epistemicstrengths:
• Human Devil’s Advocacy: Applied experience-grounded skepticism, moral intuition, and cross-domain
analogies.
• AIDevil’sAdvocacy: Systematicallyidentifiedlogicalgaps,constraintviolations,andunexaminedassump-
tionsatscale.
A.7SymbolicDriftResistance

A.8TacitKnowledgeandEpistemicSilence
Themethodologyexplicitlyacknowledgesthatcertainknowledgecannotbefullyarticulated(tacitknowledge)andthat

• PrincipledUncertainty: Explicitlymarkingareaswhereepistemiclimitationsrequireadaptivityratherthan

The methodology employs a principle that architectural components must earn their place through demonstrating
