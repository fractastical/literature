In this short communication we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two
masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston’s free energy principle in

we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy
function defined in terms of stress on the agents’ beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian)

consensus when k = 0 for all i; that is, when there are

as is expected for a dissipative system. This is shown in
Fig. 2, where k =0.3 for all i.

This is a classic two-mass spring system in a non-
Euclidean geometry. In the Euclidean case, it is easy
to see the resulting dynamics are integrable and admit
two constants of motion, the energy (given by the corre-
sponding Hamiltonian) and the linear momentum of the
total system. In contrast, we can show numerically that
the Hamiltonian dynamics in Eq. (9) are not integrable,
showing signs of weak chaos [63].

arise in the dynamics generated by Eq. (9). We find ev-

[64]. In particular, we used Sandri’s implementation of
the Wolf algorithm [65], which returns an estimation of

is T ≈ 1.9. Numerical experimentation indicates that
reasonable control solutions can be found for T > 2.2,
belowwhichboththeexactsystemandtheforwardsim-
ulation of the approximate control system become stiff.
As T approaches this threshold the approximate control
curve gets closer to the boundaries of the geometry, and
the approximation breaks down.
As an alternative to controlling the belief distribu-
tion by changing θ′, we can instead fix θ′ = θ to be
f
the desired belief and use the spring constant k as the
control parameter. We use the same objective function
as Eq. (13) with the quadratic cost C (k) = βk2. We

use this cost for both the exact dynamics, given by H,
and approximate dynamics, given by H . The result-

ing k-control problems do not appear to have a simple
closed-form solution. However, the approximate control
problem is again a LQC problem and both formulations
are much better behaved numerically than the θ′-control
formulation. This is because the control parameter k
does not lie on the information manifold and is not as
strongly impacted by the manifold curvature.
As an example, consider the same control problem as
√
above except with θ′ = 3arccos 0.9 and T = 1. As
before, we compute both the solution to the full control
HamiltonianaswellastheapproximatecontrolHamilto-
nian. For the approximate solution we again recompute
the forward problem using the exact dynamics. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 6. Again the second-order ap-
proximation provides reasonable control of the full sys-
tem, although the approximate solution underestimates
the response of the belief to the control variable for the
samereasonsastheθ′-controlcase. Theapproximateso-
lution produces a final belief of q =0.94, instead of the f
intended target q =0.9. f
Notably the time horizon for this formulation of the
problem is smaller than the minimum threshold esti-
mated for the θ′-control formulation. Since k is not
bounded by the information geometry there is no cor-
responding threshold in the k-control case and the nu-
merical problem remains tractable down to T ≈0.1.
While a more thorough analysis of this information
control problem, including joint (k,θ′)-control, is out-
side the scope of this paper, this initial analysis indi-
cates that the spring constant (i.e., social pressure) is a
more robust control parameter than the observed belief.
At a high level this is because the spring constant pro-
duces information potentials which scale linearly, while
the observed belief can only achieve large potentials by

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this paper, we introduced a model of belief combin-
ing Friston’s minimum energy principle and information
geometry, making use of the Bayesian brain hypothesis.
Using a Bernoulli distribution as a model of an agent’s
belief about a bivalent topic (e.g., humans cause climate
change), we showed how to recover a variant of DeGroot
opinion dynamics via a classical Lagrangian. We fur-
thershowedconditionsunderwhichopinionconvergesor
comes to consensus through the use of a dissipative La-
grangian. In studying the nonlinear dynamics for two
agents arising from the non-dissipative form of the La-
grangian,weshowedthatthecorrespondingHamiltonian
was a perturbation of a well-known integrable Hamilto-
nian. Despite the fact that the KAM theorem does not
apply in this case, we illustrated symplectic flow near
the fixed points and used Wolf’s algorithm to numeri-
cally prove the existence of chaotic behavior in trajecto-
ries near the boundary.
Instudyingthecontrolproblemarisingfromthesedy-
namics,weidentifiedinterestingfactsabouttheproblem
of persuasion. We found that manipulating peer pres-
sure with a fixed (preferred) belief state is a more sta-
ble approach to altering an agent’s belief than providing
a slowly changing belief state that approaches a target.

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Dynamics of An Information Theoretic Analog of Two Masses on a Spring"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'
