### OverviewThis summary synthesizes the key findings of “Empirical Translation Process Research: Past and Possible Future Perspectives” by Michael Carl. The paper traces the evolution of empirical translation process research (TPR) within the CRITT TPR-DB tradition, proposing the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) as a framework for modeling deeply embedded translation processes. The research highlights the importance of quantitative data collection and analysis, emphasizing the need for a rigorous theoretical foundation to advance TPR.### MethodologyThe authors state: "In the1970s, Translation Studies emerged as an empirical, scientific (descriptive) discipline." They note that early attempts to study translation as a cognitive activity date back to the1960s and1970s, referencing Albir (2015) and Muñoz (2017).The paper details the development of TPR, beginning with introspective methods, primarily translation protocols (TAPs) and retrospection, and subsequently transitioning to behavioral methods, including keylogging and eye-tracking, sometimes in combination with cued retrospection. The authors further point out that “TPR has been dominated methodologically, first by the use of introspective methods, primarily TAPs and retrospection, then by (micro‐) behavioral methods, keylogging and eye‐tracking, sometimes in combination with cued retrospection.” The study emphasizes the integration of data from various sources, including eye-tracking, keylogging, and other sensor technologies, to capture a comprehensive picture of the translation process. The CRITT TPR-DB, established within the EU Eye-to-IT project (2005-2009) and subsequently CASMACAT (2011-2014), serves as a central repository for these datasets. The authors state: “The CRITT TPR-DB has thus evolved into an open-access framework with several possibilities for further extension into various directions, to accommodate diverse data-acquisition tools (e.g., Translog-II, Carl2012, and CASMACAT; Alabau et al.2014), and more recently Trados (Zou et al.2022, Yamada at al.2022), to prototype new features and explore different explanatory models of the translation process.” The paper details the development of a query language to generate and extract features from the raw TPR-DB data, although this proved impractical due to the size of the data. The authors state: “A large body of data and research findings have been produced in the past two decades. More than5000 translation sessions and hundreds of hours of TPD have been recorded so far. A part of the data is publicly accessible to everyone, free of charge; the raw logging data is1” The authors highlight the integration of data from various sources, including eye-tracking, keylogging, and other sensor technologies, to capture a comprehensive picture of the translation process.### ResultsThe research has yielded a substantial amount of data, with over5000 translation sessions and hundreds of hours of translated text recorded. The CRITT TPR-DB, a publicly accessible database, contains this data, allowing researchers to analyze translation processes in detail. The authors state: “The CRITT TPR-DB has thus evolved into an open-access framework with several possibilities for further extension into various directions, to accommodate diverse data-acquisition tools (e.g., Translog-II, Carl2012, and CASMACAT; Alabau et al.2014), and more recently Trados (Zou et al.2022, Yamada at al.2022), to prototype new features and explore different explanatory models of the translation process.” The authors have identified several key features of translation processes, including temporal aspects (translation duration), translation effort, and the distribution of (visual) attention, as gathered by eye-tracking devices. The authors state: “TPR has been dominated methodologically, first by the use of introspective methods, primarily TAPs and retrospection, then by (micro‐) behavioral methods, keylogging and eye‐tracking, sometimes in combination with cued retrospection, and more recently by the application of computational methods in the analysis of very large amounts of process data.” The authors have observed that translation processes can be characterized by distinct phases, with varying levels of effort and attention.### DiscussionThe paper proposes a framework for understanding translation processes based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF). The authors state: “The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) constitute a unifying perspective on how biological organisms maintain a balance between their internal states and the external environment, necessary to ensure their survival in an ever-changing environment.” The FEP and AIF provide a mathematical framework for modeling translation processes, allowing researchers to investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms involved. The authors state: “FEP has been formulated within a mathematical rigorous framework (i.e., Bayesian reasoning) in which (artificial) agents are modelled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) that can learn from experiences, and it has been analyzed within an enactivist framework (Bruineberg et al.2018; Kirchhoff and Kiverstein2021; Carl2023).” The authors suggest that AIF may also be a promising path to advance (predictive) TPR in the next decade or so. The authors state: “Several competing theoretical approaches have been deployed within the field of CTS that account for the extended and enacted nature of translation (Risku2012; Risku and Rogl2020; Carl2021; Muñoz2021), while Schaeffer et al. (2020,3939) announce the ‘predictive turn in translation studies’ in which machine learning approaches would be used for modelling human translation processes and for predicting ‘when and why a translator is having trouble carrying out the [translation] task’ (3940).”### Future DirectionsThe paper concludes by suggesting that the FEP and AIF represent a suitable framework for future research in TPR, opening up exciting prospects for understanding and modeling the complex cognitive processes involved in translation. The authors state: “In this article I argue that the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) constitute a suited framework to account for these new demands: FEP and AIF are formulated within a mathematical rigorous framework (i.e., Bayesian reasoning) in which (artificial) agents are modelled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) that can learn from experiences, and it has been analyzed within an enactivist framework (Bruineberg et al.2018; Kirchhoff and Kiverstein2021; Carl2023).”
