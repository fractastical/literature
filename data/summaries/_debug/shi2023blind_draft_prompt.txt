Through the emulation of IGM for active inference using
conditional DDPM, we successfully obtained the primary
content. It is important to note that conditional DDPM is not
intended to completely restore a distorted image to the reference
image, but the predicted primary content may present the
reference image much better than the distorted input. Therefore,
our goal is to estimate a dissimilarity map from this primary
content, rather than merely quantifying the disparity between
the distorted image and its primary content. The process for
generating this dissimilarity map is depicted in Fig. 2.
After we obtain the primary content with the conditional
DDPM, we calculate the SSIM map between the distorted
image and the primary content, which assigns values between 0
and 1 to each and every pixel, with 0 indicating the lowest
dissimilarity and 1 representing the perfect similarity. As
dissimilarity indicates the presence of distortion, a critical
factor in assessing image quality, we subtract the SSIM map
from an all-one matrix 𝑰 to obtain the dissimilarity weights,
where larger values signify more severe distortions. Finally, we
calculate the Hadamard product between the distorted image
and the dissimilarity weights to obtain the dissimilarity map.
With this dissimilarity map as an input, the subsequent image
quality evaluator can more effectively leverage the

resultant image appears overly smooth, deviating from the
authentic appearance of the real clinical counterpart. The
DDPM approach emerges as an accurate yet robust solution,
effectively suppressing noise and streak artifacts while
simultaneously preserving intricate details. Furthermore, the
distribution of the images closely aligns with that of real clinical
reference images. As a result, opting for DDPM to generate
high-quality primary contents proves feasible and
advantageous, facilitating an accurate emulation of the IGM
principle within the HVS.
B. Visualization of the Prior Information
By employing primary contents generated through DDPM,
we can glean insights into the proposed method. In Fig. 5, the
first row showcases distorted images across varying levels of
distortions. From the second to the last row, we present
corresponding primary contents and dissimilarity maps. The
effectiveness of the IGM becomes evident in its ability to
mitigate noise and infer high-quality primary content, as
evidenced in Fig. 5(d)-(f). Concurrently, as depicted in Fig.
5(g)-(i), when subjected to distinct levels of artifacts, the
dissimilarity map exhibits diverse patterns. Notably, Fig. 5(i)
demonstrates lower dissimilarity, implying less content
degradation in Fig. 5(c).
Figure 6. Visualization of several exemplary images from the test
dataset. From left to right are the distorted images, the weight maps, and
scores. From top to bottom are five representative example images with
the radiologist scores of 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 and our model
predictions respectively.
C. Visualization of Exemplary Images
In Fig. 6, we visualize distorted images and weight maps for
five represetative examples from the low-dose CT BIQA test
dataset. These weight maps clearly highlight salient subjects,
which are significant areas that strongly influence human
perception. When humans view an image, features of interest
greatly affects our perception, and therefore these features
receive higher weights as depicted in Fig. 6. Furthermore, as the
score increases, the weight also becomes larger. Regarding the
predicted scores for the images, we observed some bias relative
to the radiologists’ scores, indicating that there is still room for
improvement.
D. Performance Comparison within the Low-dose CT
