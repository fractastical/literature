Abstract
Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel
formulation of epistemic emotions such as curiosity and interest using two types of information gain
generated by the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) from
Bayesian posterior to prior, which represents free energy reduction in recognition, and Bayesian surprise
(BS), which represents the expected information gain by Bayesian prior update. By applying a Gaussian
generative model with an additional uniform likelihood, we found that KLD and BS form an upward-
convex function of surprise (minimized free energy and prediction error), similar to Berlyne’s arousal
potential functions, or the Wundt curve. We consider that the alternate maximization of BS and KLD
generates an ideal inquiry cycle to approach the optimal arousal level with fluctuations in surprise, and
that curiosity and interest drive to facilitate the cyclic process. We exhaustively analyzed the effects of
prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) on the peaks of
the information gain function as optimal surprises. The results show that greater prediction uncertainty,
meaning an open-minded attitude, and less observational uncertainty, meaning precise observation with
attention, are expected to provide greater information gains through a greater range of exploration. The
proposed mathematical framework unifies the free energy principle of the brain and the arousal potential
theory to explain the Wundt curve as an information gain function and suggests an ideal inquiry process
driven by epistemic emotions.

1. Introduction
Inquiry is an essential cognitive process in human activities such as scientific research, creation, and
education. American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce defines inquiry as a cycle of three inferences:
abduction, deduction, and induction (Peirce, 1974). In the observation of surprising phenomena,
abduction infers a possible cause of the observation, deduction predicts unknown effects based on the
inferred cause, and induction tests the prediction and updates the causal knowledge. A voluntary inquiry

process is facilitated by epistemic emotions such as surprise, curiosity, interest, and confusion (Kashdan
& Silvia, 2009; Vogl, Pekrun, Murayama, & Loderer, 2020). Psychologist Berlyne defined two types of
epistemic curiosity: diversive and specific (Berlyne, 1966; Silvia, 2012). Diversive curiosity seeks
novelty, and thus, in this type of curiosity, surprise triggers abductive reasoning. On the other hand,
specific curiosity drives induction, which seeks evidence of deductive reasoning to resolve confusion.
Emotions are generally mapped to a dimensional space (Lang, 1995; Russell, 1980). The most
commonly used dimensions are arousal and valence, termed the core affect (Russell, 2003). Arousal is the
intensity of emotions, whereas valence is the dimension of the positive and negative poles. A recent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed that arousal and valence are correlated with
neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, respectively (Wilson-Mendenhall, Barrett, &
Barsalou, 2013). The emotional dimensions are not independent, and arousal affects valence. Berlyne’s
arousal potential theory suggests that an appropriate level of arousal potential induces a positive hedonic
response, whereas extreme arousal induces a negative response (Berlyne, 1960). Thus, valence forms an
inverse-U-shaped function of the arousal potential, termed the Wundt curve (Fig. 1). Berlyne suggests that
epistemic curiosity approaches the optimal arousal potential, where the hedonic response (or positive
valence) is maximized (Berlyne, 1960, 1966; Silvia, 2012).
Berlyne also illustrated a number of arousal potential factors such as novelty, complexity, and
uncertainty (Berlyne, 1960). Yanagisawa mathematically explains that the free energy, which is
information on the brain’s prediction error or surprise (Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006), represents the
arousal potential because free energy is decomposed into information quantity terms representing
perceived novelty, complexity, and uncertainty (Yanagisawa, 2021). This free-energy arousal model
suggests that an appropriate level of free energy or surprise induces a positive emotional valence based on
Berlyne’s Wundt curve, which is supported by experimental evidence (Honda, Yanagisawa, & Kato,
2022; Sasaki, Kato, & Yanagisawa, 2023).
By contrast, the free energy principle (FEP) (Friston et al., 2006), known as the unified brain
theory (Friston, 2010), suggests that the brain must minimize its free energy during perception and action.
Previous studies have proposed that decreasing and increasing free energy (or expected free energy)
correspond to positive and negative valence, respectively (Clark, Watson, & Friston, 2018; Hesp et al.,
2021; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013; Seth & Friston, 2016; Wager et al., 2015; Yanagisawa, Wu, Ueda, &
Kato, 2023), and that high and low free energies indicate uncertain and certain states, respectively.
Reducing free energy resolves uncertainty and produces positive emotions.
The FEP argument that minimizing free energy corresponds to a positive valence seems to
contradict the argument of arousal potential theory that an appropriate level of arousal potential
(represented by free energy (Yanagisawa, 2021)) maximizes positive valence. To resolve this
contradiction and integrate the FEP-based valence and arousal potential theories, we propose a novel
valence framework based on the theory that a decrement in free energy and its expectation explain the
2
Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
valence of epistemic emotions. A decrease in free energy represents information gain and an epistemic
value (Friston et al., 2017; Parr, Pezzulo, & Friston, 2022). The more information gain (epistemic value)
one obtains or expects, the more positive the valence one experiences.
Based on this framework, we formulated emotion valence functions of the arousal potential
using decrements in free energy (or information gains). By applying a Gaussian generative model with an
additional uniform likelihood, we demonstrated that the epistemic valence function forms an inverse-U
shape and analyzed the effects of prediction error and uncertainties on the peaks of the valence functions.
We associated epistemic emotions such as curiosity and interest with the free-energy-based valence
model. Furthermore, we proposed an inquiry cycle model based on free-energy-based epistemic emotions.

2. Method
2.1 Free energy formulations
FEP suggests that the brain must minimize its free energy through recognition, action, and learning
(Friston et al., 2006). Assume an agent recognizes a hidden state 𝑠 as a cause of an observation 𝑜 given
by an action based on a policy 𝜋. We assume that the agent has a generative model 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) as its
knowledge about the probabilistic relationship between hidden states and observation and a recognition
density 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) of hidden states for a given policy. The free energy of a policy 𝜋 is defined as a function
of an observation representing the difference between a recognition density and a generative model
averaged by the recognition density in terms of their energies (negative log probability).
𝐹 (cid:3095) (cid:3404)⟨ln𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)⟩ (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) (1)
The free energy represents the prediction error of recognition from the knowledge, i.e., the generative
model. It refers to uncertainty and the prediction error of signals in a Bayesian brain theory (Knill &
Pouget, 2004). The first and second terms on the right-hand side denote the negative-state entropy and

internal energy, respectively. Thus, the definition corresponds to the Helmholtz free energy when the
temperature is one.
With the definition of conditional probability, the generative model is factorized into true
posterior and evidence: 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667). With this factorization, the free energy is expanded
to the summation of a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence and Shannon surprise (hereafter referred to as
surprise).
𝐹 (cid:3404)𝐷 (cid:4670)𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)||𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:4671)(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) (2)
(cid:3095) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)
The first-term KL divergence forms the true posterior to the recognition density, which represents a
statistical difference between the two distributions: 𝐷 (cid:4670)𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)||𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:4671)(cid:3404)〈ln𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3398)
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)
ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) . When the recognition approximates the true posterior to minimize free energy, the KL
divergence becomes zero, and the free energy is approximated to the second term, i.e., surprise. Thus, the
lower bound of free energy is surprise. Surprise is a negative log of the model evidence, 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667), and
refers to the information content used to process given observations, representing cognitive load
(Yanagisawa, 2021).
The generative model is decomposed to a state prior 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) for a given policy and a likelihood
function 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667).
𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667) (2)
With this decomposition, the free energy is expanded to another two terms.
𝐹 (cid:3095) (cid:3404)𝐷 (cid:3012)(cid:3013) (cid:4670)𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)||𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:4671)(cid:3398)〈ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) (3)
The first term is a KL divergence of state prior from recognition. This term represents the complexity of
the generative model. The second term is the difference between likelihood and recognition. This term
indicates negative model accuracy. Thus, minimizing the free energy signifies minimizing the complexity
and maximizing the accuracy of the model.
2.2 Information gain in recognition
Assume that an initial recognition density before an action based on a policy 𝜋 is approximated to the
state prior. The initial free energy 𝐹 is a summation of KL divergence and surprise.
(cid:3095)(cid:2868)
𝐹 (cid:3095)(cid:2868) (cid:3404)〈ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3398)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3043)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) (cid:3404)𝐷 (cid:3012)(cid:3013) (cid:4670)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)||𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:4671)(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) (4)
An agent receives an observation 𝑜 by the action based on the policy 𝜋. The recognition density
approximates the true posterior by minimizing the free energy. The KL divergence becomes zero, and the
free energy decreases to the lower bound 𝐹 , corresponding to surprise.
(cid:3095)(cid:3019)
𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667):𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)→𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667), 𝐹 (cid:3404)(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) (5)
(cid:3095)(cid:3019)
The decrease in free energy in the recognition process is equivalent to the KL divergence from the true
posterior to the initial recognition, 𝐾𝐿𝐷 . Herein, 𝐾𝐿𝐷 denotes the information gain from recognizing
(cid:3095) (cid:3095)
the causal state of observations given by an action based on a policy 𝜋.

A greater KLD indicates that the recognition of an observation under a policy provides greater
information gain. Thus, KLD represents the epistemic value of recognizing an observation under a policy.
This suggests that an agent prefers to recognize observations with a greater KLD and is motivated to act
based on a policy that likely obtains such observations. Therefore, we infer that KLD increases positive
valence by increasing information gain (epistemic value) in recognition.
2.3 Information gain expected from Bayesian updating prior belief: Bayesian surprise
The free energy minimized by a recognition, 𝐹 , approximates surprise. The minimized free energy
(cid:3095)(cid:3019)
equals a summation of complexity and inverse accuracy with a recognition approximated to the true
posterior, 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3406)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667).
𝐹 (cid:3404)(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝐵𝑆 (cid:3397)𝑈 (7)
(cid:3095)(cid:3019) (cid:3095) (cid:3095)
𝐵𝑆 (cid:3404)𝐷 (cid:4670)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)||𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:4671) (8)
(cid:3095) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)
𝑈 (cid:3095) (cid:3404)(cid:3398)〈ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3043)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667) (9)
The complexity and inverse accuracy terms represent the Bayesian surprise 𝐵𝑆 and perceived
(cid:3095)
uncertainty U, respectively, and their summation (surprise) denotes the arousal potential (Yanagisawa,
2021). The Bayesian surprise, 𝐵𝑆 , is a KL divergence from posterior to prior, i.e., the deviation of
(cid:3095)
recognition from prior expectation. It represents the novelty of the recognized observation and is
correlated with the surprise response to novel stimuli (Yanagisawa, Kawamata, & Ueda, 2019). The
surprise response decreases with repeated exposure to the same novel stimuli. Such habituation is
formulated as a decrease in BS in the Bayesian update of the prior (Ueda, Sekoguchi, & Yanagisawa,
2021).
By repeatedly observing the same observation 𝑜 by an action under the same policy, the prior
is updated by Bayesian updating such that the prior comes close to the true posterior, i.e.,
𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667):𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)→𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667). When the prior is updated to the posterior, 𝐵𝑆 is zero, and the free energy
(cid:3095)
decreases to the inverse accuracy term. We refer to this term as uncertainty because it refers to the
perceived uncertainty (Yanagisawa, 2021). Thus, the lower bound of free energy after the prior updating
is the uncertainty, 𝐹 (cid:3409)𝑈 , whereas the upper bound of the free energy decrease is the Bayesian
(cid:3095)(cid:3013) (cid:3095)
surprise, 𝐵𝑆 .
(cid:3095)
𝛥𝐹 (cid:3404)𝐹 (cid:3398)𝐹 (cid:3409)𝐵𝑆 (10)
(cid:3013) (cid:3095)(cid:3019) (cid:3095)(cid:3013) (cid:3095)
Herein, 𝐵𝑆 is equivalent to the maximum information gain expected from the prior update based on
(cid:3095)
observing a sufficient number of the same observations given under the same policy. A greater 𝐵𝑆
(cid:3095)
denotes a greater information gain expected from the update with the action under the policy 𝜋. Thus, BS
represents the expected epistemic value given by the model (prior) update or learning. This suggests that
an agent prefers novel observations with a greater BS, which is expected to provide a chance to learn new
information (update its own generative model), and that the agent is motivated to approach such novel
observations. Therefore, we infer that BS increases emotional valence in anticipation of information gain

from updating prior beliefs.
2.4 Linking free energy reduction, information gain, and arousal potential
Fig. 2 summarizes the two-step free energy reduction and information gain. The free energy given an
observation 𝑜 decreases by 𝐾𝐿𝐷 as the first information gain when one succeeds in recognizing the state
as a cause of the observation. The minimized free energy approximates surprise. The surprise is a
summation of 𝐵𝑆 and 𝑈. When one’s prior is updated to approximate the true posterior, the free energy
is decreased by 𝐵𝑆, which is the expected second information gain.

The upper bound of the total free energy reduction (or information gain) from recognizing and updating
state beliefs, given an observation, is a summation of the two KL divergences, i.e., information gain.

(11)
We consider that the total information gain represents the epistemic values that explain the emotional
valence of the arousal potential.
The two types of KL divergence denote the difference between the prior and posterior. When
the posterior given an observation is the same as the prior, the KL divergences are zero, and the
observation provides minimum free energy and minimum surprise (or maximum evidence). Hence, an
observation that provides minimal free energy does not provide any KL divergence or information gain.
To provide epistemic value with an emotional valence, given information gain, a certain level of surprise
representing arousal potential (Yanagisawa, 2021) is required by observing unexpected outcomes that
give certain KL divergences. However, if the likelihood of an observation is far from the prior
6

Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
distribution, where the likelihood does not provide any information, the posterior is not updated from the
prior. In this case, the KL divergences are zero, and the observation does not provide any information.
Therefore, we consider that an appropriate level of surprise maximizes the KL divergences (information
gains) and that an appropriate level represents the optimal arousal potential that maximizes the positive
valence for its epistemic value.
KL divergence is an asymmetric operation. Hence, although both KL divergences, 𝐾𝐿𝐷 and
(cid:3095)
𝐵𝑆 , denote differences between the prior and posterior, they are different from each other. This suggests
(cid:3095)
that the two KL divergences as functions of surprise are different. KLD signifies information gain due to
recognition, whereas BS signifies information gain expected from updating prior beliefs. Namely, KLD is
the current, whereas BS is the future, information gain. This suggests that maximizing KLD and BS are
different strategies for approaching the optimal arousal level that maximizes the total epistemic value
with a positive valence.
2.5 Analytical methodology
We modeled the two information gains, KLD and BS, as functions of surprise using a Gaussian-like
generative model with a flat likelihood of uniform noise and demonstrated that the two functions, KLD
and BS, form an inverse-U shape and have different peaks. Using the function model, we analyzed the
effect of Gaussian parameters, the difference between the prior mean and likelihood peak as prediction
error (Yanagisawa, 2016), variance of prior as prediction uncertainty, and variance of likelihood as
observation uncertainty on the peaks of the information gain functions. From the analysis, we elucidated
the conditions for optimal prediction errors and uncertainties of prediction and observation to maximize
the information gains in an ideal inquiry process.
3. Results
3.1 Gaussian model of information gains
The Gaussian Bayesian model has been used in past research studies to analyze the characteristics of free
energy and Bayesian surprise (Buckley, Kim, McGregor, & Seth, 2017; Yanagisawa et al., 2023;
Yanagisawa, 2021). The Laplace approximation suggests that a Gaussian distribution is applied around
the mode of unknown distributions. The Gaussian form is useful for analyzing the effect of interpretable
and independently manipulatable parameters on free energy and KL divergence. The distance between the
prior mean and likelihood peak, 𝛿, represents prediction error; the variance of prior, 𝑠 , represents prior
(cid:3043)
uncertainty; and the variance of likelihood, 𝑠 , represents observation uncertainty. The likelihood
(cid:3013)

where 𝛿 (cid:3404) 𝜂(cid:3398)𝑜̅ is a prediction error. The evidence is an inverse exponential function of the square of
the prediction error. Hence, we describe the Gaussian evidence as 𝑒(cid:4666)𝛿(cid:4667). The evidence exponentially
decreases as the prediction error increases. Surprise, the lower bound of free energy, is a negative log
function of evidence, i.e., (cid:3398)log𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜(cid:3041)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)(cid:3398)log𝑒(cid:4666)𝛿(cid:4667). Thus, the surprise is a quadratic function of a
prediction error.
The free energy of n observations randomly obtained from a stimulus source following a
Gaussian distribution of variance 𝑠 is formed as a quadratic function of the prediction error with
(cid:3013)
coefficients of variance (for the derivation, see (Yanagisawa, 2021)):

The gradient 𝐴 is the inverse of the sum of two variances. Thus, both uncertainties increase
(cid:3007)
the sensitivity of the free energy to prediction error.
Using the same Gaussian model with a single data observation, we derive the information
gains, KLD and BS, as quadratic functions of the prediction error with the coefficients of variance:

The prediction error always increases both KLD and BS. We found that the observation variation 𝑠
(cid:3013)
always increases the gradient of both KLD and BS because the partial derivatives of the gradients are
always negative, i.e.,
(cid:3105)(cid:3002)(cid:3260)(cid:3261)(cid:3253)
(cid:3407)0 and
(cid:3105)(cid:3002)(cid:3251)(cid:3268)
(cid:3407)0. This signifies that the lower the observation uncertainty

(i.e., the more precise the observation), the more susceptible the information gains (KLD and BS) are to
prediction errors.
However, the effects of prediction uncertainty on the sensitivity of prediction errors are
inversed between KLD and BS. We found that the prediction uncertainty increases sensitivity for KLD
but decreases it for BS because the partial derivatives are
(cid:3105)(cid:3002)(cid:3260)(cid:3261)(cid:3253)
(cid:3408)0 and
(cid:3105)(cid:3002)(cid:3251)(cid:3268)
(cid:3407)0. Thus, the lower the
(cid:3105)(cid:3046)(cid:3291) (cid:3105)(cid:3046)(cid:3291)
prediction uncertainty, the more susceptible the information gains in recognition, i.e., KLD, and the more
susceptible the information gains expected from Bayesian updating prior beliefs, i.e., BS.
To compare KLD and BS in the gradient of functions of prediction error, we derived the
difference and found that KLD is always greater than BS because the coefficients are always positive.

(cid:3408)0 and 𝐵 (cid:3404)

(cid:3408)0. Therefore, for any prediction error, the

information gain in recognition is greater than that expected from updating the prior.
3.2 Convexity of information gain function by considering uniform noise
The Gaussian model suggests that prediction error always increases information gain. This is because the
likelihood function is distributed over an infinite band and deviates from the prior distribution as the
prediction error increases. However, the Laplace approximation is valid only around the mode, and there
is no guarantee that the tail of the likelihood is infinitely distributed following a Gaussian distribution.
The rate-coding hypothesis suggests that the likelihood function is coded by the distribution of the firing
rates of neurons. A single stimulation fires specific neural populations but not all neurons. Neurons that
do not receive external stimulation fire spontaneously (Raichle, 2006). The frequency of the spontaneous
firing activity of neurons is lower than the millisecond-order frequency of stimuli-driven neural activity
(Destexhe, Rudolph, & Paré, 2003). We infer that such spontaneous firing activity is independent of the
neural activity evoked by sensory observations and provides no information about the cause of sensory
stimuli (observation). To represent the influence of such independent and spontaneous neural activity, we
added an independent uniformed likelihood with very small constant probability 𝜀 to the observation-
based likelihood (Jones, 2016).

This uniform likelihood addition flattens the tail of the Gaussian likelihood function, as shown in Fig. 3.
The effect of the Gaussian tail becomes negligible as the prediction error increases. Therefore, we infer
that adding a uniform likelihood is the simplest modeling method to represent the likelihood of
spontaneous neural activity and to ignore the effect of the Gaussian likelihood tail.
The evidence with the likelihood function is the Gaussian evidence and the constant
probability.

prior.

(cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3036)
is approximated to the Gaussian posterior, 𝑝 (cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜(cid:4667)(cid:3406)𝑁 . Thus, the prediction error increases both
(cid:3084) (cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046)(cid:3047)
information gains, KLD and BS. By contrast, when the prediction error increases toward infinity, the
evidence converges to zero, lim 𝑒(cid:4666)𝛿(cid:4667)(cid:3404)0, where 𝑉 (cid:3404)0, because the evidence is the inverse exponential

function of the prediction error. In this case, the Gaussian posterior is negligible, and thus, the posterior is
approximated to the Gaussian prior, lim 𝑝 (cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑁 . When the posterior is equal to the prior, both
(cid:3084) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3036)
(cid:3083)→(cid:2998)
information gains, KLD and BS, are zero. Thus, in the case of a large prediction error, where 𝑒(cid:4666)𝛿(cid:4667) is
very small compared to 𝜀, and 𝜀𝑁 is dominant in the posterior, the information gains decrease to zero
(cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3036)

posterior and prior, respectively, in the mixed posterior distribution. Fig. 4 shows the dominances as
functions of prediction error 𝛿. When the prediction error is zero or small, the Gaussian posterior is
dominant. For a certain prediction error, the prior becomes dominant as the prediction error increases.
Fig. 5 shows an example of posterior distributions switching over from Gaussian posterior dominance to

Fig. 6 (a) shows the information gains and their total value, 𝐼𝐺 (cid:3404)𝐾𝐿𝐷(cid:3397)𝐵𝑆, as functions of the
prediction errors. All information gains are upward-convex functions of the prediction errors. This
convexity is general because when the prediction error is small, the Gaussian posterior is dominant in the
posterior, and information gains increase as the prediction error increases; whereas when the prediction
error is larger than a certain level, the prior becomes dominant, and the information gains decrease to zero
as the prediction error increases.
Fig. 7 shows surprise as a function of the prediction error. Surprise increases monotonically
with respect to the prediction error. Thus, the information gains are also upward-convex functions of
surprise, and the total information gain 𝐼𝐺 that induces positive emotions by reducing free energy is an
upward-convex function of surprise (and prediction error). We infer that the upward-convex function of
the total information gain represents the arousal potential function (i.e., the Wundt curve). Fig. 6 (b)
shows an example of information gain as a function of surprise.

Information gain functions are upward-convex and have a peak. We define the prediction errors that
maximize information gains 𝐾𝐿𝐷, 𝐵𝑆, and 𝐼𝐺 as optimal prediction errors 𝛿 , 𝛿 and 𝛿 ,
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3010)(cid:3008)
respectively. Similarly, we define the surprises that maximize information gains 𝐾𝐿𝐷, 𝐵𝑆, and 𝐼𝐺 as
optimal surprises 𝑆 , 𝑆 , and 𝑆 , respectively. We use the term “optimal” because it represents the
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3010)(cid:3008)
optimal arousal level that maximizes information gain (epistemic value) that evokes emotional valence.
When the prediction errors are greater than 𝛿 and smaller than 𝛿 , 𝐾𝐿𝐷 and 𝐵𝑆 have a negative
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
relationship, where 𝐾𝐿𝐷 decreases as 𝐵𝑆 increases, and vice versa. The prediction error that maximizes
the total information gain 𝛿 always falls into this area. Alternate maximizations of 𝐾𝐿𝐷 and 𝐵𝑆 by
(cid:3010)(cid:3008)
decreasing and increasing the prediction error and surprise in this area iteratively reach the optimal

surprise 𝑆 . This alternation generates fluctuations of surprise. The magnitude of fluctuation is
(cid:3010)(cid:3008)
determined by the difference between KLD and BS in the optimal prediction error 𝐷 (cid:3404)𝛿 (cid:3398)𝛿 and
(cid:3083) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
surprise 𝐷 (cid:3404)𝑆 (cid:3398)𝑆 . In the next section, we analyze the effects of uncertainties on the optimal
(cid:3020) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
prediction errors and surprise, together with their differences.
3.3 Effects of uncertainties on information gains
The optimal prediction error and surprise change depending on uncertainties. We found the optimal
prediction error and optimal surprise for all combinations of likelihood variances 𝑠 [1.0, 50] and prior
(cid:3039)
variance 𝑠 [1.0, 50] in steps of 0.1 using the MATLAB fminbnd.m function, which is based on golden
(cid:3043)
section search and parabolic interpolation.
Fig. 8 shows the maximum information gain as a function of the two uncertainties, 𝑠 and 𝑠 .
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
All maximum information gains decrease as 𝑠 increases, and increase as 𝑠 decreases. While 𝑠
(cid:3039) (cid:3043) (cid:3043)
approaches zero, the sensitivity of 𝑠 to the maximum information gains are low. The sensitivity of 𝑠
(cid:3039) (cid:3039)
increases as 𝑠 increases. The peak of the maximum information gain is observed when 𝑠 is small, and
(cid:3043) (cid:3039)
𝑠 is large. The maximum information gains of a large 𝑠 and large 𝑠 are greater than those of a small
(cid:3043) (cid:3039) (cid:3043)
𝑠 and small 𝑠 . Fig. 9 shows examples of the maximum information gain as a function of 𝑠 and 𝑠 . The
(cid:3039) (cid:3043) (cid:3039) (cid:3043)
maximum information gains increase exponentially as 𝑠 decreases. Thus, the sensitivity of 𝑠 to the
(cid:3039) (cid:3039)
maximum information gain increases as 𝑠 decreases. By contrast, the sensitivity of 𝑠 to information
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
gain is significant when 𝑠 is small (e.g., from 1.0 to 10.0 in this example).

and prediction variance 𝑠 . These two variances increase the optimal prediction errors. The sensitivity of
(cid:3043)
𝑠 is greater than that of 𝑠 in KLD. Fig. 11 shows an example of the optimal prediction error as a
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
function of each uncertainty. All functions are monotonically increasing convex. 𝛿 is more sensitive
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
to 𝑠 than 𝛿 . Thus, the difference 𝛿 and 𝛿 decreases as 𝑠 increases. By contrast, 𝛿 is less

sensitive to 𝑠 than 𝛿 . Thus, the difference increases as 𝑠 increases.

4. Discussions
4.1 Arousal potential functions and curiosities
The results of the analysis using a Gaussian generative model with an additional uniform likelihood
suggest that the two information gains, KLD and BS, form upward-convex functions of surprise and

prediction errors (i.e., the distance between the prior mean and likelihood peak). The prediction error
monotonically increases surprise, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 15 shows a schematic of the information gain
functions that conceptualize the analytical results, as shown in Fig. 6 and the related emotions. Surprise,
(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜(cid:4667), corresponds to free energy minimized in recognition. A previous study argued that surprise
represents arousal potential because minimized free energy consists of the summation of information
content provided by novelty and perceived complexity, which are collative variables as dominant factors
of arousal potential (Yanagisawa, 2021).
Berlyne suggested that an appropriate level of arousal potential induces a positive hedonic
response, termed the optimal arousal level (Berlyne, 1960). Extreme arousal level caused by novel and
complex stimuli may cause confusion. By contrast, a low arousal level with familiar and simple stimuli
results in boredom. Thus, emotional valence shapes the upward-convex function of the arousal potential,
termed the Wundt curve.
Berlyne also suggested that two epistemic curiosities, diversive and specific, drive the
approach to the optimal arousal level (Berlyne, 1966). Diversive curiosity drives the pursuit of novelty,
whereas specific curiosity drives the search for evidence of one’s model predictions. Consequently,
diversive curiosity increases the arousal potential to climb the Wundt curve on the left, from a low level
of arousal (boredom). By contrast, specific curiosity motivates a decrease in the arousal potential to climb
the Wundt curve on the right side from a high arousal level (confusion). The alternation between the two
curiosity-driven activities approaches the optimal arousal level.
𝐾𝐿𝐷 is a free energy reduction in recognition of a state 𝑠 given an observation 𝑜 that
increases model evidence, 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜(cid:4667)(cid:3404)〈𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 , where recognition 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠(cid:4667) is updated from a prior 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠(cid:4667) to
(cid:3044)(cid:4666)(cid:3046)(cid:4667)
true posterior 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜(cid:4667). 𝐵𝑆 is the expected information gain given by novel stimuli that corresponds to
human surprise response to novelty (Itti & Baldi, 2009; Sekoguchi, Sakai, & Yanagisawa, 2019; Ueda et
al., 2021; Yanagisawa et al., 2019). Therefore, we consider that specific curiosity drives an increase in
KLD, whereas diversive curiosity drives an increase in BS.

Fig. 15 Schematic of arousal potential functions and related emotions. Valence of epistemic emotions
represented by information gains forms upward-function of arousal potential represented by free energy
or surprise. Diversive and specific curiosity drive to maximize KLD and BS, respectively. These alternate
maximizations achieve optimal arousal level with fluctuation of surprise. Emotions such as boredom,
pleasure, interest, and confusion are induced by free energy and its fluctuations (see main text for detailed
discussion)
4.2 Inquiry process and epistemic emotions
The analytical result shown in Fig. 14 demonstrate that the optimal surprise and optimal prediction error
of BS is always greater than that of KLD, i.e., 𝑆 (cid:3408)𝑆 and 𝛿 (cid:3408)𝛿 , respectively. This result
(cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
suggests that maximizing information gain through novelty seeking (driven by diversive curiosity)
requires a greater prediction error, causing greater surprise than that from maximizing information gain
through evidence seeking (driven by specific curiosity).
When surprise is less than 𝑆 , both KLD and BS monotonically increase as surprise
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
increases. By contrast, when surprise is greater than 𝑆 , both KLD and BS monotonically decrease as
(cid:3003)(cid:3020)
surprise increases. Thus, the two curiosities increase and decrease prediction errors in the former and
latter areas of surprise, respectively. However, when surprise is greater than 𝑆 and less than 𝑆 , KLD
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
decreases, and BS increases as surprise increases. Thus, in this area of surprise, maximizing both the
KLD and BS at same time is impossible. We infer that the two types of curiosity alternately maximize
KLD and BS. This alternating maximization of information gains generates fluctuations of surprise. The
optimal arousal level, as a maximum summation of KLD and BS, falls into this area. Therefore, the
optimum arousal level, 𝑆 , involves fluctuations in surprise by alternately seeking novelty and evidence,
(cid:3010)(cid:3008)
driven by the two types of curiosity.

Optimal
arousal
Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
We consider that alternating the two kinds of curiosity by increasing and decreasing prediction
errors represents an ideal inquiry process that achieves optimal arousal. This process provides continuous
positive emotions through the continuous acquisition of maximum information gain (i.e., epistemic
value). For example, “interest” is defined as disfluency reduction in fluency–disfluency theory (Graf &
Landwehr, 2015). We previously formalized disfluency reduction as free energy reduction in recognition
(i.e., KLD) from increased free energy (Yanagisawa et al., 2023). This corresponds to an increase in KLD
from the high-surprise state shown in Fig. 15. Thus, “interest” is achieved by specific curiosity (i.e.,
climbing a hill of KLD from the right side in Fig. 15). By contrast, increasing KLD from the low-surprise
state (i.e., climbing a hill of KLD from the left side in Fig. 15) may explain “pleasure” defined as increase
in fluency (Graf & Landwehr, 2015). We have previously formalized fluency as KLD in recognition
(Yanagisawa et al., 2023).
BS denotes the expected information gain, as discussed in the Methods section. Active
inference suggests that an agent infers an optimal policy of action that minimizes expected free energy.
The expected free energy includes the negative expected information gain as an epistemic value. This
epistemic value drives curious behavior (Friston et al., 2017). Thus, diversive curiosity, formalized as
maximizing the BS, corresponds to curiosity in active inference. We discuss the mathematical
interpretations of KLD and BS in terms of the expected free energy in a later section.
4.3 Effect of uncertainties on optimal arousal level and epistemic values
We analyzed the effects of prediction and observation uncertainties, manipulated using prior and
likelihood variances, on optimal information gains. Table 1 summarizes the effects of the two
uncertainties in four quadrants for combinations of small and large uncertainties. A small prediction
uncertainty 𝑠 indicates that the prior belief is certain because of, for example, prior experience and
(cid:3043)
knowledge. However, prior beliefs are not always correct. The prediction error represents the error of
prior belief from reality. Thus, a case with small 𝑠 and large prediction error indicates a preconceived
(cid:3043)
notion. By contrast, a large 𝑠 denotes that the prior belief is uncertain, owing to, for example, a lack of
(cid:3043)
prior knowledge and experience. Thus, observation uncertainty 𝑠 indicates precision of observations.
(cid:3039)
We evaluate the condition of uncertainties using four indices: maximum information gain
(max𝐼𝐺), optimal prediction errors (𝛿 , 𝛿 ), optimal surprises (𝑆 , 𝑆 ), difference in optimal
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
prediction errors (𝐷 ), and difference in optimal surprises (𝐷 ). As shown in Fig. 8, the condition
(cid:3083) (cid:3046)
combining a small 𝑠 and large 𝑠 provides the largest max𝐼𝐺 with the largest 𝐷 between small 𝛿
(cid:3039) (cid:3043) (cid:3083) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005)
and moderate 𝛿 . A larger 𝐷 signifies a wider exploration range through alternations of diversive and
(cid:3003)(cid:3020) (cid:3083)
specific curiosities. Smaller 𝑆 and 𝑆 indicate less surprise as a cognitive load in the inquiry
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
process. Therefore, the condition combining a small 𝑠 and large 𝑠 is the best solution to achieve the
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
ideal inquiry process with the largest epistemic value (information gain; max𝐼𝐺) and the largest range of
exploration (𝐷 ) under less cognitive load (𝑆 and 𝑆 ).
(cid:3083) (cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
20
Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
The condition combining a small 𝑠 and small 𝑠 is expected to yield the second largest
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
epistemic value (information gain) under less cognitive load (𝑆 , 𝑆 ); however, the range of
(cid:3012)(cid:3013)(cid:3005) (cid:3003)(cid:3020)
exploration (𝐷 ) is small. The condition combining a large 𝑠 and large 𝑠 is expected to result in a small
(cid:3083) (cid:3039) (cid:3043)
information gain with a moderate range of exploration at the largest prediction error level. The condition
combining a large 𝑠 and small 𝑠 is the worst case, corresponding to the smallest information gain and
(cid:3039) (cid:3043)
the smallest exploration range.
As overall trends, prediction uncertainty 𝑠 increases the range of exploration (𝐷 ). This
(cid:3043) (cid:3083)
suggests that an extremely certain prior brief, such as a preconceived notion and strong assumption,
suppresses the range of exploration, whereas an open mind involving a flat prior belief widens the range
of exploration. The observation uncertainty 𝑠 decreases the expected maximum information gain (max
(cid:3039)
𝐼𝐺). This suggests that precise observation increases expected information gains (epistemic value) with
positive emotions. 𝑠 can be decreased in different ways; for example, by increasing the precision of
(cid:3039)
stimuli, paying attention to stimuli, and improving the accuracy of the observation models.

4.4 Expected free energy and information gains
An active inference framework suggests that an agent’s action policy is selected to minimize expected
free energy (Friston et al., 2017; Parr et al., 2022; Smith, Friston, & Whyte, 2022). Here, we discuss the
relationship between the expected free energy and the two types of information gains, KLD and BS, as
21
Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
drivers of specific and diversive curiosity, respectively.
Before giving observations by action, an agent calculates expected free energy under a policy 𝜋.
𝐺 (cid:3095) (cid:3404)〈ln𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3398)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) , (26)
where 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667). This definition implies that the expected free energy is the free energy
averaged by likelihood 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667) of observations expected by future action under a policy 𝜋. The expected
free energy forms the prior distribution of the policies. A policy is randomly selected based on the policy
prior 𝑝(cid:4666)𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝜎(cid:4666)(cid:3398)𝛾𝐺 (cid:4667) such that the expected free energy is minimized, where 𝜎(cid:4666)𝐸(cid:4667) is a softmax
(cid:3095)
function that transforms from energy 𝐸 to probability, and 𝛾 is the precision of policy representing the
confidence of policy selection.
The expected free energy is expanded in two terms using the decomposition of a generative
model 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667).

The first term is a KL divergence from a state prior to a recognition density under a policy, 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667). We
assume that the state prior is given from the agent’s preference 𝐶, 𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3404)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝐶(cid:4667). A preference refers
to a desired state expected to be achieved through actions based on policy selection. The KL divergence,
termed risk in state, refers to the difference between the preferred state and the state expected by acting
with a policy. A lower KL divergence indicates that the desired state is more likely to be achieved. The
second term is expected uncertainty, which represents uncertainty averaged over expected observations.
This term is called ambiguity because it is equivalent to the entropy of likelihood,
(cid:3398)〈ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠,𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667) (cid:3404)〈(cid:3398)ln𝑝(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3043)(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)(cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) (cid:3404)〈𝐻(cid:4666)𝑜|𝑠(cid:4667)〉 (cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667) .
The expected uncertainty is decomposed into two terms using a conditional probability definition:
(cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3044)(cid:4666)𝑠|𝑜,𝜋(cid:4667)

The first term of the expected uncertainty is a negative KL divergence from approximate posterior to prior
averaged by expected observations with a policy 𝜋. This KL divergence corresponds to the Bayesian
surprise, 𝐵𝑆 . Thus, this term signifies the expected information gain by prior updating using predicted
(cid:3095)
observations under policy 𝜋. Note that the observation is not yet given, and 𝐵𝑆 is averaged based on
(cid:3095)
the predicted distribution under a policy, 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑜|𝜋(cid:4667).
The second term is entropy under a policy. By definition, surprise is the sum of the negative
KLD and free energy.

Thus, the entropy is a summation of the negative predictive KLD and the predicted free energy.

In summary, the expected free energy under a policy is the sum of the risk, predicted free energy, and
negative predicted information gains.

When preference is expected to be fully satisfied by a policy, the predicted state equals the state
prior, 𝑞(cid:4666)𝑠|𝜋(cid:4667)(cid:3406)𝑝(cid:4666)𝑠|𝐶(cid:4667). In this case, the risk term becomes zero. However, the expected free energy still
remains. The remaining expected free energy is the predicted free energy minus the two predicted
information gains.
𝐺 (cid:3406)𝑝𝐹 (cid:3398)(cid:4666)𝑝𝐾𝐿𝐷 (cid:3397)𝑝𝐵𝑆 (cid:4667) (36)
(cid:3095) (cid:3095) (cid:3095) (cid:3095)
The remaining expected free energy is minimized by maximizing the predicted information gains,
𝑝𝐾𝐿𝐷 (cid:3397)𝑝𝐵𝑆 , and minimizing the predicted free energy. Therefore, the two types of expected
(cid:3095) (cid:3095)
information gains, 𝑝𝐾𝐿𝐷 ,𝑝𝐵𝑆 , drive the agent’s action based on the active inference framework. This
(cid:3095) (cid:3095)
corresponds to the expected drives of the two types of curiosity.
4.5 Limitations and further discussions
The analytical results are based on a Gaussian generative model. A Gaussian model was used to
independently manipulate the prediction errors and uncertainties and analyze their effects on information
gains. Although Laplace approximation and the principle of maximum entropy reasonably support the
Gaussian assumption, true distributions can be more complex than Gaussian distributions. For specific
applications with complex distributions, further analysis based on the method proposed in this study
paper for specific applications with complex distributions.
This study focusses on emotions induced by epistemic values (epistemic emotions) such as curiosity and
interest. However, emotions are affected by individual preference and appraisal of the situation against
objectives(Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003). We may expand the emotion model to include such preference-
based emotions by introducing the pragmatic value formalized as risk term in expected free energy(Parr et
al., 2022). The model does not consider individual capacity to process information. Surprise (free energy)
exceeding the capacity may affect negative emotions.
This study was limited to analyzing two types of information gain linked to epistemic emotions as
functions of surprise in a context-independent manner. Epistemic emotions based on epistemic values,
such as curiosity, can be observed based on the agent’s behavior. Active inference, where an action policy
23
Yanagisawa, H. & Honda, S.
is inferred to minimize the expected free energy, can be used to simulate agent behavior based on
epistemic emotions in a specific context (Friston et al., 2017). As discussed, the expected free energy
includes two types of information gain. In future studies, it will be necessary to accumulate evidence of
the model predictions based on correspondence between agent simulations and actual human behavior in
a variety of specific contexts.
5. Conclusion
This study mathematically formulated arousal potential functions of epistemic emotions, such as curiosity
and interest, that drive inquiry processes, based on information gains. Decrements in free energy in
Bayesian recognition and prior belief update correspond to two types of information gain, i.e., KLD and
BS, respectively. Free energy reduction induces positive emotions by reducing surprise caused by
prediction errors and uncertainty, which provide information gains (i.e., epistemic value). We
demonstrated that the two types of information gain form upward-convex curve functions of surprise
using a Gaussian generative model with a uniform noise likelihood, and defined epistemic emotions as
information gains (or decrements of free energy). An analysis using the model exhaustively revealed the
effects of prediction and observation uncertainties on the peak of information gain functions as the
optimal arousal level. Specifically, the analytical results suggest that the greater the prediction uncertainty
and the lower the observation uncertainty, the greater the information gained through a larger exploration
range.
These results provide general and fundamental knowledge to increase the valence of epistemic
emotions that facilitate the inquiry process because the model is deduced from the synthesis of free
energy minimization as the first principle of the brain and the well-established arousal potential theory.
Therefore, this model framework is applicable to diverse areas that deal with epistemic emotions and
motivations, such as education, creativity, aesthetics, affective computing, and related cognitive sciences.
Further studies are needed to accumulate empirical evidence for the principle-based model and
understand the relationship between the inquiry process and emotions in diverse complex situations.
