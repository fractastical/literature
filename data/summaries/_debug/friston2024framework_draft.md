### A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics### OverviewThis paper investigates a framework for modelling systems made of objects coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This approach, termed the free energy principle, offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in modelling self-organising systems. The framework leverages variational inference to estimate the statistical properties of the system, enabling the construction of models that capture the dynamics of interacting systems. The core idea is that physical systems, particularly those in non-equilibrium, track the statistics of their environment, and this tracking can be formally described as a process of inference. The authors argue that generative models, when applied to coupled systems, provide a powerful tool for understanding and modelling these systems, offering a more tractable and insightful approach compared to traditional methods.### MethodologyThe authors propose a generative model for describing the dynamics of coupled systems, based on the principle of minimising free energy. This approach is implemented through the use of variational inference, where the system’s state is represented by a probability distribution that is optimised to minimise a free energy functional. The free energy functional quantifies the difference between the system’s state and the equilibrium state, and its minimisation drives the system towards equilibrium. The authors highlight the importance of the Markov blanket, which defines the set of variables that are directly coupled to the system, and which are sufficient to determine the system’s state. The authors use a particular partition of the states or paths of a joint system, which induces a statistical boundary called a Markov blanket. The framework relies on the mathematical properties of variational free energy, which provides a tractable way to describe the dynamics of the system. The authors demonstrate this approach by simulating the behaviour of a system of coupled cells, where each cell is coupled to its neighbours through a network of interactions. The simulation is based on the principles of variational inference, where the system’s state is represented by a probability distribution that is optimised to minimise the free energy functional. The authors use a particular partition of the states or paths of a joint system, which induces a statistical boundary called a Markov blanket.

In the simulation, the cells are modelled as interacting through a network of interactions, and the dynamics of the system are described by a set of differential equations. The simulation shows that the cells converge to a stable state, and that the dynamics of the system are consistent with the principles of variational inference. The authors also demonstrate the framework’s applicability to a system of excitable cells, where the cells interact through a network of excitatory and inhibitory connections. The simulation shows that the cells exhibit periodic firing patterns, and that the dynamics of the system are consistent with the principles of variational inference. The authors quantify the convergence of the system to a stable state, and the precision of the statistical estimates of the system’s state.
