### Neural dynamics under active inference: plausibility and efficiency of information processing### OverviewThis paper investigates the theoretical framework of active inference, a normative approach to explaining behaviour under the free energy principle. The authors demonstrate that neural dynamics under active inference are consistent with mean-field models of neural population dynamics and approximate natural gradient descent on free energy. The key findings of this paper are that active inference prescribes efficient and biologically plausible neural dynamics for state-estimation and that these dynamics approximate natural gradient descent on free energy.### MethodologyThe authors formalise the process of state-estimation as a descent on the free energy, a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient corresponds to a prediction error. This means that to infer the states of the world, biological agents minimise the discrepancy between their predictions and their observations, or maximise the mutual information between them. The authors show that the neural dynamics associated with active inference approximate natural gradient descent on free energy. The authors use a variational approach to approximate the posterior beliefs, which is a key component of active inference. This approach is consistent with the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain operates as a predictive machine. The authors use a discrete state-space generative model, which is a common approach in active inference. This model encodes how the states external to the agent influence the agent’s sensations. The model is used to simulate the behaviour of agents in a variety of environments. The authors use a numerical simulation to test their hypothesis.
