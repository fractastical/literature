### OverviewThis paper investigates the phenomenon of mice navigating mazes and returning home, focusing on the surprising observation that they do not simply retrace their steps. The authors propose a hierarchical active inference model to explain this behavior, arguing that the agent can effectively imagine and exploit previously unvisited paths during planning. The core of their approach involves leveraging a low-level generative model to predict novel trajectories, even when the agent has not previously explored those paths. The study demonstrates this concept in a grid-world environment, showcasing the agent’s ability to accurately predict a shorter route to its starting point.### MethodologyThe authors employ a hierarchical active inference model, a key component of which is a low-level generative model. This model consists of three neural networks: a prior, a posterior, and a likelihood. The prior network generates a distribution over hidden states, while the posterior network compresses sensor data and combines it with the prior. The likelihood network then generates an image based on the combined state. The model is trained using a sequence of action-observation pairs, learning to predict the agent’s sensory input given its actions and the current state. The hierarchical structure allows the agent to build a topological map of the environment, enabling it to plan routes and explore new areas. The model is implemented in a grid-world environment with four rooms, where the agent’s actions are limited to moving one tile forward, turning90 degrees left, or turning90 degrees right. The agent’s observations are pixel-based renderings of the environment.### ResultsThe experiments demonstrate the agent’s ability to accurately predict a new, shorter path in the map leading to its starting point. Specifically, the authors found that the agent can successfully imagine and exploit previously unvisited paths, even when the goal is not directly reachable through the known path. The model’s performance is evaluated using the free energy (FE) of the planned trajectories. The study shows that the agent can identify and exploit shortcuts, achieving a significantly shorter path to the goal compared to a greedy approach. The authors report that the agent’s performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of the low-level generative model. The model’s ability to predict the agent’s sensory input is crucial for its ability to plan and explore new paths. The authors observed that the model’s performance degrades as the planning horizon increases, highlighting the challenges of predicting long-term trajectories.### Discussion“The authors state: “Whenexecutingsucha‘homerun’,themicedonotfollowtheexactreversepath,infact,theentrypathandhomepathhaveverylittleoverlap.” They note: “To address this issue, we propose to expand the high level map representation using the expected free energy of previously un-explored transitions, by exploiting the learned low-level environment model.” According to the paper: “In the absence of a preferred state, the agent will exploit the map representation to plan the shortest (known) route towards the objective.” The study demonstrates that the hierarchical active inference model can effectively explain the observed behavior of mice navigating mazes. “The authors state: “We demonstrate a proof of concept in a Minigrid environment with a four-rooms setup.” They argue: “By exploiting the expected free energy of previously un-explored transitions, by exploiting the learned low-level environment model.” The paper argues: “The agent not only considers previously visited links and locations in the map during planning, but also imagines potential novel links.” The authors state: “The agent is able to accurately predict a new, shorter path in the map leading to its starting point.”### Further Research“The authors state: “IntheremainderofthispaperwewillfirstreviewthehierarchicalAIFmodel[4], then explain how we address planning with previously unvisited paths by imagining novel trajectories withinthemodel.” They note: “Asaproofofconcept,wedemonstrate the mechanism on a Minigrid environment with a four-rooms setup.” The paper argues: “We conclude by discussing our results, the current limitations and what is left to improve upon the current results.” The authors state: “One challenge of using the Minigrid environment as an experimental setup [12] is the use of topviewvisualobservations.” They argue: “The model’s ability to predict the agent’s sensory input is crucial for its ability to plan and explore new paths.”
