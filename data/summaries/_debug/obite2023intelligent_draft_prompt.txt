Data Generation: Random initial positions for multiple
SUsaregeneratedwithin0and1foreachuserandtheirspatial
3D (x, y, and z). The user positions are updated at each time
step and stored in a user mobility matrix. The UAV’s initial
positionanddirectionarerandomlygenerated.Aloopiterates
through time steps, updating the UAV’s position based on its
speed and direction. The final position is computed based on
its trajectory after the specified time steps and stored in a
UAV trajectory matrix. At every time step, power allocations
are randomly generated within the specified maximum power
(P ). These are stored in a power allocation matrix, where
max
each row represents a user and each column represents a
time step. The subchannel assignment matrix is populated
with random integers within the range 1 to 6 for all possible
subchannels. We then generate a distance matrix encoding all
possible distances between the UAV trajectory and user posi-
tions.TableIpresentsanoverviewofthenetworkparameters,

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Active-GDBN,
we benchmark with suboptimal baselines such as q-learning
[2],convex[11],andrandomschemes.AsevidentfromFig.4,
the proposed approach performs better than the benchmark
schemes by achieving an improved and consistent sum rate
in fewer episodes. This is because Active-GDBN inherently
balances exploration and exploitation by seeking to minimize
abnormalities or prediction errors in each episode to update

learning necessitates manual adjustment of exploration strate-
gies and extensive trial and error to achieve enhanced sum
rate performance. The low sum rate performance of convex
and random schemes is due to a lack of inherent adaptability
and online learning to adapt to time-varying environments.

Fig.5demonstratestheconvergenceperformanceofActive-
GDBN using a varying number of multiplexed SUs per
subchannel (M). When the value of M is 1, the situation
becomes orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We observed
that stable convergence is achieved within a range of zero
to forty episodes. As anticipated, the sum rate for each
SU increases monotonically, and the proposed Active-GDBN
achieved a maximum of 5 SUs per subchannel. However, this
monotonic behavior is not guaranteed when M = 4. This
deviation could be attributed to the presence of reduced LoS
conditions, arising from the UAV’s random trajectory. This
randomness introduces unexpected interference for a specific
M configuration, resulting in a drop in the cumulative sum
rate.Similarly,thealgorithmexhibitsperformancedegradation
asweincreasethevalueofM to6.Thisisbecause,atacertain
limit, due to power control, simultaneous transmission from
superimposed SUs begins to overlap, leading to a decrease in
the sum rate.
