Here’s a revised summary of the paper, addressing all the specified issues:**Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience**Beren Millidge’s doctoral thesis, “Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience,” investigates the potential of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a framework for understanding complex systems, specifically focusing on its applications within machine learning and neuroscience. The authors argue that systems, including the brain, can be viewed as performing variational Bayesian inference to minimize a variational free energy, effectively self-organizing and maintaining a non-equilibrium state.“The free energy principle therefore provides a close link between the notions of self-organization and dissipativestructures in thermodynamics (Prigogine&Lefever,1973; Seifert,2008),” the thesis states.The core postulate is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy.The thesis is structured into three main parts, applying methods and insights from the free energy principle to understand questions first in perception, then action, and finally learning.In the first section, the research focuses on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle under certain assumptions, which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors. Scaling up predictive coding architectures and simulating large-scale predictive coding networks for perception on machine learning benchmarks is undertaken, investigating predictive coding’s relationship to other classical filtering algorithms, and demonstrating that many biologically implausible aspects of current models of predictive coding can be relaxed without unduly harming the performance of predictive coding models, which allows for a potentially more literal translation of predictive coding theory into cortical microcircuits.The second part of the thesis examines the application of methods deriving from the free energy principle to action.“Active inference,” a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, is extended to utilize deep artificial neural networks, allowing these methods to ‘scale up’ to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods.Furthermore, active inference inspired methods can bring conceptual clarity and novel perspectives to deep reinforcement learning.The research reveals the importance of deep generative models and model-based planning for adaptive action, as well as information-seeking exploration which arises under a unified mathematical framework from active inference.Finally, a unified mathematically principle framework for understanding and deriving many information-seeking exploration objectives through the lens of a dichotomy between ‘evidence’ and ‘divergence’ objectives is presented, showing that this distinction is crucial for understanding and relating the many exploratory objectives in both the reinforcement learning, active inference, and cognitive science communities, and that this provides a general mathematical framework for specifying the objectives underlying intelligent, adaptive behaviour.The final section of the thesis focuses on application of the free energy principle to questions of learning.First, the predictive coding algorithm is demonstrated to closely approximate the backpropagation of error algorithm along arbitrary computation graphs, which underlie the training of essentially all contemporary machine learning architectures, thus indicating a potential path to the direct implementation of machine learning algorithms in neural circuitry.“The thesisissplitintothreemainpartswhereweapplymethodsandinsightsfromthefreeenergyprincipletounderstandquestionsfirstinperception,thenaction,andfinallylearning,” the thesis states.Additionally, other algorithms for biologically plausible credit assignment in the brain are explored, and Activation Relaxation, a novel algorithm which can approximate backprop using only local learning rules which are substantially simpler than those necessary for predictive coding, is presented.The research shows that some relaxationsthatapply to predictive coding also work for the activation relaxation algorithm, thus producing an extremely elegant and effective algorithm for local approximationsto backpropinthebrain.In sum, Millidge’s thesis demonstrates the theoretical utility of the free energy principle by demonstrating how methods inspired by it can interface productively with other fields, specifically neuroscience and machine learning, to develop and improve existing methods, as well as inspire novel advances, in all three areas of perception, action, and learning.Throughout the thesis, the free energy principle’s unified treatment of these seemingly disparate processes is implicitly demonstrated, offering a powerful framework for understanding complex systems.
