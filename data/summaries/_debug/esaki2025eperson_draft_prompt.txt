Abstract. This paper proposes the e-person architecture for constructing a uni-
fied and incremental development of AI ethics. The e-person architecture takes
the reduction of uncertainty through collaborative cognition and action with oth-
ers as a unified basis for ethics. By classifying and defining uncertainty along
two axes - (1) first, second, and third person perspectives, and (2) the difficulty
of inference based on the depth of information - we support the development of
unified and incremental development of AI ethics. In addition, we propose the e-
person framework based on the free energy principle, which considers the reduc-
tion of uncertainty as a unifying principle of brain function, with the aim of im-
plementing the e-person architecture, and we show our previous works and future
challenges based on the proposed framework.
Keywords: AI Ethics, Moral Agent, Free Energy Principle, Active Inference,
Multi Agent System.
1 Introduction
With the rapid spread of AI into everyday life, discussions on AI ethics have become
more active [1-7]. Assuming that the application of AI in everyday life will continue to
expand, it is expected that AI ethics AI will become more important as people strive to
lead enriched lives while using AI. So far, there have been many discussions on ethical
concerns related to AI, focusing on philosophy and sociology, such as the singularity
and the threat of AI [8,9]. On the other hand, the current discussion is characterized by
the fact that with the practical application and rapid proliferation of technologies such
as self-driving cars and chatbots, more practical discussions have become active, such
as those on regulation [10] and their technical implementation [11-14]. In other words,
the ethical issues of AI are not hypothetical problems in the distant future, but urgent
and actual problems that need to be addressed, and they are unavoidable not only for
philosophers and sociologists, but also for AI service providers and AI engineers.
Current AI ethics practice is active in the approach of decomposing ethical issues
into specific multiple problems and solving each problem individually. For example, in
[15], the five important perspectives for developing responsible AI are explained as
2 K. Esaki, et al.
explainability, fairness, robustness, transparency, and privacy, and the direction of
practical efforts is shown. In particular, the discussion and development of AI ethics
has been stimulated by breaking them down into quantitative problems. In engineering,
where the basic approach is to improve and optimize quantitative indicators, it is a use-
ful approach to define problems with vague quantitative indicators, such as ethical is-
sues, as multiple problems that can be quantified, and to develop solutions for each of
them. For example, various quantitative evaluation indicators have been proposed for
fairness, and methods for improving them are actively being developed [16-17].
On the other hand, there do not seem to be many opportunities to discuss and develop
ethical issues from an engineering perspective in a unified way. For example, there has
not been sufficient progress in deepening the engineering-based unified understanding
of the question “What is ethical AI?”. Issues such as fairness and safety are obviously
important in the practice of ethical AI. However, we believe that the difficulty of AI
ethics issues lies in the conflict between multiple issues. For example, the Trolley Prob-
lem is a well-known hypothetical problem that demonstrates the difficulty of making
ethical decisions, however in the case of automated driving, the Trolley Problem is not
a hypothetical problem, but rather a real-world conflict between the safety of the driver
and the fairness of human life. For this reason, we believe it is important to develop and
implement solutions based on a unified view of what AI ethics is, rather than addressing
ethical issues from multiple individual perspectives.
In addition, when tackling big issues such as ethics, it is important in the practice of
development not only to create a unified picture, but also to divide it into appropriate
stages and levels, and to accumulate results step by step toward the final goal. The same
problem can be seen in the fields of automated driving and artificial general intelligence
(AGI). In the development of automated driving, the meaning of “automated” is broad,
so it is important to have a common understanding of “automated” in order to have
effective discussions among practitioners. In the field of automated driving, the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has proposed a system of levels of automated driv-
ing[18], which enables developers to have more effective discussions by clarifying
what level of automated driving they are discussing, and also enables the incremental
improvement of automated driving. Similarly, in the development of AGI, DeepMind
has proposed levels of AGI[19] to enable more effective discussions between AGI re-
searchers and practitioners, as the meaning of “general” is broad and ambiguous.
We believe that the importance of the AGI and Autonomous Driving levels lies in
the fact that they do not break down grand goals into multiple goals, but rather capture
the problem from a unified perspective and define the stages of development of the
problem from that unified perspective. For example, at the AGI level, the grand goal of
“general” is captured from the two perspectives of “autonomy” and “performance,” and
the development stages are defined. This paper proposes a new practical approach to
AI ethics problems that (1) draws a picture of AI ethics from a unified perspective,
rather than breaking down ethical issues into multiple individual problems, and (2)
breaks down (and clearly specifies) this picture into stages (levels) from a unified per-
spective. Specifically, we propose an e-person architecture that captures AI ethical is-
sues from a unified perspective and defines their levels. The e-person architecture rein-
terprets the e-person concept proposed by philosopher Deguchi [20,21] from an
e-person Architecture and Framework 3
engineering perspective into a form that can be put into practice. The e-person archi-
tecture sees the basis of ethics as trust in people, and classifies and organizes this as a
process of reducing uncertainty that can be manipulated from an engineering viewpoint.
In particular, it is characterized by its method of trying to reduce uncertainty not through
AI alone, but through interaction and communication with humans and society. In con-
trast to the conventional many discussions of AI ethics to date have focused on the
ethics of AI (Ethics “of” AI) and the impact of AI ethics on human ethics (Ethics “by”
AI), the e-person architecture takes a different approach, viewing ethics as something
that should be created jointly by humans and AI (Ethics “with” AI) and focusing on the
bidirectional relationship between humans and AI. In other words, it is characterized
by reconceptualizing the relationship between humans and AI from the conventional
unidirectional relationship of humans using AI as a tool to a bidirectional relationship
of humans and AI as co-adventurers.
In Section 2, this paper organizes existing discussions and issues regarding exist-
ing AI ethics. Next, in Section 3, we propose the e-person architecture with the aim of
solving the problems in the existing discussions. Finally, in Section 4, we propose a
framework for implementing the e-person architecture in concrete terms, and we intro-
duce our past efforts and future issues in line with the proposed framework.

2.1 Philosophical Exploration of Artificial Intelligence: From Early
Speculations to Modern Ethical Challenges
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a subject of discussion primarily in the field of
philosophy since its inception at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. Early philosophi-
cal discussions mainly focused on the definition of AI, its possibilities, and its relation-
ship with human intelligence. As AI technology rapidly developed, philosophers grad-
ually turned their attention to ethical issues surrounding AI, its moral status, controlla-
bility, and social impact.
This section organizes the most influential philosophical literature on AI from the
past 20 years and analyzes its development in chronological order.
The Moral Status of AI: The Starting Point of AI Ethics. The ethical exploration of
artificial intelligence can be traced back to Floridi and Sanders (2004) [22], who pub-
lished “On the Morality of Artificial Agents.” This paper was the first to systematically
analyze the moral status of artificial agents. From the perspective of information ethics,
they argued that while AI is not a moral agent in the traditional sense, it should be
considered a moral patient deserving ethical consideration in certain contexts. This the-
ory became the foundation for subsequent discussions on AI ethics and responsibility.
Two years later, Moor (2006) [23], in the paper “The Dartmouth College Artificial In-
telligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years,” reflected on the development of AI and
outlined philosophical challenges for the next half-century. He raised the issue of “AI’s
moral agency,” posing the question of how ethical responsibility should be defined if
4 K. Esaki, et al.
AI can make autonomous decisions. This issue remains a central topic in AI governance
and legal frameworks today.
The Rise of Superintelligence and the AI Control Problem. Entering the 2010s, as
AI capabilities significantly improved, philosophers began to focus on the existential
risks and control challenges posed by AI. Bostrom (2014) [24], in the book Superintel-
ligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, systematically analyzed the risks posed by super-
intelligence. He introduced the “control problem” and the “value alignment problem,”
questioning whether AI, if it surpasses human intelligence, can be controlled and made
to act in accordance with human values. These issues have become core challenges in
the field of AI safety, prompting institutions like OpenAI and DeepMind to intensify
research on AI governance. After Bostrom raised concerns about the threats of super-
intelligence, Russell (2019) [25], in Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the
Problem of Control, further developed the concept of human-compatible AI. He argued
that future AI design should not merely pursue optimal decision-making but should
center on human preferences and values. This idea has driven the development of hu-
man-centered AI and influenced policymakers’ approaches to AI regulation.
Deep Integration of Philosophy and AI Technology. As AI technology entered the
era of deep learning, discussions between philosophers and computer scientists became
increasingly intertwined. At the same time, AI ethics research entered a data-driven
phase. Cappelen and Dever (2021) [26], in Making AI Intelligible: Philosophical Foun-
dations, argued that AI explainability is central to human-machine coexistence. They
pointed out that humans should not blindly trust black-box models but must understand
the logic behind AI decisions. This perspective has influenced the field of explainable
AI, promoting the evolution of AI models toward greater transparency. Gao et al.
(2024) [27], in “AI Ethics: A Bibliometric Analysis, Critical Issues, and Key Gaps,”
used large-scale data analysis to uncover the main trends in AI ethics research over the
past 20 years. They found that AI ethics research has shifted from early discussions of
moral agency to specific issues such as fairness, transparency, and algorithmic bias.
This reflects the growing integration of AI technology into social structures. Finally,
Velthoven and Marcus (2024) [28], in “Problems in AI, Their Roots in Philosophy, and
Implications for Science and Society,” pointed out errors in knowledge growth within
AI philosophy. Citing the theories of Karl Popper and David Deutsch, they argued that
current AI “learning” is essentially pattern recognition, not true knowledge creation.
This view challenges mainstream AI cognitive models and provides a new philosophi-
cal framework for future AI development.
From the 2004 discussions on the moral status of AI to the 2024 deep reflections on
explainability and knowledge growth, philosophical research on artificial intelligence
has evolved from theoretical construction to technological integration. Early debates
primarily focused on whether AI could be granted moral status, while the 2010s cen-
tered on the risks of superintelligence and human-machine relationships. Entering the
2020s, AI philosophical research became more practical, revolving around ethics,
e-person Architecture and Framework 5
fairness, and explainability, driving progress in policymaking and technological opti-
mization. In the future, with the development of generative AI, neuro-symbolic AI, and
self-evolving AI, philosophy is expected to continue playing a crucial role in AI gov-
ernance, value alignment, and models of human-machine coexistence.
2.2 The Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Sociology: A Review
of Recent Research and Development Trends
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) not only drives technological progress
but also profoundly impacts social structures, economic systems, and human-machine
relationships. In recent years, as AI capabilities have grown increasingly powerful, the
field of sociology has engaged in a series of significant studies on AI ethics, social
adaptability, cooperation mechanisms, and economic effects. This section organizes
key studies from the past decade on the coexistence of AI and human society and ana-
lyzes their development in chronological order.
Early Explorations: Frameworks for AI’s Social Impact and Cooperation Mech-
anisms. The social impact of AI was initially explored primarily around ethics, coop-
eration mechanisms, and its role in socioeconomics. Benjamins and Salazar (2020)
[29], in “Towards a Framework for Understanding Societal and Ethical Implications of
Artificial Intelligence,” constructed a framework for socio-ethical analysis, exploring
core issues such as AI fairness, transparency, and accountability, laying the groundwork
for subsequent AI governance research.
Deepening Research: AI’s Impact on Labor Markets, Social Inequality, and Pol-
icy. With the advancement of AI technology, sociologists began to focus on its pro-
found socioeconomic effects. Deranty and Corbin (2024) [30], in “Artificial Intelli-
gence and Work: A Critical Review of Recent Research from the Social Sciences,”
systematically reviewed research on the relationship between AI and labor within the
social sciences, analyzing how automation transforms labor market structures and not-
ing that while AI may reduce jobs, it also has the potential to create new forms of work.
Capraro et al. (2024) [31], in “The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on So-
cioeconomic Inequalities and Policy Making,” further explored the effects of generative
AI on socioeconomic inequality. They pointed out that the proliferation of AI could
exacerbate disparities in wealth and resource distribution, while simultaneously posing
higher governance demands on policymakers.
Co-existence and Adaptation: AI’s Dynamic Role in Social Systems. Recent re-
search has focused on the long-term symbiotic relationship between AI and human so-
ciety. Pedreschi et al. (2024) [32], in “Human-AI Coevolution,” proposed the theory of
“human-AI coevolution,” arguing that AI is not merely a technological tool but an in-
telligent system capable of forming dynamic cooperative relationships with human so-
ciety. This theory offers a new perspective on human-machine hybrid intelligence,
6 K. Esaki, et al.
asserting that while AI must adapt to human society, human society must also adapt to
AI’s influence. Meanwhile, Mahmud et al. (2023) [33], in “A Study of Human-AI Sym-
biosis for Creative Work: Recent Developments and Future Directions in Deep Learn-
ing,” focused on how AI is applied to creative work, analyzing how AI collaborates
with humans in fields like art and writing. They argued that AI’s role in creative indus-
tries should be seen not as a replacement but as an augmentative collaborative partner.
Recent studies have further deepened the role of AI in the social sciences. Xu et al.
(2024) [34], in “AI for Social Science and Social Science of AI: A Survey,” explored
how AI functions both as a tool for social science research and as a subject of study.
They argued that AI not only drives methodological innovation in social research but
also has the potential to influence social structures and individual behavior. Solís et al.
(2023) [35], in “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Higher Education: A Socio-
logical Perspective,” analyzed AI’s impact on higher education, exploring its potential
effects on automated assessment, personalized learning, and educational support, re-
flecting AI’s profound role in education and knowledge dissemination.
Sociological research on AI has evolved from “human-machine cooperation and eth-
ics” to “impacts on economic policy” and finally to “symbiosis and adaptation.” Cur-
rently, AI’s role has shifted from being a tool to becoming part of an intelligent eco-
system, bringing methodological transformations to social science research itself. In
the future, research is expected to advance on how AI shapes social governance mod-
els, influences cultural values, and deepens the theoretical framework of human-ma-
chine hybrid intelligence.
2.3 Engineering Research on Artificial Intelligence: The Evolution of
Safe Coexistence and Human-AI Collaborative Design in the AGI
Era
In response to the emerging reality of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and its ac-
companying safety challenges, engineering research on human-AI collaboration has
transitioned from early unidirectional technical support to bidirectional, complemen-
tary symbiosis. This section organizes key literature along a timeline, dividing it into
two phases: early exploration of basic interactions and safety mechanisms and the shift
toward bidirectional collaboration and safe coexistence in the AGI era.
Exploration of Basic Interactions and Safety Mechanisms. Breazeal [36], in the
2003 work Toward Sociable Robots, first proposed the concept of social robots capable
of human-like emotional expression and natural interaction, laying the emotional foun-
dation for human-AI interaction. During the same period, Dzindolet et al. [37], in “The
Role of Trust in Automation Reliance,” experimentally verified the role of transparency
in automation systems for building user trust, revealing the moderating effect of trust
in automated decision-making. In 2004, Lee and See [38], in “Trust in Automation:
Designing for Appropriate Reliance,” systematized a methodology for designing trust
in human-AI collaboration to prevent both overreliance and excessive skepticism. In
e-person Architecture and Framework 7
2008, Goodrich and Schultz [39], in “Human-Robot Interaction: A Survey,” provided
a comprehensive review of theories and practices for achieving safe and efficient coex-
istence in industrial and service robots. Gray and Wegner [40], in their 2012 paper
“Feeling Robots and Human Zombies: Mind Perception and the Uncanny Valley,” an-
alyzed human psychological responses to attributing minds to robots and the “uncanny
valley” phenomenon, serving as a crucial warning for human-centered design. In 2016,
Amodei et al. [41], in “Concrete Problems in AI Safety,” discussed specific challenges
in AI safety from an engineering perspective, promoting the development of safety
strategies for human-AI coexistence in high-risk environments.
The Shift Toward Bidirectional Collaboration and Safe Coexistence in the AGI
Era. In 2019, Amershi et al. [42], in “Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction,” systema-
tized human-centered interaction design guidelines based on large-scale user studies,
marking a fundamental shift from unidirectional technical support to bidirectional com-
plementary collaboration. In 2020, Prakash and Mathewson [43], in “Conceptualization
and Framework of Hybrid Intelligence Systems,” constructed a theoretical framework
for hybrid intelligence systems that integrate human experts and AI to address real-
world challenges. In 2023, Fabri et al. [44], in “Disentangling Human-AI Hybrids –
Conceptualizing the Interworking of Humans and AI-Enabled Systems,” systematized
the components and interaction mechanisms of human-AI hybrid systems from a hybrid
intelligence perspective, providing a theoretical foundation for building efficient bidi-
rectional collaboration systems. In 2024, Holter and El-Assady [45], in “Deconstructing
Human-AI Collaboration: Agency, Interaction, and Adaptation,” proposed a new col-
laboration framework based on three dimensions—agency, interaction, and adaptabil-
ity—reflecting the increasing sophistication and precision of research on safe coexist-
ence and collaborative design in the AGI era.
2.4 Summary
Up to this point, this section has provided an overview of related research in the fields
of philosophy, sociology, and engineering concerning the ethical concerns of AI. To
summarize the situation in each field: In philosophy, discussions have evolved from
conceptual and speculative issues, such as moral agency and the singularity, to more
concrete and practical concerns in recent years, such as responsibility in the event of
accidents and AI governance, driven by progress in AI deployment. Similar to recent
discussions in philosophy, in sociology, there are active discussions on specific issues
like AI’s impact on labor markets and economic inequality. A key feature of sociolog-
ical discussions is that AI is not viewed as existing outside of human society but as one
of its constituent elements, treating AI-related problems as intrinsic to society rather
than external challenges. Likewise, in engineering, AI is also seen as an intrinsic soci-
etal issue, with active discussions on addressing it as a bidirectional problem based on
human-AI interaction.
From these trends in related research, it is believed that a fundamental approach to
AI ethics involves viewing the issues as intrinsic to society and focusing on
8 K. Esaki, et al.
bidirectional human-AI interactions for problem-solving. In other words, in the era of
AI deployment, it is considered crucial to propose new AI models aimed at building a
new relationship between humans and AI, envisioning a symbiotic society. These new
AI models are expected to face the challenge of flexible and dynamic adaptation to
diverse societies and cultures. Furthermore, realizing a new relationship between hu-
mans and AI through these models is thought to lead not only to simple technological
advancements in AI but also to the creation of important research fields that innovate
the knowledge generation process in society.
3 Proposal of e-person Architecture
3.1 Approach for Building e-person Architecture
This paper proposes an alternative AI architecture to the conventional unidirectional
use of AI as a tool by humans, in which artificial agents live and form society together
with us as equal partner: the e-person architecture. The e-person architecture reinter-
prets the e-person concept proposed by the philosopher Deguchi [20,21] from an engi-
neering viewpoint into a form that can be put into practice. The goal is to solve the
ethical problems in the social application of conventional AI, which is heavily focused
on intelligence, by using artificial agents as equal partners. In this section, we explain
the approach to building the e-person architecture proposed in this paper.
Artificial agents that live with us and form a society with us require not only the
labor, computational power, and reasoning ability that have been required of conven-
tional artificial intelligence, but also the various social cognitive abilities that we use in
our daily lives with other people. These social cognitive abilities are expected to be
broad and include emotional intelligence such as empathy and compassion for others,
understanding and adhering to rules and norms that may differ depending on culture
and situation, and having relationships of trust and responsibility with others.
One approach to constructing e-person architecture is to consider and list these di-
verse cognitive abilities individually and then aggregate them (bottom-up approach). It
is believed that the current solutions for AI ethics are largely based on such a bottom-
up approach. However, when building an artificial agent with such a wide range of
abilities in a bottom-up manner, difficulties are expected in integrating multiple cogni-
tive abilities in a consistent manner. For example, when there is a conflict between an
emotional decision based on empathy for others and a rational decision based on an
understanding of laws and regulations, the difficulty arises in determining which deci-
sion is appropriate in a given situation. This problem is expected to become more com-
plex and challenging as the number of bottom-up integrated cognitive capabilities in-
creases. In addition, since machine learning models are black boxes and difficult to
control in detail from the outside, it is expected that it will not be easy to connect ma-
chine learning models with different capabilities when using machine learning models
to implement e-person. We also believe that the essence of AI ethics lies in the conflicts
between these multiple decision factors. Therefore, this paper adopts a top-down con-
struction approach, defining the capabilities that form the basis of the sociality and eth-
ics that e-person possess, and defining different capabilities based on these capabilities.
e-person Architecture and Framework 9
There are several ways to think about the cognitive abilities that form the basis of
the top-down definition of the e-person architecture, however we have chosen to base
it on trust. The reason we base it on trust is because we believe that trust in relationships
is the foundation for people to coexist with others rather than live independently. There
is also a broad discussion of the capacity for trust, including emotional trust and trust
in norms, and we believe it is possible to discuss the cognitive capacities expected of
e-person in an integrated way.
Because trust itself is a broad topic of discussion, the top-down approach we take
requires that we define it in a way that allows us to discuss such diverse types of trust
in a unified way and in a format that can be manipulated in an engineering-like manner.
In this paper, we use the definition of trust in social psychology as a reference for such
a definition of trust, and define “the ability to cope with uncertainty” as a fundamental
capability [46]. In [46], trust, which is the foundation of social relationships, is defined
as follows
An individual may be said to have trust in the occurrence of an event if he expects
its occurrence and his expectation leads to behavior which he perceives to have greater
negative motivational consequences if the expectation is not confirmed than positive
motivational consequences if it is confirmed.
In our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to diverse uncertainties, and we are
always required to take these uncertainties into account when making decisions or tak-
ing actions. In real life, it is impossible to try to reduce uncertainty to zero before mak-
ing a decision or taking action, because action and decision-making are required in real
time. In other words, we must accept uncertainty and accept that unpredictable events
may occur when making decisions or taking actions. This definition of trust in social
psychology is that trust is the ability to act and make decisions under such uncertainty.
This paper considers that emotional intelligence skills such as sympathy and empa-
thy for others, and the activities of groups in forming and sharing rules and norms, can
also be seen as the ability to act and make decisions under uncertainty. For example,
we can think of empathy and sympathy as a way to understand each other’s uncertain
hidden states and to act and make decisions together under uncertainty about others by
supporting each other. We can also think of the formation and sharing of rules as a way
of reducing uncertainty by sharing and clarifying appropriate behavior for each situa-
tion in advance.
Uncertainty can be treated mathematically based on probability theory, so it is also
appropriate for engineering operations. The idea of viewing behavior and decision mak-
ing under uncertainty as a unifying basis for cognitive ability is proposed in cognitive
science as the free energy principle. A discussion of implementation based on the free
energy principle is given in Section 4.
3.2 Definition of e-person Architecture
Based on the ideas in the previous section, this paper defines the e-person architecture
by considering handling uncertainty as a fundamental cognitive ability that e-person
should possess. The definition is given from two perspectives: the person perspective,
10 K. Esaki, et al.
which organizes uncertainty scenes comprehensively, and the level perspective, which
is based on the depth of information in each person.
In our daily lives, we are confronted with various uncertainties. In order to compre-
hensively list these uncertainties, we classify them into the following three types based
on the perspective of the person who is aware of the uncertainty faced in daily life. The
three classification scenes are shown in Fig. 1.
(1) First-person perspective uncertainty (subjective)
Uncertainty from one party (I) towards another party (You) with whom they are face-
to-face.
(2) Second-person perspective uncertainty (intersubjective)
A bidirectional uncertainty shared by the party (I) and the other party (You), who is the
other party facing them.
(3) Third-person uncertainty (objective)
Uncertainty from those who are not involved (They) from those who are involved
(I/You).
Non-party (They)
Third person (objective)
e-person (I) Person opposite (You)
First person (subjective)
Second person(inter-subjective)
Interested party
Fig. 1. Classification from the perspective of recognizing uncertainty
This classification is defined by the subject of the uncertainty and the direction of the
uncertainty. We consider three types of uncertainty: the e-person itself (I) as the subject
of uncertainty, and two or more other parties that interact directly with the subject of
uncertainty: you (You), and other parties that are not the subject of uncertainty but can
indirectly affect the subject of uncertainty: they (They). As shown in Fig. 1, first-person
uncertainty and third-person uncertainty are defined as unidirectional uncertainty,
while second person uncertainty is defined as bidirectional uncertainty.
Unidirectional uncertainty is uncertainty in a one-way inference from the source of
the inference to the target of the inference. Bidirectional uncertainty, on the other hand,
e-person Architecture and Framework 11
assumes that two or more agents are both the source and the target of the inference, and
that the situation is one in which they handle the uncertainty together through commu-
nication with each other, rather than independently. These three types of uncertainty
can be understood in terms of subjectivity, intersubjectivity (also called co-subjectivity
or mutual subjectivity), and objectivity. First-person uncertainty is uncertainty based
on inference about the environment, and can be understood as subjectivity. Similarly,
objectivity is uncertainty that is given to the parties involved from the outside as com-
mon understanding or knowledge, and uncertainty that is shared by two or more agents
can be understood as intersubjectivity. Note that although third person uncertainty and
objectivity are uncertainties shared by multiple agents, they are not bidirectional, unlike
second person uncertainty and intersubjectivity. They are given to the parties as general
facts, and the parties cannot directly express their agreement or disagreement with
them. Objection and agreement are always expressed to the parties, and this paper con-
siders them as a two person scene.
Existing AI research often discusses first-person (subjective) or third-person (objec-
tive) uncertainty. For example, the world model in machine learning is a prediction
model for the world based on the experience of a particular artificial agent [47]. It is
assumed that the situation can be handled by simply improving the accuracy of the
prediction model for the world (i.e. environment). On the other hand, for example, large
language models are assumed to learn an understanding that is close to objective from
the large amount of experience of third parties that is not their own experience. Large
language models are assumed to acquire general knowledge that can be widely and
generally applied through the vast amounts of data from different people in different
scenes. Since communication between parties with different subjectivities also affects
each other’s subjectivities, it is also important to focus on second person scenes in the
formation of subjectivities. The e-person architecture we propose focuses on second
person intersubjective uncertainty and relates it to first and third person uncertainty.
One of the features of the proposed architecture is its focus on bidirectional second
person uncertainty. Most discussions in conventional AI ethics have focused on ques-
tions such as “Does AI understand and follow human rules (norms or laws)?” (Ethics
of AI) or “What are the negative effects of AI on human ethics?” (Ethics by AI). In
contrast, our architecture considers ethics as a concept that is not a unidirectional con-
cept from humans to AI, but rather a concept that is co-constructed through human-AI
interaction (ethics with AI). With this approach, the artificial agent proposed in this
paper aims to create a new relationship with artificial agents as partner, replacing the
traditional use of AI as a tool. In this way, AI is not a slave that is forced by humans to
deal with ethical concerns and risk measures unilaterally, but can be said to be a co-
adventurer that works with humans to deal with ethical concerns and risk measures.
Next, we will organize the e-person architecture from the perspective of uncertainty
based on person perspective and classify it into the following three stages. These stages
are defined based on the depth of information.
(1) Uncertainty of observable information (e.g. behavior, speech, etc.)
(2) Uncertainty of shallow latent information (e.g. emotions, attention, goal, etc.)
(3) Uncertainty of deep latent information (e.g. purpose, values, etc.)
12 K. Esaki, et al.
In other words, it is a classification based on whether the object of uncertainty is
observable (observable information) or not (hidden information) and, in the case of
unobservable hidden information, the depth of the information. Observable information
is information that can be obtained directly by the observer. This includes, for example,
the behavior or speech of others, which can be obtained by sight or by hearing. Con-
versely, unobservable hidden information includes such as other people’s emotions,
goals, and values. It is not possible to directly observe emotions, goals, or values. Even
if another person clearly states that “I am happy.” it is impossible to know whether this
is true or not. For this reason, such as emotion, goals, values, etc. are hidden infor-
mation. The levels are defined based on the idea that it is generally expected that hidden
information is more difficult to infer than observable information, and that the deeper
the level, the more difficult it is to infer. By defining these levels, we aim to support
the realization of a step-by-step development of the big picture of ethics by setting de-
velopment goals.
In accordance with the above two classification perspectives of the target uncer-
tainty, the person perspective and the depth of information, the following Table 1 shows
the definition of the uncertainty that the e-person architecture should address. The depth
of information is considered to correspond to the difficulty of realizing e-person and is
labeled as Level (Lv.) in Table 1.
In Table 1, uncertainty is classified into a total of nine types, consisting of three types
based on person and three types based on information type. Each uncertainty is ex-
pressed by . The uncertainty can be applied to various functions, such as the
standard deviation ( ) of a probability distribution, as well as the free energy, which
will be discuu(s⋅s)ed in the next sectiuo(n⋅.) The observation information is represented as ,
the action as , and tσhe hidden state as ( ). The party itself is represented
as , the person they are talking to as , and a third party as . For exampl𝑜𝑜e,
Level 1 first-𝑎𝑎person uncertainty is expr𝑠𝑠es𝑙𝑙s:e𝑙𝑙d𝑜𝑜 a𝑙𝑙s, ℎ:ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ℎand expresses the uncertainty of
the𝐼𝐼 party (I) about the observational info𝑌𝑌r𝑜𝑜m𝑌𝑌ation. Similarly, Level 𝑇𝑇1ℎ s𝑒𝑒e𝑒𝑒cond-person un-
certainty is expressed as and

, and expresses the uncertainty
of each of the two parties (I/You) regarding their own observations.

The e-person architecture is expected to handle each of the uncertainties shown in
the table. For example, dealing with second-person uncertainty means reducing the two
uncertainties and sequentially through communication and
collaboration. More rigorous probability expressions of uncertainty at the implementa-

tion level and specific implementation proposals for dealing with it are described in the
framework in Section 4. As shown in Table 1, both first-person and second-person un-
certainties include uncertainty about , and they influence each other. In other words,
two parties manipulating second-person uncertainty can affect each other’s first-person
uncertainty through communication. I𝑜𝑜t 𝐼𝐼 is important to note that the uncertainties shown
in the table can affect each other in this way. Moreover, the effect is to affect each other
through communication between second person artificial agents.

4 e-person Framework
4.1 Development Policy of the Framework
We aim to make e-persons coexist with humans. As a development strategy for e-per-
sons coexisting with humans, referring to discussions on human-coexisting robots,
there are two main candidates: the environmental structuring strategy and the humanoid
strategy (so-called humanoid robots.) The environmental structuring strategy involves
modifying the human living environment to match the robot’s system configuration.
For example, attaching two-dimensional codes to objects or environments to recognize
object positions using cameras, eliminating all steps within facilities for wheeled move-
ment, or using machine language for system input. On the other hand, the humanoid
strategy involves designing the robot’s system configuration to match the human living
environment. For example, designing hardware to match the average height and limb
structure of human adults, designing software to match human gestures, and using nat-
ural language for system input. There is no superiority or inferiority between the strat-
egies; the difference lies in whether humans adapt to e-persons or e-persons adapt to
humans as the first step towards coexistence. Regardless of the strategy taken, it is ex-
pected that as coexistence progresses, both humans and e-persons will adapt to each
14 K. Esaki, et al.
other. Generally, it is considered that the systems adapt to humans faster than humans
adapt to the systems. For example, early computers were only used by a limited number
of engineers, and before they spread to non-engineers, computers evolved to be usable
by non-engineers. Considering that systems adapt faster than humans, we adopt the
humanoid strategy as a development strategy for e-persons to penetrate human society
more quickly.
The humanoid strategy for e-persons involves designing the system configuration of
e-persons by emulating human brain functions. As mentioned in Section 2, conven-
tional models emulating individual functions of the human brain have been designed to
address individual tasks. However, considering that the human brain is a massive struc-
ture connected by generalized neurons rather than specialized structures for individual
functions, it is necessary to consider not only individual functions but also the coordi-
nation and integration between functions. The system configuration of e-persons needs
to be designed using a unified method that emulates the integrative nature of the human
brain.
A hypothesis explaining the human brain in a unified manner is the Free Energy
Principle (FEP) [48–52]. FEP is said to be a principle followed by living organisms,
including humans, and unifies the perceptual and motor processes, which have been
treated separately, as the minimization of variational free energy. According to FEP,
variational free energy is expressed as the sum of the KL divergence between the pos-
terior distribution concerning the hidden state under observation and the
recognition distribution approximating it, and the Shannon surprise of the sensory
signal: 𝑝𝑝(𝑜𝑜|𝑠𝑠) 𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜

vironment from the observation , corresponding to the minimization of the first term
in equation (1). On the other hand, the motor process is the proc𝑠𝑠ess of inferring the
policy of actions that change th𝑜𝑜e hidden state of the external environment through
changes in observation , corresponding to the minimization of the second term in
equatio𝜋𝜋n (1). Therefore, the perceptual and motor𝑠𝑠 processes are treated uniformly as the
minimization of free ene𝑜𝑜rgy.
FEP allows handling uncertainty by treating perceptual and motor processes uni-
formly as inference. Variational free energy deals with inference based on past and
present observations. As mentioned in Section 3, to handle deep level uncertainty, it is
necessary to infer including future observations. In FEP, the expected free energy ob-
tained by extending variational free energy to future observations is:

ergy is action planning. In the equation (2), the first term is called epistemic value,
and th𝜋𝜋e second term is called pragmatic value. 𝜋𝜋Epistemic value is the value of seeking
new i𝐺𝐺nformation, and pragmatic value is the value of seeking favorable observations.
Minimizing the expected free energy balances these values, resolving the
𝐺𝐺
e-person Architecture and Framework 15
exploration-exploitation dilemma. In other words, by increasing epistemic value, ex-
ploratory actions are taken, while by increasing pragmatic value, exploitative actions
are taken, responding to environmental uncertainty.
FEP has mainly dealt with first-person agents. For example, in the behavior of a
single rat in a T-maze, the position of the rat and the valence of stimuli are defined as
observations, and the generative model is described. Also, in the resonant behavior of
two birds, the pitch of the sounds each bird hears is defined as observations, and the
generative model is described. In this way, even when dealing with multiple agents,
other agents are treated without distinction from the environment, and the first-person
perspective of the self-agent is modeled. To handle the uncertainty of self-agents and
other agents as mentioned in Section 3, it is necessary to extend FEP to a framework
that also handles second-person and third-person perspectives.
4.2 Framework
We explain our proposed framework using graphical models. We present models for
the first person, second person, and third person.
The first person model is a hierarchical structure based on the conventional FEP.
Fig. 2 shows the graphical model for the first person. The set of generative models for
levels 1 and 2 in the first person is the same. The initial hidden state is inferred under
the prior distribution . Based on the policy inferred under the 𝑙𝑙expected free en-
ergy , the hidden state after transition through the transition m𝑠𝑠o 1 del and the ob-
servation through t𝑫𝑫he o𝑙𝑙bservation model 𝜋𝜋 are sequentially output. At this time,
level 𝑮𝑮1 deal𝑙𝑙s with the unc𝑠𝑠e 𝜏𝜏 rtainty regarding the observation , and𝑩𝑩 level 2 deals
with the u𝑜𝑜n 𝜏𝜏 certainty regarding t𝑙𝑙he hidd𝑨𝑨en state . By formul𝑙𝑙ating the observa-

by formulating the hidden sta𝑙𝑙te as the conditional probabili𝑙𝑙ty of the previous hidden
state an𝑨𝑨d policy represente𝑌𝑌d( 𝑜𝑜b 𝐼𝐼 y) the transition model and 𝑜𝑜e 𝐼𝐼 xpected free energy , the
uncertainty regarding the hidden state is handled. Choosing actions to mini-

set of genera𝑌𝑌t(iv𝑠𝑠e 𝐼𝐼) models for level 3 in the first𝑠𝑠 𝐼𝐼 person adds a hierarchy above the set of
generative models for levels 1 𝑮𝑮and 2. The generative models of the higher and lower
hierarchies are connected by inferring the lower hierarchy’s expected free energy and
prior distribution based on the higher hierarchy’s observation . At this time, level
3 deals with the uncertainty regarding the hidden state .ℎ By formulatin𝑮𝑮g the

Fig. 2. Graphical model of first person
The second person model connects the models of two agents in the conventional
FEP. Fig. 3 shows the graphical model for the second person. The set of generative
models for levels 1 and 2 in the second person is the same. Unlike the first person
model, the set of generative models for “I” and “You” are connected bidirectionally.
Specifically, the observation model for “I” receives the hidden state of “I” and the
hidden state of “You.” Similarly, the observation model for “You” receives the
hidden state of “You” and the h𝑨𝑨idden state of “I.” In practice, t𝑠𝑠h 𝐼𝐼 e hidden states
of “I” and “Y𝑠𝑠𝑌𝑌 o 𝑦𝑦 u 𝑦𝑦 ” cannot be directly input to each other. The𝑨𝑨refore, for example, the
observation m𝑠𝑠𝑌𝑌 o 𝑦𝑦 d 𝑦𝑦 el for “I” receives the hidden 𝑠𝑠s 𝐼𝐼 tate of “You” inferred based on
the observation obtained by sensors of “I.” A few examples will be illustrated in
Section 4.3. At this𝑨𝑨 time, the uncertainties handled at𝑠𝑠 𝑌𝑌 e 𝑦𝑦 a 𝑦𝑦 ch level are for both “I” and
“You.” Level 1 𝑜𝑜d 𝐼𝐼 eals with the uncertainty regarding the observation, and

sition model , and expected free energy . However, unlike the first person model,
the marginal distribution includes not only the hidden state of “I” but also the𝑨𝑨 hidden
state of “𝑩𝑩You.” The set of generative m𝑮𝑮odels for level 3 in the second person adds
a hierarchy above the set of generative models for levels 1𝑠𝑠 𝐼𝐼 and 2. Similar to levels 1
and 2𝑠𝑠, 𝑌𝑌 t 𝑦𝑦 h 𝑦𝑦 e set of generative models for “I” and “You” are connected. Specifically, the
observation model for the higher hierarchy of “I” receives the hidden state of “I”

deals with the uncertainty ℎ regarding the hidden state. Similar to the first

by the transition model a𝑌𝑌nd( 𝑠𝑠e 𝐼𝐼 x,p𝑠𝑠e 𝑌𝑌 c 𝑦𝑦 t 𝑦𝑦 e)d free energy . However, unlike the first person
model, the marginal distribution includes not only the hidden state of “I” but also the
hidden state of “Yo𝑩𝑩u.” 𝑮𝑮

The third person model connects the models above the second person model, but the
direction of connection is different. Fig. 4 shows the graphical model for the third per-
son. The set of generative models for levels 1 and 2 in the third person is the same. The
set of generative models for “I” and “You” are connected to the set of generative models
for “They,” but the connection is unidirectional, unlike the second person model. Spe-
cifically, the observation models for “I” and “You” receive the hidden states of “I” and
“You” and the hidden state of “They,” but the observation model for “They” only re-
ceives the hidden state of “They.” At this time, the uncertainties handled at each level
are for “I,” “You,” and “They.” Level 1 deals with the uncer-
tainty regarding the observation, and level 2 deals with the uncer-
tainty 𝑙𝑙 𝑙𝑙 𝑙𝑙 regarding the hidden state. Similar to the first and second per-

only the hidden states of “I” and “You” but also the hidden state of “They𝑨𝑨.” The set of

generative models for level 3 in the third person adds a hierarchy above the set of gen-
erative models for levels 1 and 2. Similar to levels 1 and 2, the set of generative models
for “I” and “You” are connected unidirectionally to the set of generative models for
“They.” Specifically, the observation model for the higher hierarchy of “I” and
“You” receives the hidden states and of “I” and “You” and the hidden
state of “They.” Furthermore, tℎhe calcuℎl𝑨𝑨ation of the expected free energy for

As shown above, the proposed framework supports multi-agent systems with de-
pendent relationships, unlike the conventional FEP, which was mainly limited to single-
agent or independent multi-agent systems. The dependent relationships between agents
are formulated as mutual connections of each agent’s probability distributions and
e-person Architecture and Framework 19
generative models. Additionally, the connection between “I” and “You” is bidirec-
tional, while the connection with “They,” who are positioned above the agents, is uni-
directional, encompassing different types of dependent relationships. Furthermore, the
ease of observation associated with dependent relationships is expressed through the
hierarchy from levels 1 to 3. By seamlessly connecting directly observable low-level
observations to high-level hidden states that are not directly observable, it is possible
to implement a system that handles something that is not directly observable, such as
values.
4.3 Application Examples of the Framework
To handle first-person, level 1 uncertainty, the e-person framework was applied to par-
tial observation character recognition [53] and object manipulation with dynamic prop-
erties [54]. Partial observation character recognition involves identifying characters by
moving the observation area in situations where the entire character cannot be observed
at once. The uncertainty in this problem arises from not knowing what character it is
due to the unknown image outside the observable area. By applying the e-person frame-
work, the system sequentially inferred characters and determined the observation area
to move to. On the other hand, object manipulation with dynamic properties involves
storing objects in a box in situations where it is unknown how the object will deform
until grasped by a robot. The uncertainty in this problem arises from not knowing the
trajectory for storing the object in the box due to unknown object behavior. By applying
the e-person framework, the robot successfully stored objects in a box by executing
trajectories with margins to avoid collisions with surrounding obstacles based on the
inference accuracy of object behavior. In both cases, uncertainty was addressed by ac-
cumulating better actions from a first-person perspective.
To handle first-person, level 2 uncertainty, the e-person framework was applied to
dynamic selection of robot joints according to objectives [55]. Dynamic selection of
robot joints according to objectives involves appropriately selecting joints necessary
for a robot to perform a target task. The uncertainty in this problem arises from not
knowing which joints to move due to an underdetermined problem where the degrees
of freedom for motion required to perform the target task are smaller than the number
of joints. By applying the e-person framework, we transformed it into a problem of
which robot joints to focus on and performed the target task by moving only the mini-
mum necessary joints. Uncertainty was addressed by focusing on embodiment from a
first-person perspective.
To handle second-person, level 1 uncertainty, the e-person framework was applied
to autonomous movement of robots at scramble intersections[56,57] and collaborative
transport by robots with different embodiments[58]. Autonomous movement of robots
at scramble intersections involves four robots simultaneously approaching an intersec-
tion from different directions and autonomously moving in such situations. The uncer-
tainty in this problem arises from not knowing which trajectory to take due to unknown
trajectories of three other robots besides one’s own robot. By applying the e-person
framework, the trajectories for one’s own robot are generated based on inference of
one’s own robot’s trajectory seen from other robots. On the other hand, collaborative
20 K. Esaki, et al.
transport by robots with different embodiments involves two robots with different
reachable areas cooperating to transport objects in situations where a single robot can-
not transport objects to target positions. The uncertainty in this problem arises from not
knowing when one’s own robot should act. By applying the e-person framework, we
determined one’s own robot’s action timing without pre-teaching timing by inferring
expected actions of other robots along with one’s own robot’s actions. In both cases,
uncertainty was addressed by deciding actions from a second-person perspective re-
garding relationships with others. Thus, even when applying the same second-person
e-person framework problem, implementation methods differ depending on how
boundaries between “I” and “You” are determined. The e-person framework has im-
plementation flexibility and potential applicability to more problems.
To handle second-person, level 2 uncertainty, the e-person framework was applied
to public goods games with penalties[59]. Public goods games with penalties involve
two players deciding whether or not to contribute their resources and whether or not to
penalize their opponent player. The uncertainty in this problem arises from not knowing
what actions one’s opponent player will take due to unknown opponent behavior. By
applying the e-person framework, the system balanced expected free energy of others
and oneself as social emotional value and decided one’s own actions so that this value
becomes neutral. Uncertainty was addressed by inferring emotions while deciding ac-
tions from a second-person perspective regarding relationships with others.
We have previously applied the e-person framework to observable and unobservable
and shallow uncertainties for first-person and second-person perspectives. We have not
yet addressed unobservable and deep uncertainties for first-person and second-person
perspectives regarding goals and values. To apply the e-person framework to these un-
certainties, it is necessary to consider mechanisms for providing goals and values. One
direction is sharing goals and values from others besides oneself (such as past selves or
current partners). This is an extrinsic perspective on goals and values. Additionally, we
have not yet addressed third-person perspective either. To apply the e-person frame-
work to third-person perspective, it is necessary to consider mechanisms for acquiring
third-person perspective. One direction is treating agents based on large language mod-
els (LLMs), which are currently attracting attention, as third persons.
5 Conclusion
We proposed the e-person architecture with the aim of constructing a unified foundation
to address AI ethics issues and its incremental development. The e-person architecture
is a unified foundation that reduces uncertainty through collaborative cognition and
action with others, i.e., “co-adventure.” By classifying and defining uncertainty along
two axes: (1) the perspectives of first person, second person, and third person, and (2)
the uncertainty based on the latent nature of information at three levels, we support the
incremental development of the foundation. Additionally, to implement the e-person
architecture, we proposed the e-person framework based on the free energy principle,
which considers the reduction of uncertainty as a unified principle of brain function.
e-person Architecture and Framework 21
We presented our application examples of the proposed framework and future chal-
lenges. Our contributions are as follows:
1. We presented the e-person architecture that supports the incremental development
of e-person proposed by Deguchi et al., using uncertainty as a unified metric that can
be quantitatively handled.
2. We demonstrated the e-person framework to implement the e-person architecture
based on the free energy principle.
3. We applied the e-person framework to a wide range of tasks, from character recog-
nition to autonomous robot navigation and collaborative transport by multiple ro-
bots, showing that the e-person architecture serves as a unified foundation and con-
tributes to incremental development.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "e-person Architecture and Framework for Human-AI Co-adventure Relationship"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
