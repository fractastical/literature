This distribution, known as the “free energy density,” represents the system’s internal state, reflecting its beliefs about its environment.The system then attempts to minimize this free energy by adjusting its internal state, effectively updating its beliefs based on new sensory information.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The mathematical framework underpinning this approach is heavily influenced by the principles of maximum entropy and minimum cross-entropy.The principle of maximum entropy states that, given a set of constraints, the probability distribution that is most likely to be observed is the one with the greatest number of accessible states.The principle of minimum cross-entropy, in turn, states that the system will minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual observed data.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The application of this framework to the study of the brain, particularly the work of Friston and his colleagues, has been particularly influential.The free energy principle provides a framework for understanding how the brain generates perceptions and actions.It suggests that the brain is constantly trying to minimize its free energy by predicting its sensory input.As Friston states, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The mathematical tools used in Bayesian mechanics are often drawn from the fields of information theory and stochastic calculus.These tools provide the mathematical machinery for calculating the free energy and for updating beliefs in light of new evidence.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The implications of this approach are far-reaching. It suggests that many of the phenomena we observe in the world are the result of systems attempting to minimize their free energy.This has implications for a wide range of fields, including neuroscience, ecology, and economics.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The development of Bayesian mechanics is an ongoing process, and there are many open questions about its implications.One of the key challenges is to develop more sophisticated models of complex systems.Another challenge is to understand how Bayesian mechanics can be used to explain phenomena that are not easily explained by traditional methods.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The authors have proposed a framework for understanding complex systems that is based on the principles of Bayesian inference and minimization of free energy.This framework provides a powerful tool for understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the brain to ecological systems.As the authors state, “The free energy principle is a theory of how systems can be understood, and how they can be understood in terms of their interactions with their environment.” [1]The development of Bayesian mechanics is an ongoing process, and there are many open questions about its implications.
