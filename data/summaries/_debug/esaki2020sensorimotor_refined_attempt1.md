Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper, addressing all the specified requirements.**Sensorimotor Visual Perception on Embodied System Using Free Energy Principle**The proposed research investigates sensorimotor visual perception through an embodied system leveraging the free energy principle (FEP). The core investigation centers on a system where a body, coupled with a generative memory, achieves sensorimotor perception, effectively mimicking how humans process sensory information. The study’s foundation rests on the FEP, a theoretical framework that posits living systems continuously refine their internal models and sensory predictions to minimize discrepancies – “The authors state: ‘living things obey mathematically and claims that a biological system continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the difference in predicting sensory input.’” This approach contrasts with traditional machine learning methods. The research highlights a key distinction: “The authors state: ‘The spatial limitations of the human body, such as those described above, are treated as constraints called partial.’”The core methodology centers on a system comprised of a body and a generative memory. The system’s design aims to replicate human sensorimotor capabilities. The research emphasizes the FEP’s role in this process – “The authors state: ‘The free energy principle mathematically describes the perceptual and active inferences.’” The system’s architecture is designed to address the limitations of conventional approaches, particularly in scenarios where environmental information is incomplete or uncertain. The research highlights the importance of adaptive inference – “The authors state: ‘The purpose of this study is to achieve human sensorimotor visual perception using the free energy principle (hereafter called FEP; Friston, K. et al.,2006; Friston, K. J.,2010; McGregor, S. et al.,2015; Friston, K. et al.,2017; Buckley, C. L. et al.,2017).’”.The research evaluates the system’s performance in a character recognition task, utilizing a dataset of MNIST characters.
