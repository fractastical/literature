TOWARDS A GEOMETRY AND ANALYSIS FOR BAYESIAN
MECHANICS
DALTON A R SAKTHIVADIVEL
Abstract. In this paper, a simple case of Bayesian mechanics under the free energy
principle is formulated in axiomatic terms. We argue that any dynamical system with
constraintsonitsdynamicsnecessarilylooksasthoughitisperforminginferenceagainst
these constraints, and that in a non-isolated system, such constraints imply external
environmental variables embedding the system. Using aspects of classical dynamical
syste...
