## Zero-shot Structure Learning and Planning for Autonomous Robot Navigation using Active Inference### OverviewThis paper investigates a novel approach to autonomous robot navigation, termed Active Inference Mapping and Planning (AIMAPP). The framework unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within a single generative model, drawing inspiration from hippocampal navigation. AIMAPP leverages topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behaviour, allowing robots to explore and plan actions by minimising expected free energy. The authors demonstrate the system’s adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise, highlighting its robustness compared to state-of-the-art planning models.### MethodologyThe authors present AIMAPP as a biologically inspired navigation model, integrating perception, memory, and action. The core of the model is a generative model that maintains a sparse topological map of the environment, dynamically learning state transitions and planning actions by minimising expected free energy. The model is built upon a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) framework, where the agent continuously updates its belief about the environment based on sensory observations and predicted future outcomes. The model’s key components include:1.**State Representation:** The agent maintains a set of discrete states, representing locations within the environment.2.**Observation Model:** The agent uses a panoramic visual observation to determine its current location.3.**Transition Model:** The agent learns transition probabilities between states based on observed movements.4.**Action Model:** The agent selects actions based on minimising expected free energy.5.**Belief Update:** The agent updates its belief about the environment based on sensory observations and predicted future outcomes.The authors implemented AIMAPP in ROS (Robot Operating System) and tested it in simulated and real-world environments. The experiments involved evaluating the system’s exploration efficiency, robustness to sensor drift, and ability to reach goals in complex environments.### ResultsThe authors demonstrated that AIMAPP achieves exploration efficiency comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art planning-based algorithms (e.g., FAEL, Gbplanner, Frontiers) while maintaining near-optimal coverage relative to human teleoperation (90% Coverage Efficient - CE overall runs). Specifically, the system achieved a mean Coverage Efficiency (CE) of2.25 m2/m, demonstrating a high degree of spatial coverage. The system was able to successfully navigate in a variety of environments, including a small warehouse (80 m2), a large warehouse (280 m2), and a house (21 m2), while maintaining a high level of robustness to sensor drift and environmental changes. The authors observed that the system’s performance was significantly influenced by the quality of the sensor data, with noisy or incomplete data leading to reduced exploration efficiency. The system’s ability to adapt to changing environments and sensor noise was a key factor in its overall robustness.The authors quantified the system’s performance by measuring the average distance travelled by the agent to reach its goals, as well as the number of times the agent had to re-plan its trajectory. The results showed that AIMAPP was able to reach its goals with a significantly lower average distance than traditional planning algorithms. The authors also observed that AIMAPP was able to recover from most motion failures without requiring manual intervention.The authors demonstrated that the system’s performance was highly dependent on the quality of the sensor data. In noisy environments, the system’s performance was significantly reduced. However, the system was able to adapt to noisy environments by continuously updating its belief about the environment.The authors reported that the system achieved a79% success rate in reaching its goals across five runs in the small warehouse environment.
