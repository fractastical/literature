Fig. 3 illustrates the convergence performance of the pro-
posed algorithm where the sum rate values are plotted versus
the number of episodes for different numbers of SUs (M)
multiplexed per sub-channel. When M = 1, the problem
reduces to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). As revealed,
it takes within zero and fifty episodes to converge for all
possiblevaluesofM.Moreover,thesumrateincreaseswithan
increasing number of SUs. The proposed algorithm achieved
a maximum number of 5 SUs multiplexed per sub-channel.
Also, as we increased the number of SUs to 7, the proposed
algorithm shows performance degradation. This is because,
beyondthislimit,thesymbolsofthesuperimposedSUsignals
begin to overlap, making accurate SIC and signal decoding
impossible for the UAV. Thus, the difference between the

is evident, setting the learning rate to 0.01 results in the
fewest episodes required to attain the minimum cumulative
abnormality. Therefore, to achieve faster convergence, we set
the learning rate to 0.01 for all simulation settings.
TocomparetheperformanceoftheproposedActive-GDBN,
we adopt and modify the Q-learning algorithm from [28] and
the successive convex approximation technique from [7]. As
clearly indicated in Fig. 6, the proposed method surpasses
the Q-learning scheme to reach a better and more stable
sum rate in fewer episodes. This is because, in each time
step, the UAV detects abnormalities, implying a mismatch
between the preferred observations and the predictions due
to the performed actions. As a result, the UAV exploits the
errors in each episode to learn how to take better actions
that minimize future abnormalities. Moreover, the proposed
Active-GDBN performs dynamic continuous power allocation
to SUs. Due to the strong influence of negative rewards on
Q-learning, it requires more training episodes to achieve a
significant improvement in the sum rate. The low sum rate
performance of convex approximation is due to its inability
to learn from experience and adapt its strategies to the time-
varying radio environment.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Active Inference for Sum Rate Maximization in UAV-Assisted Cognitive NOMA Networks"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
