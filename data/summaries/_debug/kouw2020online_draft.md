Here's a summary of the paper "Online system identification in a Duffing oscillator by free energy minimisation" based on the provided text, adhering to all the specified constraints:### OverviewThis paper investigates online system identification in a Duffing oscillator by employing free energy minimisation. The core approach leverages variational message passing on a factor graph to infer the dynamical parameters of the system. The research demonstrates that this method performs comparably to a state-of-the-art nonlinear model with offline prediction error minimisation, highlighting the potential of this technique for real-time system identification.### MethodologyThe authors cast the Duffing oscillator’s nonlinear stochastic differential equation into a generative model, utilizing a factor graph to facilitate parameter estimation. Specifically, they discretize the state transition equation using a central difference scheme for the second derivative and a forward difference for the first derivative, resulting in a multivariate first-order autoregressive model. To simplify inference at a later stage, they perform variable substitutions, transforming the equation into a form suitable for variational message passing. They define a set of parameters, including mass (m), damping (c), linear spring stiffness (a), nonlinear spring stiffness (b), process noise precision (τ), and ξ. Crucially, they employ variational message passing, which involves iteratively updating beliefs about the parameters using the free energy functional. The authors use a Gaussian distribution for the variational message passing, and define priors for the parameters. They use a factor graph to represent the generative model, with nodes representing conditional distributions and edges representing variables. The authors use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the nonlinear autoregressive function, and define a small noise injection to stabilise inference.### ResultsThe experimental results, conducted using Silverbox data, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The authors performed two key experiments: a1-step ahead prediction error and a simulation error setting. In the1-step ahead prediction error experiment, the model achieved a mean squared error of5.831e-5, which is comparable to the performance of a state-of-the-art nonlinear model with offline prediction error minimisation. In the simulation error setting, the model achieved a mean squared error of0.926e-3, which is also a competitive result. The authors observed that the model’s performance was largely unaffected by the input signal amplitude, indicating the robustness of the method.### DiscussionThe experimental results seem to justify looking to nature for inspiration. Free energy minimisation, in the form of variational message passing, seems a generally applicable and well-performing inference technique. The difficulties mostly lie in deriving variational messages (i.e. Equations10).Improvementsintheproposedprocedurecouldbemadewitharicherapproximation of the nonlinear autoregressive function (e.g. unscented transform) [20]. Alternatively, a hierarchy of latent Gaussian filters or autoregressive processes could be used to obtain time-varying noise parameters or time-varying coefficients [22,19]. Furthermore, instead of discretising such that an auto-regressive model is obtained, one could express the evolution of the states in generalised coordinates.Lastly,black-boxmodelscouldbeexploredforfurtherperformance improvements.A natural next step is for an active inference agent to determine the control signal regime (i.e. optimal design). Unfortunately, this is not straightforward: the current formulation relies on variational free energy which does not produce an epistemic term in the objective. The epistemic term is needed to encourage exploration; i.e. try sub-optimal inputs to reduce uncertainty. To arrive at an epistemic term, one would need to work with expected free energy [17]. But it is unclear how expected free energy could be incorporated into factor graphs.### ConclusionIhavepresentedafreeenergyminimisationprocedureforonlinesystemidentification.
