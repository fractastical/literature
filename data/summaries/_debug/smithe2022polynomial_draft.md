### OverviewThis summary of “Polynomial Life: the Structure of Adaptive Systems” by Toby St. Clere Smithe presents a novel approach to cybernetics, emphasizing embodiment and statistical inference. The core idea is that adaptive systems can be understood as statistical games operating on polynomial interfaces, providing a formal framework for understanding phenomena such as homeostasis, morphogenesis, and even spatial navigation. The paper introduces a new category of Bayesian lenses, offering a compositional approach to Bayesian inference.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers around the concept of “statistical games” operating on polynomial interfaces. They define a Bayesian lens as a category of statistical games, where the ‘internal universe’ of a system is represented by a polynomial. The lens is defined as a functor from this category to the category of Bayesian lenses. The authors use the concept of “free energy” to define the dynamics of these systems, and they show that free energy minimization leads to the system adopting a stable configuration. The authors also introduce the concept of “open Markov processes” and show that these processes can be used to model complex adaptive systems. The authors use the concept of “compositional Bayesian inference” to model complex adaptive systems.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that their framework can be used to model a number of fundamental biological processes. They show that their framework can be used to model homeostasis, morphogenesis, and spatial navigation.
