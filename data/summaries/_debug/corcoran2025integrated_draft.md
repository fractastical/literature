## Integrated Information and Predictive Processing Theories of Consciousness: An Adversarial Collaborative ReviewThis paper investigates the core tenets of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) as frameworks for understanding consciousness. The authors argue that these theories, while offering distinct approaches, share a common goal: to provide a scientifically rigorous account of subjective experience. IIT, as developed by Tononi and colleagues, posits that consciousness arises from the degree of integrated information generated by a system – the more integrated the information, the greater the level of consciousness. NREP, conversely, proposes that consciousness arises from the construction of internal representations of the external world, with the degree of realism and accuracy of these representations determining the level of consciousness. The authors highlight the potential for adversarial collaboration to advance our understanding of consciousness by rigorously testing the predictions of these theories and identifying points of convergence and divergence.The authors state: "The fundamental challenge in studying consciousness lies in its subjective nature – it is, by definition, an experience that cannot be directly observed or measured by external observers." They note: "Despite this challenge, significant progress has been made in recent years in developing theoretical frameworks that offer a scientifically tractable approach to understanding consciousness." The paper argues that IIT and NREP represent two of the most promising such frameworks.According to the paper, IIT proposes that consciousness is directly proportional to the amount of integrated information (Φ) generated by a system. The authors state: “Integrated information, as defined by IIT, is a measure of the irreducible causal power of a system. It quantifies the degree to which a system’s parts are interdependent and cannot be reduced to their individual components.” They further note: “This implies that any system capable of generating a non-zero amount of integrated information is, by definition, conscious.”The authors argue that NREP offers a complementary perspective, suggesting that consciousness arises from the construction of internal representations of the external world. They state: “NREP posits that consciousness is a product of the brain’s ability to create internal models of the external world that are sufficiently accurate and detailed to support adaptive behavior.” They note: “The degree of realism and accuracy of these internal representations determines the level of consciousness.”The paper provides quantitative data supporting these claims. For example, the authors state that IIT predicts that the level of consciousness is directly proportional to the value of Φ. They provide data from experiments measuring Φ in various systems, demonstrating a positive correlation between Φ and the level of consciousness. They state: “In a study involving primate visual cortex, researchers measured the integrated information generated by the system and found a strong correlation with the animals’ reports of visual experiences.”Furthermore, the authors present data supporting NREP’s claims. They state: “Experiments involving the construction of internal models of the external world have shown that the accuracy of these models is positively correlated with the level of consciousness.” They provide data from experiments involving the construction of internal models of the external world, demonstrating a positive correlation between the accuracy of these models and the level of consciousness. They state: “In a study involving human participants, researchers found that the accuracy of their internal models of the external world was positively correlated with their reports of visual experiences.”The paper highlights the potential for adversarial collaboration to advance our understanding of consciousness by rigorously testing the predictions of these theories and identifying points of convergence and divergence. The authors state: “By systematically testing the predictions of these theories, we can identify the specific mechanisms that give rise to consciousness and develop a more comprehensive understanding of this fundamental aspect of human experience.” They note: “Such a collaborative approach is essential for overcoming the inherent challenges in studying consciousness and for developing a more robust and scientifically grounded theory of consciousness.”The authors argue that the two theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can be integrated to provide a more complete picture of consciousness. They state: “While IIT and NREP offer distinct approaches to understanding consciousness, they share a common goal: to provide a scientifically rigorous account of subjective experience.” They note: “By integrating the insights of these two theories, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of consciousness.”The paper concludes by outlining the next steps in the research program, including the development of new experimental techniques and the development of new theoretical frameworks. The authors state: “Future research should focus on developing new experimental techniques that can directly measure integrated information and internal representations of the external world. It should also focus on developing new theoretical frameworks that can integrate the insights of IIT and NREP.” They note: “Only through such a collaborative effort can we hope to fully understand the nature of consciousness.”
