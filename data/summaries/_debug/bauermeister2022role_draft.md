### OverviewThis paper investigates the role of valence and meta-awareness in mirror self-recognition using a hierarchical active inference model. The authors propose a computational approach to study self-recognition, incorporating affective components and evaluating it on a synthetic experiment inspired by the classic mirror self-recognition test. The study aims to understand how the agent learns about itself and how this learning is influenced by its internal state.### MethodologyThe authors developed a two-layered generative model to capture the self-recognition experiment. The first layer represents the agent's perception and action, while the second layer models the agent's internal state, specifically valence. The model utilizes discrete state-space formulation of active inference, allowing the agent to infer its own hidden states and make decisions based on its internal state. The agent receives exteroceptive observations (e.g., seeing its own reflection) and interoceptive observations (e.g., sensing its own emotional state). The model incorporates a key element: the agent can attend to its own internal state, modulating its confidence in its perception. The experiment is designed to test whether the agent’s behavior changes depending on whether it is aware of its own internal state. The authors used a synthetic experiment to test the model.### ResultsThe experiments demonstrated that negative valence arises when the agent recognizes itself and learns something unexpected about its internal states. Specifically, the agent avoids the mirror altogether in anticipation of an undesired learning process. The results show that the agent’s behavior is influenced by its internal state, and that negative valence plays a crucial role in self-recognition. The agent’s confidence in its model estimates is modulated by the valence, and the agent’s ability to adapt to a changing environment is enhanced by its meta-awareness.
