### OverviewThis paper investigates the solution of max-entropy and free energy principles using belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. The authors present a framework for applying GBP to finite free sheaves, demonstrating its utility in solving complex statistical problems. The core of the work lies in the correspondence theorem initially conjectured by Yedidia et al., which provides a pathway for connecting local observables and measures within the GBP framework. The paper highlights the importance of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations and their role in stabilizing the dynamics of the GBP algorithm.### MethodologyThe authors employ a cluster variational method (CVM) to estimate the global free energy F(β) by searching for critical points of the variational free energy. These critical points are found by generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms, according to the correspondence theorem. The algorithm operates on a finite free sheaf E, defined for every region a⊆Ω by E = (cid:81) E a i∈a i, whose size grows exponentially withΩ. The global energy function H : E → R is assumed given as a sum H(x) = (cid:80) h (x ) of local short-range interactions a⊆Ω a |ah :E →R,indexedbyboundedsubregions. The authors emphasize the role of continuous-time diffusion equations in regularizing GBP, and the importance of homology classes [h] = h+δC in the complex of local observables. They also highlight the dual functor RE∗ : P(Ω)op → Vect of vector spaces, whose arrows consist of partial integrations πa→b :REa∗ →REb∗, also called marginal projections. The differential operator d:C (K,RE)∗ →C (K,RE)∗ acts by: (cid:88) (cid:88)dp (x )=p (x )− p (x ) (3)b b a→b b b b a aConsistent densities satisfying dp =0 are hence characterised by cohomology classes [p] ∈ Ker(d) in C (K,RE)∗. The Bethe-Kikuchi coefficients c = µ, or equivalently by the inclusion-exclusion principles, are defined as c =1 for all b∈K.### ResultsThe paper demonstrates that stationary states of GBP algorithms solve a collection of equivalent variational principles on local Bethe-Kikuchi functionals, which approximate the free energy F(β), the Shannon entropy S(U), and the variational free energy F(β)=U −β−1S(U) respectively. The authors show that the local form of Legendre duality yields a potentially degenerate relationship between the constraints U and β, exhibiting singularities on loopy hypergraphs where GBP converges to multiple equilibria. Specifically, the authors state: "The authors state: "The convergence of GBP to multiple equilibria is a consequence of the singularities on loopy hypergraphs."The authors further show that the Bethe-Kikuchi coefficients are defined as c = µ, or equivalently by the inclusion-exclusion principles, are defined as c =1 for all b∈K.
