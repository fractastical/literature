**Goal-Directed Planning for Habituated Agents by Active Inference Using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network**This research investigates goal-directed planning for habituated agents by utilizing active inference, a method based on variational recurrent neural networks. The study aims to address the problem of generating effective goal-directed plans based on learning from limited amounts of data. The proposed approach employs a variational recurrent neural network (PV-RNN) to achieve this. The PV-RNN is designed to learn and implement a hierarchical framework for goal-directed planning, incorporating elements of autonomy and adaptive control.
