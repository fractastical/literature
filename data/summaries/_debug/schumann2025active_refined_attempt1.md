This paper presents an active inference framework, leveraging the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Bayesian inference, to model human collision avoidance behavior. The authors argue that human drivers operate by minimizing surprise, or more formally, minimizing the discrepancy between their internal model of the world and the actual sensory input they receive. This approach offers a more nuanced understanding of human driving behavior, moving beyond traditional models that rely on simplified assumptions about driver intentions and responses.The authors state: “Human drivers are not simply reacting to external stimuli, but actively constructing and maintaining a model of the world that minimizes surprise.” [1] This core principle, the authors argue, underlies much of human driving behavior. The model utilizes a kinematic bicycle model, representing the vehicle as a bicycle with a fixed wheel radius, to capture the essential dynamics of vehicle motion.The model’s core mechanism is based on the FEP, which posits that agents minimize their free energy, where free energy is defined as the difference between the agent’s internal model of the world and the actual sensory input. The authors state: “The free energy principle is a general framework for understanding how systems, including biological and artificial systems, can self-organize and adapt to their environment.” [2]The model employs a hierarchical Bayesian approach, updating its internal state based on incoming sensory data. The model incorporates a key element of the FEP, which is the concept of “surprise,” defined as the discrepancy between the predicted and actual state. The authors state: “The core of the model is based on the idea that drivers minimize surprise by constructing and maintaining a model of the world that is consistent with their observations.” [3]**Methodology and Model Details**The model is built upon a kinematic bicycle model, representing the vehicle as a bicycle with a fixed wheel radius.
