Okay, let's proceed with generating the summary of the paper based on the instructions and the provided text.**Neural and phenotypic representation under the free-energy principle**This paper investigates the mechanisms underlying neural and phenotypic representation, specifically within the context of the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory. It proposes that the brain’s ability to represent the world stems from a hierarchical process of inference, where simpler elements combine to form more complex representations. The core argument is that the brain’s capacity to represent the world is based on the principles of the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory.The paper’s key findings highlight that neural populations can coordinate to create representations of the environment. Specifically, the authors state that neural populations can combine to form representations of the environment.
