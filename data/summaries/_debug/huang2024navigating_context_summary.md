Navigating Uncertainties with Probabilistic Diffusion-
Based Motion Prediction and Active Inference
Yufei Huang, Yulin Li, Andrea Matta and Mohsen Jafari
Abstract— This paper presents a novel approach to improving decision-making under uncertainty through predictive
autonomous vehicle control in environments lacking clear road reasoning [3].
markings by integrating a diffusion-based motion predictor within Uncertainties, such as missing roadway markings and mixed
