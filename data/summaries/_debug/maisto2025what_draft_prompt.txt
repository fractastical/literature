Abstract
Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and
human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties—such as joint agency or
knowledge—thattranscendthoseoftheirindividualcomponentsremainsanopenquestion. Here,
we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system
ofinteractingagentscangiverisetojointagencyandcollectiveknowledge. Wemodelflockingdy-
namics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling
reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define
higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a “flock” that can be treated as
an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to exter-
nal perturbations (a “predator”), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual
agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic
information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator’s location that is not
accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these
results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels
of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit)
collective knowledge and joint agency.

1 Introduction
The anchor of all my dreams is the collective wisdom of mankind as a whole. – Nelson
Mandela
The fundamental unit of analysis in biology and cognition is often the agent—an entity, such as a
person,animal,orevenasingleneuronorcell,thatpossessesawell-definedboundaryandsomedegree
ofagency,thatis,autonomyinperceivingandinteractingwithanenvironment. However,manyofthe
most intriguing phenomena in biological and cognitive systems emerge not from isolated agents but
fromthecollectivedynamicsofmultipleinteractingones. Examplesincludethecoordinatedbehaviors
and self-organization of cells composing a body morphology [49, 23, 67, 52, 54]neural population
dynamics underlying brain function [18, 26, 21, 13, 38], the collective behaviors animals [42, 47, 80],
distributed models of mind [57, 41], and even human societies viewed as collective agents [74]. Such
collective intelligence phenomena occur across multiple scales of biological and cognitive organization
[56].
Theseexamplessuggestthattheconceptofagencycanbegeneralizedbeyondsingleindividualsor

were one agent. If agency is defined as the capacity to sense, infer, and act purposefully, then joint
agency (also called shared or collective agency) arises when perception, cognition, and action extend
beyond a single entity—emerging instead from the coordinated dynamics of multiple decision-making
units.

Notions of joint agency appear at many levels of organization and cognitive sophistication. At the
level of human social behavior, classical theories of social cognition emphasize both social interaction
and collective behavior: while individuals act autonomously, they also participate in shared social
structures. Theories of mentalizing highlight that agents form beliefs about, and models of, other
agents’ minds [25]. Complementary accounts emphasize shared and aligned representations, in which
multiple agents maintain overlapping internal models of their environment [66]. In these frameworks,
jointagencycorrespondstophenomenasuchassharedrepresentations[75,76],collectiveintentionsand
goals[5,6,82],jointcommitments[31],commonground[10],jointpayoffsandteamreasoning[79],and
“we-representations” of action and intention [28]. Empirical work in cognitive neuroscience supports
these views, identifying mechanisms such as neural coupling [36, 35, 55, 44], mirroring [27, 71] and
sensorimotor communication [64] as enabling the fine-grained spatiotemporal coordination required
for joint action. Subjectively, such coordination can give rise to a shared sense of agency—the feeling
that outcomes were caused together [59].
Computationalmodelshavebeguntoformalizethesesocialdynamicsintermsofinteractingagents
that communicate, coordinate, and collaborate toward shared objectives. These frameworks typically
assume internal (generative) models that encode distinctions between self and others—“my,” “your,”
and “our” actions and intentions [84, 45]. More recent approaches, however, explore interactive dy-
namics in which multiple agents maintain and update a shared world model to minimize prediction
errorstowardacommongoal[19,53,24]. Relatedconceptsincludethenotionofagent-neutral models,
or internal models that predict the collective consequences of joint actions regardless of who executed
them[65,66],andsharedbeliefs suchas“publicbeliefs”[16]orthe“imaginedwe”[81],wherecollective
cognitive dimensions (e.g., beliefs, plans, agency)—shared across multiple individuals—supersede and
drive individual cognitive states.
Here we are concerned with a more primitive notion of joint agency that arises at lower levels of
organization: atthelevelofcollectivebehaviorandself-organizationamongsimple,particle-likeagents
that lack advanced cognitive abilities and rich internal models incorporating notions like “our beliefs”
or “our plans”. This primitive form of joint agency emerges from the simple fact that teams of agents
can infer their own states and actions based on those of other, surrounding agents to which they are
informationally coupled—and they are capable of making collective decisions [12, 78]. There is a long
tradition of studying the self-organization of collectives, such as active particles, animal swarms, and
robot ensembles, using methods from statistical physics and information theory [14, 4, 7, 2, 32, 1].
Complementary approaches have also been developed to quantify causal emergence and the extent to
whichhigher-levelcollectivedynamicsexhibitcausalpowerbeyondthatoftheirindividualcomponents
[40, 72].
An emerging trend is the study of collective phenomena and multi-agent systems within the active
inference framework [61, 19, 53, 37, 48, 3, 73]. Active inference was initially developed to address the
cognitiveandneuralprocessesassociatedwithisolatedbiologicalorganismsandtheiraction-perception
cycle. The general idea was that a single imperative or objective function — the minimization of
variational free energy — suffices to explain both perception and action and their associated neural
dynamics in biological organisms.
Recentdevelopmentshaveextendedactiveinferenceprinciplestothecollectivedynamicsofmultiple
agents, simpler (e.g., active particles) or more complex. The main difference between active inference
andtypicalstatisticalapproachesusedtostudycollectivephenomenaisthateachcomponentisafull-
fledgedagent,withitsaction-perceptioncycleandminimizingitsfreeenergybasedonlocalsignalsfrom
theenvironmentand/orotheragents. Forinstance,inanetworkofagentsplayingtheroleof“neurons,”

on the activity of surrounding neurons. The ensemble of neurons can thereby exhibit synchronous
dynamicsandbecomecollectivelyresponsivetoperceptualstimuliandrewardcontingencies[60,29,30].
Similarly,inacollectionofcellsengagedinmorphogenesisandpatternformation,eachcellcaninferits

activeinferenceagentminimizingitsownfreeenergy,yetitscollectivedynamicsleadtotheemergence
of a coherent body morphology that is resilient—for example, capable of reconstructing itself after
perturbation.
When endowed with joint agency, active inference agents do not lose their individual autonomy:
each continues to infer and minimize its own free energy. However, their collective agency at the
2
system level supersedes individual agency to some extent, as the fate of each agent becomes jointly
determined by the states and signals of others [37]. This formulation allows studying agency at two
(or more) nested levels: the level of the single agent and the agent collective (and of a collective
composedofcollectives, andsoon). Theformulationalsoallowsstudyinghowcollectiveprocessescan
go awry, for example, when a single agent becomes insensitive to signals from other agents and hence

Thisraisesanimportantquestion: canacollectivesystem,evenintheabsenceofexplicitcognitive

thatofitsindividualcomponents? Inotherwords, cantheensembleasawholeinstantiateacollective

To address these questions, we present and analyze a simple self-organizing multi-agent simulation
inspiredbyflockingdynamics,inwhicheach“bird”ismodeledasanactiveinferenceagentminimizing
its own variational free energy. In this framework, each bird updates its beliefs about hidden states
(e.g., its heading direction) based on local observations and acts to minimize prediction error, leading
to emergent coordination as birds gradually align their trajectories over time.
We first illustrate how a formal notion of both individual agency (of the birds) and joint agency
(of the flock) can be derived within this setting, using the concept of a Markov blanket to delineate
the statistical boundaries between agents, their interactions, and the environment. We then present
simulations in which a “predator” is introduced to perturb and destabilize the flock, allowing us to
examine two distinct phases: one in which the flock exhibits joint agency, and another in which it
does not. This minimal model allows us to visualize the transition from individual to joint agency
(in the absence of perturbations) and its dissolution under external disruption (when the predator
attacks). Ittherebydemonstrateshowbirdscandynamicallymergeinto,orseparatefrom,acollective
agent—a flock—through changing patterns of coupling and inference. Finally, we employ synergistic
information—a quantitative measure of how information is distributed and integrated across multiple
components—to assess the extent to which the collective flock possesses implicit “knowledge about”
the predator’s position that exceeds the information explicitly represented in the internal models of
individual birds. This approach enables us to characterize the emergence of system-level inference
and coordination, offering a formal bridge between information-theoretic and dynamical notions of
collective and joint agency.

To assess whether this alignment can be formalized as a transition toward joint agency—namely,
from individual birds to a flock—we turn to the notion of (nested) Markov blankets [46, 62, 22]. A
Markov blanket defines a statistical boundary around an agent, delineating the interface between its
internal states and the external environment—and thereby its domain of perception and action [63]
(Figure 1B). It is based on the notion of statistical independence: internal and external states are
conditionally independent given a set of blanket states, typically partitioned into sensory and active
states. Sensory states mediate the flow of information from the environment to the internal states
(observations), while active states mediate the influence of internal dynamics on the environment
(actions). This statistical separation enables an agent to maintain its identity and autonomy by
inferring hidden causes in the environment from its sensory inputs, and by acting to minimize the
discrepancy between predicted and observed states.
Crucially, the Markov blanket formalism allows for hierarchical nesting of agents and collectives.
When multiple agents become sufficiently coupled through reciprocal sensory and active exchanges,
their collective dynamics can give rise to a higher-level Markov blanket encompassing the group as a
whole(Figure1C).Inthisconfiguration, someoftheindividualagents’statesfunctionastheinternal,
sensory, and active components of a superordinate blanket, thereby defining a new, emergent agent.
Thus, while each agent retains its individual agency, the group simultaneously acquires a higher-
level, joint agency. Such nesting provides a principled, statistical account of how joint agency can
arisenaturallyfromtheinteractionsofindividualagents: asinformationalboundariesreorganize, new
levels of autonomy and coordinated inference emerge [20, 37].
Figure1DshowstheMarkovblanketaroundacollectiveofbirds—whichwehenceforthcallaflock—

the remaining birds (cyan) constitute external states outside the Markov blanket. This visualization
demonstratesthat,duringthesimulation,astatisticalseparationemergesbetweenbirdsthatarepartof

Oursimulationsfurtherdemonstratethattheflockpreservescertainmacroscopiccharacteristics—such
as its overall direction and approximate shape—even as its precise boundaries fluctuate over time.
Summing up, we have shown that the notion of Markov blanket provides a principled way to
formalize the emergence of a collective agent (the flock) above and beyond the individual agents (the
birds). The flock can thus be ascribed a form of (joint) agency, grounded in the statistical separation
(or autonomy) of its internal states from external states, and in the mediating roles of sensory and
activestatesthatcouplethetwo. Atthesametime,thejointagencyoftheflockdoesnotdiminishthe
individual agency of its constituent birds, which continue to infer and minimize their own free energy
autonomously. These two levels of autonomy, therefore, coexist and are hierarchically nested within
one another.
3 Sensing and escaping predators in the flock
Havingdefinedthenotionofjointagencyinaflock,wenowassesstowhatextenttheflockcan“sense”
and “react to” external perturbations. To this end, we extend the flocking simulation by introducing
a “predator” that appears at two distinct random positions at time steps 5 and 35, and disappears at
the following time step. The predator destabilizes the flock: all birds that sense the predator enter
a “stress” state that compels them to escape by moving in random directions. Furthermore, this
stressstatepropagatestoneighboringbirds,causingthemalsotomoverandomlyandtriggeringafast
cascade that destabilizes the entire flock.
This simulation allows us to compare the effects of the predator at two stages: an early stage (step
5), before the birds have self-organized into a large flock, and a later stage (step 35), when a large,
cohesive flock has already formed.
Figure 2 shows the results of 500 simulations, each lasting 60 time steps, in which the predator
appears at random positions. We excluded from the analysis and the plots 32 simulations where the

Figure2Bshowstheenergyofthesystem,definedasinthevectorPottsmodelwithfourstatesand
Moore neighborhood [85], which characterizes the average degree of alignment among the birds (and
thusapproximatesthesizeorcoherenceoftheflock). Whenthepredatorappearsatanearlystage(red
dotted line), the energy continues to increase briefly before decreasing, indicating that disorganization
occurs with some delay. In contrast, when the predator appears later (blue dotted line), the energy is
initially much higher due to the presence of an already well-formed flock; here, the decrease in energy
occurs more rapidly, reflecting a faster predator-induced destabilization.
Figure 2C shows the dynamics of the “stress” state across birds, which—as expected—increase
sharply when the predator appears and then gradually decline. This pattern is expected, since the
stress propagation is designed to be independent of the agents’ current states.
Summing up, this simulation illustrates that predator-induced destabilization occurs faster the
second time the predator appears, when a larger flock is present. This occurs despite the propagation
mechanism of the “stress” state being identical in both cases (Figure 2C). The faster response of
the flock may indicate more efficient information propagation within the collective, a hypothesis we
investigate in the next analysis.
4 Synergistic information about predator location in the flock
In this analysis, we turn to our central question: can we identify a notion of collective knowledge in
the flock that extends beyond that of its individual agents?
Specifically, we assess whether the flock as a whole carries information about the predator’s loca-
tion that individual birds do not possess—and whether this information is greater during the second
6
appearance of the predator (at time step 35, when a larger flock is present) than during the first (at
time step 5, when the birds are still close to a random configuration).
Toquantifythis,weemploypartial information decomposition (PID)[83],aninformation-theoretic
framework that measures how two source variables (e.g., a pair of birds) together provide information
about a target variable (e.g., the location of the predator). Crucially, PID decomposes total mutual
information into three components: the unique information provided by each source individually, the
redundant information shared between them, and the synergistic information that emerges only when
both sources are considered jointly. Synergistic information has been proposed as a foundation for
formalizing emergence, capturing higher-level informational structure beyond the sum of individual
contributions [72].
We compute all four PID atoms across all pairs of birds (source variables) and for each of the
two predator locations (target variable), over all 60 time steps and 1000 simulation runs. In each
simulation, the predator appears at two distinct random positions. To reduce the dimensionality of
thetargetvariableandmitigateestimationbias,wecoarse-grainedthepredator’s10×10gridlocation
to a 2×2 grid. This results in four large, dynamically equivalent quadrants, which remain uniformly
sampledbythepredator. Thiscoarse-grainingensuresthatanydetectedinformationaboutthetarget’s
location must be dynamically encoded by the agents, rather than stemming from static, pre-existing
properties of the environment (e.g., center-vs-edge effects).
Figure 3 summarizes these results. The core concepts of PID, including unique information, re-
dundancy, andsynergy, areconceptuallyillustratedinFigure3A.Figure3Bsummarizesthetemporal
dynamicsofallfourPIDatoms, averagedacrossallbirdpairs. Notably, theuniqueinformationatoms
(top panels) and the redundancy atom (bottom left panel) remain comparable to zero, falling within
the gray band of the null distribution at all time steps. In sharp contrast, the synergy atom (bottom
right panel) is the only variable that shows significant values. Specifically, we observe a significant
peak in synergistic information for the second predator appearance (blue curve). In contrast, the
synergy related to the first predator (red curve) shows a similar temporal shape (a peak, decline, and
rebound), but it falls within the null distribution band and is therefore not statistically significant.
The significant synergy (blue curve) peaks shortly after the predator’s appearance and then declines,
with a smaller rebound thereafter.
The impact of spatial separation (measured using Chebyshev distance) on the synergy is further
detailed in Figure 3C. For pairs in close proximity (Distance = 1, left panel), significant synergy is
detected for both the first (red curve) and second (blue curve) predator appearances. As the distance
increases (Distance=3 and Distance=5, middle panels), the synergy for the first predator becomes
non-significant,whilethesynergyforthesecondpredatorremainsrobustlyabovethenulldistribution.
At the longest distance shown (Distance = 7, right panel), synergy becomes non-significant for both
events. In all cases, the synergy is higher for the second predator than for the first.
Summing up, this analysis reveals that the flock exhibits synergistic information about the preda-
tor’s location, and that this information is stronger and more spatially distributed during the second
predator event, when a larger flock is present. This finding illustrates a form of collective knowledge
that extends beyond the information available to individual birds, and may help explain the faster
collective response observed during the second predator encounter. It also points toward a notion of
causal emergence, supported by the presence of synergistic information [72].
5 Discussion
Many of the most fascinating phenomena in biology arise from the self-organization and coordinated
behavior of simple agents—cells, neurons, animals, humans, and beyond. Such collective dynamics
have been studied across multiple scales, from high-level cognitive constructs such as shared goals and
plans, tolow-levelcollectivephenomenamediatedbyreciprocalinteractionsamongsimpleagentsthat
lack explicit representations of “you,” “we,” or other higher-level cognitive concepts.
Inthiswork,wehaveexploredthenotionofjointagency inaminimalsetting: apopulationofactive
inference agents (birds), each minimizing its own free energy while remaining informationally coupled
with others. Through simulations of collective self-organization in flocking behavior, we examined
three interconnected questions.
In the first analysis, we used the concept of (nested) Markov blankets to formalize how agency
can extend beyond individual active inference agents to groups of agents—that is, from birds to

flocks. We showed that during flocking, the Markov blanket, which formalizes a statistical boundary
around an agent, can expand to enclose a set of birds forming a collective unit. Within the flock,
subsets of birds play the roles of internal, sensory, and active states of a collective Markov blanket,
while others constitute external states. This analysis extends prior work on collective, multi-agent
systems—including groups of neurons [60], collections of primordial cells [20], and developing tissues
[23]—by showing that the notion of the Markov blanket can account for situations in which each
agent retains its individual autonomy, while the collective simultaneously acquires a higher-level, joint
agency. From this perspective, agency is not a fixed attribute of individual systems but an emergent
property of coupled dynamics that maintain conditional independence from their surroundings. As
interactionsamongagentsstrengthen,theboundariesthatdefine“self”canexpandorcontract,giving
rise to transient or stable forms of joint agency. This provides a unified statistical and dynamical
framework for understanding how perception, action, and decision-making scale from individuals to
collectives—fromneuronsformingneuralassembliestoorganismsformingsocialorecologicalsystems.
In the second and third analyses, we asked whether being endowed with joint agency—that is,
forming a flock—confers additional capabilities or knowledge compared to individual agents. To this
end, we introduced a “predator” that appeared at random positions during both early stages of self-
organization(whennoflockoronlyasmallflockwaspresent)andlaterstages(whenalargeflockhad
formed). The predator destabilized the system by triggering a “stress” state that caused nearby birds
to reorient randomly, propagating disruption through the flock.
The simulations revealed that larger flocks reacted more rapidly to the predator, as indicated by a
faster onset of destabilization during later stages, even though the rules governing the propagation of
“stress” did not depend on the level of organization.
Most importantly, our results show that the flock as a whole possesses synergistic information
about the predator’s location, and that this information increases with flock size and extends farther
fromthepredator. Thissuggestsaformallygrounded—albeitimplicit—notionofcollectiveknowledge
(or shared world model) that goes beyond the information available to individual birds.
Summing up, our simulations illustrate a simple yet general method to characterize a collective
agent, such as a flock, as an entity that maintains statistical separation from its environment through
a Markov blanket, and exhibits knowledge beyond its components through synergistic information.
Morebroadly, theseresultsillustratehowcollectiveentitiescanextendthespatialandtemporalreach
of perception, cognition, and action—or their cognitive light cone [49]—beyond the boundaries of any
single agent.
There is, however, a conceptual distinction between the implicit form of collective knowledge re-
vealed by synergistic information and the explicit forms typically studied in cognitive science. In
cognitive and social sciences, collective knowledge is often assumed to rely on explicit internal models
of others’ mental states or shared epistemic representations (e.g., “common ground” or “what we all
know that we know”). Similarly, our simulations demonstrate collective sensing and action that do
not depend on such explicit representations but instead arise from simple interaction rules. In human
societies, collective action is often defined by intentionality—individuals act with the goal of produc-
ing collective outcomes. By contrast, in simpler biological systems, such as morphogenesis or pattern
formation, intentionality can be replaced by teleological organization: systems are structured in such
a way to produce collective outcomes even without explicit goals.

systems we described do not have a model of their collective behavior; rather, they collectively are
or become a model of social action through their pattern of couplings. More complex agents, by

A.1 Active inference framework
In this work, we consider birds as Bayesian agents with sensory, active, and internal states that are
updated according to the Active Inference principles [61]. Active inference (AIF) is a theoretical
framework that provides a unified account of perception, action, and learning of both living and
artificial systems. It posits that an agent’s behavior can be understood as the process of maximizing
the evidence for the implicit statistical model of the world it embodies, in response to the sensory
information flow, by selecting adaptive sequences of actions.
Thisprocessisformallygroundedinthefree-energyprinciple, accordingtowhich, givenaphysical
phenomenon named generative process, minimizing a quantity known as variational free-energy corre-
sponds to optimizing the upper bound on the measure of how much the generative model used by the
agent to describe the phenomenon diverges from the generative process in its predictions.
FollowingtheAIFframework,wedesignedagenerativemodeldescribingasinglebirdthat,through
local interactions, determines the emergence of flocking behaviors.
We adopted a hybrid modeling approach. We borrowed the Potts model [85], a statistical physics
model describing spin glasses in which spins are arranged on a lattice, a periodic graph, and combined
it with the computational model developed by Reynolds to mimic collective behaviors in computer
vision applications [70].
The Potts model is a generalization of the Ising model [43] for q >2 components. It has been used
to address numerous problems in collective behavior, which are often described as instances of lattice
statistics. Indeed, replacing continuous symmetry with discrete symmetry allows for a simpler, more
tractable understanding of the flocking transition. Recently, Solon and Tailleur argued that flocking
can be described as a transition from a disordered phase to a polar-ordered phase in an active Ising
model, in which spins both diffuse and align on the lattice, a coarse-grained representation of the
space[77]. [8]studiedasquarelatticeinwhichactiveparticleshavefourinternalstatescorresponding
to the four directions of motion. A local alignment rule inspired by the ferromagnetic 4-state Potts
model, combined with self-propulsion via biased diffusion based on the internal particle states, leads
to flocking at high densities and low noise.
In contrast, Reynolds introduced a set of prescriptions to force group coordination among multiple
agents to simulate herds and swarms. Essentially, Reynolds’ rules require each agent to:
1. Attempt to stay close to nearby agent (flock centering);
2. Avoid collisions with nearby agent (collision avoidance);
3. Attempt to match velocity with a nearby agent (velocity matching).
These three rules have a heuristic nature and were conceived to respectively promote cohesion, sepa-
ration, and alignment of agents known as boids – a compound noun with “bird” and the suffix “oids”
(this latter meaning “having the likeness of”) – used to simulate real-life swarms or herds by auto-
mated processes. Throughout this section, we will see how these rules are embedded in each agent’s
generative model and how they influence its internal state, along with observations of neighboring
agents’ states.
A.2 Generative model for flocking
√
Let us consider an ensemble of N birds deployed on a two-dimensional lattice of side L = N with
coordination number M =8, representing next-nearest-neighbor interactions.
Each bird is in one of q discrete internal states corresponding to a movement in one of the q lattice
directions;justonebirdcanoccupyeachsitei. Inthesinglebird’sgenerativemodeloccupyingthesite
i, the hidden state z encodes its propensity to get one of q =4 discrete internal states corresponding
i
to cardinal directions. Each bird is active in the sense that it can flip its internal state and move to a
different site. Then, its own control states u is an integer in [0,q−1].
i
10
The observations σ˜ for each single bird consist of the collection of spin states σ (with j ∈M and
i j
j ̸= i) of its M neighboring agents. In our setup, each bird acts as both the process that generates
observationsforotherbirdsandthegenerativemodelthatinfersthecauseofthoseobservations. Note
that the action of one bird constitutes the observed outcomes for another (at the subsequent time
step). Therefore, a bird is in a state with a probability corresponding to its beliefs about the average
state of its neighborhood at the previous time step.
We can give the expression of the full predictive generative model of a single bird at time t meant
as a joint distribution P(σ˜ ,z ,u ) over the neighborhood observations σ˜ , the current hidden state
t t t t
z and the related control state u . One can factorize this distribution to have a form constituted of
t t
tractable expressions:
P(σ˜ ,z ,u )=P(σ˜ |z )P(z |u )P(u ) (1)
t t t t t t t t
that includes:
• A likelihood P(σ˜ |zi) encoding neighborly relations. Using the three Reynolds’ rules to define
t t
likelihood establishes how the agents interact. The whole likelihood can be expressed as the
product of the single observations σj received by a single bird in the site i with internal state zi;
hence, the likelihood can be factorized as P(σ˜|zi)= (cid:81)MP(σj|zi) , where:

A.3 A generative model variant for escaping from predator attacks
Flocksescapepredatorsthroughacombinationofindividualbirdsandcollectivebehaviorsthatenable
faster reactions and collective escape maneuvers.
Individual vigilance, dilution and detection [17], the ”fountain effect” [33], and confusion [58] are
some of the escape strategies that rely on the benefits of being in a flock, where the probability of
survival of any one individual increases when its behavior is configurable within a group response.
The choice of escape strategy depends on multiple factors [39], such as the predator’s approach—
the closer the predator gets, the more likely the flock is to initiate an escape response—, the reaction
time variation—the distance between predators and individuals influences their reaction time—, and
the flock size, connected to predation risk of any individuals as highlithed also by the selfish herd
theory [34].
Simulating a collective escape strategy entails extending the original flocking model: each bird
mustbeabletorecognizedangerandmodifybehaviorinsafetysituations. Tothisend,weintroducea
secondfactor,named“stressstate”,inthehiddenstatethatencodesthepresenceofdanger. Therefore,
the hidden state of the extended model becomes zi = zi1⊗zi2, where zi1 coincides with the hidden
state of the original model, and zi2 is a binary variable that indicates being (zi2 =1) or not (zi2 =0)
in danger.
12
Analogously,weaccountfortheobservationofstressresponsesbyadding,foreachσj1,correspond-
ing to the states of j-th neighbor individual, another factor encoding its stress outcome σj2, so that
σ˜ =σ˜1⊗σ˜2, ultimately.
At this point, we need to characterize birds’ behavior in dangerous situations. We decided to
implement the confusion strategy as an escape strategy. In practice, birds in the flock respond to a
predator’sattackbyfleeingatrandom. Todothis,weneedtomodifythelikelihoodmatrixP(σ˜|zi1,zi2)
byextendingittotheconditionalprobabilitiesoftheobservationsσ˜ giventhehiddenstatezi2. When
zi2 =0,theextendedlikelihoodmatrixisstilldefinedasEquation(2),withσj ≡σj1,whilethethreat-
related component σj2 is uninformative (all the elements have the same value and every column sums
to one). In contrast, when zi2 =1, the component P(σj1|zi1,1) of the likelihood is uninformative; in
contrast, the expression of P(σj2|zi1,1) is analogous to that in Equation (2), taking care to replace
the function R(i,j) introduced in Equation (3) with the function R¯(i,j) that satisfies the following
conditions:
(cid:26)
c , |η −ζ |=π∧θ =η
R¯(i,j)= p i j ij i (7)
−R(i,j), o/w
.
Inaway, zi2 isacontextvariablethatshapestheperceptionofthestatesofneighboringbirdsand
affects the choice of action. Actually, in the latter case, the influence is mutual. Indeed, similarly to
the case without predators with zi ≡zi1 (see Equation (4)), there exists a transition probability that
t t
probabilistically attributes a value to the stress state to zi1, every time an action u is executed.

threat, leads to a state of no danger present before the attack. Specifically, suppose to denote as t¯the
time at which a generic bird has a predator (or a “stressed” bird) in its neighborhood. In that case,
we hypothesize that its hidden state zi2 transitions from 0 to 1, then decays to 0 with a mean lifetime

A.4 Spectral Identification of Markov Blankets via Fiedler Vector Analysis
We adopted a spectral approach to detect Markov blankets that characterize groups of birds flying in
the same direction, forming a macro-agent.
By fixing a time window T , we can represent the whole flock as an undirected graph F =(V,E),
w
where the nodes are the birds and the edges denote the fact that two birds fly in the same direction,
at least once in T . We can assume that A is the weighted adjacency matrix of that graph, where A
w ij
is the number of times the nodes i and j are connected (have equal direction).
The Markov blanket of a subset of nodes S ⊂ V is defined as the minimal set M (S) such that S
b
is conditionally independent of V \(S∪M (S)) given M (S).
b b
Forcommunitydetectionapplications,weconsidertheMarkovblanketseparatingtwocommunities
C and C as the subset of boundary nodes that minimizes information flow between the communities
1 2
while maintaining graph connectivity. To find these boundary nodes, we determine the algebraic con-
nectivity (also known as Fiedler eigenvalue) of the graph by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue
13
(cid:80)

j ij
Fiedler vector y [15] is the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue λ of L, such
2 2
that Ly =λ y .
2 2 2
TheFiedlervectorprovidesanaturalembeddingofnodesalongtheprincipalaxisofspectralsepa-
ration. Nodes are projected onto a one-dimensional space where their positions reflect their structural
roles: nodes with |y (i)| ≈ 1 represent core members of the communities; nodes with |y (i)| ≈ 0
2 2
constitute the Markov blanket between communities. We identify Markov blanket nodes through
thresholding:
M ={i∈V :|y (i)|≤α} (9)
b 2
where the threshold α is determined adaptively based on the distribution of y values, typically set
2
to capture nodes within the 10th-20th percentile of absolute Fiedler values. The quality of a node is
determined by its degree of connection to the communities. For instance, taking as a reference the
community C , a node i is internal if y (i)>α, external if y (i)<−α, and either active or sensory if,
1 2 2
respectively, its connection degree is higher with C or C .

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
