### OverviewThis paper investigates Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL) for efficient robotic manipulation skill acquisition. The authors propose a novel method that integrates active inference with reinforcement learning, utilizing a vision-based tactile sensor to enhance the perception of the manipulation task. The core idea is to minimize free energy during action, thereby achieving a more precise understanding of the environment and enabling agents to learn skills with minimal sampling and to adapt to sparse rewards. The research demonstrates significant improvements in training efficiency compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods, particularly in non-prehensile object pushing tasks.### MethodologyThe authors introduce Tactile-AIRL, a method that combines active inference with reinforcement learning. The key components of the method are:1) evaluating the future states,2) evaluating F(cid:101)π, and3) learning the policy. The authors utilize a vision-based tactile sensor, such as the GelSight, to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. The sensor digitizes contact signals, offering a rich source of information. The state vector observation, denoted as o p , in the simulation includes two parts: the position, velocity, posture, and angular velocity of the manipulator and the object to be manipulated. Moreover, since the object posture remains symmetrical during ball pushing, there is no need to consider it in this scenario. So the action a involves three degrees of freedom for incremental motion: moving forward, left/right, and rotation. The tactile features, denoted as o t , in the simulation include the centroid and summation, which provide a comprehensive description of the pushing object. The authors employ the Lucas-Kanade method to calculate the optical flow field.
