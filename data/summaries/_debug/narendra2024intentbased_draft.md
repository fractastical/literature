INTENT-DRIVENPROGRAMMABLE NETWORKSThe key aspect of a programmable network is that controlof the network is separated from operation. This lends itselfto making the network programmable via intents. An intent,as defined by the TeleManagement Forum (TMForum) [18],“is the formal specification of all expectations includingrequirements, goals, and constraints given to a technicalsystem”.From a user’s perspective, it expresses what a system isexpected to achieve. It includes all the system needs to know,i.e., goals, requirements, constraints, etc. It needs formalmodeling and common semantics to be understandable tothe system; however, it is also intuitively understandable byhumans. It is not only used on the human-machine interface,but in internal goal-setting between sub-systems, and thisaspect makes intents valuable for our purposes, as will beseen later in this paper. Natural language and other domain-specific languages can be used which requires localinterpretation and translation into the common intent model.It also has its life cycle actively managed by the intentcreator through the intent API [18],[19]. Intent-basedmanagement has started to be used in several trial customerdeployments, e.g., [20].The crucial aspect of intents is that they are decomposable.That is, as shown in Fig.1, an intent can be specified atthe Business Support System (BSS) layer, and decomposedfurther down to the Operations Support System (OSS), RAN,Transport, and Core layers of the network stack. This lendsitself to the step-wise decomposition of user requirements atthe BSS layer down to the network and5G core layers. Thisproperty of intents makes them suitable for adaptable andflexible decision-making in programmable networks.At each level in the network stack, intent managementfunctions (IMF) can be defined, whose task is to translatethe intents defined by IMFs in the upper layer into intentsthat IMFs can implement at the lower layer. An IMF wouldtherefore be performing the role of an intent owner or intenthandler, depending on when it is (respectively) assigning ordecomposing intents. When the intent can no longer bedecomposed at the lowest layer, the intent handler would haveto implement the intent.Each IMF would therefore go through a closed loop, drivenby machine reasoning, as shown in Fig.2. This comprisesthe following: (a) measurement agents that report the state ofthe network at the level below that of the IMF and report toit; (b) assurance agents, that determine what needs to beimplemented based on the arriving intent; (c) proposal agentthat proposes one or more intent decompositions, comprisinga combination of decomposition and actuation as needed; (d)evaluation agent, that evaluates the proposals and selects thebest one; and (e) actuation agent that implements the actual
