Active inference and deep generative modeling
for cognitive ultrasound
Ruud JG van Sloun Member, IEEE
Abstract—Ultrasoundhastheuniquepotentialtoofferac-
cess to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices

stethoscope. Nevertheless, and despite many advances,
ultrasound image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still
highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-
image patients, image quality is oft...
