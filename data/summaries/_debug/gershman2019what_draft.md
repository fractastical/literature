### OverviewThis summary synthesizes the key arguments and findings presented in Samuel J. Gershman’s “What does the free energy principle tell us about the brain.” The paper establishes the free energy principle (FEP) as a unifying theory, closely related to Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and optimal control theory. Gershman systematically deconstructs the FEP, identifying distinct claims and highlighting the importance of assumptions. The paper emphasizes that FEP doesn’t have a fixed set of claims, but rather, its predictions depend on the specific assumptions made. It outlines the Bayesian brain hypothesis, the role of variational inference, and the implications of FEP for understanding neural computation.### MethodologyThe authors begin by clarifying the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain is equipped with an internal model of the environment, generating sensory observations from hidden states. This internal model is composed of two components: a prior distribution over hidden states and a likelihood distribution relating observations to hidden states. The authors then introduce the concept of variational inference, a technique for approximating Bayesian inference when the posterior distribution is intractable. They explain that FEP is equivalent to Bayesian inference under certain conditions, and that the choice of variational family significantly impacts the predictions of FEP. The authors detail the use of mean-field approximations and Laplace approximations to simplify the calculations. They also discuss the role of active inference, where an agent optimizes its actions to minimize expected free energy.### ResultsGershman demonstrates that FEP is equivalent to Bayesian inference under certain conditions, particularly when the variational family is unrestricted. They show that the choice of variational family significantly impacts the predictions of FEP. The authors provide specific examples of how the mean-field approximation can lead to systematic errors, but also highlight its utility in generating realistic neural models. They present the key equations and formulas that underpin the FEP, including the free energy, the KL divergence, and the Bayesian rule. The authors demonstrate that FEP can be used to model a wide range of cognitive phenomena, including perception, action, and decision-making.### DiscussionThe authors state: "Thefreeenergyprinciple(FEP)states,inanutshell,thatthebrainseekstominimizesurprise[1]." They note that FEP doesn't have a fixed set of distinct claims, but rather, its predictions depend on the specific assumptions made. According to the paper, "it ispreciselythisgeneralitythatraisesa concern:whatexactlydoesFEPpredict,andwhatdoesitnotpredict?" Gershman argues that identifying distinct theoretical claims is pointless; the fundamental issue is not whether one theory is better than another, but how to assign credit and blame to different theoretical assumptions.
