Tobeginwith,researchfundingisacrucialfacetofasustainingknowledgemarketplace,andthestructureof
thecurrentknowledgemarketisinherentlycharacterizedbythedisparityinresearchspending[4].Furthermore,
oneofthemaincausesofthisdiscrepancyisanimpropermappingofthepartieswhowouldbeinterestedin

assets). Inaddition,thefactthatprominentplayersareinvolvedinthissectorisanotherfactorthataddsto

thestakeholders. Lastly,otherproblemsassociatedwiththeconventionalknowledgetradeincludealackof
informationsecurity,privacy,accesscontrol,ownershiptransfer,andtransparency.
Inordertoresolvetheaforementionedissuesandtostreamlinetheexchangeofknowledgeassets,thispaper
proposes a novel decentralized framework in order to construct a trustworthy and functional knowledge
marketplace, which employs active inference-based free energy analysis for the efficient mapping of the
stakeholders for a research contract along with blockchain’s innate qualities including but not limited to
immutability, secure, distributed, fraudresilienceetc. whichbasedonitscutting-edgedatacryptographic
techniques,assuresboththesecurityofthedataaswellastheuser’sidentification. Toavoidtheissuesofa

2 Background
2.1 Blockchain
A decentralized distributed ledger that can only be appended to and has a synchronization mechanism
constitutes a blockchain network. It logs every transaction and verifies the origin of any assets involved
in those transactions in chronological order using cryptographic links between each block. Blockchain
technology,incontrasttocentralizedappsfoundontheinternet,doesnothaveasinglecontrollingauthority.
Thedistributedledgersystem(blockchain)consistsofanetworkofnodes,eachofwhichcopiestheledger. It
isseeninapubliccapacitybyeveryuserthatisconnectedtothenetwork[6]. Becauseonlythewalletaddress
maybematchedtoatransaction,allofthetransactionsareopentopublicscrutinywhilemaintainingaveneer
of anonymity [7]. The first practical implementation of blockchain technology was the "cryptocurrency"

Figure1: ArchitectureOfBlockchainNetwork
Bitcoin[8],whichisalsoknownasa"decentralizeddigitalcurrency"thatisverifiedbyencryption. Afterthat,
aplethoraofbrand-newcurrencies,eachwiththeirownsetofdistinctivecharacteristics,suchasEthereum[9],
emerged. ThebasicarchitectureofablockchainnetworkisillustratedinFigure1.
2.2 ActiveInference
Activeinferenceisatheorythatdescribesperception,planning,andactionintermsofprobabilisticinference.
Itisawayofdescribingsentientactivity[10]. Activeinference,whichtheoreticalneuroscientistKarlFriston
createdduringyearsofground-breakingresearch,offersanintegratedviewpointonthebrain,cognition,and
behaviourthatisincreasinglyemployedinvariousfields,includingneuroscience,psychology,andphilosophy.
Active inference translates observation into action. Active inference’s theory, applications, and cognitive
domainssimulatevariouscomplexsystems.
By framing behaviour and the brain in terms of a single drive to reduce free energy, active inference is a
"firstprinciples"approachtounderstandingbehaviourandthebrain. Inordertocomprehendhowthebrain
functions,thereisastrongemphasisontheimplicationsofthefreeenergyprinciple. Inordertocontextualize

2.3 DecentralizedAutonomousOrganization(DAO)
Adecentralizedautonomousorganization,alsoknownasaDAO,isablockchain-basedsystemthatenables

DAOsareconsideredtobeautonomousbecause,unlesstheircodespecifiesexpresslyotherwise,theyoperate

Existing methods of knowledge monetization are typically complex and have not undergone significant
development in a very long time. Traditionally, the commercialization and exchange of knowledge takes

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Blockchain-Based Decentralized Knowledge Marketplace Using Active Inference"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
