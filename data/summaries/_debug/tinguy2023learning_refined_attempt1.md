Here’s a revised summary of the paper “Learning Spatial and Temporal Hierarchies: Hierarchical Active Inference for navigation in Multi-Room Maze Environments,” adhering to all the specified requirements.**Learning Spatial and Temporal Hierarchies: Hierarchical Active Inference for navigation in Multi-Room Maze Environments**This research introduces a hierarchical active inference model designed for autonomous navigation within complex multi-room maze environments. The core innovation lies in a three-layer model—a cognitive map, an allocentric model, and an egocentric model—that effectively learns spatial relationships and navigates effectively. The model’s design addresses the limitations of existing approaches, particularly in handling complex environments and reducing the impact of computational constraints.The model’s architecture comprises three distinct layers. The cognitive map provides a high-level representation of the environment, while the allocentric model refines spatial relationships. The egocentric model, characterized by its short-term memory, adapts to the immediate environment.“The cognitive map provides a high-level representation of the environment, while the allocentric
