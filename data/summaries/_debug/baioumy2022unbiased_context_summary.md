Unbiased Active Inference for Classical Control
Mohamed Baioumy∗1, Corrado Pezzato∗2, Riccardo Ferrari3, Nick Hawes1
Abstract—Active inference is a mathematical framework
that originated in computational neuroscience. Recently, it has
been demonstrated as a promising approach for constructing
goal-driven behavior in robotics. Specifically, the active
inference controller (AIC) has been successful on several
continuous control and state-estimation tasks. Despite its
relative success, some establi...
