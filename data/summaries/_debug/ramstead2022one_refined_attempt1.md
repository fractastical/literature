### OverviewThis summary critically examines Maxwell J. D. Ramstead’s commentary on “The Markov blanket trick: On the scope of the free energy principle and active inference” by Raja and colleagues (2021). Ramstead argues that while the authors’ main argument is valid, it contains a flawed premise, which undermines their conclusions. He highlights a shift in understanding regarding Markov blankets, supported by subsequent research, particularly Friston and colleagues’ sparse coupling conjecture. The commentary emphasizes the evolving landscape of the free energy principle (FEP) and its implications for understanding complex systems.### MethodologyRamstead’s approach is primarily analytical, scrutinizing the arguments presented in Raja et al. (2021). He systematically deconstructs the authors’ modus tollens argument, identifying a critical flaw in the second premise. He leverages subsequent research, notably Friston et al. (2021) and Sakthivadivel (2022a), to demonstrate the increasing likelihood of systems possessing Markov blankets, even in high-dimensional scenarios. He explains that “as both linear and nonlinear systems become increasingly high-dimensional, the probability of finding a Markov blanket between subsets approaches1.” Of note, in this work, the construct of Markov blanket has been weakened to “soft blankets,” which are not entirely sealed off from the outside world. More technically, “this work defines a ‘blanket index,’ which measures the distance between a perfectly blanketed system and a perfectly densely coupled system, such that we have a strict Markov blanket when the blanket index is zero. And we can show that this index tends to zero as systems increase in size.” This formulation of Markov blankets, which allows for a separation of temporal scales and material turnover, may help address issues raised by the authors about meta-stable boundaries of dynamically changing systems, such as candle flames.### ResultsRamstead’s analysis centers on the implications of Friston and colleagues’ sparse coupling conjecture for the applicability of the FEP. He notes, “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q) and Some interesting systems do not have Markov blankets (¬q) Therefore, those interesting systems must not be describable by the FEP (¬p)” – but he contends that this premise is now demonstrably false.”Specifically, Friston et al. (2021) demonstrated, through Sakthivadivel (2022a), that, in the limit of increasing dimensionality, essentially all systems (both linear and nonlinear) will have Markov blankets, in the appropriate sense. He further clarifies that “the FEP is dual to the constrained maximum entropy principle (CMEP), which is a cornerstone of contemporary physics (Sakthivadivel,2022b; Ramstead, Sakthivadivel, et al.,2022).”He explains that “they are simply two complementary perspectives on the same phenomenon of self-organization: an FEP-theoretic model is a mechanical theory written to explain the dynamics of a system from the point of view of the ‘self’ or particle; while the CMEP looks at the same phenomenon from the point of view of ‘organization,’ i.e., from the perspective of an external observer, in the environment or heat bath.”Ramstead highlights that “an FEP-theoretic model of a particle’s beliefs about a system is a maximum entropy model of the states of the system. And a maximum entropy model of any system simply is the optimal model of that system, given our state of knowledge about that system (Jaynes1957).”Finally, he notes that “a closely related point was made earlier by Kiefer,2020.”### DiscussionRamstead’s commentary underscores the dynamic nature of the FEP and its evolving implications for understanding complex systems.
