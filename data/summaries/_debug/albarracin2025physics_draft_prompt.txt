Abstract
The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process ef-
fectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires
attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the
acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive
processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing
capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ul-
timately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of
relyingonothersforthereproductionof(material) tasks. Theeffectsofsocial empowermentthus
imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the
evolution of a specific state space.
Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale
of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits
thatsocialpower,inthecontextofactiveinference,isafunctionofseveralvariables,amongthem:
an individual’s or group’s ability to attract the attention of others with the ability to facilitate
desired policies, and an individual’s or group’s capacity to effectively process information. As
a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against
possible vulnerabilities. Semantic social artifacts (narratives, ideologies, histories, representation,
etc.) as attentional scripts (ensuring the coordination of social patterns: psychological schemata,
habits, groupthink, insulation, policies, etc.: [Albarracin et al., 2021]), are the structures under
and by which agents mediate and leverage power, and are thus this article’s main objects of
analysis.
Narratives are social mechanisms which have the ability to make or break power [Blakeley,
2024]. Not-yet-engaged scripts (speculations, fictions, etc.: future forecasting) can be understood
assemanticattractorsenabling—relatively—risk-freelearning[deJager,2022]. Possibilisticcogni-
tiveexplorations intheform of, e.g., (fictional) narrativesallow agentstoconsider counterfactual
scenarios and minimize uncertainty without exposure to “real-world” consequences. This mech-
anism frames both the evolutionary advantage and persistent appeal of narrative engagement in
humanculture. Inthecontextofpower,leveraging“strongnarratives”—suchas“usversusthem”
reductionisms—greatly minimizesuncertainty(technically: variationalfreeenergy,thedivergence

the problems immediately emerge in situations where collective attention controlled by agents
alreadybenefitingfromdominantnarrativescanlead to,e.g., theexacerbation ofmisinformation,
echo chambers, conspiracy theories, etc. (ibid.), in an attempt to retain attention and therefore
power. In political communication and organization, where the proliferation of scripts can be
understood as an optimization of the learning/risk trade-off inherent in active inference, this is
of crucial attention, particularly at a time when the democratic, technological and futurological
organization of life is in question.
We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing de-
sirable policies, but also byenhancing theirability to intakeand computeinformation effectively.
This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered
are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while
minimizing risk-exposure. The theoretical framework developed here has implications for under-
standing both the cognitive foundations of script engagement in the mediation and evolution of
power, aswellasstrategies fortheirpossible modulations. Formalizing andmodelingthesemech-
anisms demands special attention in the context of futurological prospects. This article reorients

Introduction: The Nature of Power
The concept of power has a long history, and can be explored at several scales. In this article, our interest
is to explore the concept as a phenomenon that can be understood as unfolding across scales, by framing
and formalizing it through active inference. In the context of social organization dynamics, one of the most
compelling elucidations of what constitutes thenature of power was presented by Michel Foucault:
“... powermustbeunderstoodinthefirstinstanceasthemultiplicityof force relations immanent
in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own organization; as the process
which, through ceaseless struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them;
as the support which these force relations find in one another, thus forming a chain or a system,
or on the contrary,the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them from one another; and
lastly, as thestrategies in which theytakeeffect...” ([Foucault, 1990], pp. 92–93, our emphasis in
bold).
The phenomenon, as well as the representations of what precisely constitutes the social acquisition and
maintenance of power, is thusa complex series of multidirectional processes which cannot be simplistically or
hierarchically schematized, but must be analyzed in terms of interactions between agents and the constraint-
regimestheyareembeddedwithin. Traditionally,theframingofsocially-facilitatedempowerment—suchasthat
ofthestate, orofalarge corporation—hasbeenunderstoodastheeffectuationof(often top-down)strategies,
tactics, policies, narratives (i.e., scripts, as will beargued later) which grant empowered agents/systems more
leverage, that is: more influence on future states 1. We will frame this in terms of information-processing
capacities and opportunities, where powerful agents either rely on others to bring about desired policies (i.e.,
exploitation: in the biological and sociological senses), or enjoy more information-processing possibilities as
a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks (i.e., exploration). The effects of social
empowerment therefore imply an increased ability to computeinformation, therebyaugmenting theevolution
of a specific state space. Basing our arguments in active inference, as will be explained, will allow for an

out [their] will despite resistance,”(Weber [2009], p. 152) in terms of actual 2 probabilities. We will present
novel understandings of concepts such as scripts and attention, by analyzing power in terms of the physics of
beliefs [Ramstead et al., 2023], and the metaphysics of social organization, where metaphysics is understood
as thepossibilistic exploration of state spaces (i.e., thefuture).
The outline of the article is as follows: in the subsections that follow, we present a necessarily broad and
briefelucidationofdifferentunderstandingsofpower,primarilybywayofphilosophyandsociology,inorderto

theoretical ground which will sustain our analysis. In section 3, we synthesize the previous sections towards
an explanation of social scripts and power, and how scripts can frame the concept of narratives, attention,
coercion and resistance. In section 4, we look at power through the lens of ActiveInference, and in section 5,
we treat the formal framework integration. We conclude by presenting attentional strategies which can result
in alternative modulations of power.
0.1 Power-pooling in, through and between agents
Gravitationalmetaphorsaboundinlanguage[Shepard,1987,Lakoff and Johnson,2003,Dennett,1992,de Jager,
2021, Kent, 2024]3). Such gravitational metaphors find analogues in the network sciences, whereby preferen-
tial attachment processes lead to additional power accruing increasingly to those already in possession of it
[Barab´asi and Albert, 1999]. The idea of power being pooled towards complex social attractors was famously
presented by Pierre Bordieu, who linked various concepts of capital (cultural, political, etc.) to power as
social (at)traction, borrowing themetaphor from physicalfield theory4. Weexpandon hislegacy which takes
theontoepistemological and theempirical tobeinseparable—and hisdesire toground sociological analyses of
habitusinascientificallytractablemanner—byframingtheseattentionalattractorsthatmovesystemstoward
specific configurations, through Active Inference (AIF). Another key thinker of power in the 20th century
was Hannah Arendt. Arendt’s relational idea of collective power frames its essence as communicative, public
and permanent potential: people may gain momentum together, but power is never guaranteed. Coercion,
(symbolic) violence and oppressive authority, in her framing, do not constitute power but are rather reduc-
tions of its possibility. In our context, this differentiation would imply the first presentation being shared
cultural narratives towards explorative change, and the second as top-down exploitative practices which re-
duce the possibility of novelty in given structures (systems such as communities; identities, histories, etc.).
Similarly, more recently, Grace Blakeley has analyzed the disempowerment of collective political imagination
by presenting this as the disillusion5 with shared narratives: democratic engagement in the context of, e.g.,
British politics, has been affected by a sense of lack of agency (from “there is no alternative” all the way
to the not-so “free” market6). This resulting political disenchantment was framed earlier by Mark Fisher in
terms of the privatization or individualization of systemic stress [Fisher, 2009]: through strategic narratives
which set public attention on individual responsibility, publics become overwhelmed by having to resolve, at
the individual level, stress which is in fact systemic. Whether we are talking about a metastabilizing “in-
visible hand” or modeling swarm-organization [Wareham et al., 2023]: we know of many systems that have

orderconsciousness ofselfhood [Kent, 2024]: gravity constrains physical proprioception andaction, as well as the very
senseofanarrativeself[Dennett,1992].

AIF.

infelicitous critical points when scaling: requisite variety demands that control systems maintain sufficient
internal complexity (entropy) to match the complexity of what they aim to control. This can be understood
at a number of levels (in modeling: computational tractability problems regarding communication between
agents that have to do with temporal tracking and issues such as latency, for example), but at the level of
socialdynamicsandthe(in)efficienciesofpowerasymmetries,thisismost obviousinthecontextofthepower
of attention: the assertion of a specific narrative, if it gains traction as a collective belief, will result in the
simplification (and mobilization) of desire. That is: a strong-enough narrative can become a script which
agentsincorporateaspartoftheirgenerativemodel,ratherthanasameta-consideration(ahighlypossibilistic
variable), existing on a dialogical landscape. In crude terms: the difference between the first and the second
can be exemplified by the situation where an agent believes that any single solution can solve national scale
problems,suchasthedeportation ofimmigrantssupposedlysolvingeverysocio-economic issueinaverylarge

of questions of information-processing capacity: not only are resource-distribution and the division of labor
a systemic fact, but also: since the modulation and projection of future possibilities cannot be computed at
thelevel of theindividualdueto itshigh complexity,thisis how andwhy theminimization of uncertaintyfor
social systems is, in fact, social. Agents seek alliances and policies which ensure cognition (i.e., information
processing and future-projection) can be distributed [Vasil et al., 2020], as this allows for efficient practical
traction because of “epistemic confidence in knowing, interpreting, and acting together” [Shteynberget al.,
2023]. This is the basis for any division of labor, where specialized roles and collaborative synergy optimize
task execution. As demonstrated by [Ispolatov et al., 2012], division of labor in biological systems improves
fitness by compartmentalizing incompatible processes, while [Labella, 2007] shows its application in robotics,
enhancingadaptability and resource efficiency. [Marzband et al., 2017] showthat coalition-based strategies in
distributed energy resources maximize collective benefits, offering a model for scalable and cooperative sys-
tems in human and artificial contexts. This is in contrast with individualized agency—which is a prerequisite
for social coercion—where one’s estimation of “divergence in mental states between self and other(s)” allows
forthe“prediction andinterpretation of others’behavior”[Shteynberget al.,2023], resultingin shorter-range
practical effects. Remaining politically-agnostic in any analysis presents us with some questions: what can
we assume to actually know about each other when we act collectively? The concept of a ‘self’ as a single
agent seems particularly questionable, especially as all selves exist within a regime of constraints which exert
effects on their supposed autonomy. A famous response to the Foucauldian take on power and the individual
came from Gilles Deleuze. His concept of the “-dividual” replaces the image of, e.g., the factory worker as a
subject of disciplinary capitalism, with theimage of adistributedsubjectivity,e.g., theownerof acredit card
as a subject of libertarian debt, occupying various spatiotemporal scales and modulated not by clock-time or
physical enclosure, but by probabilities and contractual fixation/limitation [Deleuze, 1992]. The latter condi-
tion emerges, Deleuzeshows, as a result of novelparadigms of technocapitalism which present new constraint
regimes. Distribution, collectivity, or shared sameness, therefore, do not always equal autonomous collective
traction,butcanalsobetheresultofpolicieswhichpoolpowertowardsattractors,wheretheagentsimplicated
within them may not even be aware of their implication (the examples in capitalism are vast: we have very
little idea of the complexity behind the products we buy into, but we are coerced into buying nonetheless7).
In the interest of this article, the concept tying all these processes towards an analysis of power dynamics is
that of attention. We will briefly treat this below (and in later sections) before moving to section 2 for an
exposition of the AIFframework.
0.2 Attention as power: shared narratives and awareness or coercion
Exerting social control over others’ actions begins at the level of attention: whether this be by attracting
attention (“follow me!”), or directing attention (“look at that!”). Our interest in formalizing certain aspects
of power dynamics is directing attention towards (metacognitive and collective) scripts with the capacity of
empoweringresponsestocounterdominantstrategieswhich,currently,minimizeuncertaintyfortheveryfew8.
Shared structures of meaning can exist as collective metacognitive computing conditions, i.e., conditions in
which agents are—relatively—aware of the implications of the scripts they follow, or coercive domination:

political contexts, imply promises or solutions impossible to accomplish: “you have been lied to”, “the other is the

low-computation, predictable visions10.
Inthetransitionbetweenaneconomycenteredaroundmaterialandspatialcapital,towardsoneoftemporal,
speculative capital, we can straightforwardly connect attention to computation by understanding theimplicit
link between risk-assessment and investment: (possible) future gains ought to be calculated, and directing
investment begins with attentional gains11. Beyond the strictly financial realm, in the context of futurology
and planetary survival, the concept of AI technologies as “powerful” grounds the arguments surrounding
possibleexistentialrisks. E.g.,Cappelenetal. relyontheconceptof“power”inordertoassesstowhatextent
humans may or may not lose control over their own technological creations [Cappelen et al., 2024]. Likewise,
otherauthorsmakeclaimsfor “powerfulyetnarrowAIsystems”asincapableof accommodating thesemantic
complexity which groundsmortal life [Ororbia and Friston,2023]12. What theseassessments havein common
is a concern with attention as a resource: a collectively predicted future is one where attention is directed
towards synchronized goals (whetherthis beinvestment,alignment, etc.).
Ultimately, because potential power (as attention) is both a material and an informational force, “seizing
the means of computation” (Doctorow, 2023) follows in line with a Marxist analysis of capital in our moving
paradigm: frommaterialistanalysesofterritorialandlabortimedomination,throughasemantic-sociocultural
analysis[Bourdieu,2018],toinformationalanalyseswhereweoughttothinkabouttheproductionofthefuture
by means of projective computation. Power is thus based on the controlling of attention by way of scripts
(again: narratives, representation, identities, symbolisms, etc.) and its current substrate in our contemporary
landscape is computation: both in the flesh and in silico. As we will see in section 3, power’s dual nature (as
forceattractionandinformationcomputation)inthesocialrealmthusimpliestheuseofscriptsastheyarethe
means by which agents gain or lose the ability to direct the attention of other agents (with access to desired
policies), and the ability to effectively process information in favor of these policies (and other longer-term
possibilities).
The variables modulating regimes of attention that have practical modeling potential are plenty, and in
sections 4 and 5, our interest is in the control, influence, and synchronization of attention, which lead to
social power structures. Our focus will be on empowerment quantified as agents’ potential influence over
their environment (which is tracked by assessing the mutual information between actions and states). We
will analyze this through formal methods that are tractable, but this presents us with indications of future
modeling possibilities, which in our context remain unformalized as they are practically intractable. We can
think,forexample,aboutthemodelingof“inheritance”or“provenance”variables: wherever/howeveranagent
exists, they could be born into a rich family, in a specific part of the world, etc., and these factors have an
influence on how others interpret them (and therefore on life-expectancy: mortality, and many other crucial
effects). One can also posit a possible “frictions/contingencies/contextualities” variable—in colloquial terms
“you haveto work with what you’vegot”—by which, even if agents can attract others’ attention and process
information effectively towards the effectuation of a specific policy, the projected goal and thuspossible state
space isconstrained by acontext which can behighly divergent from the“ideal” onethey project as required
forbringingagoalabout. Confidenceinpoliciesisawell-framedandstudiedvariableinthecontextofAIF,and

sections.
Power as potential, as force: as the ability to do work in physics and the ability to do work in the
socioreproductive realm, represent two sides of the same coin: the mechanics of matter and energy sustain
the dynamics of complex systems; which, in turn, modulate matter and energy. Under AIF, this ‘common
currency’ can be studied as the process by which state spaces are explored by collectives (dis)attending to
projective possibilities. In order to understand this better, formalizations are necessary, which is our interest
inthispaper: awarenessaboutthemodulationofattentionbeginsatthelevelofunderstandingtheconstraints
framing attention. As Foucault notes in “The Subject and Power” [Foucault, 1982], formalizations are not
without their reductive, objectifying problems, but are necessary in order to drive critical analysis forward.

imperative being to persist in (generalized) synchrony with its world.” (ibid.). The questions of “autonomy” and
“synchrony” are precisely the ones we are after in this article, by observing how power, in mortally-determined social
systems,isdrivenbyattention.

in its theoretical and practical sense” (p. 779). This is, in great part, what we aim to explore here, not an
established structurebut “a technique,a form of power” (p. 781): attention itself, analyzed underAIF.
In the socioconstructive realm we currently observe: those under duress resort to inevitably short-term
policies, as well as pool their attentional trust in those who seem to promise them less uncertainty13. Those
who can rely on the minimization of uncertainty because of historically-given, infrastructural factors have
access to more and therefore longer-term leverage on the unfolding future. Power as the exertion of longer-
termagency impliesthat,tobeginwith, anagent relies onfactors thatmakemorespacetime availablefor the
computation (as projection: planningand effectuation) of possible futures.
We now present the theoretical framework before moving on to defining formal aspects of this, i.e., the
ways in which we may organize variables in narratives as scripts, and how controlling a narrative or exerting
a script implies controlling attention, which implies power.
1 Theoretical Framework: Active Inference
AIF posits that biological systems maintain their existence by minimizing a quantity known as free en-
ergy—anupperboundonsurpriseorunlikelinessgivensensorydata. AIFextendsthisprincipletoexplainhow
agents—whethercells,brains,ororganisms—activelyaligntheirinternalmodelswiththeirenvironmentstoen-
sureadaptivebehavior. Itascribesadualroletoperceptionandaction: whileperceptionupdatesbeliefsabout
the world based on sensory inputs, action minimizes discrepancies between sensory inputs and predictions by
altering the environment tomatch internal expectations (Friston, 2009).
Thisisfundamentallyembodiedandenactive. Throughitweintegrateideasfrompredictiveprocessingand
Bayesian inference. It is a useful tool to cast self-organizing systems as nested within hierarchical generative
models that predict sensory inputsat multiple spatiotemporal scales.
Interestingly, we can also link it to an enactive inference perspective, which focuses more strongly on the
role of action in shaping perception. Under this lens, beliefs are formed actively. For readers unfamiliar
withtheintricaciesofActiveInferenceFramework(AIF),thisconceptcanbeseenasadynamicprocesswhere
agentsoptimizetheirinteractionswithandmodelsoftheworldtoreduceuncertaintyandmaintainhomeostasis,
allostasis,orhomeorhesis[Ororbia and Friston,2023]. AIFhighlightstheimportanceofgenerativemodelsthat
representthestructureoftheenvironmentandguidebehavior. Itdirectlyintegratesperceptual,cognitive,and
motor processes.
Generative models are thus the heart of any AIF agent. They represent a structured way for agents to
analyze sensory inputs and infer their possible causes. These models consist of hierarchical representations
that generate predictions about sensory states based on beliefs (i.e., inductive habits) about hidden causes.
Generativeprocessesrepresentthetruestatesoftheworldthatproducesensoryobservations,whilegenerative
models represent the agent’s internal hypotheses of these processes. AIF hinges on the alignment of models
with processes, with actions taken to correct any mismatch. This framework allows agents to learn both the
structureoftheenvironmentandeffectivepoliciesthroughmessage-passing algorithms, whichmimicneuronal
processes [Parr et al., 2019].
Generative models can be organized hierarchically, with each layer producing predictions about the level
below it. For example, higher levels might model abstract causes (such as intentions or environmental condi-
tions), while lower levels represent more immediate sensory or motor states. Each layer generates predictions
(i.e.,expectedsensorystates)basedoninferredhiddencausesandcorrectsthesepredictionsbasedonincoming
data. This process is mathematically described through conditional dependencies that cascade through each
layer.

1.1 Free energy minimization
Free energy minimization is the unifying principle that motivates perception, cognition, and action in Active
Inference Framework (AIF). As described in Parr and Friston’s 2019 paper, this minimization occurs at both
localandlargerscales[Parr et al.,2019]. Freeenergyminimizationatcellularandcognitivelevelscouldreflect
larger systemic constraints and efficiencies. This process involves reducing the divergence between an agent’s
predictions and its sensory inputs, maintaining a state of low surprise or entropy.
Free energy is an upper bound on the “surprise” (or negative log-probability) an agent experiences given
its observations (o). Surprise reflects the degree to which sensory data diverges from an agent’s predictions,
but it is generally intractable to compute directly. Variational free energy (VFE), an approximation applied
by Friston and others to the study of the brain [Friston et al., 2006, 2015, 2016], allows the agent to sidestep
this intractability by using an internal generative model, represented as q-distributions over hidden (latent)
states (s), toapproximate the posterior distribution. The variational free energy F can be expressed as:
F =D [q(s)kp(s|o)]−lnp(o)

sensory inputs with their predictions, agents have to update their beliefs about the world. Belief updating
underAIFisachievedthroughvariationalBayesianinference,wherebyagentscontinuouslyupdatetheirbeliefs
about the state of the world based on new sensory information. This allows agents to make predictions and
adjust their actions to confirm thesepredictions, thereby preservinga coherent sense of self and environment.
Given appropriate belief updating, the system can then select actions that are consistent with its internal
generative model. This effectively ensures that the chosen policies minimize future free energy. This mech-
anism has broad implications, enabling goal-directed behavior and coherent action selection, even in novel
environments.
Minimization can be broken down into two complementary strategies. Agents can perform perceptual or
active inference, which are inextricably related. Perceptual inference entails adjusting beliefs about hidden

minimization. In cognition, the brain applies predictive coding, where sensory inputs are compared against
predictions generated by a hierarchical generative model. Mismatches trigger updates (prediction errors) at
successive hierarchical levels, ultimately influencing cognition and behavior to minimize surprise. Free energy
minimization translates into entropy reduction. Entropy here quantifies uncertainty about the states of the
world, and free energy minimization reduces this uncertainty by aligning beliefs (internal model) with reality
(sensory inputs).
Partoftheinternalmodelofanagentmayincludepredictionsaboutitsownactions. Suchpredictionscan
be thought of as plans, which may be optimized to bring about desirable outcomes. In information-theoretic
terms, this results in a shift from minimizing the Variational Free Energy (VFE) to minimizing the Expected
Free Energy (EFE),whichcanbedecomposedintotwocomponents—extrinsic value (goal-directed,rewarding

wherelnp˜(o)representstheagent’spreferencesoverobservationsorextrinsicvalue,expressedasa(biased)

expected information gain or epistemic value, which scores the degree to which an agent expects to update
their beliefs in light of new sensory data. By pursuing outcomes that maximize a balance between epistemic
and extrinsic values, agents simultaneously satisfy immediate goals and resolve uncertainty, driving adaptive
behaviorin complex environments.
1.2 Why active inference is suitable for modeling power dynamics
Active Inference Framework (AIF) is well-suited to understand power dynamics, beginning with individual
agents as predictive systems that minimize uncertainty through perception and action [Bruineberg, 2017].
These agents develop control through embodied interaction with their environment, establishing what Bru-
inebergcallsthe“primacy of the’ICan”’—thefundamentalability,orpower, toinfluenceone’ssurroundings.
This individual control scales up through generative models that enable agents to predict and understand
others’ intentions [Friston et al., 2020, Vasil et al., 2020], while attention is fundamentally shaped by deep
preferences that determinewhat becomes salient in theenvironment [Parvizi-Wayne, 2024].
Atthesociallevel,powerdynamicsemergethroughsharedpredictivemodelsandenvironmentalmediation.
Groups develop shared narratives that coordinate actions and expectations [Bouizegarene et al., 2020], while
stigmergicprocessesallowfordistributedcontrolthroughenvironmentalmodificationsthatinfluencecollective
behavior[Friedman et al.,2021]. This social coordination is reinforced through deontic cues that signal social
norms and expectations [Constant et al., 2019], while cultural practices shape attention patterns to create
shared perceptual landscapes within the environment. Joint attention and shared fields of affordances enable
efficientcoordinationthroughmutualunderstandingofactionpossibilities[Tison and Poirier,2021,Vasil et al.,
2020].
Thesemechanismsultimately cangiverisetocomplexpowerstructuresthroughdecentralizedinteractions
ratherthantop-downcontrol[Friedman et al.,2021]. Groupsself-organize intosubgroupsbasedonbeliefsim-
ilarity [Kastel et al., 2023], while influence spreads through network structures that amplify certain messages
whilemarginalizingothers[Albarracin et al.,2022]. Thisprocesscreatessystemsof‘culturalcapital’[Bourdieu,
2018] where shared knowledge and norms enable efficient navigation of social contexts [Constant et al., 2019,
Hipo´lito and van Es, 2022]. The result is a dynamic system where power emerges from the interplay of indi-
vidual prediction, social influence, and cultural learning, all of which can be unified under the principles of
AIF.
Thequestionofsocial sameness (asin “same”narratives, beliefsimilarity, etc.) and(dis)attentiontoit,is
therefore a political question. If attention is fundamentally shaped by deep preferences that determine what
becomes salient in the environment for an agent or group, then we ought to ask how the production and
performanceofscripts(habitus,narratives: histories,identities,etc.) canbenewlyunderstoodsothatwemay

legibility in a population can also manifest in institutions shaping and direction of attention toward specific
narratives [Scott, 2020], and may similarly arise in collectively determined scripts. Thus, a balance needs
to be maintained between benefits such as improved coordination and an oversuppression of diversity among

2 Social Scripts and Power
2.1 Scripts as frameworks for social behavior
Socialscriptsareblueprintsthatenableagentstonavigatesocialsituationsandselectsituationallyappropriate

that prescribes normative standards for behavior, similar to how actors share a dramaturgical script. Strong
scriptsspecifyprecisesequencesofstructuredbehavioraleventsthatagentsareexpectedtoperformincertain
social situations [Albarracin et al., 2021]. These scripts maintain causal and temporal relationships between
events, enabling agents to make reliable inferences about others’ likely actions. For example, the North
American restaurant script prescribes specific ordered sequences: being seated by the host, reviewing menus,
ordering drinks,ordering food, eating, and payingthe bill including tip [Albarracin et al., 2021].
Weakscriptsspecifythetypicalfeaturesandsemanticassociationsthatagentsencounterinparticularevent
types, without strictly prescribing event order [Albarracin et al., 2021]. These scripts function as clusters of
conceptually related possibilities that help agents interpret situations and identify appropriate actions. The
semanticconnectionsinweakscriptsadaptagents’perceptualfieldsbymakingcertainactionpossibilitiesmore
salient based on contextualgoals.
Scripts help maintain power structures. Scripts normalize certain behavioral patterns by providing tem-
plates for ”appropriate” action, making deviations appear abnormal or inappropriate (Constant et al., 2018).
This normalization reinforces existing power relations by making them appear natural and inevitable. They
establishreliablesequencesofinteractioninfavorofacurrentnorm: whetheragentsfollowingthisare(critical)
aware of the norm, or simply perform it, is often the question. They thus reduce uncertainty and create pre-
dictable social patterns that benefit those already in power [Albarracin et al., 2021]. These patterns become
self-reinforcing as agents learn to expect and reproduce them. Given this predictability, scripts assign and
maintain social roles by specifying appropriate behaviors for different agents based on their position within
powerstructures[](Constantetal., 2018). Thisroledifferentiationhelpsreproducehierarchical relationships.
LookingatscriptsunderAIF,theycanbeunderstoodassharedgenerativemodelsthatenablecoordinated
social behavior. Scripts represent shared knowledge about the causal structure of social situations, allowing
agentstomakepredictionsaboutothers’behaviorandselectappropriateactions. Thesesharedmodelsfacilitate
social coordination by reducing uncertainty about interaction patterns. Scripts incorporate deontic cues that
trigger specific behavioral policies, helping agents select appropriate actions in response to environmental
signals [Constant et al., 2019]. These cues guide action selection by making certain policies more likely in
specific contexts. Scripts are transmitted across generations through cultural learning processes, enabling the
reproduction of social structures. This transmission occurs through both explicit instruction and implicit
learning from environmentalregularities.

leads to thecreation of shared meaning as well as to thejustification of existing power structures. Because of
the challenges inherent to the coordination of social reality—as mentioned: whether agents following a script
are (critically) aware of the implied norm, or simply perform it, being the main question—we can also think
about scripting narratives in terms of self-fulfilling prophecies, hype, fictions that make themselves real, etc.:
none of the possibilistic options on social offer need be realistic, so long as they are strong enough to attract
attention (driven by thedesire to reduce uncertaintyabout futurestates).

The effects of variational free energy-minimization are observed at the level of the basic structures of
language: (semantic) attractors such as redundancy, rhyme, alliteration, etc., can be understood as patterns

Unlikeshort-rangeprojectiveexperiencessuchastheonesdetailedin[Maisto et al.,2024],whereprediction

etc. [Albarracin et al., 2022], but, in political communication and organization, to the justification of future
policies based on (supposedly)given conditions (derivingan ought from an is, essentially). Abstract semantic
constructs (fictions, narratives, scripts), which can be understood as constraint-regimes coming to operate as
distributed generative models, create cognitive situations where agents can learn by “internally” simulating
responses to high-stakes scenarios, while maintaining corporeal integrity and safety, all the while plastically
exploring their epistemic condition. An environment pooling attention to strong-enough narratives will elicit
the scripting of policies in line with those narratives (as mentioned, regardless of their ‘veridical’ content).
For agents under thermodynamic duress (socioeconomic, corporeal, etc.): the simpler the narrative, often,
the better. This being for the banal reason that they are under duress, and therefore incapable of making
enough spacetime available for deep, projective computations. Narrative structures tempered by the pooling
of attention act as semantic attractors which organize possible world-states into explorable patterns. These
patternsfunctionasprobability-possibilitylandscapesforbelief-updating,allowingagentstoorrestrictingthem

towards narrative-sharing, this process can be understood as a corollary of actively-inferential social agents,

variables effectuate the production of the future15. The theoretical framework developed here has significant

3 Power Through the Lens of Active Inference
3.1 Individual agency and empowerment
Autonomyreferstoasystem’scapacitytogovernitselfbasedoninternallydefinednorms[Watson and Scheidt,
2005]. Autonomousbehavioremerges throughentropymaximization underconstraints. Agentsdonotsimply
maximize randomness (though in some instances they do: explorative behavior is subject to high noise and
benefits from high noise, again, note on average long-term VFEM in social agents). Agents optimize their
behavior by maintaining a balance between maximizing entropy and respecting system constraints [Jaynes,
1957]. This is consistent with Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy, which states that the least biased
estimate of a probability distribution is the one that maximizes entropy subject to known constraints. In
autonomous agents, these constraints include both the agent’s internal model and environmental dynamics
[Golan and Foley, 2022].
We can think of empowerment as a formal measure of an agent’s control over its future states, defined as
themaximum mutual information between an agent’s actions and theresulting states [Klyubin et al., 2005]:
E t,n= max I(A t,n;s t+n),
p(at,n)
15Inthecontext of“fictional inference”[deJager,2023],whichismuchofwhathumansdo,thisistheexplorationof

where I(A t,n;s t+n) denotes the mutual information between the next n actions A t,n from time t and the
state s t+n at time t+n, and p(a t,n) represents the probability distribution over the next n actions from
time t [Klyubin et al., 2005]. In this context, agents select actions that maximize their control over future
environmental states, optimizing their ability to influence outcomes. Higher empowerment indicates greater
potential for an agent to achieve desired future states. Importantly, empowerment can be decomposed into
entropyterms as:
I(A t,n;s t+n)=H(A t,n)+H(s t+n)−H(A
t,n
,s t+n),
whereH[X]representstheShannonentropyof therandom variable X andH[X,Y]denotesthejoint entropy

stateandactiondistributionswhilemaintainingstrongcorrelationsbetweenactionsandtheirconsequences16.
Wecanalsolinktheseideastorecentdevelopmentsinunderstandingintrinsicmotivationindynamicalcontrol
systems [Tiomkin et al., 2024] and complex behavior emerging from the drive to occupy future action-state
path spaces [Ram´ırez-Ruiz et al., 2024].
Empowerment as defined above is an intrinsic motivation that does not specify how an agent should
take actions to achieve specific goals. Extensions have been introduced to incorporate goal-directedness by
introducingarewardconstraint[Volpi and Polani,2020]ortradeoff[Leibfried et al.,2019],whichhighlightthe
tensions that may arise between intrinsic and extrinsicmotivators.
UndertheActiveInference Framework (AIF),autonomous agents select policies (sequencesof actions) by
minimizing expected free energy, which includes both epistemic (information-seeking) and pragmatic (goal-
directed)terms[Friston et al.,2010,Parr et al.,2022]. AIFdiffersfrom empowerment inseveralrespects, but
one crucial point of difference is that it explicitly models the partial observability inherent in many decision-
makingenvironments,motivatingagentstoresolveuncertaintythroughcuriosity-drivenbehavior. Thisbalance
between exploration and exploitation allows agents to both gather information about their environment and
pursue specific goals. Policy selection in autonomous agents involves maintaining a generative model of en-
vironmental dynamics. To do so, agents must update their beliefs about current states through perceptual
inference. Then, they can select actions that minimize expected free energy over future states and ultimately
learn from action outcomes to improve thegenerative model.
Both empowerment and theEFE highlight different components of power that are relevant to the present
discussion. Empowerment more directly formalises the notion of an agent’s control over its environment,
while the EFE emphasizes the role of information gain in the context of generative models, pointing to the
importanceofunderstandinghowinformational landscapesandaffordancescanbeshapedbythosewhowield
social power. Developing a unified framework for integrating these different objectives would likely provide a
deeperunderstandingof how power, goals, and information relate to one another.
3.2 Social power dynamics

through two primary mechanisms. Entities with high power gravity naturally draw others to them through
access to resources, information, or strategic advantages. As more agents are drawn into their ‘orbit,’ their
influenceamplifies through positive feedback loops, e.g., through phenomenasuch as preferential attachment.
Powerful entities offer perceived stability and predictability in an uncertain environment. In AIF terms,
they help other agents minimize their expected free energy by providing reliable frameworks for prediction,
essentially by dictating the information geometry landscape [Constant et al., 2019]. Power confers significant
advantages in information processing and management. Powerful entities occupy positions that grant them
privileged access to information streams, enabling more accurate modeling of their environment. Ultimately,
they also control what can and cannot be modeled, and in what way, through their position and resources,

Through their ability to shape both physical and informational environments, powerful agents can actively
reduceuncertainty for themselves while potentially increasing it for others.
The manipulation of information geometry—both in terms of perception and action—is central to how
power operates in social systems. Powerful entities can shape the attentional landscapes of others, directing

ulate both the physical and informational structure of the environment creates a self-reinforcing cycle where
power begets more power through increasingly sophisticated control over the collective predictive landscape.
Power also expands an entity’s available state-space policies in several ways: powerful entities have access to
a broader range of possible actions and strategies through their resources and influence. Through their at-
tractiveforce, theygain access tothestate-spacepolicies of agentswithin theirsphereof influence,effectively
expandingtheiroperational capabilities.
3.3 Formal Framework Integration
Power dynamics within and between agents can be formalized by addressing various dimensions of control,
influence,andsynchronization. Attheindividuallevel,recallthatempowerment quantifiesanagent’spotential
influenceoveritsenvironmentbyassessingthemutualinformationbetweentheagent’sactionsandtheresulting

Insocialcontexts,freeenergyisexpandedtoincorporatedeonticvalue,whichreflectstheinfluenceofsocial
norms and expectations on behavior. This is formalized as:
P(π|o)∝exp(−G(π)+D(π,o)),
where G(π) represents expected free energy for a policy π, and D(π,o) is the deontic value associated
withaligningactionswithsocialnormsandexpectations[Constant et al.,2019]. Socialnormsmodulatepolicy
selection, encouraging behavior that is goal-oriented and aligned with collective expectations. This deontic
value may also be linked to a particular kind of empowerment of other agents. Consider that to another
agent, one’s own actions may be viewed as part of the external state that is being predicted and controlled.
Therefore,theempowermentofotheragentsincludestheirinfluenceonone’sownpolicy,whichmaybereflected
by the deontic value term above. A deeper investigation into how the two are precisely related is beyond the
scope of this paper, but would shed light on the relationship between social norms and individual/collective
empowerment.
Beyondcontroloverotheragents’policies,agentsmayalsoexertinfluenceoverothers’beliefs,constituting
another aspect of empowerment which focuses on viewing other agents’ generative models as states external
tooneself. Inparticular, onephenomenonworth investigatingisthesynchronization ofbeliefs between agents
in social interactions. This can be quantitatively assessed through the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
different agents’ generative models. In thesimple case of two agents i and j, this can be quantifiedas:
D
KL
[Q i(s)kQ j(s)]=E
Qi
[lnQ i(s)−lnQ j(s)],
where Q i(s) and Q j(s) denote the belief distributions of agents i and j over the hidden state, respectively.
This quantity reflects the degree of belief alignment, indicating the extent to which a shared understanding
emerges from social interaction. Theways in which thisis unconscious, tacit, orotherwise unexploredare the
elements which lead to manyof theintractable aspects of formalizing these dynamics. This is a consideration
which ought to beexplicitly stated in any modeling attempt.
Belief alignment itselfcanemergefrom reciprocal interactionsgovernedbytheminimization ofvariational
free energy. This may arise as agents select actions consistent with their internal models, and thus produce
outcomes that align with their beliefs, which reciprocally influences the beliefs of their counterparts. Over
successiveinteractions,theminimizationofexpectedfreeenergycanleadtosynchronizedbeliefs(encapsulated
by the KL divergence), by a process of mutually adapting beliefs and behaviors in order to achieve benefits

andincorporatetheseintotheirowngenerativemodels,thusbringingtheirstatesofbeliefintoalignmentwith
each other. This signifies a stable convergence where the beliefs of both agents synchronize, establishing a
shared understanding and a common ground for interaction. There are many ways this synchronization can
occur, with extreme cases being where
lim D [QtkQ0]≪ lim D [QtkQ0],
KL i i KL j j

orviceversa. Intuitively,thesecorrespondtosituationswhereoneagent makesasmall updatetotheirbeliefs
but causes the other to change their beliefs to a greater extent to fit their own. The agent who makes the
significantly smaller updatemay do so as a result of being in a position of greater social power.
17In adversarial or mixed-motive settings, this synchronization need not occur, e.g., in situations where an agent is
beingdeceivedormanipulatedbyanother.
12
Linking this idea back to empowerment, notice that defining “external states” is more complicated in
social contexts, because one agent’s internal state is another agent’s external state, and vice versa. This
means that different agents’ internal representations of the world must be similar in some parts (those that
are external to all of them) and different in other parts. Therefore, part of what it means for an agent to
maximize their empowerment in a social context is to actively make parts of other agents more predictable
and useful to themselves, which is often more easily achieved by bringing other agents’ generative models in
line with one’s own. In general, belief alignment can emerge as a natural consequenceof each agent’s driveto

of understandingnot just when thissynchronization occurs, butalso how it does so. As we conceptualized it,
power isan agent’s capacity toshape and control the(semantic) “attractors” within a social or informational
landscape. These attractors represent stable states or patterns that agents are drawn towards, which reduce
uncertainty and create predictable social structures. Power enables agents to influence which states become
salient or preferred for others, thereby controlling the flow of attention, shaping beliefs, and modulating the
precisionofpredictions. The20thand21stcenturyhaveshown,timeandtimeagain—especially sointhelast

An agent with power has the capacity to shape these expected outcomes by adjusting the social or infor-
mational environment in a way that amplifies certain states while suppressing others. For example, powerful
agents may create narratives, i.e., scripts, that reduce the dimensionality of the state space by establishing
strong, predictable attractors—such as social norms or shared narratives. By doing so, they effectively direct
attention and ensurethat otheragents align their actions with thesepreferred states.

Inleader-followerdynamics,aleaderminimizesthisdivergencebyexertingcontroloverprecision,amplifying
others’ confidence in specific interpretations of their sensory data. For example, if the leader’s goal is clearly
defined and they select social epistemic actions (more informative, albeit less efficient actions), they convey
their intentions early and reduce uncertainty for followers [Maisto et al., 2024]. This approach encourages
other agents to update their beliefs to align with the leader’s, effectively lowering KL divergence across the
group. Even in cases where leadership is not predefined, an agent can assume a leadership role by adjusting

of, e.g., policy and governance are vast. Coordination dynamics at the level of simple perception-action
cycles such as the ones analyzed in [Maisto et al., 2024], need to be framed in terms of their possibilities for
novel understandings of social change processes: how should humanity—as one, as many—develop strategies
with enough coherence and plasticity so as to resist the oppressive aspects of dominant narratives which do
not benefit the coordination of the whole? What kinds of timeframes are we thinking about (in terms of
generations, or the reorganization of our understanding of future time altogether)? Leader-based top-down
control ‘works’ when established cooperation dynamics are already in place, and the same can be said about
distributedcontrol(eitheraspresentedbyasocially-positivecybernetics(e.g.,Beer)or“freemarket”,invisible
hand narratives).
A starting point for the analysis of such multi-agent interactions may be from the point of view of game
theory. In particular, the concept of Free-Energy Equilibria (FEE) captures the notion of a joint policy in
which all agents in a given interaction are minimizing their (Expected) Free Energy [Hyland et al.]. Under
certainconditions,it maybeexpectedthatinteractionsbetweenagentstendtodrivethesystemtowardFEE.
However, as is well understood in game theory, there are typically many equilibria of a game and depending
on the starting point and interaction/learning dynamics, the system may converge to undesirable equilibria

desirable, and then to understand how incentive landscapes may be shaped to navigate society toward better
equilibria. Shared narratives, where agents are in the know about what is shared, are fundamental here, and
this begins by paying attention to the (possible) rules in place, hence the need for formal methods. This is

arguments.
4 Conclusion
Attentional power dynamics shape the probability landscape of future possibilities. Our proposal to address
possibilistic power, grounded in AIF, offers ways to identify and address power imbalances. These formal-
izations can have significant impact for understanding power dynamics in an increasingly information-driven
world. The transition from material to informational forms of power presents plenty of questions and oppor-
tunitiesforpossibleframingsoffuturesocial dynamics. ThispaperexaminedhowAIFcanshedlightonthese
shifts, suggesting that (possibilistic) power operates through mechanisms of social association, through the
identification of and attention-pooling towards (apparently!) influential agents, as well as through enhanced
computing-projective capabilities. Both these phenomena create self-reinforcing cycles, where empowered
agents can expand their state space (and, often, minimize cost and future vulnerability). What has been
previously framed in terms of territorial, material and cultural power can now also be understood in terms
of informational and computational power, both of these have received attention as forms of capital; a term
we can therefore reframe as possibilistic power. This new understanding links the cognitive foundations of
narrative engagement and theensuing social scripts which makeor break power relations.
Theontoepistemicchallengesingrounding(deontic)valuecanbeunderstoodunderAIFinwaysthatopen
up complex semantics and social coordination towards a possible naturalization of these phenomena. Not in
anefforttoreducethemtosimplistic images, ratherinanefforttoprovidenewentriesintoaswell aspossible
accountability metrics of thorny ethical landscapes. In our proposal, coordinated behaviors emerge as shared
models thatreducecollective uncertainty (again: with thecaveat that whateveris supposedto be“shared” is
not always given nor understood). When scripts become internalized by multiple members of a community,
this allows for the collective construction of future states. Following those who appear to have the potential
to reduce our uncertainty, leads to agents associating with agents and actions that would seem to meet those
expectations. Metacognitive criticality, that is: not just playing the game (or being played) but knowing
the rules and being able to imagine new rules, is how we ought to collectively navigate uncertainty,assuming
alreadygivenasymmetries. Futureresearchcouldfocusondevelopingmetricsformeasuringpossibilisticpower
and designing interventions to promote equitabledistribution of both material and informational resources.
This shift from territorial/material to informational/computational power requires special attention in
futurological contexts. We propose that AIF provides crucial theoretical tools for making power structures
visible and therefore analyzable, allowing for the potential to rethink current social asymmetries. Given
the apparent transition between the organization of life around the centrality of physical work and matter,
towardsacentralityofattentionandinformation, asustainablesocialfuturerequiresaddressingbothresource
and information distributions. The latter is best analyzed through the power of attention as a major factor
influencingsocial dynamics.
Hierarchies are inevitable in complex thermodynamic systems. We propose fostering transparent, plastic
hierarchies that remain contestable and therefore open to novelty. This approach acknowledges historic and
thermodynamicconstraints,whileacknowledgingspaceforsystemicevolution. Whilehierarchiesareinevitable,
