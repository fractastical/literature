Bio-Inspired Artificial Neural Networks based on Predictive
Coding

*Equal contributions
Backpropagation (BP) of errors is currently the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It works by updating the network weights through
gradient descent to minimize the value of a loss function, which represents the mismatch
between the network’s prediction and the desired output. BP relies on the chain rule
from calculus to propa...
