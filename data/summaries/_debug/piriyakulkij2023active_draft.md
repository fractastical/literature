### OverviewThis paper investigates active preference inference using language models and probabilistic reasoning. The authors propose a novel algorithm to quickly infer user preferences by asking informative questions, addressing the inefficiency of existing methods. The core idea is to minimize the number of user interactions while maximizing the amount of information gained. The research demonstrates improved performance compared to baseline models in a simplified web shopping setting.### MethodologyThe authors introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. The algorithm utilizes a probabilistic model, where conditional distributions are defined by prompting an LLM. The algorithm samples a finite set of questions from the LLM and chooses the one that maximizes expected entropy and expected model change. Specifically, the model is defined as p(x,q,a) = p(a|x,q)p(x)p(q), where p(x|q,a)∝p(a|x,q)p(x). The algorithm uses a binary reward function, assuming the target product is retrieved with a reward of1, and0 otherwise. The key objective is to minimize the expected entropy of the model given the questions and answers.### ResultsIn a simplified web shopping setting with150 tasks, the authors demonstrate that an LLM equipped with their entropy reduction algorithm outperforms both vanilla instruction-tuned LLM and ReAct LLM while using fewer questions.The algorithm significantly reduces the number of questions needed to infer the target product.Specifically, after three questions, the entropy reduction LLM was able to determine the target product, while the vanilla LLM required five questions. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the efficiency of active preference inference.### Claims and Supporting Evidence*"Toenablethisabilityforinstruction-tunedlargelanguagemodels(LLMs), one maypromptthemtoaskusersquestionstoinfertheirpreferences,transformingthelanguagemodelsintomorerobust,interactivesystems."
