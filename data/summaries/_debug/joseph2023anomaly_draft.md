### Anomaly Detection via Learning-Based Sequential Controlled Sensing### OverviewThis paper investigates the problem of detecting anomalies among a given set of binary processes using a learning-based sequential controlled sensing framework. The authors propose a novel approach that combines Bayesian log-likelihood ratio (LLR) based reward functions with entropy-based reward functions to design a sequential selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time instant, minimizing the delay in decision-making and the total sensing cost. The authors present two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, a deep Q-learning algorithm and an actor-critic algorithm, and an active inference algorithm, and demonstrate their efficacy through numerical experiments.### MethodologyThe authors formulate the anomaly detection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). They define the posterior belief vector on the conditions of the processes as the state of the MDP. The action at each time t is the selection of processes to observe, and the observation at time t is the noisy observation of the processes. The authors use two reward functions: a Bayesian LLR-based reward and an entropy-based reward. The Bayesian LLR-based reward encourages the agent to choose actions that maximize the likelihood of the true hypothesis, while the entropy-based reward encourages the agent to explore the state space and reduce uncertainty. The authors also present two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, a deep Q-learning algorithm and an actor-critic algorithm, and an active inference algorithm. The deep Q-learning algorithm learns the Q-function, which estimates the expected reward of taking a given action in a given state. The actor-critic algorithm learns both the Q-function and the policy function. The active inference algorithm learns the generative probability distribution of the state and action.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate the efficacy of their algorithms through numerical experiments. They show that the algorithms adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes. They also show that the algorithms achieve high detection accuracy, minimize the delay in decision-making, and minimize the total sensing cost. The authors show that the active inference algorithm is more robust to variations in the system parameters and adapts better to statistical dependence among the processes. Further, they observe that as the statistical dependence between the states of the processes increases, the delay in state estimation gets diminished. The authors compare the performance of the three algorithms (deep Q-learning, actor-critic, and active inference) and show that the active inference algorithm achieves the best performance in terms of detection accuracy, delay, and sensing cost. The authors also show that the active inference algorithm is more robust to variations in the system parameters and adapts better to statistical dependence among the processes.### DiscussionThe authors discuss the trade-off between the accuracy and the cost of anomaly detection. They show that the active inference algorithm achieves the best balance between these two factors. They also discuss the limitations of the current approach and suggest future research directions. Specifically, the authors suggest that future research could focus on developing more sophisticated reward functions and exploring different deep learning architectures. The authors also suggest that future research could focus on developing active inference algorithms that can handle more complex state spaces.### ConclusionThis paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection that combines Bayesian LLR-based reward functions with entropy-based reward functions and deep reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate that this approach achieves high detection accuracy, minimizes the delay in decision-making, and minimizes the total sensing cost. The active inference algorithm is more robust to the variations in the system parameters and adapts better to statistical dependence among the processes. The authors conclude that this approach is a promising solution for anomaly detection in a wide range of applications.
