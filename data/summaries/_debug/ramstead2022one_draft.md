### OverviewThis summary critically examines Maxwell J. D. Ramstead’s commentary on “The Markov blanket trick: On the scope of the free energy principle and active inference” by Raja and colleagues (2021). Ramstead argues that while the authors’ main argument is valid, it contains a flawed premise, which undermines their conclusions. He highlights a shift in understanding regarding Markov blankets, supported by subsequent research, particularly Friston and colleagues’ sparse coupling conjecture. The commentary emphasizes the evolving landscape of the free energy principle (FEP) and its implications for understanding complex systems.### MethodologyRamstead’s approach is primarily analytical, scrutinizing the arguments presented in Raja et al. (2021). He systematically deconstructs the authors’ modus tollens argument, identifying a critical flaw in the second premise. He leverages subsequent research, notably Friston et al. (2021) and Sakthivadivel (2022a), to demonstrate the increasing likelihood of systems possessing Markov blankets, even in high-dimensional scenarios. He notes: “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q) and Some interesting systems do not have Markov blankets (¬q) Therefore, those interesting systems must not be describable by the FEP (¬p)” – but he contends that this premise is now demonstrably false.” Specifically, “Recent work undermines the second premise of their modus tollens.” Indeed, Friston et al. (2021) demonstrated, through Sakthivadivel (2022a), that, in the limit of increasing dimensionality, essentially all systems (both linear and nonlinear) will have Markov blankets, in the appropriate sense. He explains that “as both linear and nonlinear systems become increasingly high-dimensional, the probability of finding a Markov blanket between subsets approaches1.” Of note, in this work, the construct of Markov blanket has been weakened to “soft blankets,” which are not entirely sealed off from the outside world. More technically, “this work defines a ‘blanket index,’ which measures the distance between a perfectly blanketed system and a perfectly densely coupled system, such that we have a strict Markov blanket when the blanket index is zero. And we can show that this index tends to zero as systems increase in size.” This formulation of Markov blankets, which allows for a separation of temporal scales and material turnover, may help address issues raised by the authors about meta-stable boundaries of dynamically changing systems, such as candle flames.### ResultsThe core of Ramstead’s argument centers on the challenge to Raja and colleagues’ assertion that the absence of a Markov blanket necessarily precludes the applicability of the FEP. He states: “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q)” – but this is now demonstrably false.” He notes that “recent work undermines the second premise of their modus tollens.” Specifically, Friston et al. (2021) demonstrated, through Sakthivadivel (2022a), that, in the limit of increasing dimensionality, essentially all systems (both linear and nonlinear) will have Markov blankets, in the appropriate sense. He explains that “as both linear and nonlinear systems become increasingly high-dimensional, the probability of finding a Markov blanket between subsets approaches1.” Of note, in this work, the construct of Markov blanket has been weakened to “soft blankets,” which are not entirely sealed off from the outside world. More technically, “this work defines a ‘blanket index,’ which measures the distance between a perfectly blanketed system and a perfectly densely coupled system, such that we have a strict Markov blanket when the blanket index is zero. And we can show that this index tends to zero as systems increase in size.” He further clarifies that “the FEP is dual to the constrained maximum entropy principle (CMEP), which is a cornerstone of contemporary physics (Sakthivadivel,2022b; Ramstead, Sakthivadivel, et al.,2022).”### DiscussionRamstead’s commentary significantly shifts the perspective on the FEP’s applicability. He argues that the original argument’s reliance on a strict requirement for Markov blankets is overly restrictive. “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q)” – but this is now demonstrably false.” He notes that “recent work undermines the second premise of their modus tollens.” Specifically, Friston et al. (2021) demonstrated, through Sakthivadivel (2022a), that, in the limit of increasing dimensionality, essentially all systems (both linear and nonlinear) will have Markov blankets, in the appropriate sense. He further clarifies that “the FEP is dual to the constrained maximum entropy principle (CMEP), which is a cornerstone of contemporary physics (Sakthivadivel,2022b; Ramstead, Sakthivadivel, et al.,2022).”### ConclusionRamstead’s commentary underscores the dynamic nature of the FEP and its ongoing evolution. He concludes that the original argument’s insistence on a strict Markov blanket requirement is now untenable. “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q)” – but this is now demonstrably false.” The development of subsequent research, particularly Friston’s work on sparse coupling, has provided a more nuanced and robust framework for applying the FEP to complex systems. “According to the paper: “If a system is describable by the FEP (p), then it must have a Markov blanket (q)” – but this is now demonstrably false.”
