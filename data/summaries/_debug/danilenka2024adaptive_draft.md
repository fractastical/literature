### Adaptive Active Inference Agents for Heterogeneous and Lifelong Federated Learning – Summary### OverviewThis paper investigates adaptive active inference agents for heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning (FL). The authors address the challenges of adapting to dynamic environments and resource asymmetry within FL systems. They propose a conceptual agent based on the active inference framework, which allows for balancing competing SLOs and adapting to non-IID data distributions. The core idea is to enable systems to autonomously find optimal configurations, without manual intervention. The paper demonstrates the viability of this approach through extensive experiments, highlighting its ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain high SLO fulfillment rates.### MethodologyThe proposed AIF agent utilizes a Bayesian Network (BN) to represent the system's state and predict future observations. The BN is continuously updated based on observed data and the agent’s performance, allowing it to learn the underlying dynamics of the FL environment. The agent employs a free energy principle to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and the actual observations, guiding its actions. The key components include: (1) a generative model that represents the environment, (2) a Bayesian network to represent the relationships between variables, and (3) an optimization algorithm to find configurations that minimize the free energy. The authors use a batch size of256 and a learning rate of0.005 for the training process. The agent is trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The experiments are conducted on a physical testbed consisting of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The data generator is set to a drift of5,000 samples per round.### ResultsThe experiments demonstrate the AIF agent’s ability to adapt to dynamic environments and maintain high SLO fulfillment rates. Specifically, the agent achieved up to98% fulfillment rate under a quantity drift.

The agent’s performance is compared to a baseline approach (Optuna) and shows that the AIF agent is able to achieve similar performance while being more robust to changes in the environment.
