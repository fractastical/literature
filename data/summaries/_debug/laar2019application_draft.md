Okay, here's a summary of the paper, adhering to all the instructions and constraints.**Abstract**This paper investigates the application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to estimation and control problems. It proposes a joint inference and control formulation based on the FEP, which allows for the derivation of optimal control strategies. The core of the approach involves formulating a control law that minimizes the discrepancy between the predicted and actual system behavior. The paper demonstrates that this approach can be used to solve traditional control problems, such as the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem.**Key Findings**The primary finding of this work is that the FEP provides a framework for designing optimal controllers. Specifically, the FEP allows for the derivation of a control law that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual system behavior. The authors demonstrate that this approach can be used to solve the LQG problem, where the goal is to minimize the expected squared cost of the control action.
