### OverviewThis paper investigates Bayesian Active Inference as a framework for intelligent UAV anti-jamming and adaptive trajectory planning. The authors propose a hierarchical approach combining expert demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and real-time feedback from the wireless signal. The core idea is to enable the UAV to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory without prior knowledge of jammer locations. The research aims to overcome the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods, which can be slow to converge and require substantial training data.### MethodologyThe authors present a novel scheme for UAV trajectory design based on Bayesian Active Inference. The system consists of a single UAV, a control base station, a set of ground regions, and a set of ground-based jammers. The UAV operates at a fixed altitude within a square area, and the target regions are randomly located. The wireless channel between the UAV and the CBS is modeled as a ground-to-air link, incorporating both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) components. Jammers are randomly positioned on the ground and interfere with the UAV’s reception when it enters their effective range. The received jamming power from jammer j is given by: p j |d ju |−α, where d ju is the distance between jammer j and the UAV. The resulting SINR at the UAV is: Γ = b LoS |d bu |−α, LoS, (1) b NLoS |d |−α, NLoS bu. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize both the total travel distance and exposure to jamming. The authors utilize expert demonstrations to generate training examples, which help develop an efficient UAV trajectory for specific missions, both in the presence and absence of jamming. They construct a world model that encodes the expert’s adopted strategy for tackling these training examples and how the expert interacted with the environment to avoid jamming. During testing, the UAV employs autonomous decision-making, enabling it to select an appropriate plan for the current mission, adapt to new situations not encountered during training, and effectively navigate critical challenges such as jamming. The key contribution of their work is the use of an optimizer derived from demonstration results to learn the world model. This approach minimizes unnecessary exploration and enhances efficiency, thus leveraging the model’s contextual capabilities.### ResultsThe authors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the UAV can successfully complete missions under jamming conditions with minimal deviation from the expert trajectory. The Bayesian Active Inference framework is able to adapt to new jamming scenarios without requiring extensive retraining. The system’s ability to anticipate interference and localize jammers contributes to its robust performance. The authors report that the proposed method maintains low interference levels and accurate jammer localization. The system’s ability to adapt to new jamming scenarios without requiring extensive retraining is a key advantage. The results confirm that the Bayesian Active Inference framework is a viable alternative to traditional reinforcement learning methods for anti-jamming trajectory design. The authors quantify the performance improvement by stating that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines.### DiscussionThe authors highlight the advantages of Bayesian Active Inference over conventional reinforcement learning approaches. The framework’s ability to incorporate expert knowledge, reason over actions and sensory outcomes, and adapt to uncertain environments makes it particularly well-suited for anti-jamming applications. The use of a hierarchical world model enables the UAV to efficiently learn and represent complex mission objectives. The system’s robustness to jamming is attributed to its ability to anticipate interference and dynamically adjust its trajectory. The authors emphasize that the Bayesian Active Inference framework offers a comprehensive solution for intelligent UAV anti-jamming and adaptive trajectory planning. The use of an optimizer derived from demonstration results minimizes unnecessary exploration and enhances efficiency, thus leveraging the model’s contextual capabilities. The system’s ability to maintain low interference levels and accurate jammer localization is a key advantage.
