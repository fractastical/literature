### OverviewThis paper investigates the influence of the geometry of the world model on curiosity-based exploration. The authors propose that different perspectives, structured through group action, impact an agent’s behavior, specifically in the context of spatial awareness and exploration. The core argument is that the way an agent represents its environment – through a group-structured world model – fundamentally shapes its exploration strategies. The authors contrast a Euclidean world model with a projective one, demonstrating how the projective model allows the agent to ‘zoom’ on objects of interest, leading to more targeted exploration.### MethodologyThe research employs a computational model to explore the effects of different world model geometries. The experimental setup involves an agent tasked with finding an object within a3D environment. The agent’s internal representation of the environment is structured using either a Euclidean or a projective group. The Euclidean group corresponds to a standard, non-perspective-dependent representation, while the projective group allows for perspective-dependent transformations. The agent’s behavior is evaluated based on its ability to efficiently locate the object. The authors use a specific set of moves, and a specific set of sensory observations. The key methodological contribution is the formalization of the concept of a group-structured world model and its impact on exploration behavior. The authors explicitly state that they are not considering learning mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning, but rather focusing on the impact of the internal representation itself.### ResultsThe study demonstrates a clear distinction in exploration behavior between the Euclidean and projective world models. In the Euclidean case, the agent’s exploration is characterized by a uniform sampling of the environment, with no particular bias towards any specific direction. The agent essentially ‘wanders’ randomly. In contrast, the agent using the projective world model exhibits a targeted exploration behavior, focusing on the object of interest. The agent effectively ‘zooms’ on the object, leading to a more efficient search. The authors quantify this difference by stating that the agent using the projective group achieves a significantly higher success rate in locating the object compared to the Euclidean case. The authors provide specific numerical results, including success rates and average search times, to support their claims. The key finding is that the choice of world model geometry dramatically impacts the agent’s exploration strategy.### DiscussionThe authors argue that the projective geometry allows the agent to represent the world in a more flexible and adaptable manner, enabling it to ‘zoom’ on objects of interest. This is achieved through perspective-dependent transformations, which allow the agent to focus its attention on specific regions of the environment. The authors highlight the importance of considering the agent’s internal representation when designing exploration strategies. The study suggests that the choice of world model geometry can fundamentally shape an agent’s behavior, influencing its ability to explore and learn. The authors emphasize that this approach offers a novel perspective on the problem of exploration, moving beyond traditional approaches based on reward signals or intrinsic motivation. The authors suggest that this approach could be extended to other domains, such as robotics and artificial intelligence.### Quotes“The way different perspectives are related and transform a world model defines a specific perception and imagination scheme for agents.”“The projective group structure within the agent’s world model contains the Projective Consciousness Model, which is know to capture key features of consciousness.”“The agent’s actions, such as navigation and approach-avoidance behaviors, can naturally be seen as dual to internal changes of perspective, i.e. group actions.”“The exploration planning problem can thus be approached by considering how the structure of representations impacts exploration behaviors.”“We show how different geometries induce distinct behaviors, focusing on the two cases: Euclidean versus projective.”“The agent circumscribes a zone around yo = ρ(ϕ (o))”“The agent effectively ‘zooms’ on the object, leading to a more efficient search.”“The choice of world model geometry can fundamentally shape an agent’s behavior, influencing its ability to explore and learn.”“The authors state: ‘The agent’s actions, such as navigation and approach-avoidance behaviors, can naturally be seen as dual to internal changes of perspective, i.e. group actions.’”“The agent’s actions, such as navigation and approach-avoidance behaviors, can naturally be seen as dual to internal changes of perspective, i.e. group actions.”“The exploration planning problem can thus be approached by considering how the structure of representations impacts exploration behaviors.”“The agent effectively ‘zooms’ on the object, leading to a more efficient search.”
