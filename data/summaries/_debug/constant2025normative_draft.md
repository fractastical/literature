### OverviewThis paper investigates the application of active inference (AIF) as a computational and economic legal analytic approach to AI governance. Grounded in the active inference framework (AIF) and informed by economic legal analysis (ELA), the model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a mechanism for “agent” governance in AI systems – specifically, the self-regulation of AI agents rather than human oversight within the AI industry. The core of this paper presents a numerical proof of principle, demonstrating how AIF can generate behavior conforming to normative expectations, particularly in the scenario of a self-driving car balancing the legal requirements of yielding the right of way to an emergency vehicle.### MethodologyThe methodology employed centers on building a computational model based on the AIF framework, informed by ELA. This approach seeks to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a mechanism for “agent” governance in AI systems – specifically, the self-regulation of AI agents. The model incorporates three state factors (F1, F2, and F3) and four observation modalities (M1, M2, M3, and M4). The parameters of the model are set to reflect the interplay between these factors, allowing the agent to respond to and adapt to changing circumstances. The model is implemented using the DEM_Law and SPM_MDP_VB_XXX functions, enabling the simulation of the scenario.### ResultsThe simulation demonstrates that the AIF model can generate behavior that aligns with normative expectations. Specifically, the agent consistently performs the action of crossing the road when the line is dashed, reflecting the legal requirement to yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle. The model’s performance is characterized by a shift in confidence, indicated by the change in gamma, when encountering a situation requiring compliance with emergency regulations. The results highlight the model’s ability to generate behavior that conforms to normative expectations, demonstrating the potential of AIF for governing AI systems.### DiscussionThe goal of this paper was to demonstrate how AIF can generate behavior that aligns with normative expectations, specifically in a situation where there is a conflict of norms and where more sophisticated legal decision-making is required. We have established the construct validity of context dependent preferences.
