The core objective is to optimize stream processing services running on resource-constrained edge devices. The research focuses on developing a system that can dynamically adjust its operations to meet service level objectives (SLOs). The work demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, providing a practical example of AIF in action.The paper’s central contribution is the implementation of an AIF agent for stream processing, leveraging generative models to achieve this. The agent uses AIF, a behavioral framework from neuroscience, to dynamically adjust its operations to meet service level objectives (SLOs). The agent uses causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions affect SLOs. The system achieves this by continuously monitoring and adjusting its parameters to optimize performance. The authors demonstrate that the agent can converge to an optimal configuration within approximately30 iterations.Specifically, the research addresses the following key aspects:***Dynamic Adjustment of Parameters:** The system continuously adjusts its parameters to optimize performance and meet SLOs.***Causal Modeling:** The system uses causal models to understand the relationship between its actions and the fulfillment of SLOs.***Adaptive Learning:** The system learns and adapts to changing conditions, ensuring continued optimal performance.The paper’s key findings highlight the potential of AIF for adaptive control in resource-constrained environments. The results demonstrate that AIF can effectively manage complex systems and achieve desired outcomes. The research provides a practical demonstration of AIF’s capabilities and opens up possibilities for future applications in areas such as IoT and edge computing.The paper’s methodology involves the development of an AIF agent that utilizes generative models to achieve adaptive stream processing.
