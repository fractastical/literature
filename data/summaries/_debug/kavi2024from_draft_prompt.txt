Abstract
The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles
with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel "thoughtseed"
framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of
self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called "thoughtseeds" within the Global
Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary
theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of
cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains
(KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay,
mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the
emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception,
action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete
for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping
conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework

grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed
dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. The
thoughtseed framework offers a promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded
model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied
cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, with potential applications
in understanding consciousness, attention, and decision-making.
1. Introduction
Embodied Cognition: An Evolutionary and Free Energy
Perspective
Survival depends not only on adaptation but also on the ability of living systems to
actively shape their environments (Futuyma, 2017). Evolutionary mechanisms such as
the Baldwin effect and natural selection explain how learning and environmental
pressures influence evolutionary processes (Baldwin, 1896; Darwin, 1859). Beyond
genetic evolution, modern perspectives recognize the role of epigenetic, behavioral, and
cultural inheritance in shaping living systems and their environments (Jablonka & Lamb,
2005; Boyd & Richerson, 1988). These interactions underscore how living systems
dynamically regulate their relationship with the environment, not just responding to it,
but influencing it through actions and perceptions (Laland et al., 2000; Odling-Smee et
al., 2003). This dynamic, adaptive relationship is central to the concept of embodied
cognition, where understanding emerges through the interaction of the brain, body, and
environment (Varela, Thompson & Rosch, 1991; Noë, 2004).
In line with this view, autopoiesis describes the self-organizing nature of livingsystems
(Maturana & Varela, 1980), allowing them to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state
(NESS) by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings (Friston
& Ao, 2012 ). These systems resist the natural tendency towards disorder (entropy),
exhibit emergent properties (Schrödinger, 1944; Nicolis & Prigogine, 1977) and actively
regulate internal states to ensure persistence. Building on the idea that effective
3
regulation requires an internal model (Conant & Ashby, 1970), the Free Energy Principle
(FEP) provides a unifying framework to explain how living systems adapt by minimizing
surprise or variational free energy (Friston, 2010). Through a process called active
inference, living systems continuously refine their internal models and take actions that
align their predictions with incoming sensory data (Friston et al., 2010; Parr et al., 2022).
The Markov blanket concept, central to the FEP, separates internal states from the
external world, enabling computational autonomy and conditional independence while
mediating interactions with their environment (Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2018).
FEP’s scale-free modeling approach integrates both evolutionary and cognitive
dynamics, offering insights into how adaptive systems emerge and evolve (Friston et al.,
2021, 2024). Furthermore, the Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind (HMM) hypothesis views
the brain as an adaptive control system that minimizes free energy through recursive
interactions between neurocognitive processes, emerging as a result of evolutionary
pressures and self-organization (Badcock et al., 2019).
Neuronal Representations
Efforts to understand the neural basis of cognition have explored representational units
beyond individual neurons, such as cognits (Fodor, 1983), engrams (Josselyn &
Tonegawa, 2020) and cell assemblies (Hebb, 1949). Furthermore, recent research
suggests that cognitive processes may operate in a discrete manner, with distinct
packets of information or 'cognitive atoms' forming the building blocks of thought and
consciousness (Dehaene, 2014). These discrete units of cognitive processing compete
for access to a global workspace, where they can be broadcast across the brain to
generate a unified and coherent conscious experience (Dehaene et al., 2011, 2003).
The Neuronal Packet Hypothesis (NPH) (Yufik & Friston, 2016; Palacios et al., 2020;
Ramstead et al., 2021)positsthatneuronalpackets(NPs),self-organizingensemblesof
neurons, serve as the fundamental units of neuronal representation in the brain (Yufik,
2019). Superordinate ensembles (SEs) emerge from the coordinated activity of multiple
NPs, enabling the representation of complex and abstract concepts. Through their
interactions and emitted signals, NPs allow the system to infer probabilistic beliefs about
4
external states, continuously updating these beliefs to minimize free energy (Ramstead
et al., 2021).
Each NP and SE possesses its own Markov blanket, which defines its boundaries and
interactions. The Markov blankets of lower-level NPs are nested within those of
higher-level SEs, integrating information through a shared generative model (Palacios
et al., 2020). This hierarchical structure facilitates the brain's ability to represent
knowledge across multiple scales, from sensory details to abstract categories. Nested
SEs interact via reciprocal message passing, where top-down predictions from
higher-level SEs modulate lower-level SEs and NPs, while bottom-up sensory evidence
or prediction errors update higher-level representations. This continuous exchange of
information supports adaptive behavior in response to a changing environment
(Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2021). The FEP also has
implications for the nature of representation itself,suggesting that the content of neural
representations lies in their role in guiding action and minimizing surprise (Ramstead et
al., 2020, 2023).
NPH lays a robust foundation for exploring several key questions: How do evolutionary
pressures shape the emergence and organization of neuronal packets and their
hierarchical ensembles? How do individual experiences interact with inherited
predispositions to refine and adapt these representations? How do these
representational units collaborate within a network to generate complex cognition and
adaptive behavior?

The Thoughtseed Hypothesis
A fundamental challenge in elucidating the neural basis of cognition lies in the inherent
opacity of the Markov blanket, that can be referred to as a "black box" problem. While
6
this statistical construct offers a robust framework for modeling the exchange of
information between an agent and its environment, it inherently obscures the internal
generative model responsible for behavior (Friston 2010, 2020).
To address these challenges, we propose the "thoughtseed" framework, which builds
upon the concept of neuronal packets (NPs) and the neuronal packet hypothesis (NPH).
This framework integrates insights from the Free Energy Principle (FEP) (Friston 2010,
2021), evolutionary theory, and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) (Baars, 1997;
Dehaene & Naccache, 2001).
The thoughtseed hypothesis posits that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of
self-organizing units of embodied knowledge termed "thoughtseeds." These
thoughtseeds, conceptualized as emergent agents with their own Markov blankets, are
shaped by a hierarchy of evolutionary priors that encompass both inherited
predispositions and learned experiences. The framework proposes a four-level
hierarchical/heterarchical model of the cognitive agent's internal states: Neuronal
Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the Thoughtseed Network (TN),
and meta-cognition.
Each level in this model consists of nested Markov blankets, encoding information about
the world at varying levels of abstraction, with deeper levels representing more
domain-general and abstract knowledge (Fields et al., 2022; Ramstead et al., 2023).
The dynamic interplay within this hierarchy facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as
coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. The framework
emphasizes the embodied nature of cognition, where the living system's interactions
with its Umwelt (von Uexküll, 1934) and the knowledge encoded in the KDs shape the
Thoughtseed Network.
In the following sections, we will elaborate on the architectural foundations of the
thoughtseed framework, exploring the details of NPDs, KDs, and their dynamic interplay
in the emergence of thoughtseeds and the shaping of conscious experience through
nested Markov blankets.

Neuronal Packet Domains
The brain's sparse architecture, characterized by a limited number of active neurons
and low connection density, supports localized functional units for specific cognitive
tasks (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009; Sporns & Betzel, 2016). NPDs are hypothesized to
emerge through self-organizing interconnected NPs. Their hierarchical organization, via
nested Markov blankets, reflects "ascending scales of canonical microcircuits" (Hipólito
et al., 2021; Douglas & Martin, 1991; Mountcastle, 1997), enabling complex
computations from simpler units. This structure facilitates efficient information
8
processing and adaptive behavior (Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Palacios et al., 2020; Friston
et al., 2021).
NPD formation is guided by evolutionary priors that favor adaptive neural architectures
suited for specific functions (Quartz & Sejnowski, 1997). For instance, the visual cortex
has distinct NPDs for color, motion, and form (Zeki, 1993 ; DiCarlo et al., 2012), with
these specializations evolutionarily conserved across mammalian species (Markov et
al., 2014). Hebbian learning further shapes their specific organization, as elaborated in
Section 2.4 and 8.2.
NPs compete for resources by minimizing variational free energy (VFE), resulting in
efficient internal models. This competition, described as "neural Darwinism," produces
specialized NPs, each representing different aspects of the world (Edelman, 1987). The
Markov blanket structure supports this decentralized, modular organization, enhancing
both robustness and adaptability.
NPs dynamically interact to form superordinate ensembles (SEs) within NPDs,
representing higher-order concepts and allowing for greater complexity in cognitive
representations. The hierarchical structure, where the Markov blankets of lower-level
NPs are nested within those of higher-level SEs, enables the brain to encode
knowledge across different scales, from sensory details to abstract categories
(Riesenhuber & Poggio, 2000; Ramstead et al., 2021). SEs may emerge as stable
entities when they accurately predict and explain sensory input (Friston et al., 2021).
The nested SEs interact through reciprocal message passing, facilitating flexible and
adaptive behavior in response to changing environments.
Furthermore, the formation of SEs within NPDs is influenced by the alignment of
knowledge representations through vector rotations. When multiple NPs contribute to a
shared generative model, their encapsulated knowledge representations undergo a
process of alignment through vector rotations (Yufik & Friston, 2016). This rotation
facilitates the integration of knowledge from different NPs by bringing their vectors
closer together in the knowledge space. The rotation angle is determined based on the
similarity between the generative models of the participating NPs. This alignment
9
process is an integral part of the formation of SEs, ensuring that the constituent NPs
have a coherent and integrated representation of the knowledge relevant to the shared
generative model.

Representation

Within each NPD, NPs serve as the fundamental units of neuronal representation
(Ramstead et al., 2021; Yufik, 2016, 2019). An NP could exist in three states:
● Unmanifested State: Represents a potential configuration of neural activity with
high prior probability under specific conditions, shaped by evolutionary priors. It
can be viewed as a sparsely connected neural ensemble with low precision,
corresponding to a shallow local minimum in the free energy landscape,
indicating low stability and high potential for change.
● Manifested State: Emerges from the unmanifested state upon repeated
exposure to relevant stimuli, leading to a phase transition (Yufik, 2019) and the
formation of a Markov Blanket stabilized by an energy barrier (Yufik, 2019). This
Markov blanket structure may enable local computation and autonomy within the
NP, while maintaining informational boundaries. It is characterized by increased
coherence of neural activity, resulting in a stable state with a core attractor
representing the most probable and stable pattern of neural activity (Friston &
Ao, 2012; Parr & Friston, 2018). This state embodies the NP's core functionality
with high certainty and can be interpreted as the mode of the posterior
distribution over the NP's internal states, given its Markov blanket (Friston et al.,
2021). It corresponds to a deeper local minimum in the free energy landscape,
reflecting high stability and low surprise (Kiebel et al., 2009). The depth of this
global minimum could indicate the NP’s binding energy, reflecting the overall
stability and resistance to change of the core representation (Yufik, 2019).
Alternative attractors represent less dominant patterns of neural activity that
may become active under specific conditions or in response to novel stimuli
(Rabinovich et al., 2008). They can be viewed as shallower local minima in the
free energy landscape, separated from the core attractor by energy barriers.
The existence of alternative attractors, along with the energy barriers that
11
separate them, allows for flexibility and adaptability in the NP's response to
changing inputs.
● Activated (or Spiking) State: A transient state characterized by heightened
neural activity within the manifested NP ensemble, triggered by specific inputs
that resonate with the NP's internal model. The NP generates a response that
may influence the living system's behavior or cognition. This response can be
interpreted as a consequence of the NP's internal dynamics and its attempt to
minimize free energy, rather than a deliberate or planned action. The active state
can be seen as a temporary shift in the free energy landscape, where the core
attractor becomes even more pronounced.
Knowledge Domains (KDs)
Knowledge Domains (KDs) can be conceptualized as large-scale, organized structures
within the brain’s internal model, akin to knowledge graphs (Hogan et al., 2021). They
serve as nested levels of "knowledge repositories" that provide the conceptual
scaffolding for interpreting sensory information and generating the content of
consciousness within the Global Workspace. KDs encompass not only sensory
representations but also retrieved memories, beliefs, experiences, policies, emotions,
and learned patterns.
KDs are hypothesized to exhibit both hierarchical and heterarchical structures, enabling
flexible and context-dependent knowledge retrieval for adaptive behavior (Pessoa,
2014). The hierarchical aspect reflects the layered organization of knowledge, ranging
from concrete to abstract (Friston, 2008; Hipólito et al., 2021; Zamora-López et a.,
2011), while the heterarchical aspect captures the interconnectedness and
cross-domain interactions among different KDs (Yufik, 2019).
NPDs function as specialized units that process specific information and project it into
the Global Workspace. In contrast, KDs interpret and contextualize this raw data within
the brain’s neural architecture. The formation and adaptation of KDs are influenced by
evolutionary priors, which provide a foundational structure for their development, as
12
illustrated in Figure 3. Continuous learning throughout the lifespan further refines KDs
(Spelke & Kinzler, 2007).
KDs possess an intrinsic affective dimension, reflecting the emotional valence and
arousal associated with their content (Patisappu et al., 2024). This dimension is crucial
for shaping subjective experiences and influencing behavior and decision-making
processes (Sladky et al., 2021; Solms, 2021). However, KDs representing purely
abstract concepts, such as mathematical or grammatical rules, may lack this affective
component.
The dynamic and context-dependent binding process within KDs contributes to the
emergence of coherent percepts in the Global Workspace. This process may involve
the synchronization of neural activity across different NPDs (Singer, 1999; Palacios et
al., 2019), the formation of superordinate ensembles encompassing multiple NPs, and
the modulation of attentional mechanisms to prioritize relevant information. Enhanced
firing rates in specific neurons may facilitate this binding across NPDs (Roelfsema,
2023). This process is further supported by reciprocal message passing and attentional
selection, reflecting “circular causality” within the FEP, where different levels of the
hierarchy mutually influence one another through prediction and error correction (Friston
& Kiebel, 2009).
A contrived illustration of potential brain areas, having a greater influence on KDs might
include:
● The hippocampus, serving as a central hub for a "memory" KD, integrating
information to create episodic and semantic memories (Squire et al., 2015;
Eichenbaum, 2017).
● The amygdala, associated with an "emotion" KD, linking sensory information with
affective responses (LeDoux & Brown, 2017; Phelps & LeDoux, 2005).
● The prefrontal cortex, acting as a central hub for multiple KDs related to
executive functions and goal-directed behavior (Miller & Cohen, 2001; Fuster,
2015).
13
The thoughtseed framework offers a biologically grounded model of cognition within the
broader context of mortal computation (Ororbia & Friston, 2023), elucidating how
cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interplay of neuronal packets, knowledge
domains, and higher-order structures. An illustrative example of the Visual Object
Recognition KD is provided in Supplementary Section 9.

static illustration of the relationship between NPDs and KDs at a given time snapshot, highlighting their
roles in the thoughtseed framework. KDs: The four distinct colors represent different KDs, each

KDs, formed as superordinate ensembles of NPDs, integrating information from specific functional units

3. Thoughtseeds Network and Meta-cognition
Formal Definition of a Thoughtseed
The thoughtseed framework posits that thoughtseeds are self-organizing, higher-order
cognitive constructs that emerge from the coordinated activity of distributed neural
networks, aligning with research on large-scale brain networks and the Global
Workspace Theory of consciousness (GWT) (Mashour et al., 2020).
Thoughtseeds can be understood as transient units within this global workspace,
representing temporary coalitions of neural activity that form, compete, and dissolve as
the individual interacts with the world. These dynamic patterns of neuronal activity can
be interpreted as metastable states within the brain's pullback attractor landscape
(Friston, 2010; Friston & Ao, 2012; Friston, Sengupta, & Auletta, 2014).
The content and structure of thoughtseeds emerge from the knowledge and beliefs
embedded within Knowledge Domains (KDs), reflecting the living system's evolutionary
history and individual experiences. The dynamic interplay between thoughtseeds and
KDs shapes cognition, behavior, and conscious experience.
Key Characteristics of Thoughtseeds:
● Sub-Agents: Thoughtseeds act as autonomous sub-agents within the cognitive
system, engaging in active inference to generate predictions, influence actions,
and update internal models based on sensory feedback (Seth, 2015). This
agency allows them to explore the environment and develop affordances.
15
● Pullback Attractor Dynamics: When active, thoughtseeds function as pullback
attractors (Friston & Ao, 2012; Haken, 1983), integrating information from
multiple KDs to form coherent representations. This establishes a transient
Markov blanket, maintaining autonomy and computational independence. Each
thoughtseed is associated with a core attractor, representing its most probable
and stable pattern of neural activity, and may also have subordinate attractors,
offering flexibility and adaptability.
● Goal-Directed Behavior: Thoughtseeds are inherently goal-directed, driven by
the imperative to minimize EFE (Parr & Friston, 2019). They anticipate action
consequences and select those that minimize EFE. The interaction between
thoughtseeds and KDs results in affordances—potential actions within the
environment (Gibson, 1977). These affordances can be categorized as epistemic
(opportunities for learning or exploration) and pragmatic (opportunities for goal
fulfillment or exploitation) (Friston et al., 2015; Friston, 2022).
● Thoughtseed States: Thoughtseeds exist in the following states: unmanifested,
manifested (inactive, active, dominant), and dissipated.
○ Unmanifested: The thoughtseed exists as a potential configuration within
the neural network, latent within interconnected knowledge domains,
primed by prior experiences and learning. It is not yet actively influencing
cognition or behavior.
○ Manifested: The thoughtseed has emerged and is now part of the
cognitive landscape, with the potential to influence thought and action.
This state is further divided into the following sub-states:
■ Inactive: The thoughtseed is present but not currently contributing
to conscious experience. It resides in the background, with its core
attractor and associated dynamics intact, potentially primed for
activation.
■ Active: The thoughtseed is in the "active thoughtseed pool" and
contributes to the content of consciousness, competing with other
active thoughtseeds for dominance.
16
■ Dominant: The dominant thoughtseed is selected through an
ongoing process of cumulative EFE minimization, where
thoughtseeds within the active thoughtseeds pool compete in a
winner-take-all dynamic. The thoughtseed that minimizes
cumulative EFE over time gains dominance, enters the Global
Workspace, and shapes the unitary conscious experience. This
process ensures that the most relevant, predictive, and adaptive
thoughtseed guides cognition and action.
○ Dissipated: The thoughtseed has lost its influence and its core attractor
has become significantly weakened or dissolved. It no longer contributes
to the active thoughtseed pool and its constituent elements may be
reabsorbed into the broader neural network or contribute to the formation
of new thoughtseeds.
Formal Definition: A "thoughtseed" is a higher-order, transient, Markov-blanketed unit
with agency that emerges from the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles across
different knowledge domains (KDs). It is characterized by a core attractor and
subordinate attractors that shape its content and dynamics. Thoughtseeds exhibit a
repetitive behavior, revisiting the brain's cognitive landscape even when not explicitly
required, contributing to phenomena such as mind-wandering. Through continuous
competition with other thoughtseeds via EFE minimization, a dominant thoughtseed
emerges, enters the Global Workspace, and contributes to the unitary conscious
experience, enabling active exploration of the environment and the development of
affordances.
An illustrative example of a "dog thoughtseed" is shown in Supplementary Section 9.
Thoughtseeds and the Global Workspace
The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) proposes that consciousness arises from a
"global workspace" – a central information exchange hub within the brain (Baars, 1997;
Dehaene & Changeux, 2011). This workspace facilitates communication and integration
17
among specialized, modular processing units. Within the thoughtseed framework,
Knowledge Domains (KDs) can be conceptualized as these specialized modules, each
encapsulating a specific domain of knowledge or expertise. These KDs operate in
parallel, processing their respective inputs until a selection process determines which
information will enter the global workspace for conscious access.
Thoughtseeds as Information Processors
Thoughtseeds, in turn, act as the information processors within this GWT framework.
They dynamically integrate information from multiple KDs, forming transient coalitions of
neural activity that compete for access to the Global Workspace. Each thoughtseed,
with its associated core and subordinate attractors, represents a candidate for
conscious access, vying to shape the contents of awareness. These attractors can be
seen as metastable states, aligning with the brain's pullback attractor dynamics (Friston
& Ao, 2012).
Competition for Dominance
Thoughtseeds compete in a winner-take-all dynamic, where the one that minimizes
cumulative expected free energy (EFE)—balancing both epistemic (uncertainty
reduction) and pragmatic (goal achievement) considerations (Parr & Friston,
2019)—gains access to the Global Workspace. This process is akin to the "ignition" of a
neural assembly (Dehaene & Changeux, 2011), in which a critical threshold of neural
activity is reached, leading to a self-sustaining pattern of activation.
Once a thoughtseed becomes dominant, it triggers a shift in global brain activity,
reflecting a change in the content of consciousness. This mechanism aligns with the
theory of discrete conscious states, where consciousness is seen as a sequence of
transient attractor states that emerge through coordinated neural activity (Deco et al.,
2013; Dehaene et al., 2003). The winning thoughtseed, after gaining access to the
Global Workspace, enables the "broadcast" of its content across the cognitive system,
influencing processes such as attention, decision-making, and motor planning,
facilitating adaptive behavior (Dehaene, 2014; Deco et al., 2015).
18
In this way, the global workspace functions as a "broadcasting platform", while KDs act
as the "sources" of specialized knowledge, and thoughtseeds serve as the "processors"
that dynamically integrate this knowledge to form the content of consciousness
(Mashour et al., 2020). Through this mechanism, thoughtseeds shape both perception
and action, allowing the cognitive system to respond flexibly to changing environmental
demands.
The Unitary Nature of Conscious Experience
The unitary nature of conscious experience, the subjective feeling of a single, coherent
stream of consciousness, emerges from the dominance of a single thoughtseed at any
given moment. This dominance reflects the winner-take-all dynamic inherent in the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT), ensuring that only one thoughtseed broadcasts its
content globally, while other competing thoughtseeds remain inactive or latent. This
continuous competition maintains the coherence and integration of conscious
experience, preventing fragmented or conflicting streams of awareness from
simultaneously entering the workspace (Dehaene & Naccache, 2001).
Thus, thoughtseeds do not merely compete for access to the global workspace but
actively contribute to the unitary and seamless nature of conscious experience. Once a
thoughtseed gains dominance, it effectively "controls" the global workspace, shaping the
current content of consciousness and guiding future actions and decisions. This
guidance is achieved through policy selection that balances epistemic (learning) and
pragmatic (goal-driven) affordances (Friston et al., 2015).
This cyclical process—of competition, selection, and dominance—underpins the
seamless flow of conscious experience, aligning with the brain's overarching goal of
minimizing surprise and maximizing adaptive efficiency through active inference.
Meta-Cognition and Agency in Thoughtseed Dynamics
Meta-cognition refers to the ability to monitor, evaluate, and regulate one's own
cognitive processes. In the context of thoughtseeds and the Global Workspace Theory
19
(GWT), meta-cognition plays a crucial role in the orchestration of thoughtseed
dynamics, influencing which thoughtseed is selected as dominant and how it interacts
with broader agent-level goals and policies (Desimone & Duncan, 1995). This aligns
with Dehaene's conscious access hypothesis, which posits that conscious access to
information is a selective process mediated by prefrontal cortex activity (Dehaene &
Naccache, 2001).
Meta-Cognitive Regulation of Thoughtseeds
Meta-cognitive processes, potentially implemented by higher-order thoughtseeds, help
modulate the activation and competition among lower-level thoughtseeds by
dynamically adjusting attention, prediction, and error signals. These higher-order
thoughtseeds can be seen as "observers" or "regulators" within the cognitive system,
evaluating the relevance and coherence of lower-level thoughtseeds and influencing
their access to the Global Workspace.
Thoughtseeds compete for dominance based on their ability to minimize free energy,
but meta-cognition introduces a higher level of control by shaping attention and prior
expectations. For instance, attentional control can amplify the precision of certain
sensory signals, enhancing the chances of relevant thoughtseeds being selected for
conscious access (Feldman & Friston, 2010). The attentional precision parameter plays
a crucial role in this modulation, affecting how sensitive lower-level thoughtseeds are to
sensory evidence during their free energy minimization process. By adjusting this
parameter, higher-order thoughtseeds can influence which lower-order thoughtseeds
gain prominence in the competition for conscious access. This selection process, in line
with Dehaene's work, contributes to the discrete nature of conscious experience, where
transitions between dominant thoughtseeds correspond to distinct shifts in conscious
content.
Moreover, meta-cognition adjusts the activation threshold that determines which
thoughtseeds enter the active thoughtseed pool, influencing the pool’s composition.
This threshold can vary based on the current cognitive or emotional state. For example,
in states of high arousal or focused attention, the threshold may be lowered, allowing a
20
broader range of thoughtseeds to manifest. Conversely, in states of reduced attentional
control, only highly salient thoughtseeds surpass the threshold (Corbetta & Shulman,
2002). The meta-awareness parameter enriches this process by representing the
higher-order thoughtseed’s awareness of its influence on lower-level thoughtseeds and
attentional focus. This meta-awareness can be modeled as a probabilistic belief about
the degree of opacity in accessing and understanding lower-level thoughtseeds and
their associated Knowledge Domains (KDs). It serves as a metacognitive monitoring
and control mechanism (Metzinger, 2003; Sandved-Smith et al., 2021).
Agency and Goal-Directed Thoughtseed Dynamics
Agency in this context refers to the ability of the cognitive system to act intentionally and
adaptively by selecting the most appropriate thoughtseeds based on its goals.
Thoughtseeds, acting as sub-agents within the larger cognitive architecture, contribute
to the agent’s overarching goals by driving behavior that aligns with the minimization of
long-term surprise or free energy (Seth, 2015).
Higher-level thoughtseeds, representing more abstract or long-term goals, act as the
agents of control that guide the system's overall direction. These thoughtseeds exert a
top-down influence on the selection and competition process, ensuring that the selected
thoughtseed aligns with global goals and the broader objectives of the agent. For
example, a higher-order goal (e.g., finding food) might bias the selection of
thoughtseeds that prioritize related affordances within the environment, such as
detecting food sources or planning routes to them (Friston, 2013).
Policies, Goals, and Affordances at the Agent Level
At the agent level, thoughtseeds help shape the perception of policies (strategies),
goals, and affordances (opportunities for action) within the environment. These
elements guide the living system's adaptive behavior by integrating sensory data with its
internal models of the world. The active inference framework posits that the agent
constantly selects policies that minimize EFE, balancing epistemic affordances
21
(opportunities to reduce uncertainty or gain knowledge) with pragmatic affordances
(opportunities to fulfill goals or needs) (Friston et al., 2015).
In this view, meta-cognition plays a key role in determining which goals are prioritized
and how policies are enacted. As the agent navigates its environment, thoughtseeds
help to represent and update predictions about the most relevant actions and
affordances. This aligns with the notion of a hierarchical policy structure, where
lower-level thoughtseeds handle immediate, task-specific actions, and higher-level
thoughtseeds manage broader, long-term goals and strategies (Pezzulo et al., 2013).
The brain’s ergodic principles ensure that these higher-level goals are regularly
revisited, influencing future behavior and keeping the system aligned with long-term
adaptive objectives (Friston et al., 2021).
An illustrative example of a "dog" thoughtseed is discussed in Supplementary Section
8.5.
4 Illustrative Mathematical Framework
Neuronal Packets and Superordinate Ensembles
State Representation of a NP is represented by its core attractor and
subordinate attractors and their corresponding activation levels and
, ∈ [0, 1]. represents the object/knowledge encapsulated within . its
state ∈ {0: unmanifested, 1: manifested, 2: activated}.

Generative Model of a NP describes how its internal states aids in generating
sensory predictions and potentially, actions . Given the internal model

state . A NP can be further classified as a (sensory, active, or internal) for
additional granularity.
22
(2)
Free Energy Minimization of a NP. Each NP minimizes its free energy , by
balancing two opposing pressures: Complexity and Accuracy.
(3)
where:
● Complexity: This term, represented by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence,
pushes the NP to minimize the complexity of its internal state
representation, . measures the difference between the NP's
approximate posterior distribution, term, and it's true posterior distribution,
term. By minimizing this divergence, the NP seeks the simplest possible internal
state that remains consistent with its sensory inputs, actions, model parameters,
the state of its parent KD, its encapsulated knowledge, and its current activation
state.
● Accuracy: This term, represented by the negative log-likelihood, reflects the
NP's drive to accurately predict its active and sensory states, and . This
involves maximizing the expected log-likelihood of its generative model. By
maximizing this term, the NP strives to generate actions that lead to expected
sensory inputs, minimizing prediction error and surprise. This process is
influenced by the state of its parent KD, its own internal state, its encapsulated
knowledge, and its current activation state.
State Representation of a Superordinate Ensemble (SE) is a functional unit
within a KD that integrates information from multiple NPs. It represents a higher-level
pattern of neural activity that emerges from the coordinated activity of its constituent
NPs.
(4)
23
and represents the set of attractors (core and subordinates) and the
corresponding activation levels of SE . represents the encapsulated knowledge
structure, valence ∈ [-1, 1] (unpleasantness/pleasantness) and arousal ∈
[0, 1] of SE .
Knowledge Domains (KDs)
State Representation of a KD is a collection of SEs that together represent
a broader domain of knowledge or expertise. It acts as a repository for integrated
knowledge shaped by the interactions and relationships between its constituent SEs .
(5)
Generative Model of a KD describes how the KD predicts its active states ,
sensory states , internal state (which includes the states of its constituent SEs),
content of consciousness which is hypothesized to capture the qualia (Chalmers,
1995) or subjective experience associated with the KD's activation, and affective states
(valence and arousal ), given its model parameters and the state of its
parent thoughtseed . It formalizes the KD's internal model of the world and its role
in shaping subjective experience and guiding behavior within the thoughtseed
framework.
(6)
Free Energy Minimization of a KD effectively balances the need for a
parsimonious internal representation with the need for accurate predictions about its
interactions with the world. This process ensures that the KD contributes to adaptive
behavior while maintaining an efficient and coherent representation of its knowledge
domain.
24
(7)
where:
● Complexity: The Complexity term considers how well the KD's internal state
representation explains its actions , sensory inputs , content of
consciousness , valence , arousal , model parameters , and the
state of its parent thoughtseed .
● Accuracy: The Accuracy term considers how well the KD's generative model
predicts its actions, sensory inputs, content of consciousness, valence, and
arousal, given its internal state and the influence of its parent thoughtseed.
● Weighted difference between the predicted and actual valence and arousal
associated with a KD can also be added as shown below:
Thoughtseeds
Thoughtseeds can be conceptualized as information processing units competing for
access to the global workspace, the proposed neural correlate of consciousness.
State Representation of a Thoughtseed is represented by its core attractor
and subordinate attractors and their corresponding activation levels
and , ∈ [0, 1]. represents the encapsulated knowledge structures
within . its state ∈ {0: unmanifested, 1: manifested-inactive, 2: manifested
-active, 3:manifested-dominant, 4:dissipated}. ∈ [-1, 1] (unpleasantness
/pleasantness) and arousal ∈ [0, 1] of .
(8)
25
Activation Level of a Thoughtseed is represented by a weighted combination of
the brain’s current state in the thoughtseed’s core attractor or subordinate
attractors .
(9)
The activation level represents a thoughtseed's "bid" for dominance. The thoughtseed
with the highest activation level is most likely to enter the Global Workspace, shaping
conscious experience.
Generative Model of a Thoughtseed: predicts its own future state ,
encompassing changes in its core attractor, associated knowledge, and emotional tone
while simultaneously generating the content of consciousness .
(10)
This prediction is conditioned upon its current state , the state of the knowledge
domains it draws from, and the valence and arousal associated with
those domains. It also considers sensory input and its salience , perceived
affordances for action , internal model parameters , and policies guiding action
selection . This dual prediction allows the thoughtseed to anticipate its own evolution
and influence on cognition and behavior while actively shaping conscious experience
within the broader cognitive landscape.
Free Energy Minimization of a Thoughtseed is a measure comprising both
complexity and accuracy. The complexity term reflects a thoughtseed's propensity to
reduce uncertainty and surprise, compelling it to actively seek information within the
global workspace. This can be interpreted as an inclination towards acquiring
information from the ongoing broadcast, by predicting its next state and
26
generating the content of consciousness . Conversely, the accuracy term
compels a thoughtseed to maximize the evidence for its internal model, prompting it to
influence the content of the global broadcast. This can be understood as a tendency
towards contributing information to the workspace.
(11)
Active Thoughtseeds Pool
The Thoughtseeds Network comprises numerous manifested thoughtseeds vying for
conscious expression, but only a select few actively contribute to the stream of
consciousness.
(12)
This selection is mediated by a global activation parameter , influenced
by the state of consciousness and arousal levels, serving as a dynamic threshold for
entry into the "active thoughtseed pool." This parameter regulates the "gain" of the
Global Workspace, determining the selectivity and sensitivity of conscious awareness.
This pool , fluctuating within brief intervals, represents the ensemble of
thoughtseeds competing for dominance within the Global Workspace.
Meta-cognition
Dominant Thoughtseed and Content of Consciousness
Selection of the Dominant Thoughtseed: The competition among thoughtseeds in the
active pool follows a winner-take-all dynamic. The thoughtseed that most
effectively minimizes its free energy emerges as the dominant thoughtseed . It gains
27
privileged access to the Global Workspace, broadcasting its information widely and
influencing a broad range of cognitive processes.
(13)
This privileged access allows the dominant thoughtseed to shape conscious
experience, guide attention, and direct action, effectively orchestrating thought and
behavior. This selection process can also be chosen via a cumulative Effective Free
Energy (EFE) minimization. We additionally hypothesize that for long-term or
deliberative planning Generalized Free Energy (GFE) minimization could be a better
candidate for dominant thoughtseed selection.
Unitary Nature of the Content of Consciousness
The content in the Global Workspace at any moment is shaped a single, dominant
thoughtseed reflecting the unitary nature of conscious experience. The identification of
the dominant thoughtseed index is articulated in Eq 13.
(14)
Influence of Higher-order Thoughtseeds on Lower-order
Thoughtseeds
Higher-order thoughtseeds with meta-awareness , exert influence on lower-level
thoughtseeds by modulating their attentional precision . This influence is captured by
Eq 15, with denotes the internal states of competing lower-level
thoughtseeds. encapsulates the set of policies, represents the goals pursued by
the higher-order thoughtseed, conditioned on model parameters , prior beliefs
and the active thoughtseeds in .
(15)
28
Goals, Policies and Affordances at Agent Level
Global Goals: The agent's goals can be described as a function of the
characteristic states within the brain's pullback attractor landscape. These states are
revisited frequently (above a certain threshold ) and demonstrate a level of
stability or persistence . This goal function is represented as:
(16.1)
Global Policies: Once the agent’s goals are established, the selection of appropriate
policies (or action plans) to achieve these goals is guided by the knowledge and beliefs
contained within various Knowledge Domains (KDs), along with the context and
perceived affordances of the environment. The agent-level policies are defined
as a function of the states of all KDs and the agent's global goals:
(16.2)
The functions and encapsulate the complex processes involved in
deriving goals and policies from the interplay of characteristic states, knowledge
domains, and the Agent’s internal dynamics.
Global Affordances: The global affordances at an Agent level are described via
mapping functions and respectively.
(16.3)
(16.4)
While thoughtseed-specific affordances are more context-dependent and tailored to the
individual thoughtseed’s knowledge and goals, global affordances provide a broader
view of the possible actions available to the agent, considering its overarching
objectives and the integrated knowledge across all KDs.
29
Agent-Level Free Energies: GFE, VFE and EFE
Agent-level GFE is calculated as the sum of the current Variational Free Energy (VFE)
and the expected value of the Expected Free Energy (EFE) under the agent’s current
policy. This captures both the current surprise or uncertainty about the agent’s sensory
observations and the anticipated uncertainty related to future potential actions .
(17.1)
Agent-level VFE is calculated as sum of VFEs of active thoughtseeds in
plus other factors contributing to the agent’s overall surprise at that instant.
(17.2)
Agent-level EFE is calculated as the sum of EFEs of active thoughtseeds in
weighted by their respective activation levels . This allows the Agent
to evaluate potential outcomes of different policies, considering both their
epistemic(informational gain) and pragmatic (goal-oriented) values, and select the policy
that minimizes overall surprise.
(17.3)
5. Discussion and Future Directions
Towards a General Theory of Embodied Cognition
The Thoughtseed Framework, building upon the concept of neuronal packets (Yufik,
2013, 2019; Yufik & Friston, 2016; Ramstead et al., 2021) and the and the Free Energy
Principle (FEP) (Friston, 2010), offers a promising foundation for a general theory of
embodied cognition (Allen & Friston, 2018; Foglia & Wilson, 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2024).
Within this framework, thoughtseeds—emergent, higher-order constructs—arise from
30
the coordinated activity across knowledge domains (KDs). These thoughtseeds
represent coherent patterns of neural activity that serve as agentic constructs, driving
action, perception, and cognitive function. This aligns closely with the Global Workspace
Theory (GWT) (Baars, 1997; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011), where thoughtseeds can be
seen as high-salience representations that gain access to the global workspace,
thereby influencing conscious experience. Furthermore, the thoughtseed framework
aligns with the notion of discrete thought processes, where each dominant thoughtseed
represents a distinct cognitive moment or 'atom' of conscious experience.
The thoughtseed framework introduces the novel concept of thoughtseeds as
self-organizing units with their own internal states and dynamics, which sets it apart
from other cognitive theories. These self-organizing dynamics, driven by the principles
of active inference, allow thoughtseeds to actively engage with the environment, predict
future states, and shape the ongoing flow of conscious experience. This active and
embodied nature of thoughtseeds provides a unique perspective on how cognition
emerges from the interaction between the living system and its environment.
Cognition, as seen in this framework, is not merely an internal process. It is inherently
embodied and situated, deeply rooted in the interactions between the living system’s
internal states, its body, and the environment (Thompson, 2007). Thoughtseeds emerge
from this reciprocal relationship and shape the living system’s perception and
decision-making processes by forming predictions, selecting actions, and integrating
sensory feedback.
31
The Hierarchical Structure of the Thoughtseed Framework
Figure 3. Illustrative Thoughtseed Framework. This diagram provides a high-level
conceptual overview of the internal states within the Thoughtseed Framework,
structured across four nested levels. It employs an active inference formalism framed
within the principles of Global Workspace Theory.
The Thoughtseed Framework proposes a hierarchical organization of cognitive
processes (see Figure 3), offering a mechanistic explanation for how the brain
organizes and manages complex functions such as decision-making, problem-solving,
and planning. These processes can be understood within the Global Workspace Theory
(GWT) paradigm, where information from various subsystems becomes globally
accessible to the living system when it reaches the level of conscious awareness. Below
is an outline of the hierarchy:
1. Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs): NPDs form the foundation of the
framework, consisting of groups of neurons that process sensory input or
generate potential actions. Within the GWT, these subsystems provide the
foundational, localized processing of information. NPDs can be divided into
32
domains responsible for sensory processing, motor planning, and internal state
regulation, contributing raw data for higher-order representations.
2. Knowledge Domains (KDs): KDs represent large-scale networks that integrate
knowledge, memories, and conceptual categories. They serve as structured
repositories from which thoughtseeds draw. Within the GWT, KDs act as
functional modules that hold specialized knowledge, accessible to the global
workspace when relevant. For example, recognizing a dog would involve KDs
related to visual processing, auditory associations (barking), and emotional
contexts (companionship).
3. Thoughtseeds Network: Thoughtseeds represent dynamic, self-organizing
entities that emerge from the coordinated activity within and across KDs. In the
GWT context, thoughtseeds represent potential candidates for entry into the
global workspace, where they can shape conscious experience and direct
behavior. Each thoughtseed is a coherent pattern of neural activity associated
with specific concepts, percepts, or possible actions. Thoughtseeds act as
cognitive sub-agents, actively generating predictions and selecting actions to
minimize free energy, constantly updating based on sensory feedback.
4. Meta-Cognition, Dominant Thoughtseed and Higher-Order Thoughtseeds:
This level involves higher-order thoughtseeds that modulate attention and guide
goal-directed behavior. Higher-order thoughtseeds reflect the agent's global
goals, influencing which lower-level thoughtseeds gain prominence within the
global workspace. In GWT terms, these higher-order constructs govern the
selection of conscious content by modulating attentional precision and prioritizing
relevant information. This helps shape global policies that determine the living
system's actions in a goal-oriented manner. The selection of a dominant
thoughtseed can be seen as a discrete event, leading to a distinct shift in
conscious content.
The culmination of these hierarchical processes is the projection of content onto the
Global Workspace, the metaphorical stage of conscious experience. The dominant
thoughtseed at any moment, selected through competitive processes based on free
energy minimization and influenced by meta-cognitive processes, shapes the conscious
33
content. This content includes sensory input, memories, concepts, and potential actions,
reflecting the living system’s current understanding and interaction with the
environment. The dynamic interplay between thoughtseeds and knowledge domains
creates the fluid "stream of thoughts" that manifests as the content of consciousness,
guiding adaptive behavior and decision-making.
Limitations and Future Research Directions
Investigating the neural mechanisms behind thoughtseed formation necessitates a
multi-scale approach, spanning from the co-activation of neurons to the emergence of
stable Markov blankets embodying distinct attractor states. A major challenge lies in
developing biologically plausible computational models of spiking neural networks that
incorporate synaptic plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms. Such models could
simulate the self-organization of thoughtseeds, allowing researchers to track the
evolution of attractor state stability, precision, and how these states are bound within
nested Markov blankets to foster thoughtseed resilience and predictive (Yufik, 2019;
Litwin-Kumar & Doiron, 2012; Hipólitoet al., 2021).
These computational models could also help identify conditions under which
thoughtseeds transition between states, reflecting attractor dynamics seen in models of
memory (Boscaglia et al., 2023; Parr, et al., 2021). Potential neural signatures, such as
spatiotemporal patterns of activity, connectivity motifs, or oscillatory dynamics, could
indicate the presence of thoughtseeds (Buzsáki, 2006; Fries, 2015; Sporns, 2011). .
Early research could focus on specific cognitive domains like object permanence or
numerical cognition to observe how thoughtseeds manifest in these processes.
Key Limitations
1. Metastability of Thoughtseeds: Thoughtseed dynamics are inherently
metastable, with rapid transitions between states. This makes it difficult to isolate
core attractors representing stable knowledge or behaviors, posing challenges in
capturing and measuring the dynamic properties of thoughtseeds empirically
(Rabinovich et al., 2008; Tognoli & Kelso, 2014; Deco et al., 2016, 2017).
34
2. Mapping Distributed Neural Activity: Given the complexity of the brain’s
distributed networks, linking specific patterns of neural activity to cognitive
processes (e.g., thoughtseeds) is fraught with difficulty. Misinterpretation could
arise without a clear framework that maps distributed signals to well-defined
cognitive domains (deCharms & Zador, 2000; Rué-Queralt, et al., 2021).
3. Hierarchical Complexity: The nested Markov blanket structure of thoughtseeds
introduces additional complexity in understanding how higher- and lower-order
processes interact. This complicates experimental design and analysis,
especially when attempting to link abstract thought processes to neurobiological
signatures (Friston, 2020; Kirchhoff et al., 2018).
Future Directions
Future research should focus on several key areas to further develop and validate the
thoughtseed framework:
● Computational Modeling: Future research should prioritize the development
and empirical validation of computational models that simulate thoughtseed
dynamics within the Global Workspace. These models could utilize hierarchical
nested Markov-blanketed structures and leverage frameworks like the intrinsic
ignition model (Deco & Kringelbach, 2017), but adapted to use thoughtseeds as
the competing units. By incorporating thoughtseed internal structure, active
inference mechanisms, and EFE minimization for the "ignition" of the Global
Workspace, these models can explore how parameters like activation thresholds
and attentional precision influence the emergence of discrete conscious states
and dominant thoughtseed selection. Furthermore, these models could plausibly
generate testable predictions about the neural correlates of thoughtseed
transitions, allowing for comparisons with empirical data from neuroimaging
techniques like EEG or fMRI and findings on the ignition of neural assemblies
(Dehaene, 2014).
● Cognitive Development: Investigate how the thoughtseed framework can be
applied to understand cognitive development. This could involve exploring how
35
thoughtseed dynamics change across the lifespan and contribute to learning,
memory, and the acquisition of complex cognitive skills. Early research could
focus on specific cognitive domains like object permanence (Piaget, 1954) or
numerical cognition (Nieder, 2017) to observe how thoughtseeds manifest in
these processes. The development of thoughtseeds may also be investigated in
the context of the emergence of discrete symbols and language (Dehaene et al.,
2022; Dehaene, 2020).
● Clinical Applications: Explore the potential applications of the thoughtseed
framework in understanding and treating disorders of attention. This could
involve investigating how disruptions in thoughtseed dynamics contribute to
specific clinical conditions and whether interventions targeting thoughtseed
regulation can improve cognitive function.
By pursuing these research directions, the thoughtseed framework can be further
refined and validated, leading to a deeper understanding of cognition, consciousness,
and their underlying neural mechanisms.
6. Conclusion
The thoughtseed framework offers a novel and biologically plausible model for
understanding the emergence and organization of embodied cognition. By integrating
evolutionary principles, active inference, and the Global Workspace Theory, the
framework provides a comprehensive account of how cognitive processes arise from
the dynamic interplay of neuronal packets, knowledge domains, and higher-order
thoughtseeds. The framework's emphasis on self-organization, competition, and free
energy minimization sheds light on the mechanisms underlying thought formation,
conscious experience, and adaptive behavior.
The hierarchical structure of the framework, with its nested Markov blankets and
reciprocal message passing, provides a compelling explanation for the brain's ability to
integrate information across different levels of representation and generate coherent
cognitive states. The concept of thoughtseeds as self-organizing units of embodied
36
knowledge offers a promising new perspective on the nature of thought and its role in
shaping conscious experience.
While still in its theoretical stages, the thoughtseed framework provides a fertile ground
for future research, with potential applications in understanding cognitive development,
psychopathology, and artificial intelligence. By continuing to explore the dynamics of
thoughtseeds and their interactions within the Global Workspace, we can gain a deeper
understanding of the fundamental principles that govern cognition and consciousness.

Illustrative Example: The Visual Object Recognition KD
The visual object recognition Knowledge Domain (KD) illustrates the complex nature of
KDs and their relationship with Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs). This KD
encompasses the hierarchical processing of visual features, progressing from basic
sensory inputs to complex object representations. Additionally, it integrates information
from various modalities, such as auditory and tactile inputs, as well as semantic and
emotional associations stored in memory. This multi-modal integration facilitates a rich
and nuanced understanding of objects that transcends mere visual appearance. For
instance, recognizing a dog involves not only processing its visual features but also
associating it with characteristic sounds (barking), tactile sensations (fur), and emotional
connotations (e.g., loyalty, companionship).
37
Hierarchical Processing within the Visual Object Recognition KD
Within the visual object recognition KD, various processing systems are hypothesized to
operate in a hierarchical manner, contributing to the construction of a comprehensive
visual experience. The primary visual cortex (V1) acts as an initial processing stage,
extracting basic features such as edges and orientations from retinal input. The ventral
visual stream, encompassing areas like V4 and the lateral occipital complex (LOC),
functions to integrate these features into representations of shapes and objects
(Grill-Spector et al., 2001). Higher-order regions, such as the inferotemporal cortex (IT),
further synthesize this information to recognize complex objects like faces (FFA) or tools
(EBA) (Kanwisher et al., 1997). The efficiency of this hierarchical processing can be
attributed to a sparse representation of visual information, leading to robust encoding of
visual features (Olshausen & Field, 2004; Herzog & Clarke, 2014).
KD as Integrative Framework
The visual object recognition KD serves as an integrative framework, binding outputs
from these various processing systems into coherent percepts. It organizes and
contextualizes the information derived from different sensory modalities, allowing for
meaningful interpretations of the stimuli. The specific content represented within this
framework is dynamically shaped by the interaction between activated KDs, the living
system's goals and expectations, and the saliency of environmental stimuli.
This binding process, which leads to the emergence of a coherent percept, involves
synchronization of neural activity across different processing systems (Singer, 1999;
Palacios, 2019), and the formation of superordinate ensembles that encompass
multiple neural representations. The enhancement of firing rates in specific neurons
may facilitate the binding of information, creating a more integrated perceptual
experience (Roelfsema, 2023). The dynamic and context-dependent nature of this
process enables flexible and adaptive perception, allowing the living system to respond
effectively to the ever-changing demands of its environment.
Nested Markov Blankets and Hierarchical Representation
38
Each neural representation within the visual object recognition KD is hypothesized to
possess its own Markov blanket, forming a nested hierarchy of representations. This
structure allows for the integration and exchange of information across multiple levels of
abstraction. The information encoded at each level is progressively coarse-grained,
moving from fine-grained sensory details at lower levels to more abstract and
categorical representations at higher levels (Hipólito et al., 2021).
Illustrative Example: "Dog" Thoughtseed
The "dog" thoughtseed serves as an illustrative example of how thoughtseeds emerge
and function within thoughtseeds framework, representing an individual's integrated
knowledge, beliefs, and associated behaviors related to dogs (Miklósi, 2014). This
encapsulation forms a complex and multifaceted concept within the brain's internal
model, which can be understood through the lens of Global Workspace Theory (GWT).
A Generative Model Perspective of "Dog" Thoughtseed
Scenario: You are walking in a park, surrounded by various stimuli, including trees,
birds chirping, and other people. Suddenly, you spot a Golden Retriever playing fetch.
Level 1: Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs) - The Projectors
● Sensory NPDs:
○ Visual NPD: The sight of the Golden Retriever triggers the activation of
various neural packets (NPs) within the visual NPD, encoding features like
its golden fur, wagging tail, and playful movements. This sensory
information is transformed into a format suitable for conscious access and
interpretation.
○ Auditory NPD: The sound of the dog barking activates NPs within the
auditory NPD, contributing to the overall perception of the dog.
○ Other Sensory NPDs: If you were to pet the dog or smell it, the
somatosensory and olfactory NPDs would also become active, enriching
the sensory representation of the dog.
39
● Active State NPDs:
○ Motor NPDs: The sight of the dog playing fetch triggers potential actions
within the motor NPDs, such as reaching out to pet the dog or throwing a
ball. These potential actions are represented as motor plans that are
prepared for execution.
● Internal State NPDs:
○ These NPDs integrate information from the sensory and active NPDs,
contributing to the formation of higher-order representations within
relevant Knowledge Domains (KDs). They recognize the combination of
visual and auditory features as indicative of a "dog," activating the
corresponding SEs within the "animal" KD.
Level 2: Knowledge Domains (KDs) - The Content Generators
● "Animal" KD: This KD contains Superordinate Ensembles (SEs) representing
various animals, their characteristics, and behaviors. Activating the "dog" SE
within this KD provides a rich conceptual framework about dogs, their typical
actions (e.g., barking, playing), and their relationships with humans (e.g., as
pets). This information can be accessed by conscious awareness, becoming part
of the global workspace.
● Other Relevant KDs:
○ "Pet" KD: Provides context about the dog's social role and potential
interactions, shaping the observer's expectations and actions.
○ "Emotion" KD: Contributes to the affective experience associated with
the dog, generating feelings of joy, excitement, or even fear, depending on
past encounters.
○ "Dog Encounters" KD: Activates memories of past encounters with
dogs, enriching the representation of the current experience and
influencing predictions about the dog's behavior.
Level 3: Thoughtseed - The Pullback Attractor and Agent
40
● "Dog" Thoughtseed: The "dog" thoughtseed emerges as a dominant attractor
state within the brain's dynamic landscape, integrating perceptual, conceptual,
and emotional information from activated KDs and NPDs. It embodies a unified
and meaningful concept of "dog," encompassing various attributes, behaviors,
and associated experiences. As the thoughtseed evolves through interactions, it
influences the cognitive processes that shape conscious awareness.
● Agency and Cognitive Access: The "dog" thoughtseed acts as an active agent,
generating predictions about the dog's behavior, such as expecting it to continue
playing fetch or approach the observer. These predictions are continuously
compared to actual sensory input, leading to updates in the thoughtseed's
internal model and the refinement of its representation in conscious awareness.
● Attentional Modulation: The thoughtseed exerts top-down control over
attention, directing focus to specific aspects of the dog or its environment based
on the observer's goals and interests. This modulation facilitates the selection of
relevant sensory inputs for further processing in the global workspace.
● Competition and Selection: The "dog" thoughtseed competes with other
potential thoughtseeds for dominance in cognitive processing. Its selection as the
dominant thoughtseed is determined by its Expected Free Energy (EFE),
considering its epistemic and pragmatic affordances. The thoughtseed's saliency,
contextual relevance, and alignment with the living system's goals influence its
likelihood of being selected. The emergence of the "dog" thoughtseed reflects its
ability to provide the most accurate and parsimonious explanation for the current
sensory input and the living system's goals, thereby minimizing free energy.
● Action Selection: The active "dog" thoughtseed guides the selection of actions
toward the dog, such as petting it or calling its name. These actions are aimed at
fulfilling the thoughtseed's predictions and minimizing free energy.
Level 4: Meta-Cognitive Level
● Higher-Order Thoughtseeds: Higher-order thoughtseeds, representing goals or
intentions (e.g., "I want to play with the dog"), modulate the activity of the "dog"
thoughtseed and influence its policy selection. These thoughtseeds exert
41
top-down control over cognitive processes, shaping attention and the salience of
different aspects of the "dog" thoughtseed. This allows for flexible and adaptive
behavior, enabling the living system to prioritize certain aspects of the "dog"
concept based on current goals and intentions.
● Stream of Thoughts: The continuous emergence, competition, and transition of
thoughtseeds create a dynamic stream of thoughts within the global workspace.
As the observer interacts with the dog and the environment, different
thoughtseeds may activate, reflecting changes in attention and ongoing active
inference. For example, the "dog" thoughtseed might transition to a "play"
thoughtseed during a game of fetch or to a "fear" thoughtseed if the dog
suddenly barks aggressively. This dynamic interplay of thoughtseeds, illustrates
the living system's efforts to make sense of its environment, predict future events,
and select actions that minimize surprise and achieve its goals.

     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
