### OverviewThis paper investigates the application of active inference in developing energy-efficient control agents for manufacturing systems. Active inference, rooted in the principles of biological brains, provides a unified probabilistic framework integrating perception, learning, and action, with inherent uncertainty quantification. The authors focus on controlling parallel and identical machine workstations to enhance energy efficiency, addressing challenges posed by the system’s stochastic nature and delayed policy response. The research introduces tailored enhancements, such as multi-step transition and hybrid horizon methods, to mitigate these issues. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of these enhancements and highlights the potential of the active inference-based approach.### MethodologyThe authors employ an active inference framework, a unifying theory that integrates inference, perception, and action by emphasizing the dependence of observations on actions [27]. This framework operates on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [17,29], where the agent interacts with the environment, generating observations (o ), latent states (s ), and actions (a ). The generative model of the agent, parameterized with θ, represents the internal model of the world, while the inference mechanisms quantify the uncertainty and drive the decision-making process. The core of the framework relies on the free energy principle [10,26], which posits that organisms minimize surprise by calibrating their models and making decisions without complete knowledge of the system dynamics. The authors utilize a multi-step transition and hybrid horizon approach to address the challenges posed by the system's stochastic nature and delayed policy response. The multi-step transition allows the agent to consider future states when planning, while the hybrid horizon combines short-term and long-term predictions to optimize control. The agent’s transition is modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and the agent’s state is represented by a normal distribution. The authors also incorporate a Bayesian approach to model uncertainty, which is crucial for handling the stochastic nature of the system. The authors utilize a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to explore the state space and evaluate the effectiveness of different control policies. The MCTS algorithm generates multiple possible trajectories, which are then evaluated based on their expected reward. The authors also incorporate a reward function that reflects the system’s energy efficiency goals. The system is characterized by Poisson processes [19] for machine arrival and processing times, and the machines transition between states (idle, busy, startup, failed) based on these processes. The authors use Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions to model the state transitions.### ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements. The authors conducted simulations on a workstation comprising six parallel and identical machines with an upstream buffer B with finite holding capacity serving multiple machines. The system is subject to the stochastic arrival of parts, while machines can transition between states: working (idle or busy), standby, startup, and failed. Power consumption varies by state: standby (w ), failed (w ), startup (w ), idle (w ), and busy (w ), where w ≈0. The key characteristic of this system is that all processes are stochastic, modeled as Poisson processes [19]. The authors utilize a hybrid horizon approach, combining short-term and long-term predictions to optimize control. The authors observed that the agent can effectively manage power variations to minimize energy consumption without compromising productivity. The authors found that the multi-step transition and hybrid horizon methods significantly improved the agent’s performance compared to a baseline approach. Specifically, the agent reduced energy consumption by15% while maintaining the same level of throughput. The authors also observed that the agent quickly adapts to changing conditions, such as variations in part arrival rates and machine failures.
