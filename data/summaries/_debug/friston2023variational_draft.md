### A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics### OverviewThis paper introduces a variational formulation of natural selection, paying special attention to the nature of ‘things’ and the way that different ‘kinds’ of ‘things’ are individuated from—and influence each other. We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain—and are constrained by—fast, phenotypic processes. The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness. Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively. In this view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a generative model, whose parameters are learned via natural selection. The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects. Perhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a population of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider populations—and nested meta-populations—of different natural kinds that influence each other. This paper is limited to a description of the mathematical apparatus and accompanying ideas. Subsequent work will use these methods for simulations and numerical analyses—and identify points of contact with related mathematical formulations of evolution.### MethodologyThe authors state: "The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness." They note: "Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively." According to the paper, “We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain—and are constrained by—fast, phenotypic processes.” They further state: “It offers a technical and generic treatment with minimal assumptions or commitments to specific biological processes.” The authors detail a stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics approach, which is a method for learning parameters in a generative model. They explain that this approach is used to learn the parameters of the generative model via natural selection. The authors also describe a variational free energy functional, which is a mathematical expression that quantifies the cost of a particular model.### ResultsThe authors state: "The authors state: “It offers a technical and generic treatment with minimal assumptions or commitments to specific biological processes.”" They note: “The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness.” According to the paper, “The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects.
