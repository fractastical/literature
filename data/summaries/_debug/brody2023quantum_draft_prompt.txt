The cognitive state of mind concerning a range of choices to be made can effectively
be modelled in terms of an element of a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The
dynamics of the state of mind resulting form information acquisition is characterised
by the von Neumann-Lu¨ders projection postulate of quantum theory. This is shown
to give rise to an uncertainty-minimising dynamical behaviour equivalent to the
Bayesian updating, hence providing an alternative approach to characterising the
dynamics of cognitive state that is consistent with the free energy principle in brain
science. The quantum formalism however goes beyond the range of applicability
of classical reasoning in explaining cognitive behaviours, thus opens up new and
intriguing possibilities.
Introduction
The present paper is concerned with the use of Hilbert space techniques, so successfully
implemented in characterising behaviours and properties of quantum systems [1], to model
cognitive ‘psychology’ in the sense to be defined below. The paper, on the other, is not
concernedwithwhetherquantumeffects,suchasinterference,violationoftheBellinequality,
or the use of complex numbers, might play a role in psychology or in brain activities. There
are differing opinions on the matter [2–6], but these will not be addressed here, for, the
use of Hilbert space techniques in modelling cognitive behaviour, in themselves, do not
necessarily require functioning of brain neurophysiology to be quantum mechanical. What
doesconcernuswillincludethetensorproductstructureoftheHilbertspace, entanglements,
the superposition principle, the projection postulate, and decoherence. While some may
view these to be intrinsically quantum-mechanical effects, I will show that they are in fact
intrinsic to any probabilistic system modelled on a Hilbert space — an idea that dates back
to the pioneering work of Rao [7]. At any rate, my purpose here is to illustrate how it
is both natural and effective to implement Hilbert space techniques in modelling cognitive
human behaviours. Such a proposal, in itself, is not new (see, e.g., [8, 9] and references cited
therein). My main contribution is to introduce a formalism that allows for a systematic
treatment of the dynamics of cognitive state of mind, from which predictions can be made.
The key idea to be explored is that the state of mind of a person, to be defined more
precisely, can efficiently be represented in terms of a vector in a high-dimensional Hilbert
space, whichinturnisatensorproductoflower-dimensionalHilbertspaces. However, before
turning to technical discussion, I would like to illustrate the significance of the superposition
principle in this context through simple examples. The first concerns the tossing of a fair
coin. When a coin is tossed, but the outcome not yet revealed, no one will dispute the state
of the coin, which is a macroscopic classical object: it is either in the ‘head’ state or in the
‘tale’ state. In fact, even before the coin is tossed, it will be known to all that the state of
the coin will be either head or tail. However, a person who is in the position to guess the
3202

2
outcome is having a different state of mind. Until the moment when a choice is made, the
person’s mind is in the state of neither head nor tail – it is in a state of a superposition.
Thus there is a dissonance between the objective reality of the state of the coin and the
state of the mind attempting to determine the state of the coin.
Another example is seen in children’s hand game of rock, scissors and paper. Again, until
the last moment when the decision is made as to which hand to choose, the person’s mind is
in the state of a superposition between the three alternatives. Of course, with any decision,
a person may come with a predetermined outcome — as in Groucho Marx’s whatever it is,
I’m against it! But until when that decision is made, the fact remains that the mind is in an
indefinite state. Only at the moment when the decision is made, for example to declare that
the outcome of the coin tossing is head, or choosing the scissors hand, the state ‘collapses’
into one of the definite states. This situation is very much analogous to the measurement
process in quantum theory.
With these heuristics in mind, the present paper will be organised as follows. I begin
by defining what I mean by the state of mind, which essentially will be a Hilbert-space
representationoftheprobabilityassignmentstothetotalityofchoicesavailabletotheperson.
AgivensetofchoiceswillthenbemodelledasanobservableactingonthisHilbertspace. The
ideaIputforwardiscloselyrelatedtotheproposalmadebyBusemeyerandhiscollaborators
[10],andthatbyKhrennikovandhiscollaborators[11]. Onedifferencetothelatter,however,
is that I model cognitive behaviours directly using the quantum formalism, rather than
starting from the quantum theory and then deduce implications in behavioural modelling
byreduction. Asaconsequence, Iamabletogaincertaininsightsintohumanbehaviourthat
go beyond what is commonly understood in cognitive psychology. I examine how the state of
mind changes when a person acquires noisy information that is relevant to decision making.
My approach will be consistent with the cybernetics framework of Wiener as an attempt
to understand the dynamics of living systems [12]. I will use the von Neumann-Lu¨ders
projection postulate in quantum mechanics to arrive at the change in the state of mind,
and show that the result agrees with the classical formulation using the Bayes formula; in
agreement with related previous findings [11]. Further, I show that the projection postulate
givesrisetoanevolutionthatonaverageminimisesfuture‘surprises’, andhenceisconsistent
with the free-energy principle widely adopted in brain science [13]. I then consider what
happens when noisy information arrives in continuous time. When the dynamical evolution
of the state of mind resulting from a sequential von Neumann-Lu¨ders projection postulate is
reduced to a projective Hilbert space, the dynamical equation reveals an important feature,
namely, that each state of zero uncertainty, having vanishing Shannon-Wiener entropy, acts
as an attractor to the dynamics. The result provides a geometric explanation of certain
characteristics of human behaviour seen in psychology literature (such as confirmation bias),
which I have previously called the tenacious Bayesian behaviour [14]. The work presented
here demonstrates the fact that if a person’s opinion is strongly skewed towards one of
the false alternatives, and if all choice observables are commutative, then even if partial
informationaboutthetruthisrevealedandthepersonbehavesrationallyinaccordancewith
Bayesian updating, it is very difficult for the person to escape from the initial misconception.
In other words, adherences to false narratives commonly observed in today’s society is not
due to irrational behaviours. Following the proposal in [8], I then consider what happens if
choice observables are not commutative. This is motivated by the observation that many
empirical observations concerning cognitive human behaviours cannot be fully described by
use of a commuting set of observables. The existence of incompatible observables can be
3
used to rescue a person fallen into a false attractor; a possibility that is unavailable by use
of purely classical reasonings.
Decision making and the state of mind
Throughout the paper I will be concerned with the cognitive process of decision making,
which will be a topic distinct from what is known as statistical decision theory, for which
there are excellent treatise [15, 16]. A decision making occurs when a person is unsure from
which alternative to choose; but I will be using the term ‘decision making’ in a broad sense
to include a person’s uncertain point of view on a topic, for which there are multiple views,
and for which there may not be a need to choose one particular alternative. At any rate,
this uncertainty, which is largely due to lack of sufficient information, can be modelled in the
form of a set of probabilities that represents the likelihoods of different alternatives being
selected. Suppose that a decision needs to be made to choose one out of N alternatives.
(The number of alternatives can be infinite, or even uncountable — the formalism extends
naturally to these cases, but for simplicity I will consider the finite case here.) At a given
moment in time, let p denote the likelihood that the kth alternative is selected. If p = 1
k k
for a value of k then the mind is in a definite state in relation to this decision. Hence for a
given decision, the set of numbers (p ,p ,...,p ) represents the state of mind in relation to
1 2 N
that decision making.
Of course, at any moment in time one faces a multitude of decisions, not just one, some of
which are intertwined with each other while others are independent. In probability theory,
such a situation is modelled by means of a joint probability for the totality of decisions.
Alternatively, though equivalent, the situation can be modelled on a Hilbert space by use
√
of the square-root map: p → ψ = p . Clearly, the vector with components {ψ }, in the
k k k k
basis |e (cid:105) = (0,0,0,...,1,0,...,0) with only the kth element nonzero, is an element of an
k
N-dimensional real Hilbert space HN. Thus, in terms of the Dirac notation the state can
(cid:80)
be expressed in the form of a superposition |ψ(cid:105) = ψ |e (cid:105). If there is a second decision
k k k
to be made out of M alternatives, then the state of a person’s mind in relation to these two
choices is represented by an element of the tensor product HN ⊗HM. This tensor product
structure arises solely from statistical dependencies of two decisions, when modelled on a
Hilbert space.
This construction extends for an arbitrary number of decisions to be made. With this in
mind, I define the state of mind of a person facing a range of alternatives to consider, at any
moment in time, to be an element of the tensor product H = ⊗K H , where K is the number
l=1 l
of distinct decisions. If two decisions can be made independently, then the component of
the state vector belonging to the corresponding subspace of H will be in a product state.
Otherwise, a state is entangled. As a simple example, consider a pair of binary decisions, for
example, whether to take fish or meat for the main course, and whether to take red or white
wine to accompany the dinner. Writing |F(cid:105) and |M(cid:105) for the food choices, and similarly |R(cid:105)
and |W(cid:105) for the wine selections, if the state of mind of a person is |ψ(cid:105) = c |FW(cid:105)+c |MR(cid:105),
1 2
then the person will choose fish with white wine with probability c2, and meat with red
1
wine with probability c2 = 1−c2; but no other option will be chosen. This is evidently an
2 1
entangled state, which collapses to one or the other alternatives at the moment (or before)
the waiter arrives and takes the order.
In this Hilbert space formulation, a given choice can be modelled by a real symmetric
matrix, whosedimensionisthenumberofalternatives. Suchamatrixcorrespondstoobserv-
4
ables in quantum mechanics. I will assume, for now, that all such ‘observables’ or ‘choices’
are compatible in the sense that the matrix representations can be diagonalised simultane-
ously. What this means is that at any given time, an arbitrary number of decisions can be
made simultaneously. It is then evident that no state of mind, whether entangled or not,
can violate laws of classical probability, and hence no state can violate, in particular, Bell’s
inequalities. Later in the paper, however, I will consider the case where choice observables
are incompatible.
The eigenvalues of choice observables then label different alternatives. This is analogous
to quantum observables when it concerns labelling outcomes of a single measurement. How-
ever, observablesinquantumtheoryhaveasecondroleapartfromrepresentingmeasurement
outcomes: they generate dynamics. As a consequence, the differences of observable eigen-
values have direct physical consequences, and hence they cannot be chosen arbitrarily. It
appears, in contrast, that the differences of eigenvalues of the choice observables have no
significance: the results of a selection, such as choosing a hand in the game of rock, scissors
and paper, can be labelled by means of any three distinct numerical values, merely as place
keepers so that statistical analysis can be applied. It will be shown below, however, that
when it concerns the dynamics of the state of mind, the eigenvalue differences do play an
important role, and hence they cannot be chosen arbitrarily, just as in quantum theory.
Dynamics
Having established the framework for representing the cognitive state of mind, it will be
of interest to explore how the state changes in time. To this end I will be working under the
hypothesis that a given state |ψ(cid:105) of a person’s mind changes only by transfer of information.
It is, of course, possible that an isometric motion analogous to unitary motion of quantum
theory that does not exchange information can change the state, and if so this will be
given by an orthogonal transformation. However, without a clear physical or psychological
evidence indicating the existence of such a symmetry, I will not consider this possibility,
and focus instead on universally acknowledged empirical fact that information acquisition
(or loss) changes states of minds. The question is, in which way?
To understand dynamics, I will be borrowing ideas from communication theory. Focusing
ˆ
on a single decision to start with, let X denote the decision or choice observable, with
eigenvalues {x } . These eigenvalues for now merely label different alternatives. The
k k=1,...,N
ˆ ˆ
eigenstate |x (cid:105) of X, satisfying X|x (cid:105) = x |x (cid:105), thus represents the state of mind in which
j j j j
the jth alternative has been chosen. Prior to an alternative being chosen, the state is in a
(cid:80)
superposition |ψ(cid:105) = c |x (cid:105). The state will change when the person acquires information
k k k
relevant to decision making. This information is rarely perfect. In communication theory,
anything that obscures finding the value of the quantity of interest is modelled in terms of
noise. Letεˆdenotethisnoise. Here,εˆcantakediscretevalues,ormorecommonlycontinuous
values. I will consider the latter case so that εˆacts on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space
H∞ distinct from the state space HN. The noise arises from external environments E.
For simplicity I will assume that the state of noise is pure, and is given by |η(cid:105) = η(y) ∈
H∞, although a mixed state can equally be treated. Then initially the state of mind of a
person attempting to make a decision and the state of the noise-inducing environment is
disentangled, and together is given by the product state |ψ(cid:105)|η(cid:105).
Acquisition of partial information relevant to decision making can then be modelled by
5
observing the value of
ˆ ˆ
ξ = X +εˆ.
Here, the sum is taken in the tensor-product space HN ⊗ H∞. To understand the sum,
consider the case in which εˆis finite and can take three values ε ,ε ,ε , while the decision
1 2 3
ˆ
is binary, represented by the values x and x . Then ξ is a 6×6 matrix with the eigenvalues
0 1
ˆ
x + ε , x + ε , x + ε , x + ε , x + ε , x + ε . In general, the eigenvalues of ξ are
0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 1 1 3
ˆ
highly (typically N-fold) degenerate. The form that ξ takes is of course nothing more than
a signal-plus-noise decomposition in classical communication theory [12]. The ‘signal’ term,
ˆ ˆ
more generally, will be a function F(X) of X, but for simplicity I will assume the function
to be linear because the choice of F(x) is context dependant.

Once the value of the information-providing observable ξ is measured, the initially-
disentangled state

|ψ(cid:105)|η(cid:105) = p η(y)|x (cid:105)

becomes an entangled state. In quantum mechanics, the transformation of the state after

Two interesting observations that follow are in order. First, the density matrix by construc-

givenbyp(y)dy. Second,thecoefficientsoftherandompurestateagreeswiththeconditional

That is, π (ξ) is the probability that the kth alternative is chosen, conditional on observing

the value ξ of ξ. It follows that the von Neumann-Lu¨ders projection postulate of quantum

theorynotonlygivesthecorrectclassicalresult(asalreadyobservedin[6,11]withadifferent
construction) but also provides a simple geometric interpretation of the Bayes formula. This
follows because the Lu¨ders state |ψ(ξ)(cid:105) associated to a degenerate measurement outcome ξ
is given by the orthogonal projection of the initial state onto Hilbert subspace associated to
this outcome. Hence |ψ(ξ)(cid:105) is the closest state on the constrained subspace in terms of the
Bhattachayya distance [17] to the initial state |ψ(cid:105)|η(cid:105).
It is worth remarking that an alternative interpretation of the von Neumann-Lu¨ders pro-
jection postulate can be given in terms of the so-called free energy principle [18]. Intuitively,
this principle asserts that the change in the state of mind follows a path that on average min-
imises elements of surprises. In the present context, the degree of surprise can be measured
in terms of the level of uncertainty. Suppose that the state of mind after information acqui-
sition becomes µˆ that is different from the Lu¨ders state ρˆ . Then the level of uncertainty

ˆ ˆ
the expected uncertainty, and hence the surprise, for all X and ξ, it has to be that δ = 0.

It follows that among all the states consistent with the observation, Lu¨ders state is unique
in that it minimises the expected level of future surprise, as measured by the uncertainty.
I might add parenthetically that a psychologist wishing to predict the statistics of the
behaviour of a person who has acquired information relevant to decision making will a priori
notknowtheobservedvalueofξ. Henceinthiscasethedensitymatrixρˆ hastobeaveraged

Evidently, 0 ≤ Λ(ω ) ≤ 1 and Λ(ω ) = 1 for all k,l, but because the initial state of mind
kl kk √
|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| in this basis has the matrix elements { p p }, it follows that an external observer
k l
(e.g., a psychologist) will perceive a decoherence effect whereby the off-diagonal elements of
the reduced density matrix are damped.
It is at this point that I wish to comment on the numerical values of the differences {ω }.
kl
While there is no reason why Λ(ω) should be monotonic in ω (unless η(y) is unimodal), it
will certainly be the case that the decoherence effect is more pronounced for large values of
ω. That is, Λ(ω) (cid:28) 1 for ω (cid:29) 1. For the same token, the values of ω will directly affect
kl
the conditional probabilities {π (ξ)}. Therefore, while the values of ω , and hence those
k kl
of x , can be chosen arbitrarily to describe the statistics of the initial state of mind, once
k
dynamics is taken into account (what happens after information acquisition), it becomes
evident that they cannot be chosen arbitrarily.
A better intuition behind this observation can be gained by reverting back to ideas of
signal detection in communication theory. For this purpose, consider a binary decision.
7
ˆ
Supposed that the two eigenvalues of X, labelling the two decisions, are chosen to be, say,
±0.1 and suppose that the noise distribution η2(y) is normal centred at zero, with a small
ˆ
standard deviation. In this case, observed outcomes of ξ will most likely take values close to
ˆ
zero. Asaconsequence,asingleobservationofξ willreduceonaveragetheinitialuncertainty
ˆ
only by a very small amount. In contrast, suppose that the two eigenvalues of X are chosen
to be ±10, but the noise is the same as before. Then the observation will almost certainly
yield the outcome that is close to +10 or −10. Hence the uncertainty in this case has been
reduced to virtually zero after a single observation. This extreme example shows how it is
not possible to label different choice alternatives by arbitrary numerical numbers, while at
the same time to adequately model the dynamics of the state of mind.
In the event where a model η(y) for the state of noisy environment exists, it is possible in
principle to estimate the eigenvalue differences {ω } by studying how much a person’s views
ij
shifted from the acquisition of the noisy information. This is because the average reduction
of uncertainty, as measured by entropy change or the decoherence rate, is determined by the
eigenvalue differences {ω }.
ij
Sequential updating
I have illustrated how the cognitive state of mind of a person in relation to a given
choice changes after a single acquisition of information. A more interesting, as well as
realistic, situation concerns a sequential updating of the state of mind as more and more
ˆ
noisy information is revealed. In this case the information-providing observable ξ is a time
t
series. As a simple example that naturally extends the previous one I will consider the
following time series
ˆ ˆ
ξ = Xt+εˆ,
t t
where I will assume that the noise term εˆ is modelled by a standard Brownian motion
t
{B } multiplied by the identity operator of the Hilbert space H∞. The ‘signal’ component,
t
(cid:82)t ˆ
more generally, can be given by F (X)ds, but again for simplicity I will assume that the
0 s
ˆ
function F (x) is linear for all t. In fact, even more generally, the range of alternatives X
t
itself can also be time dependent, but I will not consider this case here.
In this example, what happens to the state of mind can be worked out by discretising the
time and taking the limit. Starting from time zero, over a small time increment dt the initial
ˆ
state |ψ(cid:105)|η(cid:105) is projected to the Lu¨ders state Π |ψ(cid:105)|η(cid:105), suitably normalised, in accordance
ξ
dt
with the projection postulate. In this case, the noise is normally distributed with mean zero
and variance dt, so that η(y) is just the square-root of the corresponding Gaussian density
function. Then after another time interval dt we apply the projection operator again, and
repeat the procedure till time t. Finally, taking the limit, a calculation shows that the
ˆ
Lu¨ders state, after monitoring the observable ξ up to time t, is given by
t
1 (cid:88)√
|ψ(ξ t )(cid:105) = √ p k e 2 1x k ξt−1 4 x2 k t|x k (cid:105),
Φ
t
k
where ξ = Xt + B and X is the random variable represented on the Hilbert space HN
t t
by the operator X ˆ along with the initial state |ψ(cid:105), and Φ t = (cid:80) k p k e1 2 k k ξt−1 4 x2 k t gives the
normalisation.
Because we have an explicit expression that monitors the change in the state of mind
as information is revealed, there is a priori no reason to identify the differential equation
8
to which |ψ(ξ )(cid:105) is the solution. Nevertheless, the exercise of working out the dynamical
t
equation provides several new insights worth discussing. The detailed mathematical steps
required here to work out the dynamics has been outlined in [19], so I shall not repeat this.
It suffices to say that the Lu¨ders state is a function of t and ξ , where the latter is a Brownian
t
motion with a random drift. Hence the relevant calculus to apply is that of Ito: one Taylor
expands |ψ(ξ )(cid:105) in t and ξ , and retain leading-order terms, bearing in mind that (dξ )2 = dt.
t t t
Then it follows that
1 1
d|ψ(ξ )(cid:105) = − (X ˆ −(cid:104)X ˆ (cid:105) )2|ψ(ξ )(cid:105)dt+ (X ˆ −(cid:104)X ˆ (cid:105) )|ψ(ξ )(cid:105)dW ,

where (cid:104)X(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ(ξ )|X|ψ(ξ )(cid:105)/(cid:104)ψ(ξ )|ψ(ξ )(cid:105) and where
t t t t t
ˆ
dW = dξ −(cid:104)X(cid:105) dt.
t t t
The process {W } defined in this way is in fact a standard Brownian motion, known as the
t
innovations process [20]. This process has the interpretation of revealing new information.
ˆ
That is, while the time series {ξ } contains new as well as previously known information
t
about the impending choice to be made, the process {W } merely contains information that
t
was not known previously.
There are two important observations that follow. First, the evolution of the state of
ˆ
mind is not directly generated by the noise {B }, nor by the observation {ξ }. Rather,
t t
it is the innovations process that drives the dynamics. But this is the case only if the
state of mind changes in such a way to continuously minimise uncertainties. Because the
expectation of the cumulative uncertainty is the entropy [19], it follows that according to
the present framework, the tendency towards low entropy states required in biology [18],
which forms the basis of the free energy principle, emerges naturally. In particular, the
implication here based on the projection postulate is that the state of mind changes only in
accordance with the arrival of new information; it will not change spontaneously of its own
otherwise. Second, while the analysis presented here can be deduced as a result of standard
least-square estimation theory [20, 21], I have derived these results using the von Neumann-
Lu¨ders projection postulate of quantum theory. It follows that the informationally efficient
dynamical behaviour, in the sense of minimising surprises, of a system, is applicable not
only to the state of mind but also to quantum systems. An analogous point of view, based
on the free energy principle, has recently been proposed elsewhere [22].
I might add that for the purpose of psychological modelling, the averaged reduced density
matrix ρˆ = E[ρˆ ] can be seen to obey the dynamical equation

This, of course, is just the Lindblad equation generated by the decision X.
Projecting down the dynamics
One advantage of working with the mathematical formalism of quantum theory in mod-
elling psychological states of minds is the deeper insights that it can uncover (cf. [8]). To
this end I note that although I have defined the state of mind as a vector in Hilbert space,

Figure 1: Flow of the negative gradient of the variance. In the case of a decision involving three
alternatives, the corresponding state space M is a real projective plane. This two-dimensional
manifold is not orientable and cannot be embedded in three dimensions, however, it can be inter-
preted as a sphere with antipodal points being identified. Thus the flow on M can be captured by
examining the flow on the positive octant of the sphere. Here, a three-fold decision is modelled by
a choice observable Xˆ with eigenvalues x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3. The three axes, correspond-
1 2 3
ing to the three corners of the octant, represent the three eigenstates of Xˆ with no uncertainty.
The flow −∇aV generated by the negative gradient of the uncertainty (shown in the left panel)
takes any initial state into one of the states with no uncertainty — this is the tendency towards
least surprises. The gradient ∇aX of the mean is shown on the right panel for comparison. This
term is multiplied by the Brownian increment dW , which is normally distributed with mean zero
t
and variance dt, so at any moment in time the direction of the flow generated by the Brownian
fluctuation can go either way.
what I have in mind really is a projective Hilbert space consisting of rays through the ori-
gin of the Hilbert space. The idea is as follows. In probability, one can say, for instance,
that the likelihood of an event happening is 0.3, or three out of ten, or 30% — all of these
statements convey the same idea. The total probability being equal to one is merely a
convenient convention that does not carry any significance. Putting it differently, working
ˆ
with the convention that the expectation of any decision X in a state |ψ(cid:105) is given by the
ˆ ˆ
ratio (cid:104)X(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ|X|ψ(cid:105)/(cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105), it is evident that the expectation values are independent of
the overall scaling of the state |ψ(cid:105) by a nonzero constant. Hence the Hilbert space vector
|ψ(cid:105) carries one psychologically irrelevant degree of freedom. When this degree of freedom is
eliminated by the identification |ψ(cid:105) ∼ λ|ψ(cid:105) for any λ (cid:54)= 0, one arrives at a projective Hilbert
space, otherwise known as the real projective space. This is a real manifold M of dimension
N − 1, endowed with a Riemannian metric induced by the underlying probabilistic rules
given by the von Neumann-Lu¨ders projection postulate [23].
Let {ψa} denote local coordinates for points on M. A point on M thus represents a
state of mind corresponding to a family of vectors λ|ψ(cid:105), λ (cid:54)= 0, on Hilbert space. For any
10
representative |ψ(cid:105) of that family corresponding to the point ψ ∈ M, consider a function on
M through the expectation X(ψ) = (cid:104)ψ|X ˆ |ψ(cid:105)/(cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105). With this convention, and writing ∇a
for the gradient vector, the dynamical equation for the state of mind |ψ(ξ )(cid:105), when projected
t
down to M, is given by
1 1
dψa = − ∇aV dt+ ∇aXdW ,
X t
16 4
where V (ψ) = (cid:104)ψ|(X ˆ − X(ψ))2|ψ(cid:105)/(cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105) is the function on M that corresponds to the
X
ˆ
variance of X in the state |ψ(cid:105). The mathematical analysis leading to this result have essen-
tially been provided in [24, 25], which will not be repeated here. The important observation
is that the drift term (the coefficient of dt) that generates a tendency flow on the state
space M is given by the negative gradient of the variance (uncertainty). Therefore, on the
state space there is a tendency of driving the state of mind into one of the states with no
uncertainty — this is the flow that attempts to reduce surprises. It also follows that if the
state of mind is in the vicinity of one of the definite states of no uncertainty, then it will
be difficult to escape from that neighbourhood — a phenomenon that I referred to as a
tenacious Bayesian behaviour [14]. I will have more to comment on this below. In Figure 1
an example of the negative gradient flow of the uncertainty on the state space is sketched,
along with the gradient flow ∇aX of the mean.
It is worth remarking that in principle properties of the dynamics just outlined can be
inferred from the squared amplitudes
π kt = Φ− t 1p k ex k ξt−1 2 x2 k t
of the coefficients of |ψ(ξ )(cid:105), which evidently contain as much information as the state |ψ(ξ )(cid:105)
t t
itself. Indeed, starting from the expression for π , which can be deduced by use of the
kt
Bayes formula, one can apply the Ito calculus to deduce the dynamical equation satisfied
by π , known in communication theory as the Kushner equation [26]. However, π is a
kt kt
martingale, that is, on average a conserved process. In particular, the process has no drift
(the coefficient of dt in the Kushner equation for π is zero), so by simply examining the
kt
Kushner equation for π it is difficult to infer key properties of the dynamics. In contrast,
kt
the surprise-minimising feature of the dynamics becomes immediately apparent once the
process is projected to the state space M.
Difference between psychological and quantum states
I have thus far emphasised the similarities in the state of mind as represented by a Hilbert
spacevector(oradensitymatrix), andthephysicalstateofaquantumsystemasrepresented
by the same scheme. There are, however, some important differences. The most important
one, in my view, can be described through the following example. Suppose that the state
ˆ
of a quantum system is very close to one of the eigenstates |x (cid:105) of an observable X, and
k
that the measurement outcome yields the value x , l (cid:54)= k, for which the probability would
l
have been very small. In this case, the interpretation of the event is the obvious one: a rare
event has occurred. Now suppose instead that the state of mind is very close to one of the
‘certain’ states |x (cid:105), in a situation where there is a correct choice to be made (for example,
k
in deciding what had actually happened at an event in the past — as opposed to choices
for which there need not be ‘correct’ outputs). In this case, if the correct choice happens
to be |x (cid:105), l (cid:54)= k, it does not mean that an unlikely event had occurred. Rather, it means
l
11
that the initial state of mind was a misguided one. Putting the matter differently, while
a state of a quantum system represents the physical reality of the system, a state of mind
merely represents the person’s perception of the state of the world. This difference between
objective and subjective probabilities has important implications discussed below. (There
is, of course, the suggestion that the state of a quantum system itself is entirely subjective
[27], but this idea will not be explored here.)
The subjective nature of psychological states gives rise to the following challenge. In
psychology, it is not uncommon for a group of people having varying dispositions be given
some information (for example, an article to read or a video clip to watch), and their
responses are examined. One such example is seen in the study of confirmation bias — a
bias towards information that confirm their views [28, 29]. The idea is to investigate how
people having diverging opinions respond differently to the ‘same’ information. The issue
here, however, is that the information content of the given message such as an article or
a video clip is different to people with different opinions, even though it is an identical
information source.
To explain this more concretely, consider the simple example considered above. Suppose
that the preference, or the opinion, of one person on a topic is represented by the choice
ˆ
observable X. Then the information-providing observable representing an article discussing
ˆ ˆ
thistopicisgivenbyξ = X+εˆ. Ifasecondpersonwithadifferentopinionrepresentedbythe
ˆ
choice observable Y were given the same article, then the information-bearing observable for
ˆ
the second person is given by ηˆ= Y +εˆ. They are different. Hence, just because two people
are given, say, the same article to read, to assert that they are given the same information
is factually false. One important consequence in psychology is that the various conclusions
drawn from such experiments on how people’s behaviour might deviate from the rational
Bayesian updating require fundamental reexamination.
The subjective nature of psychological states also gives rise to a mathematical challenge.
In communication theory, one is typically concerned with well-established communication
channels, where the signal transmitted is assumed to represent an objective reality. There-
ˆ
fore,thereisnoambiguityininterpretingtheinformation-carryingtimeseries{ξ }. However,
t
if different receivers were to interpret the ‘same’ message differently, and if there is a need
to apply statistical analysis on the behaviours of different people, then the question arises
as to which information process (called ‘filtration’ in probability) one should be using for
statistical analysis. To my knowledge, such a situation has hardly been examined in the
vast literature of probability and stochastic analysis.
Limitation of classical reasoning
Thus far I have assumed, for definiteness, that all decisions are compatible. What this
means is that the quantum formalism advocated here, while effective, can be reduced, if
necessary, to a purely classical probabilistic formulation. It seems to me that this assump-
tion does not fully reflect the reality, and that it is plausible that not all decisions can be
made simultaneously by human brains. Indeed, there are empirical examples in behavioural
psychologythatstrongly indicate thatnotall decisionsor opinions arecompatible[8, 30,31].
If so, the observables representing these choices will not commute.
The issue with the classical updating of likelihoods based on the Bayes formula is that it
is not well suited to characterise changes of the contexts, that is, changes of sample spaces
— represented, for example, by an arrival of information that reveals a previously unknown
12
alternative. In such a scenario, the prior probability of the new alternative is zero (because
it was not even known), whereas the posterior can be nonzero. Hence, in the language of
probability theory, the prior and the posterior are not absolutely continuous with respect
to each other, prohibiting the direct use of the Bayes formula. In contrast, such a change
of context can be modelled using incompatible observables, along with the von Neumann-
Lu¨ders projection postulate.
(cid:80)
To see this, suppose that the prior state of mind is given by |ψ(cid:105) = c |x (cid:105) when
k k k
ˆ
expanded in the eigenstates of X, where c = 0 for some m, and suppose that acquisition of
m
ˆ ˆ
information takes the form ηˆ= Y +εˆ, where Y cannot be diagonalised using the basis states
√
ˆ ˆ
{|x (cid:105)}. ThenitispossiblethattheLu¨dersstateΠ |ψ(cid:105)/ (cid:104)ψ|Π |ψ(cid:105)resultingfrominformation
k η η
acquisition, when expanded in {|x (cid:105)}, is such that c (cid:54)= 0, thus circumventing the constraint
k m
of the classical Bayes formula. Therefore, in a situation whereby choice observables are not
compatible, the quantum-mechanical formalism proposed here and elsewhere [9] becomes
a necessity, for, the modelling of the dynamical behaviour of a person cannot be achieved
using the techniques of purely classical probability.
As a simple example, consider two binary (yes or no) decisions that are represented by
the choice observables
(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)
1 0 cosφ sinφ
ˆ ˆ
X = and Y = .
0 −1 sinφ −cosφ
ˆ ˆ
Evidently, X and Y cannot be diagonalised simultaneously, unless φ = 0 (mod 2π). Suppose
further that the initial state of mind of a person is represented by a Hilbert space vector
(cid:18) (cid:19)
cos 1θ
|ψ(cid:105) = 2
sin 1θ
2
ˆ
for some θ. Then the probability that the person giving a ‘yes’ answer to question X is
cos2 1θ; whereasifquestionY ˆ wereaskedinstead, thenthelikelihoodofgivinganaffirmative
2
answer is cos2 1(θ − φ). Note that strictly speaking, according to the scheme introduced
2
here the state space for a pair of binary decisions is four-dimensional, if the two decisions
(questions) are simultaneously considered. However, here I am interested in the effect of
questions being asked sequentially, and for this purpose a two-dimensional representation
suffices. Thus |ψ(cid:105) is interpreted to represent an abstract state of mind for which a range
of binary questions may be asked. In quantum theory, such a special state is known as a
coherent state.
ˆ ˆ
Now suppose that question Y is asked first, and subsequently question X is asked. Then
ˆ
from the projection postulate, the probability of giving a ‘yes’ answer to question X, irre-
spective of which answer was given to the first question, is 1 (2+cos(θ)+cos(θ−2φ)). For
4
φ (cid:54)= 0 this is different from the a priori probability cos2 1θ of answering ‘yes’ to question X ˆ .
2
In other words, the so-called law of total probability in the classical probability theory, that
the unconditional expectation of a conditional expectation equals the unconditional expec-
tation, is not applicable when dealing with incompatible propositions. Similarly, if question
ˆ ˆ ˆ
X is asked before question Y, then the probability of giving a ‘yes’ answer to question Y is
cos2 1θcos2 1φ+sin2 1θsin2 1φ, which is different from cos2 1(θ−φ) when φ (cid:54)= 0.
2 2 2 2 2
This example is perhaps the simplest one to demonstrate that answers to questions can
be dependant on the order in which questions are asked, provided that the questions are
not compatible (see [32], Appendix 2, for a discussion on the order dependence). A more
13
elaborate construction of this kind in higher dimension is found in [31]. At any rate, the
violation of the law of total probability shows that this empirical phenomenon of order-
dependence cannot be explained using compatible observables.
For a pair of binary choices, an attempt is made in [8] to explain the experiment discussed
in [33]. The data presented in [33] show that when people are asked if Clinton is honest,
about 50% answered ‘yes’, and if they are then asked if Gore is honest, 60% answered ‘yes’;
whereas if the order of the questions are reversed, then the figures change into 68% yes for
Gore followed by 60% yes for Clinton. Note however that the explanation of this effect in
[8] is incomplete because only conditional probabilities are considered therein, whereas the
data in [33] concern total probabilities. The analysis of total probabilities considered here,
on the other, shows that by setting θ ≈ 9π/20 and φ ≈ π/15, the phenomenon reported in
[33] can be explained within the ±10% error margin.
Discussion
I have illustrated how the Hilbert-space formalism used in quantum theory is highly ef-
fective in modelling cognitive psychology, in particular, its dynamical aspects. In particular,
I have shown how an important feature of the dynamics associated with Bayesian updat-
ing, or equivalently with the von Neumann-Lu¨ders projection, namely, of the uncertainty-
reducing trend, is made transparent in this formalism. This, in turn, provides an alternative
information-theoretic perspective on the free energy principle, due to the close relation be-
tween entropy and variance in communication theory.
One important consequence of the foregoing analysis is that states of low uncertainty are
always preferred ones, irrespective of whether they represent the correct choices. Therefore,
if the state of mind happens to be close to one of the false choices, then with a rational
updating it is difficult to escape from this neighbourhood because to achieve this, entropy
has to increase before it can be decreased again, and this is counter to biological trends [34].
In such a situation, it appears that only the accidental effect of noise, which otherwise is a
nuisance, can rescue the person from the false choice within a reasonable timescale, at least
when all choices are compatible to each other.
The situation changes once we accept the thesis of [8] that real-world decisions are never
compatible, thus making it a necessity to model cognitive behaviours using the quantum
formalism. To see this, consider a pair of maximally incompatible binary decisions modelled
by the pair
(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)
1 0 0 1
ˆ ˆ
X = and Y = ,
0 −1 1 0
and suppose that the state of mind is given by
(cid:18) (cid:19)
1 1
|ψ(cid:105) = √ ,
2 1
ˆ
orastateverycloseto|ψ(cid:105). BecauseY|ψ(cid:105) = |ψ(cid:105), thismeansthatthestateofmindinrelation
ˆ
to decision Y is already fixed to the alternative labelled by the eigenvalue +1, and that the
likelihood of choosing the other alternative labelled by the eigenvalue −1 is zero, or else
very close to zero anyhow. Suppose further that the ‘correct’ choice is the one labelled by
the eigenvalue −1 (in a situation where a correct alternative exists). The tenacious classical
ˆ
Bayesian behaviour [14] then implies that providing partial information ηˆ = Y + εˆ about
14
the truth will have little impact. Instead, if the person is given information, not about the
ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ
choice Y, but about X in the form ξ = X+εˆ, where the magnitude of noise εˆis small, then
after acquisition of this information the state will change into one of the two possible Lu¨ders
ˆ
states. These two states will be close to one of the two eigenstates of X. If subsequently
ˆ
partial information ηˆ= Y +εˆis provided, then irrespective of which Lu¨ders state is chosen,
the state of mind will now transform into one that is close to the truth. Thus the quantum
formalism opens up a new possibility that was unavailable with the classical reasonings.
