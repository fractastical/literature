Abstract. This work presents a fault-tolerant control scheme for sen-

boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following
a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunc-
tioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on
active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori
threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor preci-

1 Introduction
Safety is paramount for autonomous systems designed for operating in
the real world. External dangers in the environment such as steep and
slippery terrain encountered by planetary rovers [15] can compromise
entiremissions.Inadditiontoexternaldangers,internalsystemcompo-
nents can also fail and possibly lead to dangerous outcomes if a proper
fault-tolerant(FT)controlschemeisnotpresent.Buildingsystemsthat

tuators, is addressed in the FT literature [24,32,8]. Generally speaking,

thresholds: the sensor is ‘faulty’ if a threshold is exceeded or ‘healthy’
otherwise. To recover from a fault, the recovery actions are usually per-
formedthroughcontrollerreconfiguration,thatentailsadaptingthecon-
troller parameters, or switching to another controller or to backup sen-
sorsandactuators[22].Whenmodellingexternaldangersormonitoring
faultysystems,robustdetectionthresholdsareessential.Robustthresh-
olds used in existing work (such as [7] or [32]) are often deterministic,
but this is sub-optimal. For instance, if the safety threshold for a rover
on a slippery terrain slope is 15 degrees, this means that a slope of 14.9
is safe but 15.1 is unsafe. Additionally, a slope of 15.1 degrees and 40
degrees are ‘equally unsafe’.
Inthispaperwebuildupontwoideasintheliterature.First,theusageof
astochasticfaulttolerantformulation(e.g.[9,30]).Thisallowstheagent
to overcome the issues mentioned above. Additionally, we leverage an
unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC) [3], evolved from previous
activeinferencecontrollers(AIC)[6,1,25].Activeinferenceisapromising
framework for FT control which has already been shown to facilitate
fault-detection, isolation and recovery for robotic systems with sensory
faults [3,26].
Besides fault tolerance, active inference showed promising performance
in many control and state-estimation problems in robotics [16,17]. Par-
ticularlyinterestingaretheworksonrobotarmcontrol[25,23,29],which
highlighted the adaptive properties of active inference. Active inference
also shares similarities with the control as inference framework [18]. A
more extensive analysis of active inference and its relation to control as
inference can be found in [20,14].
The main contribution of this paper is a FT controller for robot ma-
nipulators with sensory faults based on unbiased active inference with
a stochastic decisionboundary. Unlike previous work [3], here we model
the precision (inverse covariance) of each sensor in our system and de-
terminetheprobabilityofthesensorbeinghealthytobeproportionalto
its precision. Our approach allows for fault-tolerant behaviour without
needinganythresholddefinitionapriori,andwithouttheneedtodesign
additional ad-hoc recovery mechanisms. Finally, this work can be used
stand-aloneorinconjunctionwithothermethodsforfault-detectionand
isolation in order to estimate the faults.
2 Problem statement and background
The FT scheme in this paper is derived for a class of systems, namely
serial robot manipulators equipped with sensors for joint position and
velocity, and end-effector location. In the following, the problem and
the setup are described, and some background knowledge on u-AIC for
torque control from [3] is presented.

Background: Unbiased Active Inference controller In this
section we briefly describe the u-AIC as introduced in [3], to which an
interested reader is referred for more details on the derivations of the
following equations. The novel FT method presented in this paper in
Sec. 3 builds upon the u-AIC, but instead of employing an ad-hoc hard
update of the precision of a faulty sensor after fault detection, it relies
on online precision learning during operations.

Note that with the u-AIC the information about the desired goal to be
reachedisencodedinthedistributionp(u|x).Inthispaper,asin[1],we
assume that an accurate dynamic model of the system is not available
to keep the solution system agnostic and to highlight once again the
adaptability of the controller.
Theu-AICaimsatfindingtheposterioroverstatesaswellastheposte-
rior over actions p(x,u|y ,y ). The posteriors are approximated using

3 Precision Learning for fault-tolerant control
In previous work [3], the u-AIC is used in combination with an estab-
lishedFTapproachtoachievefaultdetectionandrecovery.Inparticular,
the sensory prediction errors in the free-energy are used as residual sig-
nalsforfaultdetectionpurposes.Thestatisticalpropertiesoftheresidu-
als are analysed offline and healthy boundaries are defined. At runtime,
a healthy residual set is computed and if the current residual is out-
side the admissible set, the relative sensor is marked as faulty. When a
fault is detected, the precision (or inverse covariance) of the sensor is
abruptly set to zero, that is P =Σ−1 =0, to exclude that sensor from
the optimization of the free-energy. This idea is summarised in Fig. 1.
In this work, we propose a different approach to achieve fault recov-
ery through online precision learning with u-AIC instead ad-hoc hard
switchesinthecontroller’sparameters.Fig.2showstheedifferencewith
respect to [3].

Intuitively, when a sensor is faulty, the related sensory prediction error
willnecessarilybehighersincesensoryreadingsandinternalbeliefswill
drift away. After a fault, the estimated precision through our precision
learning scheme will be much lower than the original P = Σ−1. Thus
its weight in the free-energy F, and so in the state-estimation and con-
trol equations as in eq. (5) will naturally become lower than the other
healthysensors.Itsweightessentiallyadjustsproportionallytothedegree
of the sensor being faulty. Note that this allows for automatic fault re-
coverybutitdoesnotprovideexplicitfaultdetection.Incasethelatter
isneededforapotentialuseroranadditionalsupervisorysystem,tradi-
tional techniques can be used as the one presented in [3] in conjunction
with precision learning.
FT control for sensory faults can now be done using precision learning
in several ways. The first way is to use it as a stand-alone and acti-
vate precision learning for all sensors during operation. In this case, no
other methods are needed, no thresholds are designed and the recovery
emerges naturally. As mentioned before, the drawback is that the users
can not be ‘alerted’ for the presence of a fault (since there is no explicit
fault-detection).Thesecondway,whichaddressesthisissue,istousean
established algorithm for fault detection (such as the one presented in
[3]) and then, only after a fault is detected, allow precision update.
Interestingly, performing precision learning as presented in this section
can make the state-estimation noisier since the agents only relies on
the current observation (rather than a batch of last k observations) for
the update and both the uncertainty of the state and precision are not
quantified. An additional approach would then be to consider the last k
observations for the update, but this is out of the scope of this work.

at all times or only after a fault is detected. Activating the precision
learning at all times with a small step-size for the gradient seems to
work best.

5 Improving precision learning: a discussion
In this paper, we perform a simple modification to the unbiased active
inference controller: adding precision learning for all sensors. We show
that this results in stochastic fault-tolerance to sensory faults, i.e. the
precision of a faulty sensor will decrease automatically making its rela-
tive weight in the control and estimation laws smaller. This eliminates
the need to learn a threshold from data offline. Additionally, no ah-hoc
recovery action is required. The controller automatically adjusts to the
new precision.
Intheexperiments,wecomparedprecisionlearningtoastate-of-the-art
method. Precision learning was an order of magnitude worse in perfor-
mancebutstillsatisfactory.Notethatprecisionlearningdidnot require
any data or training offline to determine thresholds or recovery strate-
gies.Finally,precisionlearningperformsstochasticfault-detectionrather
than deterministic.
Most importantly, this approach based on precision learning can be im-
proved in many ways. First, rather than computing a point-mass esti-
mate, we can explicitly model the precision as a random variable and
perform inference on it.
We can perform Bayesian inference by modelling the precision as a ran-
dom variable and computing a posterior over it. In the one dimensional
case we use a Gamma prior on the precision ω as
ba
Γ(ω;a,b)= ωa−1e−ωb.

Γ(5) = 4! = 24. Now to compute the posterior, we multiply the prior
with the Gaussian likelihood model of p(y|ω) and obtain the posterior
which is also a Gamma distribution as shown below.
p(ω)=Γ(ω;a,b)∝ωa−1e−ωb

The last equation shows a simple update rule to modify the belief over
the precision for every data point. In the optimization for the state, the
followingquantitiesareused:expectedprecisionE[ω]=a/b,Mode[ω]=
(a−1)/bandVar[ω]=a/b2.Inthen-dimensionalcase,thesameproce-
durecanbedonebutwithaWishartdistributionratherthanaGamma.
Additionally, we could use a batch of k observation to learn the pre-
cision rather than just one observation. Many approaches for covari-
ance/precisionestimationhavebeensuccessfulinroboticse.g.[33,27,34,31].
Additionally, many other approaches within the active inference litera-
turecanbeusedforeffectiveprecisionlearningsuchasdynamicexpecta-

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Towards Stochastic Fault-tolerant Control using Precision Learning and Active Inference"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
