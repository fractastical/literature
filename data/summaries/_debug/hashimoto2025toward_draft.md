### Toward Ownership Understanding of Objects: Active Question Generation with Large Language Model and Probabilistic Generative Model – Summary### OverviewThis paper investigates the challenge of enabling robots to understand object ownership within domestic environments. The authors propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that leverages a probabilistic generative model and large language models (LLMs) to efficiently acquire ownership knowledge. ActOwL dynamically generates questions to users, maximizing information gain and reducing the burden of manual instruction. The core idea is to integrate multimodal information—object position, attributes, and user answers—to build a robust ownership distribution.### MethodologyActOwL operates through a series of interconnected steps. First, the robot explores the environment to obtain object positions and attributes. Then, it classifies objects as either shared or owned using an LLM, guided by commonsense knowledge. For candidate-owned objects, the system calculates information gain (IG) to identify the most informative object to query. Finally, the robot generates a natural language question using the LLM and asks the user for an answer. The user’s response is then incorporated into the probabilistic generative model, updating the ownership distribution. The model utilizes a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to estimate the posterior distribution of ownership concepts. The model is trained using multimodal observations and user answers. The key components include: a probabilistic generative model, a multimodal representation of objects, and an LLM for question generation and interpretation. The system incorporates a weighting coefficient of0.1 for the attribute modality to account for the influence of attributes in the environment.### Key FindingsThe experiments demonstrated that ActOwL achieves significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions compared to baseline methods. Specifically, in the first experiment, ActOwL achieved an ARI of0.8, while the IG-min method achieved0.7 and the Random method achieved0.6. In the second experiment, ActOwL achieved an ARI of0.9, outperforming the other methods. The number of questions required to reach a given ARI was substantially reduced with ActOwL. The authors state: "The proposed method achieves higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods." They note: "The probabilistic generative model efficiently learns the ownership distribution by integrating multimodal information and user answers." The study demonstrates that the combination of spatial and attribute information is crucial for accurate ownership inference. The authors further argue: "Bypre-classifying shared objects, the robot excludes them from question generation, avoiding unnecessary queries."### ResultsThe results show that ActOwL consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

The authors state: “The proposed method achieves higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods.” The study demonstrates that the combination of spatial and attribute information is crucial for accurate ownership inference. The authors further argue: “Bypre-classifying shared objects, the robot excludes them from question generation, avoiding unnecessary queries.” The use of an LLM for question generation allows for natural and flexible interactions with users. The incorporation of user answers into the probabilistic generative model enables continuous learning and adaptation. The use of RBPF allows for efficient estimation of the posterior distribution of ownership concepts.
