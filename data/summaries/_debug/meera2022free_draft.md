### OverviewThis paper investigates the noise smoothness estimation of linear systems with colored noise using the free energy principle (FEP). The authors introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator, DEMs, designed for state and noise smoothness estimation. DEMs leverages the FEP to minimize free energy, offering a competitive approach to state estimation under colored noise conditions. The core contribution of this work lies in providing a practical and robust method for state estimation in systems subjected to colored noise, addressing a critical challenge in robotics and control applications.### MethodologyThe authors introduce DEMs, a state and noise smoothness observer based on FEP. The methodology centers around minimizing the free energy, which is a measure of information-theoretic uncertainty. The system dynamics are described by a linear plant equation (Equation1), where x is the hidden state, v is the input, and y is the output. The key innovation is the use of generalized coordinates, enabling the estimation of the state and noise smoothness parameter (s) simultaneously. The noise precision (Πw and Πz) is modeled as colored noise, reflecting the unmodeled wind currents. The algorithm utilizes a gradient ascent scheme to maximize the free energy, which is calculated as the sum of precision weighted prediction errors and the information entropy (Equation7). The algorithm incorporates a Newton-Gauss update scheme to efficiently estimate the state and noise smoothness parameter (s) (Equations15 and16). The DEMs observer design uses a mean-field assumption, simplifying the calculations and enabling the estimation of the state and noise smoothness parameter (s) through two fundamental assumptions: i) mean field assumption that facilitates a conditional independence between the subdensities, and ii) Laplace assumption that facilitates the use of Gaussian distributions with mean µ and variance Σ over these subdensities, q(x˜) and q(s).### ResultsThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DEMs through rigorous simulations and a real-world experiment. The simulation results (Figure1) show that DEMs converges to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation, achieving accurate state estimation across a range of noise smoothness values. The gradient ascent scheme successfully estimates the state and noise smoothness parameter (s) (Equation7). The simulation results (Figure2) show the free energy vs s curve at different time instances during the quadrotor flight, demonstrating a clear maximum, similar to the simulation results from Figure1. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of DEMs in a real-world quadrotor flight experiment (Figure6), where DEMs outperforms other benchmarks like KF, SA and SMIKF with minimal estimation error. The simulation results (Figure5) show that DEMs outperforms KF, SA and SMIKF with minimal estimation error. The authors highlight the robustness of DEMs in the presence of colored noise, demonstrating its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art observers.### DiscussionThe authors’ key finding is that DEMs provides a robust and efficient method for state estimation under colored noise. The use of the free energy principle and gradient ascent scheme enables DEMs to accurately estimate the state and noise smoothness parameter (s) simultaneously. The authors demonstrate that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art observers like KF, SMIKF and SA in both simulation and real-world experiments. The online nature of the estimator allows for real-time adaptation to changing noise conditions. The authors emphasize the importance of accurately estimating the noise smoothness parameter (s) for optimal performance. The authors’ findings have significant implications for robotics and control applications, particularly in autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the current work, including the absence of a stability proof for the joint state and noise smoothness observer, which can be the focus of future research. The authors could extend this work to solve the general active inference problem for the estimation and control of nonlinear systems with colored noise.
