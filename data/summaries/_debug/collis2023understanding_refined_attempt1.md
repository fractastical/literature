### OverviewThis paper investigates the processes of tool discovery and tool innovation using the framework of active inference. It articulates a distinction between these concepts, defining tool use as “the exertion of control over a freely manipulable external object (the tool) with the goal of altering the physical properties of another object, substance, surface or medium (the target, which may be the tool user or another organism) via a dynamic mechanical interaction.” However, it highlights that developing an understanding of how to use a given tool is significantly different from the process of inventing a new tool. The paper proposes a minimal model to explore tool innovation, incorporating tool affordances into the hidden states of the generative model to facilitate offline induction of appropriate tool properties.### MethodologyThe research employs a computational model to investigate tool innovation within a discrete-state space utilising partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The model incorporates a generative model with hidden states and tool states. The model utilises a uniform distribution for the transition likelihood model, allowing the agent to learn state transitions through exploration. The agents are initialised with a uniform distribution and the model is implemented in Python using the pymdp package, which facilitates Bayesian model inversion and the updating of model parameters based on observed data. The agents are exposed to different reward locations to test the model’s ability to solve the task.### ResultsThe study demonstrates that the agent can straightforwardly use tools optimally to solve a task when a perfect generative model is provided. Furthermore, the agent can discover the correct tools and learn to solve the task when it is not provided with this information in its model a priori. The results highlight that the model’s ability to learn state transitions and to conceptualise the appropriate tool properties is key to solving the task.### DiscussionThe paper articulates a distinction between tool use and tool innovation, defining tool use as the exertion of control over a freely manipulable external object (the tool) with the goal of altering the physical properties of another object, substance, surface or medium (the target, which may be the tool user or another organism) via a dynamic mechanical interaction.
