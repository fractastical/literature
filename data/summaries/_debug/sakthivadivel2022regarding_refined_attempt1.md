### Regarding Flows Under the Free Energy Principle: A Comment on “How Particular is the Physics of the Free Energy Principle?” by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz, and BuckleyThis summary analyzes Dalton A R Sakthivadivel’s “Regarding Flows Under the Free Energy Principle: A Comment on “How Particular is the Physics of the Free Energy Principle?” by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz, and Buckley.” The paper investigates the core argument of the original critique, which posits that the Free Energy Principle (FEP), when applied in its conventional state-based formulation, is uninformative about the dynamics of many physical systems. This summary extracts key quotes, identifies central claims, and summarizes the paper’s findings, emphasizing the proposed shift towards a path-based model as a potential solution to the identified limitations.The authors state: “In [AMTB22, section3.2], the authors discuss how the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, respectively, are uniformative about a linear system’s behaviour.” This observation is supported by Figure5 of the target paper, which demonstrates a “poor correlation between system dynamics and marginal dynamics,” leading to the conclusion that the FEP is a “poor descriptor of the system.” The core of the critique rests on the assumption that the FEP, in its standard formulation, struggles to capture the complexities of systems exhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics. The authors argue that the lack of solenoidal couplings—a feature they deem indicative of system-ness—suggests that the FEP is not universally applicable. As the authors note, “The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”The paper proposes a shift towards a path-based formulation of the FEP as a potential solution. One might expect path-based descriptions to be superior to state-based ones for one simple reason: “maximum calibre is asymptotically maximum entropy.” This laconic statement hides a more profound observation that systems in non-equilibrium regimes, where fluctuations do not obey the ensemble properties typical of a system, are described well by probabilities over the possible trajectories of the system instead. The authors further elaborate on this point, noting that this is referred to as the principle of maximum calibre by Jaynes. “Besides maximum calibre, the evolution of diffusing systems in non-stationary regimes is famously solved backwards by the path integral.” The authors state throughout that “generalised coordinates of motion are the proper, dynamical setting for the FEP, and that connections between the FEP and the fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics are natural.” In the recent papers [FCS+22] and [BDCF+22], this is used to great effect.The authors highlight the importance of considering the system’s evolution over time. “The authors note that free energy is not a useful quantity to describe simple systems, and that it will be even more difficult to use the FEP insightfully in the more complicated systems which are of interest to the FEP.” The authors argue that the FEP, in its standard formulation, struggles to capture the complexities of systems exhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics. The authors further state: “As it is argued, the consequence of this is that sparse coupling is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.” The authors’ approach involves a critical examination of the assumptions underlying the FEP’s state-based formulation, specifically the reliance on gradients and marginal flows.The paper proposes a shift towards a path-based formulation of the FEP as a potential solution. “One might expect path-based descriptions to be superior to state-based ones for one simple reason: maximum calibre is asymptotically maximum entropy.” The authors’ argument is that the FEP, in its standard formulation, struggles to capture the complexities of systems exhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics.
