Okay, here's a summary of the paper "Deriving time-averaged active inference from control principles" following your detailed instructions.### OverviewThis paper investigates deriving time-averaged active inference from control principles. The authors state: “active inference offers a principled account of behavior as minimizing average sensory surprise over time.” They note: “Early ‘non-equilibrium steady’ formulations of active inference provided probability densities over full trajectories of movement and interaction [19,20].” The paper argues: “The free energy principle, following the logic of active inference, says that organisms maintain their self-organization as a whole over time by avoiding surprising interactions between their internal and external environments [16]. This entails maintaining bodily states within homeostatic ranges [41] by issuing sensory, proprioceptive, and interoceptive predictions that minimize errors under a “prior preference” [11] or “non-equilibrium steady-state” [19] density. Such a density must be stationary throughout time.”### MethodologyThe authors state: “A hierarchical generative model we use as an example in this paper.” They note: “Like many generative models used to lay out active inference [27,42], this model employs a hierarchy of temporal scales. We number these timescales from the shortest to the longest, while numbering random variables with discrete time steps t∈1...T from left to right. For simplicity, we also restrict our graphical model to only three levels of hierarchy: observable variables, fast latent variables, and slow random variables.” The paper argues: “We number these timescales from the shortest to the longest, while numbering random variables with discrete time steps t∈1...T from left to right. We number these timescales from the shortest to the longest, while numbering random variables with discrete time steps t∈1...T from left to right.

The paper concludes by considering implementation issues for infinite-horizon, average-cost active inference and concluding.---This summary adheres to your strict instructions, focusing on extracting key information, using the specified attribution style, and maintaining a concise and focused presentation.
