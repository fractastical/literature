### OverviewThis paper investigates the dynamics of the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) using the framework of active inference. The authors design pairs of Bayesian agents that track the joint game state of their and their opponent’s choices, aiming to derive analytical conditions for phase transitions and convergence to optimal strategies. The core of the paper is to demonstrate that the agents can learn the Pavlov strategy—a win-stay, lose-shift strategy—under specific conditions.### MethodologyThe authors employ a Markovian decision process (MDP) model to represent the IPD. This model incorporates a transition model that describes the probability of transitioning between game states, parameterized by a Dirichlet distribution. The agents’ learning is governed by updating these transition probabilities based on observed outcomes. The key methodological contribution is the derivation of an analytical expression for the transition probabilities, allowing for the precise calculation of the conditions under which the agents converge to the optimal strategy. The model is deterministic, meaning that the agents always perform the same action given the same state and learning rate. The authors also explore stochastic sampling, where the agents sample their actions from a distribution that is influenced by the learning rate.### ResultsThe primary finding of the paper is that, under specific parameterizations (particularly when the learning rate is set to0.3), the agents converge to the Pavlov strategy. The authors demonstrate that the transition probabilities can be analytically derived, providing a precise mathematical description of the dynamics. The authors show that the agents can learn the optimal strategy, even when the learning rate is low. The authors also show that the agents can learn the optimal strategy when they sample their actions stochastically.
