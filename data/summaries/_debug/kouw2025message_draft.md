### OverviewThis paper investigates the design of an autoregressive active inference agent for robot navigation. The authors present a message-passing-based inference algorithm on a factor graph, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space. The agent learns by minimizing expected free energy, modulating action based on predictive uncertainty, and arrives later but with a better model of the robot’s dynamics compared to a classical optimal controller.### MethodologyThe authors build an autoregressive model where the system output at time *k* is predicted from the system input *u*, *M* previous system inputs *u¯*, and *M* previous system outputs *y¯*. The likelihood function is based on a Gaussian distribution, with a regression coefficient matrix *A* and a precision matrix *W*. The prior distribution over parameters is a matrix normal Wishart distribution. The agent utilizes Bayesian filtering to update parameter beliefs given observations, and the inference is performed via message passing on a factor graph (Figure1). The authors implement a variational approximation to the inference, using a Gaussian distribution to approximate the posterior predictive distribution. The expected free energy functional is minimized to determine the optimal control action. The authors use a Lagrange multiplier to ensure the control action is constrained to be within the feasible control space. The authors use a1-step ahead expected free energy minimization to determine the optimal control action.### ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed agent successfully navigates a robot to a goal position in a single trial. The agent achieves a smaller free energy compared to a classical optimal controller. The agent arrives later but with a better model of the robot’s dynamics. The agent utilizes maximum power to get closer to the goal. The authors show that the agent achieves a smaller free energy compared to a classical optimal controller.
