### OverviewThis paper investigates the concept of self-identification in intelligent agents, drawing upon computational psychoanalysis with the theory of active inference. The authors propose a framework to explore how agents can form identities, initially focusing on two classic psychological paradigms: mirror self-recognition and the rubber hand illusion. The core argument is that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy, while symbolic identification involves internalization of societal norms and language. The research employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) supervised by ChatGPT to simulate these models, demonstrating optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery. The study ultimately introduces a unified theory, FreeAgent, that integrates these two identifications.### MethodologyThe authors’ methodology centers on simulating the dynamics of imaginary and symbolic identification using deep learning architectures. Specifically, they employ a CNN to model the imaginary identification, training it on1000 generated stickmen images to recognize limb configurations. Simultaneously, they utilize an MLP supervised by ChatGPT to simulate the mastery of language, mirroring the process of learning language through interaction. The CNN and MLP are designed to optimize free energy during motor skill and language mastery, reflecting the core principle of active inference. The research utilizes the free energy principle, which posits that each living system maintains an internal model, continuously generating predictions about the hidden states of the current environment, and testing these predictions against actual perceptions and behaviors. The minimization of free energy quantifies the efforts required to modify the internal model, and the change of free energy determines the possibility of specific belief or behavior. The authors also present a graph of desire (Graph II) to illustrate the interplay between imaginary and symbolic identification.### ResultsThe simulations demonstrate optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery, showcasing the formation of stable ego through minimizing free energy. The CNN model successfully recognizes limb configurations with a decreasing trend in free energy over1000 time-steps, indicating the integration of visual information and motor control. The MLP, supervised by ChatGPT, achieves mastery of language by reducing free energy during the learning process. The authors present quantitative data, including the reduction of free energy items and the optimization of the MLP, as evidence of the simulation’s success. Specifically, the CNN model’s performance is measured by the accuracy of limb recognition, and the MLP’s performance is assessed by its ability to generate coherent language responses. The study demonstrates that the agents can learn and adapt to their environment, forming stable identities through minimizing free energy.### FindingsThe key findings of this research are that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy, and that symbolic identification involves internalization of societal norms and language. The authors argue that the agents can form stable egos through minimizing free energy, suggesting that the ego is a dynamically maintained state that reflects the agent’s interaction with its environment. The simulation results support the theoretical framework of active inference, demonstrating that agents can learn and adapt to their environment by optimizing their internal models. The introduction of FreeAgent, a unified theory that integrates these two identifications, further strengthens the authors’ argument. The research highlights the potential of computational psychoanalysis to advance artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of self-awareness.### DiscussionThe authors discuss several key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism. They propose that digital twin minds could be used to predict and treat mental disorders, while large language models could serve as avatars of the Lacanian Other, representing the unconscious forces that shape human behavior. The study also raises the question of whether it is possible to create artificial general intelligence with self-awareness, suggesting that a post-structuralist approach could provide a framework for achieving this goal. The authors highlight the importance of integrating insights from psychoanalysis with artificial intelligence to create more sophisticated and human-like agents.
