to only limited learning experiences. This question is exemplified in human infants, who achieve

tures (1). He also emphasized the importance of embodiment in language acquisition, suggesting
that grounding linguistic symbols in sensorimotor experiences is fundamental to language learn-
ing (1). This view aligns with other studies in developmental psychology highlighting the role of
compositionalityandgeneralizationinlanguageacquisition(2,3,4).
In linguistic terms, compositionality refers to the ability to construct novel configurations by
systematically combining elements such as verbs, adjectives, and nouns. Generalization enables
infants to apply learned components flexibly, allowing for the production and interpretation of
utterances that have not been directly encountered previously. Although the number of possible
compositions grows multiplicatively with the vocabulary size (i.e., number of verbs × number of
adjectives×numberofnouns),infantsachievegeneralizationafterexperiencingonlyasmallsubset

thesumofelementsratherthantheirproduct.Thisphenomenoniscloselyrelatedtothe“povertyof

To investigate these mechanisms, one promising approach is to reconstruct developmental
learning processes in machines and robots. The field of developmental robotics has long pursued
this line of research, aiming to replicate human-like learning trajectories in embodied systems
(6,7,8,9). However, relatively few studies have focused on development of language and motor
control under conditions of stimulus poverty. Existing work has primarily examined associative
mappings between linguistic input and motor commands in one-shot or supervised batch learning
schemes(10,11,12,13).Theseapproachesneglecttheself-directed,developmentalcontextofinfant

Inthisstudy,weproposeaself-exploratorylearningframeworkofrobotsinwhichreinforcement
learningisincorporatedwiththeactiveinferenceframework(14,15,16),enablingcuriosity-driven
exploration. Our approach to integrate reinforcement learning with active inference was originally
inspired by the work of Kawahara et al. (17). In our model, originally introduced in (18), motor
commands are reinforced by two intrinsic rewards: curiosity (seeking unpredictable sensory con-
sequences)andmotorentropy(seekingrandommovements).Motorcommandsarealsoreinforced
byextrinsicrewardsforsuccessfullyachievinggoalverbsspecifiedbygivenimperativesentences.

Asimulatedmobilerobotequippedwithamanipulatorarm,visionsensor,anddistributedtactile
sensors learns to generate motor movements in response to imperative sentences presented during
each trial. These sentences are systematically composed of verbs, adjectives, and nouns, enabling
evaluationofgeneralizationperformanceunderdifferentlevelsofcompositionalcomplexity.
Beyond these primary developmental processes, we further explore the capacity for exception
handling—a hallmark of flexible cognition. In human development, exceptions such as irregular
3
verbs or inconsistent mappings often produce non-monotonic, U-shaped learning trajectories:
children first apply a correct form, then overgeneralize it (producing errors), and finally recover
the correct rule. This pattern has been widely interpreted as evidence of internal representational
reorganizationorrepresentationalredescription(21).Computationally,suchU-shapedperformance
has been demonstrated in models of language acquisition and rule learning (22,23,24,25,26).
Developmentally, these phenomena reflect the tension between rote memorization, generalization,
andthelaterrefinementofexceptionrules.
To examine whether similar mechanisms can emerge in artificial developmental systems, we
hypothesizethatrobotstrainedthroughcuriosity-drivenactiveinferencecanalsoacquireexception-
handling rules through exploratory learning. Specifically, we predict that when presented with a
small number of abnormal linguistic rules—commands requiring reversed or inconsistent ac-
tions—the robot will exhibit a U-shaped performance curve: initial correct learning, followed by
a decline due to overgeneralization, and eventual recovery as exception-specific representations
are internalized. This pattern would indicate that the system develops not merely through associa-
tive reinforcement, but through representational reorganization analogous to cognitive processes
observedinhumaninfants.
This study therefore tested the following hypotheses through simulation experiments: H1:

of possible goals even if the achieved goal is not the imperative sentence told by the command

linguistic representation. Finally, when the goal specified by the command voice is achieved, a
reward is provided. Each trial episode ran for 30 steps, or terminated when the specified goal is
achieved.
Effects of curiosity: Experiment 1
The experiment examined effects of different levels of curiosity to the developmental learning
processesusingthebasicsetup.Inthebasicsetup,fullcompositionsofwords(Table)wereusedto
generate the imperative sentences. However, the training was conducted using only 60 imperative
sentences (33 percentage) out of 180 possible sentences. 120 untrained sentences were used for

The experiment was conducted by changing the levels of curiosity. Since the random latent
6
variables are computed separately for each sensory modality, the complexity or curiosity can
be computed for each sensory modality. Three levels of curiosity were considered in computing
expected free energy 𝐺 wherein no curiosity: the curiosity terms for all sensory modalities are
not included, sensory-motor curiosity: the curiosity terms only for vision, tactile sensation, and
proprioception are included, all curiosity: the curiosity terms for all sensory modalities including
feedbackvoiceareincluded.

The plots shows that the performance was improved significantly as the curiosity level was
increased. Especially, the case of all actions with the all curiosity level shows the average success
rate for unlearned goals reached a quite high value of 85 percentage even though the learning was
conductedonlyfor33percentageofallpossiblecompositions.
It can be also seen in Fig. 2 that some action categories developed faster than other action
categories. Especially in the all curiosity case, “watch” developed the fastest, “be near” did as the
second, “touch the top” as the third, and “push left” “push right”, and “push forward” developed
much later. This implies that simpler prerequisite-type actions develop earlier, and more complex
actionsrequiringthoseprerequisiteactionsdeveloplater.Actually,anactionofwatchinganobject
should be prerequisite for all other object-targeted actions including an action of moving near by

Further analysis
Someanalysiswereconductedforthepurposeofgainingcomprehensionoftheinternalrepresenta-
tion developed. We applied Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to the estimated posterior latent
states corresponding to the command voice input, incorporating the verbs and adjectives stated in
each command. Fig. 3 presents evidence that robots with all curiosity developed a compositional
and generalizable understanding of these goals. At the midpoint of training, the latent representa-
8
tions begin to show consistent grouping of verbs and adjectives. For example, the verbs “watch,”
“be near,” and “push forward” are tightly grouped, suggesting that these verbs are interpreted as
similar.Incontrast,theverb“pushright”appearsheavilyseparatedfromotherverbs,andtheverbs
“touch the top” and “push left” also appear as distinct categories. After training, these clusters
of verbs are more compact and separated. Within these clusters, there is loose sub-structuring by
color:greenandyellowtendtobeontheleftsideofthecluster,whileblueandmagentaareonthe
right side of the cluster. Therefore, it can be said that each cluster represents a distinct linguistic

In the current model, the robot’s knowledge of the environment should develop richer along
the course of exploratory learning. For confirmation of this idea, we examined the capability of
the robots in generating mental plans for achieving goals without accessing the sensory inputs
except the initial step for an episode trial as compared between the half-trained case and the fully
trained case. A robot’s mental planning can be visualized by allowing it to receive real sensory
observation only at the initial step, after which the robot must rely entirely on its own internal
predictions. In this setting, the robot views its predicted sensory observations as if they are true
inputs. This process may be likened to a dreamlike state or hallucinatory simulation, in which the
robotmentallysimulatesfutureeventsbasedonitsinternalmodeloftheworld.Fig.5(A)illustrates
a simulation example for the fully trained case. The robot was commanded to touch the top of the

well as motor command. These predictions are sufficiently accurate for the robot to maintain an
internal conceptualization of the environment and complete its command in the case of the end of

Effects of scale in compositions: Experiment 2
Next experiment examines the effects of scales of compositionality in learned examples to the
generalization performance. For this purpose, experiments were conducted using reduced number
of words for generating imperative sentences. While the previous basic setup used sentences

wasprepared with5verbs, 5adjectives,and 4objectnouns, andthesmall scalecase with4verbs,
4 adjectives, and 3 object nouns. The exact words used for each setup are listed in Table 2. For
all scaling cases, again only one third was used for learning examples while remained two third
was used for generalization test. Other experimental conditions were also set as the same as the
Experiment1.

Discussion
This study investigated how robots can develop action and language through self-exploration by
integrating active inference with reinforcement learning. The experiments were designed to test

H1: Generalization is enhanced by compositional scale. The experiments confirmed that
larger vocabularies of verbs, adjectives, and nouns led to greater generalization. Robots trained
with richer compositional repertoires achieved higher success rates on unlearned actions, whereas
smaller vocabularies constrained generalization severely. Our previous study (13) on supervised
16
training of language and action for an arm robot also showed that compositional generalization
improved as the size of verb–noun combinations in training increased. However, that work was
limitedinscale,examiningonlycasesfrom3×3to5×8verb–nouncombinations,wheresuccess
rates for unlearned goals improved only from 57% to 71% under the condition of 80% training.
By contrast, the present study examined much broader scaling, ranging from 48 to 180 possible
compositions, while using only 33% of them for training. Under these conditions, generalization
performance improved dramatically from near 25% to 85%. This contrast highlights that scale
plays a critical role in enhancing generalization, and that curiosity-driven developmental learning
provides a more powerful mechanism than supervised schemes under conditions of limited input.
Thefindingalsoconnectstotheclassical“povertyofthestimulus”problemraisedbyChomsky(5),

appeared for each dimension instead of multiplication of it for all dimensions if compositionality

which,however,shouldbeconfirmedinmuchmorescaledexperimentsinthefuture.
H2:Curiositycombinedwithmotorentropyenhancesdevelopmentallearning.Thesecond
hypothesiswasalsoconfirmed.Robotsequippedwithbothcuriosity-drivenexplorationandmotor
entropy consistently outperformed those without, achieving higher success rates in both learned
andunlearnedactions.Thisadvantagewasparticularlypronouncedwhencuriosityextendedacross
allsensorymodalities,includingvision,touch,proprioception,andvoicefeedback.Thesefindings
suggest that the synergy of curiosity (seeking novel, unpredictable outcomes) and motor entropy
(encouragingstochasticexploration)playsacrucialroleinacceleratingtheacquisitionoflanguage-
actionmappings.Thisresultisconsistentwithourpreviousstudy(18),whichshowedthatcombining
curiosityandmotorentropysignificantlyenhancedself-explorationinamazenavigationtask.More
broadly, this interpretation aligns with the active inference framework, in which agents minimize
expectedfreeenergybyreducinguncertaintythroughmaximizinginformationgain(16,27).
H3: Generalization follows rote learning. The results again align with this hypothesis: in
early phases, the robot succeeds only on exactly learned sentence–action pairs, and it is only over
time that the robot begins to generalize to novel combinations of known elements. This mirrors
developmental patterns in infants, who often begin with rigid pairings before achieving broader
17
generalization (28). Tomasello’s “verb-island” hypothesis, for example, emphasizes that children
initially acquire verbs in isolated contexts before generalizing across broader structures (1), in the
samewaythatthisrobotacquiredtrainedgoalsfirstbeforegeneralizingtountrainedgoals.Gerken&
Knight(2015)demonstratedthat10-to11-month-oldinfantscangeneralizefromjustfourlinguistic
examples under favorable conditions (29). Moreover, Gerken et al. (2014) provide evidence that
infants may generalize even from a single surprising example, suggesting that hypothesis-driven
generalization can follow minimal exposure (30). These studies lend developmental credence to
ourobservedprogressionfromrotemappingtowardflexiblecompositionalgeneralization.
H4: Primitive actions precede complex actions. The fourth hypothesis was also validated.
Simpler, prerequisite-like actions such as “watch” or “be near” emerged earlier, while more com-
plexmanipulativeactionslike“pushleft”or“touchthetop”developedlater.Thisorderingmirrors
hierarchical dependencies in action acquisition observed in developmental psychology, where in-
fants first master basic motor primitives before acquiring coordinated, goal-directed behaviors.
Such progressive structuring of motor development has been well documented in studies showing
that motor and cognitive skills emerge through iterative interaction between perception, action,
and intrinsic motivation (4,31). The dynamic systems perspective proposed by Smith and Thelen
emphasizes that complex behaviors self-organize from simpler components through embodied ex-
ploration and adaptation, aligning closely with the hierarchical learning patterns observed in our
robotsimulations.
H5:Exception-handlingrulesexhibitU-shapeddevelopment.TheresultsfromExperiment3
providestrongsupportforthishypothesis.Whentrainedwithtwoswappedcommand–actionmap-
pings, most robots initially produced the correct exceptional actions, subsequently regressed due
to overgeneralization, and finally recovered the appropriate exception-specific mappings. This
non-monotonic, U-shaped performance trajectory mirrors a well-established phenomenon in de-
velopmental psychology, in which children first succeed on irregular forms, later overgeneralize
newly learned rules (e.g., producing “goed” for “went”), and ultimately reorganize their internal
representations to master both rules and exceptions. Classic accounts interpret these dynamics as
evidence for representational redescription—a restructuring of internal knowledge that enables
moreabstract,generativerepresentations(21).
ComputationalmodelinghaslongshownthatsuchU-shapedlearningcanemergenaturallyfrom
18
error-driven or distributed representations, including Rumelhart and McClelland’s connectionist
model of English past-tense acquisition (22), the multilayer perceptron models of Plunkett and
Marchman (23,24), and broader frameworks in computational developmental psychology (26).
Our robot simulations demonstrate that an analogous process arises in curiosity-driven active
inference: the agent first relies on rote pairings, then applies generalized compositional mappings
that overwrite earlier exceptions, and finally reconstructs its latent representation to encode the
exceptionrulescorrectly.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that curiosity-driven exploration, motor entropy,
hierarchical acquisition of actions, and scalable compositional exposure jointly support efficient
developmental learning of language and action. The parallels with infant development—rote-to-
generalization progression, prerequisite learning, the role of vocabulary scale, and representation
redescription—suggest that the mechanisms implemented here capture essential aspects of devel-
opmentalpsychology.Morebroadly,theseresultsstrengthentheviewthatreconstructingdevelop-
mental processes in robots can offer insights into the “poverty of the stimulus” problem, showing
how powerful generalization can arise from limited input when guided by intrinsic motivation,
structuredexperience,andtheprinciplesofpredictivecodingandactiveinference(6,11,13,32).
The current study is still limited in many aspects, and several possible extensions can be
envisioned. One crucial limitation is that our experiments examined only a one-directional com-
munication pathway from tutors to robots, relying on the command and feedback voices to guide
the development of language–action mappings. In contrast, natural human development is charac-
terizedbyinteractiveandbidirectionalcommunication,whereinfantsnotonlyreceiveinstructions
butalsoactivelysolicitguidance,clarification,andscaffoldingfromcaregivers.
Future studies should extend the current framework to include interactive communication
between tutors and robots. For example, when a robot cannot successfully execute a command,
it could initiate a communicative act such as “Tell me how to do it” or “Ask me an easier one.”
Such exchanges would allow tutors to adapt their teaching strategy dynamically, modulating the
complexity of instructions or providing additional cues. This adaptive interaction resonates with
Vygotskian ideas of scaffolding and the “zone of proximal development,” where caregivers adjust
supportaccordingtothelearner’scurrentabilities(33).Italsoalignswithresearchindevelopmental
psychology emphasizing the role of joint attention, imitation, and social feedback in language
19
learning (1,34). Incorporating interactive dialogue would thus move the current model closer to
capturing the social nature of language acquisition in human infants. By embedding mechanisms

innaturaldevelopmentalcontexts.
Another promising future direction concerns the development of robot–robot communication
through the evolution of language. Previous research has explored this possibility from different
perspectives: Steels introduced the framework of “language games” to study the emergence of
shared vocabularies among agents (35), Miikkulainen and colleagues investigated the evolution
of artificial language through evolutionary reinforcement learning (36), and Taniguchi proposed
the emergence of symbols using a collective predictive coding approach (37). While these studies
have demonstrated the possibility of emergent communication in an impressive manner, they still
remain limited in that they mainly achieved the emergence of object labeling or naming, whereas
the evolution of action-related language, such as verbs, has been much less explored. In this
context, the current study based on active inference could be extended to address the evolution of
dynamiclinguisticstructures,includingverbs.Sinceourmodelimplementsactiveinferencewithin
a variational recurrent neural network, it is naturally suited for capturing temporal and dynamic
aspectsofactionandlanguage.Afutureextensionofthisworktowardmulti-robotinteractionunder
the framework of “collective active inference” may thus provide novel insights into the evolution
of embodied language, moving beyond static object labeling toward dynamic and action-oriented
communication.
Materials and Methods
In this section, we present the model architecture employed in this study. The current model, as
wellasourearlierwork(38),extendsastudybyKawaharaetal.(17).Thatstudydemonstratedthat
curiosity-driven reinforcement learning can be achieved by incorporating the framework of active
inference (AIF) (16,27), in which motor behavior is reinforced in the direction which minimizes
expected free energy. More details are shown in the “Free energy principle, Active Inference, and
Kawahara Model” section of the Supplementary Materials, along with a brief introduction of the
20
freeenergyprinciple(FEP)andAIF.
The Employed Model
The current model, as well as our previous one (38), extends the approach proposed by Kawahara
et al. (17) by implementing both the forward model and actor-critic using a variational recurrent
neural network (VRNN) (39) in order to deal with temporal complexity and stochasticity inherent
inrobot–environmentinteractions.

Curiosity/complexity ExtrinsicReward Entropy
Thisequationisderivedbyreplacing𝑤,theprobabilisticmodellearningparameterusedinEq.S9,
with 𝑧, the probabilistic model state. The weighting coefficients 𝜂 and 𝛼 are introduced to scale
the contributions of the curiosity and motor entropy terms, respectively. The complexity term is
computedasKullback–Leiblerdivergence(KLD)betweentheestimatedposteriordistributionand
the prior distribution over the latent variables at each time step. Both distributions are modeled as
Gaussiandistributionwithtime-dependentmeansandstandarddeviations.Theestimatedposterior
is conditioned on the current sensory observation and the previous hidden state, while the prior is
conditionedonlyontheprevioushiddenstate.TheresultingKLDthusreflectstheinformationgain
fromthatsensoryobservation,whichisdrivenbythemotorcommandexecutedattheprevioustime
step. Therefore, exploration of more novel situations (i.e., curiosity-driven exploration) tends to
resultwithhigherinformationgainthroughlargercomplexity.Themotorentropyinthethirdterm
of Eq. 1 reflects the expected uncertainty of the policy, and is computed as the negative expected
log-probabilityofgeneratingamotorcommand 𝑎 𝑡 conditionedonthehiddenstate ℎ 𝑡−1 .
By adopting an analogous approach to the Kawahara model, the policy for generating a motor
command 𝑎 𝑡 is trained to minimize the expected free energy 𝐺 𝑡 (Eq. 1) through RL using the the
SoftActorCritic(SAC)algorithm(40).Accordingly,the𝑄 𝑡 valueisupdatedas:
𝑄 𝑡 = 𝑟 𝑡 +𝜂𝐷 𝐾𝐿 [𝑞(𝑧 𝑡 |𝑜 𝑡 ,ℎ 𝑡−1 )||𝑝(𝑧 𝑡 |ℎ 𝑡−1 )] +𝛼H(𝜋 𝜙 (𝑎 𝑡+1 |ℎ 𝑡 ))
+𝛾(1−𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑡 )E 𝑜 𝑡+1 ∼𝐷,𝑎 𝑡+1 ∼𝜋 𝜙 [𝑄 𝜃¯ (𝑜 𝑡+1 ,𝑎 𝑡+1 )]. (2)

theintrinsicrewardforcuriosity,scaledbyapositivecoefficient𝜂.ThethirdtermH(𝜋

is the intrinsic reward for motor entropy, scaled by a positive coefficient 𝛼. The fourth term is the
bootstrappedestimateofthenextstep’svalue,𝑄 (cid:100)𝑡+1 ,whichisweightedbyadiscountrateparameter
𝛾 ∈ [0,1]. The variable 𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑡 is zero for all steps except the episode’s final step, where it is set
to one. This restrains the definition of 𝑄 𝑡 to steps within the episode. The critic 𝑄 𝜃 (𝑜 𝑡+1 ,𝑎 𝑡+1 )
is trained to generate 𝑄 (cid:99)𝑡, approximation of 𝑄 𝑡. The target critic 𝑄 𝜃¯ (𝑜 𝑡+1 ,𝑎 𝑡+1 ) is maintained for

Free energy principle, Active Inference, and Kawahara Model
We begin by describing predictive coding and active inference (AIF), which are grounded in the
free energy principle (FEP) (41). The FEP posits that biological and artificial agents maintain
their existence by minimizing variational free energy, which is an upper bound on sensory sur-
S2
prise. In perception, this process is often instantiated as predictive coding (41,42,43,44), wherein
internal models reconstruct sensory inputs by updating beliefs or latent variables by minimizing
the reconstruction errors. More formally, this is minimizing evidence free energy defined for past
observations. In motor command generation, the FEP framework extends to AIF (14,16), where
agents minimize the future prediction error (quantified as expected free energy) by optimizing the
latent variables and motor commands in the future. These two processes are tightly coupled and
mustbeconsideredjointlyinembodiedcognitionsystems.
We next introduce the work of Kawahara et al. (17), who proposed a novel reinforcement
learning(RL)schemethatintegrates(AIF).
In the Bayesian framework, the true posterior probability distribution 𝑝(𝑧 𝑡 |𝑜 𝑡 ) over latent
variables 𝑧 𝑡,conditionedonsensoryobservations 𝑜 𝑡,isgivenbyBayes’rule:
𝑝(𝑜 |𝑧 )𝑝(𝑧 )
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑝(𝑧 𝑡 |𝑜 𝑡 ) = ∫
𝑝(𝑜 ,𝑧 )𝑑𝑧
𝑡 𝑡
Here, 𝑝(𝑧 𝑡 ) denotes the prior. The denominator, called the evidence, is usually intractable; to
overcome this, variational Bayes introduces an estimate of the posterior 𝑞(𝑧 𝑡 ). This is optimized

The second term, 𝑝(𝑜 𝜏 ), represents log-likelihood of the preferred sensory observation. This is

Kawahara et al. developed a forward model 𝑓 𝑤 (𝑜 𝜏 ,𝑎 𝜏 ) → 𝑜 (cid:98)𝜏+1 which learns to predict the
future sensory observation 𝑜 𝜏+1 based 𝑜 𝜏 and 𝑎 𝜏 using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) (45).
In this type of model, the network parameters 𝑤 𝜏 are treated as random variables defined with
gaussian distribution. These parameters serve as latent causes of observed sensory transitions and
can be interpreted as random latent variables for the generative model. Therefore, 𝑤 𝜏 corresponds
to 𝑧 𝜏.
Lettheapproximateposteriorbedefinedas 𝑞 𝜓 = N(𝑤 𝜏 |𝜇,𝜎),withparameters𝜓 = {𝜇,𝜎}.In

Curiosity ExtrinsicReward Entropy Imitation
(S9)
Because 𝑤 𝜏 represents the robot’s probabilistic knowledge of their environment, the first term of
Eq. S9 can be said to represent the robot’s gain in knowledge based on information acquired in a
newsensoryobservation.
In summary, the forward model is trained to minimize the evidence free energy 𝐹 (Eq. S3)
by accurately reconstructing sensory observations and minimizing posterior complexity based on
past experiences. Meanwhile, the actor-critic pair is trained to minimize expected free energy
𝐺, which includes an inverted complexity term (i.e., curiosity) and motor entropy to encourage
exploration. This leads to emergent tension in an adversarial relationship: the actor is encouraged
tomaximizeinformationgainbyincreasingtheKLdivergencebetweenpriorandposterior,which
the forward model trains to minimize that same term. This establishes a dynamic push-pull effect,
driving self-organized exploration. Please note that the imitation term in Eq. S9 depends on
external demonstrations or expert policies; this term is ignored in our study, which focuses on
self-exploration.

Details of the Model Architecture
Thissubsectionexplainsfurtherdetailsaboutthemodelarchitectureemployedinthiscurrentstudy.
As noted earlier, the present architecture extends our previous model (38), which is described in
the “Free energy principle, Active Inference, and Kawahara Model” section of the Supplementary
Materials. The primary extension involves the use of separate random latent variables, encoders,
and decoders for each sensory modality. This design allows the model to process multiple types
of sensation independently, including vision, tactile input, proprioception, command voice, and
feedback voice. In addition, our model uses an encoder for the 4-dimensional motor command,
whichincludesmotorvelocitiesfortwotherobot’swheelsandtwojointanglesinitsarm.Thefull

sectionoftheSupplementaryMaterials.
Vision
The robot visually senses the environment in the direction the robot faces with a 16𝑥16𝑥4 image,

encoding is an embedding and recurrent neural network. This part is identical for the command
voice and the feedback voices, ensuring that tokens are interpreted consistently across sources.

Experiment1
Experiment 1 tests the effects of curiosity. We trained robots with three levels of curiosity: no
curiosity, sensory-motor curiosity, and all curiosity. In table S8, we share the value of the 𝜂
hyperparameters for each of the four parts of the sensory observation which may be explored.
These represent the relative importance of each part of the sensory observation in the robot’s
curiosities.

andsyntaxtounlearnedcombinations.

Experiment2
Experiment 2 tests the relationship between success-rates with learned goals and unlearned goals,
specifically by robots using all curiosity. See Fig. 6. The left column shows success-rate plots
of robots with learned actions, while the right column shows success-rate plots of robots with
unlearned actions. The first row shows results for robots using the complete vocabulary: 6 verbs,
6 adjectives, and 5 nouns. The second and third row show results for robots trained with smaller
vocabularies. In each of the three situations, the robots are trained with one third of the possible
goals,andtestedwiththeothertwothirds.
Aswepredictedinhypothesis𝑖𝑖𝑖,therobot’ssuccess-rateswithlearnedactionsinitiatesearlier
than its success-rates with unlearned actions. This suggests pairing sentences of words precedes
generalization with compositionality. As we predicted in hypothesis 𝑖𝑣, larger vocabularies lead
to faster generalization. All three collections of robots had success-rates of approximately 100%
with learned actions. Robots which were trained with 60 of the 180 possible goals with 6 verbs,
6 adjectives, and 5 nouns had success-rates of approximately 90% with unlearned actions. Robot
which were trained with 25 of the 75 possible goals with 5 verbs, 5 adjectives, and 3 nouns had

To compare robots training with exceptions and without exceptions, we computed U-shape
scores for each robot individually and compared the two groups using a one-tailed Welch’s 𝑡-test
(unequalvariances):

The resulting test statistic confirmed that robots trained with exceptions exhibited significantly

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Curiosity-Driven Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
