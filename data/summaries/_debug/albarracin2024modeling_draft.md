### OverviewThis paper investigates modeling sustainable resource management using active inference. The authors present a computational model of an agent learning sustainable resource management strategies in both static and dynamic environments. The agent’s behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics. In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume resources to satisfy its needs. In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent’s actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability. The authors highlight active inference’s potential for understanding and shaping sustainable behaviors. “The authors state: “The agent’s behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics.”### MethodologyThe research employs active inference to simulate adaptive behavior and decision-making in an agent. The generative model for Case1, which is a static environment, includes hidden states for food availability (1, absent) and agent satiety (0, somewhat satiated,2: fully satiated). Observations directly correspond to these hidden states. The agent performs variational inference to optimize an approximate posterior Q(s ) over hidden states at each timestep, using the expected log likelihood of observations E[logP(o |s )]=Q(s )T logA. The transition matrix (B) specifies the state transitions based on the agent’s actions. “They note: “The agent performs variational inference to optimize an approximate posterior Q(s ) over hidden states at each timestep, using the expected log likelihood of observations E[logP(o |s )]=Q(s )T logA.” The likelihood matrix (A) assumes an identity mapping between hidden states and observations. “The authors state: “The agent performs variational inference to optimize an approximate posterior Q(s ) over hidden states at each timestep, using the expected log likelihood of observations E[logP(o |s )]=Q(s )T logA.”For Case2, a dynamic environment, the model expands to include more granularity in the states and observations, allowing for a wider range of behaviors and interactions between the agent and the environment. Both the observations and hidden states are expanded to have three levels each: food left (0, some, abundant) and satiety (0, not satiated,1, somewhat satiated,2: fully satiated). The agent’s preferences are designed to balance maintaining satiety and ensuring a sustainable food supply, encouraging the agent to maximize its satiety while also considering the long-term availability of food. “The authors state: “For Case2, a dynamic environment, the model expands to include more granularity in the states and observations, allowing for a wider range of behaviors and interactions between the agent and the environment.”### ResultsIn Case1, the agent consistently chooses to eat at every time step, reflecting its understanding that food is always available and that eating maximizes its satiety. Food availability remains constant throughout the simulation since the environment is static. The agent’s satiety increases as it eats and remains at a high level, indicating successful learning and adaptation to maintain a stable, high satiety state. “The authors state: “In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume resources to satisfy its needs.”In Case2, without learning, the agent either does not eat (as shown in the three plots on the left) or eats too much and therefore allows food in the environment to go to0 (as shown in the three plots on the right). As a result, the agent dies. “The authors state: “In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent’s actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability.”### DiscussionThe research demonstrates how active inference can give rise to sustainable resource management strategies at the level of an individual agent. The agent’s behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics. “The authors state: “The agent’s behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics.” The study demonstrates that the agent’s ability to adapt its behavior in response to changing environmental conditions is crucial for achieving sustainable outcomes. “They note: “In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent’s actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability.”
