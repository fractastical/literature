We develop the compositional theory of active inference by introducing activity, functorially
relating statistical games to the dynamical systems which play them, using the new notion of
approximateinferencedoctrine. Inordertoexhibitsuchfunctors,wefirstdevelopthenecessary
theory of dynamical systems, using a gen...
