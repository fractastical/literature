Okay, here’s a revised summary of the paper, adhering to the requested specifications and addressing all identified issues.**Active Inference is a Subtype of Variational Inference**Active inference, a framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty, is presented as a specific instantiation of variational inference. This approach leverages the principles of variational inference to derive a more focused and computationally tractable model for decision-making. The core of active inference is to minimize the expected cost of a decision, given a model of the environment and the decision-maker’s uncertainty. This minimization is achieved by minimizing the expected value of a cost function, which is dependent on the decision-maker’s uncertainty.The key components of active inference are: the cost function, the model of the environment, and the representation of uncertainty. The model represents the relationship between the decision-maker’s actions and the environment’s response. The representation of uncertainty is typically a Gaussian distribution, which represents the decision-maker’s belief about the state of the environment.
