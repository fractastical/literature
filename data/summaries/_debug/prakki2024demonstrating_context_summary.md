Abstract
Activeinferenceprovidesapowerfulmathematicalframeworkforunderstandinghowagents—biological
or artificial—interact with their environments, enabling continual adaptation and decision-making. It
combines the principles of Bayesian inference and free energy minimization to model the process of per-
