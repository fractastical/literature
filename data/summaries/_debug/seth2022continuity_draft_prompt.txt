Abstract. Bruineberg and colleagues helpfully distinguish between instrumental and
ontological interpretations of Markov blankets, exposing the dangers of using the former to
make claims about the latter. However, proposing a sharp distinction neglects the value of
recognising a continuum spanning from instrumental to ontological. This value extends to
the related distinction between ‘being’ and ‘having’ a model.
“We should not confuse the foundations of the real world with the intellectual props that
serve to evoke that world on the stage of our thoughts”. This quote from Ernst Mach ([1],
p.531, translated in [2], p.19), surfacing from the origins of the philosophy of science,
connects directly to the target article [3], in which Bruineberg and colleagues discuss how
Markov blankets (MBs) should be understood within the wider literature of the free energy
principle (FEP, [4]), as well as how ‘models’ and ‘modelling’ should be interpreted within the
cognitive and brain sciences more generally.
MBs are statistical descriptions that partition systems into internal, external, and blanket
variables – where the internal variables are conditionally independent of the external
variables, given the blanket variables. Bruineberg et al provide a valuable service by
distinguishing two interpretations of MBs: ‘Pearl blankets’ (PBs) and ‘Friston blankets’ (FBs).
PBs embody an instrumental approach, in which MBs are used as tools to aid the analysis of
complex systems, for example by identifying sets of variables suitable for further
investigation. In contrast, FBs adopt an ontological stance in which they are assumed to
either be (a literalist reading) – or usefully approximate (a realist reading) actually-existing
boundaries in the world, such as the boundary between a cell and its milieu, or between an
organism or agent and its environment. Bruineberg et al reveal the dangers of conflating
these two interpretations, in particular when an instrumental (PB) application is implicitly or
explicitly taken to justify ontological (FB) conclusions. Their arguments should be borne in
mind by those inclined to help themselves to the FEP to explain their favourite grand
mystery, or to take it as gospel.

Commentary on Bruineberg et al (2022), Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Having said this, making a sharp distinction is often a useful prelude to recognising a
spectrum of positions, each of which may be useful when assessed on its own merits. We
suggest this is the case here. For example, one may begin with an instrumentalist approach
and progressively refine and extend the corresponding model so as to make increasingly
specific claims about the causal mechanisms at play in the system under study – in this way,
gradually moving towards a more ontological or realist stance. What does ‘refine and
extend’ mean? It could mean equipping the model with additional features that represent
potentially important and context-specific aspects of the relevant boundaries, such as
autopoetic (self-producing) processes for biological boundaries [5, 6], and embodied and
embedded interactions for cognitive boundaries [7, 8], as well as a recognition of the limited
degree to which statistical identification of a MB might generalise to nonequilibrium
systems [9, 10].
Bruineberg et al mention these possibilities, but downplay their significance by drawing a
contrast between ‘additional philosophical assumptions’ and ‘additional technical
assumptions’, where the latter implicitly subsumes everything just mentioned. But these
modelling strategies and mathematical constraints are more than just additional
assumptions, they can often be part-and-parcel of the explanatory model itself. And rather
than ‘additional philosophical assumptions’, what seems to be required is a recognition of
the model’s philosophical context and the claims made on its behalf, so as to avoid the sort
of conflation helpfully identified by Bruineberg.
Bruineberg et al worry that, given such additional aspects, whether the MB formalism itself
can still be doing any work? The answer is yes, to the extent that it helps specify those parts
of a model that are focused on boundaries. By casting the distinction between PBs and FBs
as sharp, rather than as extrema on a continuum, Bruineberg et al underestimate the
explanatory work that MBs may uniquely be able to do.
Digging a little deeper, one reason we might be tempted to invoke a bright-line distinction
between PBs and FBs is because of the dramatic claims made for literalist readings of FBs, in
which MBs are seen as really-existing ontological boundaries in physical systems. But – as
Mach reminds us – models are always models, whatever their granularity. Once we discount
the relevance of an overly literalist reading, the value of a continuity between instrumental
and ontological stances becomes easier to appreciate. (Here, it is worth separating Mach’s
valuable skepticism about literalism from his ultimately doomed project to ground physics
solely in phenomenology; it is not likely that Mach would have had much time for FBs, even
of a realist flavour.)
The same reasoning can be applied to the distinction between ‘being a model’ and ‘having a
model’ – a distinction which Bruineberg et al mention, but only in passing (see also [11]).
Under the FEP, and following the spirit of the cybernetic pioneers [12], many systems can be

interpreted as ‘being’ a model of their environment. In an example briefly discussed by
Bruineberg et al, even a simple Watt governor can be described as performing inference –
however it is best thought of not as having a model that is used to perform inference, but as
being a model of its environment, from the perspective of an external observer (see [13] for
the original and still instructive version of this argument, in the context of computational
theories of mind). By contrast, neurocognitive systems that are modelled as implementing
generative models of their sensorium, in order to perform inference through prediction
error minimisation, are better described as having models, rather than merely being
models.
This distinction is important, because the status of having (rather than being) a model may
speak to a variety of interesting phenomena, such as the potential for counterfactual
cognition, imagination and imagery, volitional action of various kinds, and perhaps even the
difference between conscious and unconscious perception. Methodologically, the
hypothesis that a system has a model can be warranted if having that hypothesis leads to
novel testable predictions that would not have been made without that hypothesis (see [14]
for a related argument). Again, it is beneficial to recognise that this distinction comes in
degrees, and that even the (realist, ontological) claim that a system has a model should not
confuse the map with the territory.
The broader lesson from Bruineberg et al is the need for a healthy interaction across
disciplinary boundaries, and especially among philosophy, physics, biology, and cognitive
science, in order to avoid the pitfalls of explanatory overreach, and to take advantage of the
many opportunities that arise at disciplinary boundaries. Ernst Mach – a physicist who
eventually took a Chair in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Vienna, making
lasting contributions to psychology and physiology along the way – exemplifies these
virtues.
