Introduction**The challenge of training agents in complex environments remains a significant hurdle in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence. Traditional RL methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, requiring vast amounts of data to converge to optimal policies. Imitation learning offers a potential solution, allowing agents to learn from expert demonstrations, but suffers from the problem of distribution mismatch, where the agent’s learned policy diverges from the expert’s.The Free Energy Principle (FEP), originally developed within the context of neuroscience, provides a framework for learning from limited data by minimizing a free energy functional that represents the difference between the agent’s internal model of the world and the actual world.This paper combines the FEP with deep learning to create a robust and sample-efficient learning framework.**2. Methodology**The core of the system is a recurrent state space model that learns the underlying dynamics of the environment.
