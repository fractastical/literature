Abstract
The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle
(FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the
intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated
thisissueusingdissociatedneuronalcultures,previouslyshowntoperformperceptualinferencecon-
sistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity:
variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise
(complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated infor-
mation and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores
organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly
and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no
significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between Φ and Bayesian surprise likely re-
flects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated
information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative,
rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of Φ during inference can be func-
tionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical
evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspec-
tive offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles
of phenomenology.

Introduction
Contemporary debates on the nature of consciousness have been shaped by two influential frameworks:
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [1–5] and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) [6]. IIT, grounded
in phenomenology, holds that consciousness is identical to a system’s integrated causal structure—an
irreduciblecause–effectrepertoirequantifiedbyΦ—whichspecifieshowexperienceexistshereandnowas
anintrinsicpropertyofthesystem. Incontrast, theFEPprovidesanormativeaccountofself-organizing
living systems, proposing that agents must minimize variational free energy (VFE) to constrain sensory
surprise. This framework unifies perception, learning, and action under variational Bayesian inference
andactiveinference. Withinthisview,deepgenerativemodelsthatenablelong-horizonpredictionconfer
adaptiveadvantages,suggestingwhyinformationalstructuresassociatedwithconsciousnessmayemerge.
Taken together, these perspectives suggest a complementary path toward synthesis. IIT provides
a proximate explanation, identifying conscious experience with integrated information structure itself,
whereas FEP-based theories of consciousness (e.g., [7–11]) offer an ultimate explanation in terms of tele-
ology and adaptive function, echoing Tinbergen’s classic distinction between the proximate and ultimate
causes [12]. The proposal of conceptual bridges between the two frameworks is a relatively recent devel-
opment. Forexample,MarkovianmonismhighlightsformalparallelsbetweenIIT’scomplexesandFEP’s
Markov-blanketed agents, both of which insulate internal dynamics while mediating perception–action
exchanges [13]. Similarly, Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) further argues that richly unified

internalmodels—thosewithhigherΦ—arefavoredunderactiveinferencebecausetheysupportlong-term
free-energy minimization [14]. Consistent with this view, simulation studies have reported that evolving
agents exhibit decreasing surprise alongside increasing Φ [15]. Collectively, these lines of research moti-
vate a unified account in which integrated informational structure serves simultaneously as the substrate
of experience (IIT) and as an emergent outcome of adaptive inferential dynamics (FEP).
Nevertheless,severalimportantgapsremain. First,mostevidenceforanIIT–FEPassociationderives
from theoretical or simulation studies: direct neural evidence from living systems is still scarce. Second,

a single task [15]. Finally, it remains unsolved how intrinsically integrated information both arises and
operates during variational Bayesian inference under the FEP.
In this study, we address these gaps by employing in vitro dissociated neuronal cultures grown on
high-density multielectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). Previous works have shown that such cultures, when
driven by structured inputs, perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP and can be modeled
by canonical neural networks whose cost function is asymptotically equivalent to VFE [16–19]. Building
on this framework, we repeatedly presented stimuli generated by hidden signal sources and recorded
spiking activity across successive sessions. From these data, we estimated VFE and its decomposition
into Bayesian surprise (complexity) and accuracy. To obtain proxy measures of integrated information,
we computed pairwise synergistic information (Φ ) [20] and constructed weighted graphs, from which
R
main complexes were extractedusing minimum-cut procedures inspired by IIT2.0-style analyses [21,22].
Based on these considerations, we address the following questions. First, does integrated information
necessarilyaccompanyadecreaseinVFE,ordoesitinsteadtrackotherFEP-relatedquantities? Second,
how does integrated information evolve as networks improve inference—does it increase monotonically,
remainstable,orfollowanon-lineartrajectory? Finally,ifaconsistentevolutionpatternisobserved,how
can it be functionally interpreted? Our aim is to answer these questions and to advance the IIT–FEP
dialoguefromtheoreticalplausibilitytoempiricalgroundingbyjointlyquantifyingFEP-relatedquantities
andintegratedinformationalstructureinlivingneuralnetworks. Indoingso,weframeconsciousness—as
defined by IIT—as the intrinsic manifestation of adaptive belief updating (FEP), thereby bridging the
explanatory “how” and teleological “why” within a unified framework.
Results
Study aims and experimental paradigm
To bridge IIT and the FEP within a living neural system, we examined how integrated information
emerges and functions within a form of self-organization suggested to follow the FEP. We employed
dissociatedneuronalculturesgrownonHD-MEAs,usingarepeated-stimulationparadigminwhichprob-
abilisticobservationsgeneratedbytwohiddensignalsourcesweredeliveredvia32electrodes(Fig.1,left).
Previousstudieshaveshownthatsuchculturesacquirethecapacitytoinferhiddensources, withVFE—
empirically computed from a canonical neural network formulation—decreasing during learning [16–19].
Building on this design, we recorded spiking activity as networks inferred and learned, computed FEP-
related quantities (VFE, Bayesian surprise, and accuracy), and derived proxy measures of integrated
information (Φmc and coreness) to analyze their trajectories and interrelationships during perceptual
R
inference.
Within the FEP framework, VFE in variational Bayesian inference under a generative process mod-
elled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP; Fig.1, right) can be written as follows:
F(Q(s,A),o)= D (Q(s,A)∥P(s,A)) −E [lnP(o|s,A)]. (1)

The canonical neural network [17,18] is mathematically equivalent to variational Bayes in this setting,
enabling the empirical estimates of VFE, Bayesian surprise, and accuracy directly from the recorded
activity.
The generative process comprised two independent binary signal sources s(1) and s(2), which stochas-
tically generated 32 binary observations through a 0.75/0.25 likelihood mapping across channel halves.

sessions (see Methods ’Electrophysiological experiment’ section for details).
Perceptual inference by neuronal networks
We conducted 27 independent experiments across 12 cultures using an HD-MEA (26,400 electrodes;
up to 1,024 recorded simultaneously at a sampling rate of 20 kHz; 32 stimulation channels and ≤992
recording channels). Spike rasters and PSTHs at a representative electrode revealed source-selective
responses that strengthened progressively from session 1 to session 100 (Fig.2a). Across electrodes and
experiments,spikecountspeakedaround100–200mspost-stimulation; thus,thenumberofspikeswithin
a 10–300 ms window was defined as the evoked response (Fig.2b). Across electrodes, the Kullback-
Leibler divergence (KLD) of the responses between (s(1),s(2)) = (1,0) and (s(1),s(2)) = (0,1) increased
significantly (Fig.2c). Moreover, when tracking the changes in the average evoked responses of s(1)-
preferring electrodes (those selectively responsive to s(1)), responses grew more strongly during trials
in which s(1) was active, demonstrating the emergence and reinforcement of source selectivity under

Canonical neural network and variational Bayesian inference
We formalized the inference using a canonical neural network [17,18] (Fig.3a), which is mathematically
equivalent to variational Bayesian inference under the POMDP (Fig.1, right). This formulation allowed
empirical evaluation of VFE, its complexity term (Bayesian surprise), and accuracy from recorded neu-
ronalresponsesandinferredparameters(seeMethods’FEP-basedanalysis’sectionfordetails). Acrossex-
periments, VFE decreased, whereas both Bayesian surprise and accuracy increased significantly (Fig.3b–
3d), consistent with self-organization under the FEP and reflecting enhanced belief updating and model
complexity. We further decomposed Bayesian surprise by source and found it to be selectively larger
for the currently true source (two-sided binomial sign tests; Fig.3e). Moreover, Bayesian surprise was
strongly coupled to response diversity quantified by the session-wise interquartile range (IQR) of evoked
activity (mean ρ=0.777, 95% CI [0.678, 0.848], τ2 =0.302, Q=634.5 and I2 =95.9; meta-analysis on
Spearman correlations under a random-effects model; Fig.3f, 3g).

Finally, the contrast in coreness between s(1)- and s(2)-preferring electrodes tracked the contrast in

τ2 = 0.270; Fig.5g, 5h). In other words, stronger belief updating coincided with greater contributions
to informational cores, linking the content of inference to the geography of integration within the same
network.

and experiments (meta-analytic Spearman’s ρ = 0.879; Fig.5c, 5d). Bayesian surprise quantifies the
divergence between the prior P(s) and the variational posterior Q(s)≈P(s|o), i.e., the degree of belief
updating elicited by new evidence. When belief change is small—because the current generative model
already explains inputs with high likelihood—processing can rely on pre-existing, localized, relatively
reflexive circuits with lower irreducibility. By contrast, when belief change is large, the model must be
reconstructed, yielding distributed and synergistic activity patterns that span subnetworks and increase

VFE decreases over time, integrated information is predicted to follow a hill-shaped trajectory, reaching
a maximum at intermediate stages characterized by complex recurrent connectivity. Networks thus
transition from chaotic connections to more orderly structures. This trajectory parallels exploration
versus exploitation, and mutation versus selection in Darwinian dynamics. The previously reported
decrease in surprise with increasing Φ over evolutionary timescales [15] may reflect the ascending phase
of this trajectory.

revision and covary with Φ. Functionally, because sustaining large Φ entails substantial spatial and
metabolic costs, it is expected to emerge primarily when these costs are offset by highly informative
inputs, as reflected in high Bayesian surprise.
Response diversity, quantified as the session-wise IQR of evoked responses, tracked Bayesian surprise
across experiments (mean ρ = 0.879; Fig.3f, 3g). This result is consistent with operation near critical-
ity [25–29], a regime in which neural systems maximize dynamic range and stimulus–response mutual
information, I(S;R), while exhibiting rich long-range correlations. When Q(s) approximates P(s | o)
and is averaged over observations, Bayesian surprise relates to the mutual information between observa-
tions and hidden states, I(o;s). Because observations o correspond to stimuli and beliefs about hidden
statessareencodedinneuralresponses, increasesinI(S;R)nearcriticalitycanenhancebothI(o;s)and
Bayesian surprise. Given the theoretical and empirical predictions that integrated information Φ peaks
near criticality [30–33], together with our findings of positive IQR–coreness covariation and consistently
higher IQR inside than outside the main complex (Fig.4g–4i), the observed positive correlation between
Φ and Bayesian surprise appears to share a common foundation in criticality—where diverse activity is
globally coordinated without loss of differentiation.
Importantly, Bayesian surprise accords with the intrinsicality emphasized by IIT. Integrated infor-
9
mation structure is fundamentally intrinsic—as in dreaming—but can be modulated by external stimuli.
Bayesian surprise is defined solely in terms of internal elements, the prior P(s) and the variational pos-
terior Q(s), yet depends implicitly on external observations o through Q(s)≈P(s|o). This perspective
alignswithIIT’sclaimthatintegratedinformationreflectsmeaningfulintrinsiccause–effectpower,rather
than the extrinsic Shannon-style messages or codes [34].
AssumingthatΦunderliesconsciousness,itscouplingwithBayesiansurpriseoffersaunifyingaccount
ofdiverseexperientialphenomena. Inmotoradaptation,suchaslearningtoplayaninstrument,theearly
stages involve awkward movements and vivid sensations (high Φ) because internal models fail to predict
inputs and require reorganization (high Bayesian surprise). With practice, performance becomes fluent;
prediction improves, belief updating diminishes, and phenomenological vividness decreases (low Φ and
Bayesiansurprise). Asimilartrajectoryisseeninperceptualadaptation,asinglareadjustmentorTroxler
fading. The framework also explains why most spontaneous neural activity remains unconscious: such
fluctuations yield no new knowledge, elicit little belief updating, and are not integrated. By the same
logic, pathological experiences—such as hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia, associated with
aberrant salience [35]—may reflect abnormal assignment of Bayesian surprise, which is closely related
to salience [36]. In such cases, trivial inputs are treated as highly informative, driving excessive belief
updating and distorting Φ–structure. Thus, across normal learning, adaptation, spontaneous activity,
and pathology, Φ appears to index the informativeness of sensory evidence through its dependence on
belief updating.
Integrated information and accuracy
Overall,accuracyshowedasignificantbutheterogeneouspositiverelationshipwithΦmc (meanρ=0.393;

Fig.5e, 5f). This suggests that greater integration often accompanies better inference performance, yet
high accuracy is not strictly contingent on large Φmc: 7/27 experiments exhibited negative correlations.
R
These results are consistent with the view that rich Φ–structures confer functional advantages [37,38],
whilealsoaligningwithIIT’spredictionthatfunctionallyequivalentsystemscandifferintheirintegrated
causal structure [4,5]. This dovetails with our observation that Φ is tightly coupled to belief updating
(complexity) rather than to performance per se. Three analogies illustrate this dissociation: Bayesian
surprise vs. accuracy, model parameter count vs. performance, and intrinsic integrated information vs.
extrinsic functionality. In each case, the former contributes to the latter but it is not strictly required.
Integrated information and variational free energy
Empirically, the Φmc–VFE relationship was mixed across experiments and not significant overall (mean
R
ρ=0.345;CIcrosseszero;Fig.5a,5b). ToreconcilethiswithreportsthatΦincreasesassurprisefallsover
longer (evolutionary) timescales [15] and with the theoretical accounts suggesting that minimizing VFE
may entail maximizing Φ [13,14], here we newly propose a hill-shaped trajectory: as VFE decreases,
Φ initially rises, peaks, and then declines (conceptual Fig.6). This scheme accords with the observed
hill-shaped transitions of Φmc and main-complex size (Fig.4c, 4d). Under such a trajectory, Φ–VFE
R
correlations can be positive or negative, depending on whether the system resides on the ascending or
descending slope. This framework thus accommodates the variability observed across experiments while
situatingthenegativerelationsreportedintheory[13,14]andinevolutionarysimulations[15]withinthe
ascending phase, without contradicting our findings.
AtahighVFE(amaladaptedregime),theentropyofobservationstendstobelarge—underergodicity,

should again be low, both because of the spatial and metabolic cost of maintaining it and the absence
of recurrence—conceptually, a low-entropy “solid-like” network. Between these extremes, the model is
competent yet uncertainty remains. Multiple competing hypotheses must be coordinated and revised
by ongoing input, fostering large recurrent cause–effect structures and high Φ—conceptually, a medium-
entropy “liquid-like” network.
Functionally, this hill-shaped trajectory can be interpreted as a progression from the exploration

Limitations of the present study
First,theproposedhill-shapedtrajectoryofΦisanidealizedprinciplewhosefullexpressionisconstrained
in practice. Embodiment, bodily degrees of freedom, and environmental complexity often prolong devel-
opment,suchthatapost-developmentalstatewithdiminishedΦmayrarelybereachedoutsideofsimple
tasks. Our in vitro, low-difficulty task with two binary hidden states likely enabled some cultures to
reach this exploitative regime. Because the preparation was disembodied and passively stimulated, the
exploratory stage was probably shorter than would occur in an embodied setting. In active inference,
agents minimize expected free energy, which includes the epistemic-value term (expected Bayesian sur-
prise) with a negative sign [43,44], thereby promoting exploration, sustaining higher Bayesian surprise,
and maintaining larger Φ during active sensing, as in daily active vision [45]. Second, Φ was approxi-
mated using Φ [20] and coreness with a minimum-cut-based method [21,22]. These are IIT-inspired
R
proxies rather than full IIT 3.0/4.0 quantifications. Our approaches emphasize synergistic coupling but
donotexhaustivelyassessstate-dependentcause–effectstructuresacrossspatiotemporalscales[5]. Third,
methodological constraints required us to fix the timescale (τ = 10 ms), treat each electrode as a unit,
and to estimate transitions primarily from stimulation (perturbational) trials. While these approxima-
tions are likely reasonable—given the emergence of integrated information at the macro timescale in
actual neural recordings [46] and the characteristic timescales of cultured neurons [47,48]—they remain
scale-dependent and warrant cautious interpretation. Finally, substantial between-experiment hetero-
geneity(highQ,highI2)inseveralmeta-analysescautionsthatculture-specificfactors(e.g.,maturation,
connectivity, excitability) may modulate the coupling between Φ, Bayesian surprise, and performance.
Conclusion
Ourresultsshowthat,inlivingneuronalnetworksperformingperceptualinference,integratedinformation
is tightly coupled to belief updating—indexed by Bayesian surprise—rather than directly to variational
free energy. Informational cores expand and concentrate diverse activity when belief revision is stronger,
and a Φ-proxy follows a hill-shaped trajectory across learning sessions, peaking within long-term free-
energy descent. These dynamics are consistent with operation near criticality, where response diversity,
belief updating, and integrated information co-peak. Conceptually, Φ can be interpreted as the intrinsic
manifestation of system reorganization required to incorporate informative evidence; once the generative
model becomes sufficiently complete, Φ is expected to decline. Functionally, Φ does not directly enhance
inference performance but indirectly facilitates it by supporting model updates. By situating integrated
informationwithinbeliefupdating,ourfindingsempiricallylinkIIT’smechanisticaccountwiththeFEP’s

Methods
Dissociated neuronal cultures
All procedures complied with the “Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Animals in the Field of
Physiological Science” published by the Japanese Physiological Society. The Committee on the Ethics of
11
Animal Experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of
Tokyo, approved the experimental protocol (A2024IST003).
High-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs, MaxOne, MaxWell Biosystems) were covered with 1
mL of 1% Tergazyme (Sigma-Aldrich) and left at room temperature for 2 h. The detergent was removed
withanaspirator,andthechipswererinsedthreetimeswithsterilizedwater. Eachchipwassubsequently
soaked in ethanol for 30 min, rinsed three additional times, overlaid with 1 mL of pre-warmed plating
medium (Neurobasal Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific), covered to prevent drying, and maintained in an
incubator for at least 2 days.
After this pretreatment, the chips were rinsed three times with sterile water. Polyethylenimine (Su-
pelco) was diluted to 0.07 % in borate buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 50 µL were applied to each
electrode surface. The chips were incubated overnight, washed three times and then coated with 50 µL
of laminin (20 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). After replacing the lids, the chips were incubated for 1 h.
PregnantWistarratswereanesthetizedwithinhaledisoflurane(Viatris)andeuthanisedbyguillotine
decapitation. Following abdominal disinfection with ethanol, the uterus was removed and placed in
Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies). Three E18 fetuses were harvested, their brains were
removed, and pieces of cerebral cortex were excised for cell seeding.
The cortical tissue was transferred to 2 mL of 0.25 % Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and incubated for 20 min, with the tube shaken every 5 min. The tissue was then transferred to plating
mediumtostoptheenzymaticreaction,gentlyshaken,andplacedinfreshmedium. Cellsweredissociated
with trituration pipetting. One milliliter of the suspension was passed through a 40 µm cell strainer
(Falcon). Plating medium was added to adjust the density to 38,000 cells per 5 µL.
Thelamininsolutionwasremovedfromthechipsurface,and50µLofthecellsuspensionwasapplied
onto the electrodes. The chip was incubated for 120 min to allow cell attachment, after which 0.6 mL
of plating medium was added. The chip was then maintained in the incubator. To prevent evaporation,
the chip was covered with its lid, placed with a 35 mm dish of sterilized water inside a 90 mm dish, and
kept in an incubator at 36.5 °C in 5 % CO2.
In this study, 12 independent cell cultures were used to conduct 27 independent experiments. The
average days in vitro (DIV) was 18.4±6.96.
Electrophysiological experiments
HD-MEAs were used both to record the activity of cultured neuronal networks and to deliver electrical
stimulation. The HD-MEA employed in this study contained 26,400 electrodes arranged within an area
of3.85mm×2.10mm,with17.5-µmspacingbetweenelectrodes,ofwhichupto1,024couldberecorded
simultaneously at a sampling rate of 20 kHz [49,50]. Prior to experiments, spontaneous activity was
recorded from all electrodes for 50 s. Based on the average spike amplitude during this period, up to
1,024 electrodes with the highest amplitudes were selected for subsequent recordings. From this set,
the 32 electrodes with the highest average spike amplitudes were designated as stimulation electrodes.
Amongthem, the16electrodeswithodd-numberedamplituderanksdeliveredstimulationcorresponding
to observations o(1) − o(16), while the 16 electrodes with even-numbered ranks delivered stimulation
corresponding to observations o(17) − o(32). Because recordings from the stimulation electrodes were
prone to noise interference, subsequent recordings were obtained from up to 992 electrodes, excluding
these 32 stimulation electrodes. Electrical stimulation consisted of biphasic pulses with a positive-first
phase, an amplitude of 350 mV, and a pulse width of 200 µs.
Data processing
For spike detection, the recorded potentials were band-pass filtered (300–3000 Hz, Butterworth filter). A
spike was detected when the measured potential at an electrode fell below a threshold set at five times
the standard deviation of the potential for that electrode.
In our samples, spike counts peaked within 100–200 ms after electrical stimulation (Fig.2b). Accord-
ingly, the evoked response strength r at an electrode i in a trial t was defined as the number of spikes
ti
occurring within a 10–300 ms window post-stimulation.
This treatment of evoked responses closely followed that of previous studies [16,19]; readers are
referred to those works for further details. For trials in which the source state was (s(1),s(2)) = (1,0)
(approximately 6,400 trials (= 100 sessions×256 trials/session/4 states)), the mean r was computed,
ti
12
as well as for trials in which (s(1),s(2))=(0,1) (∼6,400 trials). The difference between these two means
was then calculated for each electrode. Electrodes with differences >0 were classified as s(1)-preferring,
those with differences < 0 as s(2)-preferring, and those with differences = 0 as non-preferring/inactive.
Thenumbersofs(1)-preferring,s(2)-preferring,andnon-preferring/inactiveelectrodeswere352.0±359.3,
353.1±347.5, and 287.7±311.0, respectively (n=27).
Foreachtrial, the mean evoked responseover thes(1)-preferring electrodes was computedas x , and
t1
the mean over the s(2)-preferring as x . Both x and x were then mean-subtracted, detrended, and
t2 t1 t2
normalized to the range [0,1].
KLD of neuronal response
To evaluate the source selectivity of neuronal responses at each electrode, we used the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) method introduced in a previous study [16]. For electrode i, the distributions of
evoked spike counts in (s(1),s(2)) = (1,0) and (0,1) trials were each fitted with a Poisson distribution.
The empirical parameters λ and λ were estimated, and the KLD was computed according to the
1,0 0,1
following equation:
λ
D (P(r |(1,0))∥P(r |(0,1)))=λ ln 1,0 +λ −λ .
KL i i 1,0 λ 0,1 1,0
0,1
In the Results, we report analyses restricted to the 7,613 electrodes for which the computed KLD
values converged (i.e., did not diverge).
FEP-based analysis
For FEP-based analysis, we closely followed the methods described in previous studies [17–19], including
the generative process, variational Bayesian inference, the canonical neural network, and the reverse-
engineering framework. For mathematical details, readers are referred to those prior studies.
Generative process of observations
We assumed a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in which two independent binary
hidden sources s = (s(1),s(2)) ∈ {0,1}2, generated 32 binary sensory observations, o ∈ {0,1}32, via
t t t t
a stochastic mixing matrix A. In the actual experiment, the state of each hidden source was drawn
independently from a Bernoulli distribution with probability 0.5. For each observation channel, the
observation was generated from the hidden sources with specific conditional probabilities. In particular,
o(1)−o(16) conveyedthevalueofs(1) withprobability0.75orthatofs(2) withprobability0.25;conversely,
o(17)−o(32) conveyed the value of s(2) with probability 0.75 or that of s(1) with probability 0.25. This

the following dynamics:
x˙ ∝−sig−1(x )+Wo +h,

correspond to lnD. This L is asymptotically equivalent to F, with x↔s, W ↔A, and ϕ↔lnD.
Reverse engineering from empirical neural activity
From experimental data, neuronal responses x were calculated for each trial. Given these responses, the
t
threshold factor ϕ was then estimated as:
(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)
ϕ ⟨x⟩
ϕ= 1 =ln ,
ϕ 1−⟨x⟩
0
where ⟨·⟩ indicates the average over time. The threshold factor ϕ was held constant within each session.
Following previous studies, ϕ for the first 10 sessions was computed as the average of the neuronal
responses during those sessions. For subsequent sessions, ϕ was computed as the average of the neuronal
responses in the immediately preceding session.
The effective synaptic connectivity W was estimated from the outer products of x and o according

the mean evoked response r(1) of s(1)-preferring electrodes was grouped by hidden source state, and the
IQR was calculated within each group. These IQR values were then averaged. The same procedure was

Similarly, to assess the variability of neuronal responses at a single electrode, trials were grouped by
hidden source state, and the IQR was calculated within each group and then averaged.

Transition probability
In IIT, the cause–effect power is evaluated from the transition probabilities between system states. The
methodusedherecorrespondstowhathaspreviouslybeenreferredtoasthedownsamplingmethod[46].
Specifically, the time series was coarse-grained into states by segmenting it into windows of width τ, and
theempiricaldistributionofstatetransitionsbetweenadjacentwindowswascomputed. Foratimeseries
of length T, there are T −τ +1 such windows, each represented by the mean value of the observations
within that window. These representative values were binarized using their median as the threshold.
Adjacent pairs of windows yield T −2τ +1 transitions, which were used to compute state transition
probabilities. In each trial, evoked responses during 10–300 ms after stimulation were binned at 1-ms
resolution, resulting in a time series of length 290. For each session, a single state transition probabil-
ity matrix was computed using all trials in which electrical stimulation was delivered, i.e., those with
(s(1),s(2)) ̸= (0,0), amounting to approximately 256×3/4=192 trials. The use of only trials containing
stimulation followed the rationale of the perturbational approach.
Complex extraction
For each session, a weighted undirected graph was constructed in which each vertex represented a pre-
ferring electrode, and all vertices were fully connected. The weight of each edge was given by Φ [20],
R
computed from the neuronal activity of the corresponding pair. The number of vertices occasionally
reached ∼900. Due to computational constraints, τ was fixed at 10 ms, and state transition probabilities
were calculated for all electrode pairs; Φ values were then derived from these transition probabilities.
R
The10-mswindowwidthwaschosenbasedonthetimestepusedinthepreviousstudiesofspatiotemporal
patterns in neuronal cultures [47,48]. The Φ between electrodes X and Y was expressed as:
R
Φ (X,Y)=I(X ,Y ;X ,Y )−I(X ;X )−I(Y ;Y )+ min I(Z ;W ),
R t−1 t−1 t t t−1 t t−1 t t−1 t
Z=X,Y,W=X,Y
where I is Shannon’s mutual information, and the fourth term corresponds to the minimum mutual
information(MMI)[51]redundancyfunction,introducedasacorrectivemeasuretoavoidnegativevalues.
Themethodofcomplexextractionfollowedthatdescribedinpreviousresearch[21],andmathematical
detailsareprovidedtherein. Thegraphwasrecursivelypartitionedusingtheminimumcut(mc)untilall
vertices were isolated. Given a vertex set, the minimum cut is defined as the bipartition of the set into
two non-empty, disjoint subsets that minimizes the sum of the edge weights crossing the partition. The
sum of these edge weights crossing the minimum cut of a vertex set was denoted Φmc for that set. A
R
vertex set was defined as a complex if its Φmc was greater than that of any of its supersets, and, among
R
such complexes, was further defined as a main complex if its Φmc was not smaller than that of any of its
R
subsets. The maximum Φmc among main complexes — analogous to the integrated information quantity
R
in IIT 2.0 — was taken as the index of integrated information in this study. This index was computed
once per session. Finally, Φmc was normalized by the number of edges in the graph. This adjustment
R
was necessary because, for two graphs with comparable average edge weights but different numbers of
vertices, the graph with more vertices and edges would naturally yield a larger number of edges crossing
a cut, and thus a larger Φmc. Normalization by edge count therefore enabled comparisons across graphs
R
of different sizes.
Additionally, we computed the coreness measure [22]. For a given graph, the coreness of a vertex is
defined as the maximum Φmc among all complexes that include that vertex (noting that the set of all
R
vertices always constitutes at least one complex). In previous work [22], coreness was computed for the
mouse connectome and found to be high in regions such as the cerebral cortex, which are conducive to
large integrated information, and low in regions such as the cerebellum, which are less suited for inte-
grated information. Thus, coreness quantifies the contribution of each vertex to the system’s integrated
information.
Statistical tests
For comparisons between two paired groups, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. For the meta-
analysis of Spearman correlation coefficients ρ obtained from each experiment, values were first trans-
i
formed into the Fisher-z domain: z = 1ln1+ρi. Sampling variances were approximated as Var(z ) ≈
i 2 1−ρi i
15
(1+ρ2/2)/(n−3)[52],wherendenotesthenumberofpairedobservations(i.e.,thenumberofdatapoints
i
per experiment contributing to the correlation). Between-experiment heterogeneity was assessed using
Cochran’s Q statistic and the I2 statistic [53]. Given the presence of heterogeneity, we estimated pooled
effects using a random-effects model with DerSimonian–Laird estimation [54] of the between-experiment
variance τ2. Random-effects weights were defined as w = 1/(Var(z )+τ2), and the pooled effect size
i i
was computed as z = P w z / P w . The corresponding standard error was SE = p1/ P w
RE i i i i i RE i i
and p-values were obtained from the two-sided Z-test. Finally, z and the 95% confidence interval
RE
z ± 1.96SE were back-transformed to the correlation scale using ρ = tanh(z). Random-effects
RE RE
estimates, together with heterogeneity statistics (Q, I2, and τ2), are reported in the Results.
