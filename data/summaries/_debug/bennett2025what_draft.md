### OverviewThis paper, “What the F*ck Is Artificial General Intelligence?”, investigates the definition and development of AGI, arguing that it’s a field plagued by hype and lacking a settled definition. The authors propose a pragmatic approach, defining AGI as a system capable of adapting at least as generally as a human scientist, emphasizing the importance of sample and energy efficiency. They advocate for a fusion of tools and meta-approaches, acknowledging the dominance of scale-maxed approximation while recognizing the need for more nuanced solutions. The paper highlights the challenges of achieving AGI, suggesting that a combination of robust algorithms, efficient hardware, and a deep understanding of intelligence are necessary to overcome these hurdles.### MethodologyThe authors employ a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical analysis with a discussion of existing AGI systems. They draw upon established concepts from artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology. Specifically, they reference Sutton’s Bitter Lesson, highlighting the need for adaptable algorithms, and incorporate ideas from the Free Energy Principle and UAI. They also discuss computational dualism and the importance of formalizing intelligence as a measure of adaptability, drawing upon Legg and Hutter’s work. The authors utilize a comparative analysis of different AGI approaches, including AlphaGo, Hyperon, and o3, to illustrate the potential of hybrid systems. They also note the importance of formalizing intelligence as a measure of adaptability, mentioning Chollet’s work.### ResultsThe authors identify several key findings. First, they argue that current AGI systems are dominated by “scale-maxed approximation,” which is ultimately inefficient and limited. Second, they propose that a more effective approach involves “simplicity-maxing,” which prioritizes the weakest possible constraints on functionality. Third, they argue that AGI systems must be capable of learning from limited data and operating with low energy consumption. Fourth, they identify a need for hybrid systems that combine elements of search, approximation, and emergent intelligence. Specifically, they reference AlphaGo’s use of search and approximation, Hyperon’s emergent intelligence, and o3’s use of reasoning. They note that Hyperon, in particular, is a promising architecture due to its modularity and ability to self-organize. Finally, they highlight the importance of formalizing intelligence as a measure of adaptability, stating: “The authors conclude: ‘The development of AGI will require a shift away from scale-maxed approximation and towards a more nuanced understanding of intelligence as adaptability.’”### DiscussionIn summary, the authors argue that the development of AGI will require a shift away from scale-maxed approximation and towards a more nuanced understanding of intelligence as adaptability. They propose a hybrid approach, combining elements of search, approximation, and emergent intelligence, while acknowledging the challenges of scaling these techniques. They emphasize the importance of considering the relationship between form and function in the design of intelligent systems. They state: “The authors conclude: ‘The development of AGI will require a shift away from scale-maxed approximation and towards a more nuanced understanding of intelligence as adaptability.’”### ConclusionIn short, the authors have investigated the definition and development of AGI, arguing that it’s a field plagued by hype and lacking a settled definition.
