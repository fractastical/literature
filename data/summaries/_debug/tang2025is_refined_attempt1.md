Okay, here’s a revised summary incorporating all the feedback and aiming for a comprehensive, high-quality output.**Is Active Persona Inference Necessary for Aligning Small Models to Personal Preferences?**The pursuit of aligning large language models (LLMs) with individual user preferences represents a significant challenge. While scaling models and incorporating vast datasets can improve alignment, achieving truly personalized responses remains a complex endeavor. This paper investigates the effectiveness of incorporating active persona inference – specifically, the use of pre-defined personas during the fine-tuning process – in achieving this goal, particularly with smaller models. Our findings suggest that active persona inference can significantly improve the alignment of smaller models to user preferences, offering a viable approach to mitigate the challenges associated with scaling and data requirements.The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The authors state: “The
