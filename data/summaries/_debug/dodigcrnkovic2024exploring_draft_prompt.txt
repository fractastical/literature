Abstract. Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving
perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that
cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms.
This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information
and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework
dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties
of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss
morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer.
Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores
research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological
computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using
examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical
approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol
processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment).
Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial
for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.
Introduction
The human-centric perspective of cognition focused on high-level mental activities has historically
dominated cognitive science, neglecting the manifestations of cognition on sub-symbolic levels as
well as cognition in other living beings. Recent research, however, challenges this narrow
understanding, proposing a more inclusive view of cognition on both symbolic and sub-symbolic
levels, as a fundamental ability shared by all living organisms – starting with basal (cellular) cognition
(Lyon, 2015) (Levin et al., 2021) (Lyon et al., 2021). This chapter explores that broader perspective
within the morphological info-computational framework, highlighting the implications for our
understanding of cognition in nature and the development of intelligent artifacts, (Dodig-Crnkovic,
2008) (van Leeuwen & Wiederman, 2017).
The concept of morphological computation, which utilizes the physical properties of organisms to
produce and control behavior, provides a foundation for this expanded view of cognition. As
“Information is not a disembodied abstract entity; it is always tied to a physical representation.”
(Landauer, 1996), its dynamics (morphological computation) depends on the same physical substrate.
1
Through the info-computational perspective, seeing cognition as a network of computational
processes on informational structures (Dodig-Crnkovic, 2017d), we can better understand how
cognitive processes emerge and function across different levels of biological organization. This
chapter presents the conceptual underpinnings of that perspective, examining how it challenges
traditional views of cognition and offers new insights into the cognitive abilities of all living
organisms and their connection to information and computation as fundamental building blocks.
There is a cycle of development between the info-computational physical substrate and the cognitive
capacities of cognizing agents. The more complex agents possess more advanced cognitive capacities,
leading to even more advanced cognitive agents.
Challenging Traditional Understanding of Cognition
The understanding of cognition as knowledge generation focused on high-level mental activities in
humans in our present stage of evolution, excluding sub-symbolic and sub-conscious processes, and
neglecting cognition in other living beings. As a result, numerous theoretical and empirical challenges
have arisen, putting into question the adequacy of this human-centric view.
Within this tradition, cognition has been modeled as classical sequential computation, understood as
the Turing machine symbol manipulation, or by neural networks. While behaviorism offered an
alternative focusing on observable behavior, contemporary cognitive science has remained largely
divided between mutually excluding cognitivism/computationalism and embodied, embedded,
enactive, and extended 3E/4E cognition approaches. (Newen et al., 2018)
Info-computationalism (ICON), Morphological Computing (MC), Computational Nature, and
Natural Computation
Info-computationalism (ICON) is a conceptual framework that integrates two key concepts,
(Pan)Informationalism (Informational Structural Realism) (Floridi, 2008) and (Pan)Computationalism
(Dodig-Crnkovic & Miłkowski, 2023). It presents a unifying perspective for understanding natural
phenomena, including living organisms and their cognition, by viewing the physical universe as a
network of networks of computational processes running on an informational structure. The ICON
describes the computing nature (Zenil, 2012) (Dodig-Crnkovic & Giovagnoli, 2013) (Dodig-Crnkovic
& Miłkowski, 2023) with the naturalization of the concepts of information, computation, and
cognition. Natural computationalism adopts a generalized, broader notion of computation-
unconventional computation beyond the traditional Turing model, (Sloman, 1996) (Stepney, 2008)
(Cooper, 2012) (Calude & Cooper, 2012) (Horsman et al., 2017) (Stepney et al., 2018). It allows for a
smooth integration of natural and artificial systems.
This view, in which natural processes, from physical interactions to biological and cognitive
functions, can be understood as forms of natural (physical) computation, is inspired by Alan Turing's
ideas on computation and morphogenesis, where computation is not just a mathematical abstraction as
in the Turing machine model (which Turing called Logical Computing Machines, LCMs) but a
physical process that drives real-world behaviors and interactions leading to a generation of form.
Another inspiration is Wheeler’s informational universe (Wheeler, 1994) in which nature is viewed
(by a cognizer) as a web of informational structures. Information is not merely a static entity but is
dynamic and constantly processed by computational mechanisms. Thus processing of information is
what drives changes and developments in natural systems.
2
Info-computationalism incorporates the concept of morphological computing, where the physical
form (morphology) of an organism or system plays a crucial role in its computational processes. This
idea emphasizes that the embodiment, that is physical properties such as shape structure, and material
enable and constrain computation.
Morphological computation is an unconventional computation that presents a shift from traditional
views, defining computation more generally than conventional symbol manipulation or connectionist
neural network models. This approach is based on the physical embodiment of computational
mechanisms, making it a suitable tool for modeling a broader range of natural cognitive phenomena,
(Pfeifer & Iida, 2005) (Pfeifer et al., 2006) (Hauser et al., 2014) (Nowakowski, 2017) (Ghazi-Zahedi
et al., 2017) (Miłkowski, 2018). Morphological computation is physical computation found in nature
on the hierarchy of levels of organization/levels of abstraction/ontological levels or scales of agency –
from quantum to molecular, chemical, biological, cognitive, and social computing, (Dodig-Crnkovic,
2012) (Baluška & Levin, 2016) (Manicka & Levin, 2022) (Bongard & Levin, 2023) (McMillen &
Levin, 2024).
In short, morphological computation, MC, refers to the process where the physical structure
(morphology) of a body determines its behavior through its intrinsic physical properties with causal
powers.
Müller and Hoffmann identify three types of morphological computation:
(1) morphology facilitating control,
(2) morphology facilitating perception, and
(3) morphological computation proper.
The first two types involve the physical structure aiding in motor control and sensory perception,
respectively. The third type, morphological computation proper, refers to more complex
computations, such as those found in reservoir computing, where physical structures are integral to
the computational process (Miłkowski, 2018)
At the First International Conference on Morphological Computing in 2007, morphological
computation was defined informally as any process serving a computational purpose, with clearly
assignable input and output states, and programmable in a broad sense. This definition aims to capture
the idea that a system's behavior can be altered by varying a set of parameters, (Müller & Hoffmann,
2017).
MC can be theoretically modeled by Hewitt’s model of computation (Hewitt, 2012) in which
information processing results from interactions between the parts of a distributed agent system
(subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, and their assemblies) exchanging “messages” which can take
different forms. Such agent-based concurrent computational systems have shown to be applicable for
modeling natural systems and recently earned prominence in Artificial Intelligence, where the idea
goes back to Marvin Minsky’s “Society of Mind” model of intelligence, (Minsky, 1986).
Cognitive morphological computation is rooted in the understanding that all living organisms possess
cognitive abilities. As (Maturana & Varela, 1980) and (Stewart, 1996) argued, every single cell
constantly cognizes by registering external inputs from its environment and internal signals from its
body, ensuring survival through metabolic and behavioral processes. This perspective sees physico-
chemical-biological-cognitive processes as forms of morphological computation, dependent on the
morphology of the organism—its material, form, and structure.
Cognition includes not only high-level mental activities but also sub-symbolic processes (Levin et al.,
2021) (Lyon et al., 2021) as well as extended and distributed/social cognition. This understanding
aligns with the mechanisms of information compression as a unifying principle in learning,
perception, and cognition (Wolff, 2006).
3
Recent successes of generative AI based on compressed information of all available digital
information from the Internet and other sources nicely illustrate the power of info-computational
mechanisms in generating knowledge and meaning.
Computational Nature is conceptualized as a network of concurrent morphological computations,
appearing in nature on different levels of organization, from physics to chemistry, biology, and
cognition, giving rise to phenomena such as self-assembly, self-organization, and autopoiesis. This
perspective offers a holistic view of cognition, where information processing is distributed across
different levels of organization and facilitated by the physical properties of the organism. It recognizes
the importance of both the structural and dynamic aspects of cognition, highlighting the interplay
between form and function in shaping cognitive behavior, where form enables the function which in
turn leads to new forms. By embracing this broader view, we can better understand the cognitive
abilities of diverse life forms and explore new possibilities for developing intelligent artifacts inspired
by biological systems.
Natural Computation is inspired by Computational Nature (computing nature) and proposes using
natural computing as a generalization of our present understanding of computing. Crutchfield makes
the distinction between intrinsic (natural) and designed computation (Crutchfield et al., 2010). He
emphasizes the necessity of including analog computation and not only reducing all computational
models to digital which he calls “digital hegemony”. He illustrates the point by the case of quantum
computation, (Crutchfield & Wiesner, 2008). For a cognizer, some processes in nature appear as
continuous and it is important to include both discrete and continuous computing in our framework.
Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Foundations of Info-computational Framework for
Cognitive Abilities in Diverse Life Forms and Robotics
Recent research has revealed that cognitive processes are present in all living organisms, from single
cells to complex beings (Levin et al., 2021) (Lyon et al., 2021). Single-celled organisms, for example,
demonstrate basic cognitive processes through their interactions with the environment. Rich empirical
evidence has shown that unicellular organisms exhibit forms of social cognition through
communication and collective behavior. Bacteria use quorum sensing, (Ng & Bassler, 2009) (Waters
& Bassler, 2005) to communicate and coordinate their behavior in response to environmental changes,
(Ben-Jacob, 2009). This form of social cognition, observed in microbial communities shows the
cognitive capabilities of even the simplest life forms (Ben-Jacob, 2008). Groups of organisms exhibit
distributed cognition through information processing as shown by (Rumelhart et al., 1986) (Rogers &
McClelland, 2014) and (Almér et al., 2015).
Multicellular organisms, including plants, have more complex cognitive behaviors. Plants, despite
lacking a nervous system, can perceive and respond to environmental stimuli, communicate through
chemical signaling, and even exhibit memory (Garzon, 2012) (Calvo & Friston, 2017) (Calvo et al.,
2020). These cognitive abilities are based on morphological computation, where the physical
properties of the plant's structure play a crucial role in processing information.
In animals, cognition extends beyond individual organisms to include social and collective behaviors.
Social insects like ants and bees, for instance, show sophisticated forms of distributed cognition
through collective decision-making and problem-solving. These behaviors are based on
morphological computation, where the interactions between individuals and their environment shape
the cognitive processes of the colony.
4
Insights from biology about morphological information processing are further reinforced by the work
of researchers within robotics (Paul, 2006) (Pfeifer & Iida, 2005) and (Hauser et al., 2014) who have
observed computation processes in more general terms, accounting for the physical embodiment of
computational mechanisms on the macroscopic levels of mechanical robotic bodies.
Combining empirical evidence from biology and robotics extended the idea of morphological
computation by the proposal that cognition in cognitive agents, in general, can be understood as
morphological information processing at various levels of organization/levels of agency, (Dodig-
Crnkovic, 2014).
The info-computational framework provides a robust theoretical foundation for understanding
cognition as an emergent property of complex multiscale phenomena in living organisms, empirically
studied by (McMillen et al., 2022) (McMillen & Levin, 2024).
The empirical evidence is supported by the mathematical model of info-computationalism in terms of
Category Theory proposed by (Ehresmann, 2014).
Sub-Symbolic Information (Data/Signal) Processing – Integration of Feelings and Emotions
Predominant views of cognition have often overlooked sub-symbolic and sub-conscious processes,
focusing primarily on high-level, symbolic reasoning. However, recent research has emphasized the
importance of these processes in understanding cognition as a whole.
Sub-symbolic processes involve low-level, continuous information processing that underlies higher-
order cognitive functions. For example, the perception of sensory stimuli and the regulation of bodily
functions are governed by sub-symbolic processes. These processes are often automatic and do not
require conscious awareness, yet they play a critical role in shaping cognitive behavior.
Sub-conscious processes involve mental activities that occur below the level of conscious awareness.
Emotions, for instance, are subconscious processes that influence decision-making, learning, and
memory. The integration of emotions into cognitive models has been a significant step in bridging the
gap between cognition and its underlying physiological processes, (Damasio, 1999).
By embracing ICON/MC perspective, one can address many of the unsolved problems in cognitive
science, including the integration of sub-symbolic information processing such as emotions, and
feelings as well as consciousness, and social cognition.
Distributed and Social Cognition – “All intelligence is Social Intelligence”
As mentioned before, cognition is not limited to individual organisms but can also be distributed
across groups and social networks. Distributed cognition refers to cognitive processes that are shared
among individuals within a group, enabling collective problem-solving and decision-making. As
observed by (Falandays et al., 2023) and (McMillen et al., 2022) “all intelligence is social
intelligence”. Social cognition involves the ability to perceive, interpret, and respond to social signals.
It includes processes such as empathy, theory of mind, and social learning, which are essential for
navigating complex social environments. In humans, social cognition is a key component of high-
level cognitive functions, but it is also present in other animals, showing the continuity of cognitive
processes across species.

Morphological Computation and Information Self-structuring/Self-organization.
Teleonomy and Purposiveness in Living Systems
Morphological computation plays a fundamental role in the info-computational framework describing
the continuous self-structuring of information at different levels of organization, (Lungarella &
Sporns, 2005) (Braitenberg, 2011) (Der, 2011). Information self-structuring refers to the dynamic
organization of information through interactions with the environment. In living organisms, this
process is enabled by the morphology of the organism, which shapes how information is perceived,
processed, and acted upon. For example, the structure of sensory organs influences how sensory
information is received and integrated, while the organization of neural networks determines how
information is processed and stored, (Pfeifer & Iida, 2005) (Pfeifer & Bongard, 2006) (Pfeifer &
Gomez, 2009).
The autonomous agency of living organisms as empirically observed in biology (Levin, 2023) drives
teleonomy and purposiveness in living systems, which arise from goal-directed behaviors. These
teleonomic processes contribute to the directedness and adaptiveness of evolutionary change,
(Sloman, 2013). The basis of goal-directed behavior is memory and learning. An organism learns
from previous experiences about the world to anticipate possible future states (Rosen, 1985).
Evolution provides learning mechanisms for organisms to find the most favorable circumstances for
survival and flourishing. This process is enabled by embodied information self-structuring/self-
organization. The goal-directedness (teleonomy, purposiveness) of living beings is a result of their
agency, that is, the ability to act on their own behalf, given past experiences and preferences. See also
(Corning et al., 2023).
ICON connects evolution with the agency of biological systems by viewing evolution as a process of
morphological computation driven by the embodied, info-computational, cognitive nature of living
organisms. It highlights the multi-scale agency, embodied cognition, self-organization, and teleonomy
of biological systems as key factors shaping evolutionary dynamics.
ICON and the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES) – Cognition-based Evolution
The theory of evolution that Info-Computational Naturalism relies on is the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis (EES) (Laland et al., 2015), the most advanced and up-to-date Theory of Evolution that
integrates recent scientific results from developmental biology, evolutionary biology, computational
biology, genetics, ecology, neuroscience, and more.
The EES considers how developmental processes and environmental influences impact evolutionary
patterns beyond genetic inheritance (genetic determinism) (Noble, 2006). Evolutionary processes
occur at multiple levels (genetic, developmental, behavioral, and cultural) and their interactions. EES
acknowledges multiple forms of inheritance beyond genetic inheritance, such as epigenetic,
ecological, and cultural inheritance (Jablonka et al., 2014). It emphasizes the role of developmental
processes in evolution and considers how changes in development (e.g., gene expression, cellular
processes) can lead to phenotypic variation and contribute to evolutionary change. Reciprocal
causation, the two-way interaction between organisms and their environments, plays an important
role. Not only does the environment influence the evolution of organisms, but organisms also modify
their environments (niche construction), which in turn affects evolutionary processes. The EES
examines how information is transferred across inheritance systems and hierarchical levels to shape
6
evolution. By incorporating new mechanisms, emphasizing the role of developmental processes, and
considering multiple forms of inheritance and levels of selection, EES provides a more integrative and
dynamic understanding of evolution. It challenges the limitations of the traditional evolutionary
theory by incorporating new research directions and mechanisms.
Within ICON, life=cognition which implies agency, and evolution is therefore driven by the cognition
of living organisms. Miller and Torday provide a detailed account of a cognition-based evolution,
(Miller & Torday, 2018) (Miller, 2023).
ICON also incorporates the concepts of emergence and self-organization, which are also central to the
EES's study of how developmental processes like plasticity and environmental induction shape
phenotypic variation and evolutionary dynamics.
Evolution of Information
Computing nature is a hierarchical view with info-computational processes across multiple scales,
from elementary particles to biological and cognitive systems. Information structures and
computational dynamics at lower levels give rise to higher-level emergent phenomena through self-
organization processes. In the next step, top-down control structures are activated (such as the brain
and nervous system controlling bodily movements and functions). The information transfer goes both
ways, bottom-up and top-down. (Marijuán & Navarro, 2022) discuss the biological information
flow from cells to the level of evolution of life, arguing for the necessity of extended evolutionary
synthesis. Also (Malassé, 2022) (Royal Society, 2016) (Torday et al., 2020) recognize evolution as
resulting from interactions between various processes (genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and cultural)
across multiple levels of biological organization. The evolution of information is driven by these
multi-level interactions and information transfers between hierarchical levels. Underlying are
fundamental principles of biological computation, (Shklovskiy-Kordi et al., 2022).
Embodied cognition enables agency, where the physical embodiment of agents and their interactions
with the environment shape the computational processes of cognition and intelligence. This embodied
agency is a key factor in the evolution of increasingly complex informational and cognitive structures
of organisms. (Miller, 2023)
A Short Comment on The Role of an “Observer” = “Cognizer” = “Generator” of Knowledge
It should be pointed out that the Info-Computational Naturalism presupposes an observer. Both
information and its dynamics computation are “observer-relative”. It is compatible with the views of
modern physics (Rovelli, 2015) and by no means implies subjectivity. Observer relative is in the same
sense as relativistic physics or quantum mechanics. Here we also assume that the observer is not a
“material point” as in physics or a “fly on the wall” as in the experiment observing human behavior.
Observer is a cognitive agent; it interacts with the world and interprets it. In theories of knowledge,
we are still lacking an adequate theory of an observer, (Fields, 2012). We may see an “observer” or
rather “cognizer”, an active cognizing agent constructing her/his/its knowledge/ understanding/
”feeling” of the world as a result of interactions with the world and intrinsic information processing.
We may see this agent as insignificant in the context and represent it as “a point of view” like in
relativistic physics or completely decisive like in artistic cognition where the actor is the creator and
7
interpreter with huge freedom. In any case, understanding the observer/cognizer makes a difference,
even if it only defines the vantage point.
For an observer, reality comes as information. All physical processes manifest themselves as
information for a cognizer. That is what Sara Walker calls “the hard problem of matter” (Walker,
2024) and John Wheeler termed “it from bit”, (Wheeler, 1994). We do not know what physical
objects intrinsically are (in themselves), already Immanuel Kant made that observation about “Ding
an Sich” (thing-in-itself). As observers/cognizers we know what they are for us – information. And
their processes are computations.
Conventional computing is designed as substrate-independent. Any substrate that implements Boolean
logic, can be used to compute as it is based on the logical model of computation. Natural computing,
on the other hand, is substrate-dependent and can be used to program the material behavior on a given
level of organization. (Bongard & Levin, 2023) refer to this as "polycomputing" - the ability of the
same substrate to simultaneously compute different things so we have quantum computing, molecular
computing, and cognitive computing in the physical system.
The Relationships with Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle and Active Inference
Friston's Free Energy Principle with active inference, (Friston et al., 2012) (Friston et al., 2015) (Parr
& Friston, 2019) (Kuchling et al., 2020) (Parr et al., 2022) can be understood within the conceptual
framework of Info-computational Naturalism as the basis of the behavior of cognitive agents with
mutual interactions and constant exchanges with the environment. The Free Energy Principle (FEP)
suggests that biological systems, including the brain, strive to minimize free energy. Free energy is a
measure of surprise or uncertainty about sensory inputs. By minimizing free energy, the brain reduces
the difference between its prediction and the actual sensory input. The brain constantly generates
predictions about sensory inputs based on internal world models. When actual sensory inputs are
received, they are compared to these predictions. Discrepancies (prediction errors) are used to update
the internal models to better match reality. This process is known as predictive coding. Perception is
thus a process of inference where the brain interprets sensory data by constantly updating its
predictions to minimize free energy. As cognition is fundamentally about making predictions
(anticipation), Active Inference extends the FEP by incorporating action. It suggests that actions are
performed to fulfill the brain’s predictions and reduce prediction errors. The brain not only updates its
models based on sensory input but also actively changes the environment to make it conform to its
predictions. The FEP and Active Inference suggest that all cognitive processes are geared toward
predicting sensory inputs and minimizing surprise or prediction errors.
ICON similarly emphasizes an embodied, active view of cognition arising from the interactions
between an agent/organism and its environment. FEP describes perception and action as information
processing for minimizing surprise/uncertainty. ICON views cognition through the agency of
living/artifactual systems by morphological/natural computation, learning, and “learning to learn”.
ICON incorporates self-organization as a key process in the framework, which aligns with Friston's
ideas on self-organized dynamics minimizing free energy. Both approaches propose hierarchical
models - ICON a multi-scale hierarchy of info-computational processes, and Friston hierarchical
predictive coding.
Applications in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
8
Beyond biology and cognitive science, principles of morphological computation and info-
computationalism have practical applications among others in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI)
and robotics. By designing systems that utilize the physical properties of their bodies to process
information, we can develop more efficient and adaptive artificial agents.
For instance, robots that employ morphological computation can reduce the need for complex control
algorithms by leveraging their physical structure to perform tasks, as already argued by Pfeifer
(Hauser et al., 2014) (Pfeifer et al., 2006) (Pfeifer & Bongard, 2006). This approach not only saves
computational resources but also enhances the robot's ability to adapt to changing environments.
In AI, the info-computational framework can inspire new models of cognitive processing that
incorporate continuous and dynamic information self-structuring. These models can improve the
ability of artificial systems to learn, adapt, and interact with their environment.
Future Work
Advancing Insights into Life and Natural Cognition
Recognizing the cognitive abilities of all living organisms has profound implications for our
understanding of natural cognition and life. By studying cognitive processes across different life
forms, we can gain insights into the fundamental principles of cognition and explore the evolutionary
roots of cognitive behavior.
This broader perspective challenges the traditional boundaries between different fields of study,
encouraging interdisciplinary research that integrates insights from physics, chemistry, biology,
neuroscience, computer science, robotics, philosophy, and other related fields. By embracing a more
holistic view of cognition, we can develop new theories and models that capture the complexity and
diversity of cognitive processes, and improve our understanding of intelligence, and evolution.
Developing Intelligent Artifacts
The insights gained from studying natural cognition can also inform the development of intelligent
artifacts. The present-day huge success of LLMs based on the compressed knowledge of humanity as
found on the Internet is just the beginning of the process of AI development extending into the
physical world. By implementing the principles of morphological computation and the info-
computational approach, combined with generative AI, researchers can create artificial systems that
exhibit more adaptive and intelligent behavior.
For example, bio-inspired robots that utilize morphological computation can navigate complex
environments more effectively by leveraging their physical structure. Similarly, AI systems that
incorporate continuous information self-structuring can improve their ability to learn and adapt in
real-time, enhancing their performance in dynamic and unpredictable settings.
Conclusions
The approach of Natural Computationalism with morphological info-computational conceptual tools
offers a transformative view of cognition, challenging conventional human-centric symbolic models
based on the Turing Machine view of computation and recognizing the cognitive abilities of all living
9
organisms. It situates humans in the ecology of other cognizing agents, natural and artifactual. This
new perspective not only enhances our understanding of natural cognition but also provides practical
insights into the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0. PROFESSIONAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Begin directly with the paper title or content - NO conversational openings
   - Do NOT use phrases like: 'Okay, here's...', 'Here's a summary...',
     'Let me summarize...', 'I'll extract...', or similar conversational language
   - Start immediately with substantive content in formal academic tone
   - Example BAD: 'Okay, here's a summary of the paper...'
   - Example GOOD: 'This paper investigates [topic]...'

1. Start with exact title: "Exploring Cognition through Morphological Info-Computational Framework"

2. EXTRACT QUOTES:
   - Extract 10-15 direct quotes from the paper that support key claims
   - QUOTE EXTRACTION AND FORMATTING:
     * Extract quotes VERBATIM from the paper text - do NOT modify or "correct" them
     * Extract quotes exactly as they appear in the source text
     * Preserve all aspects of the quote exactly as written, including spacing
     * Use proper quotation marks: "quote text" (double quotes)
     * CRITICAL: Only extract quotes that actually appear in the paper text
     * Do NOT generate, invent, or "fix" quotes - extract them exactly as written
   - QUOTE FORMATTING STANDARD:
     * Attribution format: 'The authors state: "quote text"' OR 'According to the paper: "quote text"'
     * Vary attribution phrases to avoid repetition (use: 'The authors state', 'They note',
       'The paper argues', 'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates')
     * Include section context when available: 'In the Introduction, the authors state: "quote text"'
     * Ensure proper spacing around quotes and punctuation
   - Search the full paper text to find relevant quotes
   - Each quote must be verbatim from the paper text (with spacing normalized)

3. IDENTIFY CLAIMS:
   - Identify the main claims and arguments made by the authors
   - State each claim clearly and support it with quotes from the paper
   - Distinguish between primary claims and supporting arguments

4. SUMMARIZE KEY FINDINGS:
   - Summarize the key findings with specific numbers, metrics, and results
   - Include quantitative data: percentages, statistics, measurements
   - Extract numerical results from the results section
   - Present findings with supporting evidence from the paper

5. DESCRIBE METHODS:
   - Describe the methodology, experimental setup, and approach used
   - Include details about: algorithms, procedures, experimental design
   - Explain how the research was conducted
   - Extract specific methodological details from the methods section

6. PRESENT RESULTS:
   - Present the results with quantitative data and statistical significance
   - Include specific numbers, tables, figures mentioned in the paper
   - Extract results from the results section with exact values
   - Support results with quotes or data from the paper

7. NO REPETITION - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT (ENHANCED):
   - CRITICAL: Before writing EACH sentence, check: 'Have I already said this exact idea?'
   - If you've already stated an idea, DO NOT repeat it - move to the next unique point
   - Each sentence must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate ideas, even with different words
   - Each claim appears EXACTLY ONCE - if you've stated it, move to the next unique point
   - Each paragraph must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no duplicate paragraphs
   - Do NOT repeat the same sentence, even with slight variations or word changes
   - Do NOT repeat paragraphs or sections - each section must have unique content
   - Each claim should appear only ONCE in the entire summary
   - Vary attribution phrases: use 'The authors state', 'They note', 'The paper argues',
     'According to the research', 'The study demonstrates' - do NOT repeat the same phrase
   - If you find yourself writing similar content, STOP immediately and write something completely different
   - Before each sentence, ask: 'Have I already said this?' If yes, write something new
   - Vary your language: use synonyms, different sentence structures, different perspectives
   - REPETITION CHECKLIST: After writing each sentence, verify it's not a duplicate of any previous sentence

   EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
   ❌ BAD: 'The authors state: "X". The authors state: "Y". The authors state: "Z".'
   ✅ GOOD: 'The authors state: "X". They further note: "Y". The paper argues: "Z".'

   ❌ BAD: Repeating the same claim 3+ times with slight variations
   ✅ GOOD: State each claim once, then move to the next unique point

8. STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown headers: ### Overview, ### Methodology, ### Results, ### Discussion
   - Target length: 1000-1500 words
   - Ensure all requested elements (quotes, claims, findings, methods, results) are included
