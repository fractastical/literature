### OverviewThis paper investigates the processes of tool discovery and tool innovation using the framework of active inference. The authors articulate a distinction between these concepts, defining tool discovery as the incidental repetition of actions while tool innovation involves constructing novel tools independently. They propose a minimal model to explore tool innovation, incorporating the notion of tool affordances into the agent’s probabilistic generative model to facilitate offline induction of an appropriate tool property. The study highlights the importance of Bayesian model inversion and the role of minimising information-theoretic surprise in driving adaptive behaviour.### MethodologyThe research employs a computational model to investigate tool innovation within a discrete-state space using partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The model incorporates a generative model with hidden states and tool states. The authors utilise a uniform distribution for the transition likelihood model, allowing the agent to learn state transitions through exploration. The agents are initialised with a uniform distribution and the model is implemented in Python using the pymdp package, which facilitates Bayesian model inversion and the updating of model parameters based on observed data. The agents are exposed to different reward locations to test the model’s ability to solve the task. The model is defined as a joint probability distribution over observations, hidden states, and policies. The key parameters of the model are the transition likelihood and observation likelihood distributions, which are updated based on the agent’s interactions with the environment.### ResultsThe study demonstrates that the agent can straightforwardly use tools optimally to solve a task when a perfect generative model is provided. Furthermore, the agent can discover the correct tools and learn to solve the task when it is not provided with this information in its model a priori. The agent’s ability to innovate is facilitated by incorporating tool affordances into the hidden states of the generative model to conceive offline the appropriate properties of the tool required to solve the task. The agent’s performance is measured by the number of steps required to solve the task, which varies depending on the reward location. The results show that the agent’s ability to innovate is dependent on the agent’s ability to learn state transitions and to incorporate tool affordances into the generative model. The agent’s performance is also dependent on the agent’s ability to learn state transitions.### DiscussionThe authors highlight that the agent’s ability to innovate is driven by the principle of minimising information-theoretic surprise, which is a core tenet of active inference. The incorporation of tool affordances into the generative model enables the agent to construct novel tools through a process of offline induction of an appropriate tool property. The study demonstrates that the agent can discover the correct tools and learn to solve the task when it is not provided with this information in its model a priori. The authors acknowledge that their model is a simplified representation of the complex processes involved in tool innovation and that future research should focus on incorporating more realistic sensorimotor challenges. They suggest that a more sophisticated model could incorporate a definition of ‘affordances’ based on ecological psychology, allowing the agent to learn more complex tool manipulation skills. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying tool innovation and highlights the importance of Bayesian model inversion and minimising information-theoretic surprise in driving adaptive behaviour.
