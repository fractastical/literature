ABSTRACT:
Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and
behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by
providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the
development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories
generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to
neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect
of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to
modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical
gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important
source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals
infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information
processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of
psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent
increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input,
becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted
priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this
model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.
INTRODUCTION:
The study of psychiatric disease has traditionally been split across a number of sub-disciplines,
from the social to the molecular1. Integrating insights from across these disparate levels of
explanation has been challenging, in large part because we have lacked a language that can
translate findings from different levels into a common framework2. The field of computational
psychiatry has sought to provide this framework through well-defined mathematical and
algorithmic models that can be fit to data from various domains, such as neural responses,
choice behavior, and self-report. Algorithmic processes and free parameters in models
capturing such processes can generate individual patient-level insights, and these processes
can simultaneously be mapped to the neural systems that implement them. Specifically, free
parameters in these models can be estimated at the individual patient level, providing an
individual-level measure of a given latent process. Thus, these models can serve to provide
formal links between behavioral, neurobiological, phenomenological, and social findings3. One
persistent challenge, however, has been the adequate representation of core psychiatric
phenomena within computational models. In this review, we focus on efforts to model one
complex, but critical, element of human experience commonly affected within psychopathology:
affect4.
Affect is often understood as an individual's momentary experience of valence
(pleasant/unpleasant) and arousal (high/low). While these basic feelings accompany a wide
range of other experiences, they are a core feature of emotions. Theories of emotion vary, but
are often associated with specific situational causes, cognitions, bodily/interoceptive responses,
and observable behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, approach-avoidance drives). A related
construct is mood, which typically refers to more stable, long-term affective states that are
influenced by cumulative experience. Here we focus on emotions and mood as phenomena with
affect as a core element, with the understanding that affect is a broader category and that there
are important differences in timescale. We also consider specific emotion categories, as well as
relevant cognitive and interoceptive components5.
One might argue that a true understanding of any cognitive process, especially in the context of
psychiatric illness, can be obtained only when its interaction with affect has been adequately
modelled. Indeed, affect is known to influence behavior, thoughts, attention, visceral states,
perception, and decision-making 6–8. Executive function is also so closely tied to affect that it is
often studied as either ‘cold’ (affectively neutral) or ‘hot’ (affectively charged)9,10. For example,
negatively valenced states with low arousal (boredom) vs. high arousal (e.g., frustration) have
been shown to influence experimental results in important ways11,12.
Affect is a key feature of many psychiatric illnesses, from depressive disorders to the psychosis
prodrome13,14. Indeed, the prevalence of disturbances in affect and mood in schizophrenia has
been reported to be around 40%15 and up to 80% of patients with chronic schizophrenia have
experienced a depressive episode16. Similarly, negative symptoms in schizophrenia are
characterized by anticipatory anhedonia17. In addition, reducing the negative affect or distress
associated with symptoms, beyond reduction of the symptoms themselves, has been proposed
to be one of the driving factors of the efficacy of psychotropics18.
In this review, we will discuss previous approaches to modelling affect in computational
psychiatry. We will then discuss limitations of this work, and use these limitations to highlight the
potential for further advances. In service of this, we will examine the test case of the psychosis
prodrome, demonstrating how the role of affect can be integrated into a recently developed
model of psychotic symptom development 2.
Literature Review of Affect in Computational Psychiatry
Affect is often assumed to exist because it carries information for an organism that is relevant to
survival or reproduction. This information (e.g., regarding the presence or degree of threat, the
internal states and intentions of others, or the degree to which we find ourselves in a favorable
environmental state), can be crucial for guiding behavior adaptively19,20. Yet, it can also guide
behavior maladaptively, such as in the context of psychiatric illness. If we consider affect as a
carrier of information used to guide inference and choice (among other internal processes),
models of the associated computational processes could offer important insights.
In this section, we will explore several approaches to modelling affect. We will begin with
reinforcement learning (RL) models, which generally focus on appetitive and aversive aspects of
affect. In this framework, affect is often conceptualized as a way to modify sensitivity to rewards.
We will then discuss active inference21, which further posits that agents aim to reduce their
uncertainty and maximize their ability to prospectively predict choice outcomes. This often takes
the form of first acting to gain information (exploration) and then using that information to
achieve reward and remain within desired states (exploitation). In active inference, it has often
been posited that information contained within affect assists in inference over both internal and
external states, and in predicting the likely outcomes of actions. Following active inference, we
will also discuss a related model widely applied to behavioral and neural data, the hierarchical
gaussian filter, or HGF22.
A complementary modelling framework we will consider, drift-diffusion models (DDMs), focus on
sequential sampling for evidence accumulation toward a choice threshold. DDMs incorporate
parameters reflecting the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), the starting bias in evidence
accumulation, and the distance to a decision threshold. Within these models, affect could be
posited to modify one or more of these and thereby explain individual differences in choice,
such as, for example, incorrect responses that occur due to impulsivity (low decision-bound) vs.
exaggerated uncertainty (low drift rate).
In what follows, we aim to give the reader an understanding of selected findings and theories in
this literature, with a focus on models that offer mechanistic insights into the role of affect in
mental illness. There are several ways that affect and bias towards certain affective states can
be captured within existing modeling frameworks within the processes of learning and inference.
Formalization using computational models could allow us to test these ideas directly, and so we
review how each of these frameworks capture the development of affect and affect bias below.
Reinforcement Learning Models
Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to a class of machine learning algorithms that model how an
agent takes actions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishment, and adjusts its
expectations and behaviour to maximize long-term reward23. These models have long been
used to study how individuals adapt their behaviour based on feedback from their environment24
25 26. Within the RL framework, affect may track specific patterns in the valence (reward or
punishment) and magnitude of outcomes, which in turn affect learning and action selection.
Here, the perceived magnitude of a rewarding outcome can be parameterized as a “reward
sensitivity” parameter that scales its objective reward value. It has been shown that reduced
reward sensitivity affects the learning process of individuals with depression27 and that
anhedonia is specifically related to reduced reward sensitivity (motivation to act on reward), in
the absence of altered learning rates28,29. Dopamine agonism has also been shown to modify
learning rates in healthy individuals28.
Another line of work has related momentary happiness levels to the cumulative impact of recent
outcomes and associated patterns of surprise. In one study using a simple a gambling task, for
example, Rutledge et al. (2014) showed that trial-by-trial self-reported happiness was
predominantly associated with the recent history of positive reward prediction errors (e.g. when
outcomes were repeatedly better than expected) versus expected rewards themselves30. As
prediction errors are weighted by learning rates in belief updating, biases in learning rates for
positive versus negative outcomes may also bias individuals toward positive versus negative
mood states (e.g., by effectively making positive surprises consistently stronger or weaker than
negative surprises)31.
In these models, one proposed role of affect is to bias reward sensitivity. Namely, in a more
positive mood, rewards will be perceived as more rewarding; in a negative mood, punishments
will feel more punishing. This can be adaptive in helping an organism track trajectories of
change in the environment (e.g., seasonally changing resources), but it also creates the
potential for instability. For example, if this biasing effect is too strong, a stable reward level can
lead to exaggerated positive expectations, followed by disappointment and exaggerated
negative expectations, followed by positive surprise and exaggerated positive expectations, and
so on in cyclic fashion. This offers one interesting computational mechanism that could
contribute to the emotional instability observed in bipolar or cyclothymic disorders31. Stronger
effects of current mood on perceived outcomes have been observed in those with greater mood
instability32. Current mood has also been shown to influence reward learning: Bennett et al.
(2023) have demonstrated that positive affect induction leads to higher reward expectations,
while negative affect induction leads to lower reward expectations33. Reward expectation was
also driven by affect-related shifts in attention. That is, when in a positive affective state,
individuals paid more attention to positive, high value features of the stimuli, while negative
emotional states led individuals to pay more attention to negative, low-value features. In
schizophrenia, negative symptoms have been associated with reduced reward-driven learning34,
reduced reward sensitivity35, reduced learning on “Go” trials, as well as reduced tendency to
explore potential actions (correlated with anhedonia)36. These results may tie together the early
appearance of depressive symptoms as well as negative symptoms early in the psychosis
prodrome14. However, it should be noted that the relationship between exploration and
schizophrenia is complex. In particular, while reductions in directed exploration (i.e., directing
choice toward more uncertain options) have been seen in some studies 37, other work has
instead shown increased exploration (often via random choice strategies) in this population 38.
It is important to note that, while these RL models have included a role for positive or negative
valence in action selection, there is a much wider array of known influences of affect and
emotion not captured by this approach. Thus, it will be important to find ways in which these
other influences (e.g., on attention, visceral regulation, interpretation biases, etc.) might be
included in extended models (see 39,40). In general, RL frameworks tend to model affect as the
result of prediction errors related to rewards and punishment, with affect then shaping sensitivity
to rewards.
Active Inference
Active inference is a Bayesian theoretical framework that models the brain as a predictive
agent. In perception, active inference aims to identify interpretations of sensory input that
maximize the predictive accuracy of an internal (generative) model of the world; in decision
making, it aims to predict which actions are most likely to generate preferred (i.e., rewarding)
outcomes21. The drive to reduce uncertainty through information-seeking actions (and thereby
improve predictions) is a core feature of this framework. Due to its comprehensive nature, active
inference has emerged as an effective framework for modelling affect, suggesting that it may
arise, at least in part, from the brain’s attempt to predict and explain both the world and internal
bodily sensations41 using an internal generative model. Dysfunctions within that generative
model can lead to maladaptive affective responses in psychopathology, as the brain is unable to
accurately predict the world or predict and regulate internal sensations42.
A conceptual paper by Biddell et al. (2024)43 outlined a theoretical framework based on active
inference for how the interaction between affective arousal and perception of bodily signals may
contribute to both emotional awareness and emotion regulation. Specifically, they propose that
affect arises from an inference process where subjective experience and autonomic arousal
jointly guide decision making toward effective means of reducing uncertainty. In this
conceptualization, autonomic arousal tracks current uncertainty about one’s environment44.
Arousal coherence is then defined as the alignment of subjective experience and autonomic
arousal. Building on active inference principles, the framework posits that the perception of
autonomic arousal guides belief updating about affective states and leads to effective and
adaptive regulation of those states 43; that increased coherence is linked to well-being. One key
limitation of this framework, however, is an assumption that the relationship between arousal
coherence and emotion regulation is consistent, overlooking cases where decoupling of
autonomic arousal and subjective experience might act as a temporary protective mechanism,
such as in PTSD45.
The above-mentioned framework also broadly aligns with work by Hesp et al. (2021)46,46 who
developed a hierarchical active inference model to demonstrate how a simulated agent might
infer the valence of its own affective states. A key piece of evidence in this affective inference
process in their model is an internal observation of changes in confidence regarding one’s own
action model (i.e., whether predicted action outcomes are likely to be accurate). A key
suggestion here was that increases and decreases in confidence act as evidence for positively
and negatively valenced states, respectively, and that these affective states can then act as
prior beliefs about future confidence levels. This link between affect and changes in confidence
bears some similarity to the proposals (and evidence) mentioned above within RL that
happiness levels go up and down based on positive and negative prediction errors. Using this
model, they simulated a synthetic rat navigating a T-maze with positive and negative
reinforcement to show the resulting behavioral dynamics. They found that affective states could
allow for more effective use of recent changes in action-outcome contingencies (e.g., quicker
changes in behavior after a simulated shock), whereas simulated rats without affective states
would engage in maladaptive behavior (e.g. experiencing more punishments before learning to
change strategy). The behavioral dynamics are nuanced, however, as negative affect promotes
random exploratory behavior in the absence of learned habits, but instead causes an agent to
fall back on ingrained habits (i.e., prior expectations about one’s own actions) when these are
present. While unique in positing a role for affect in governing the degree of random exploration
(and habitual behavior) this proposal is also limited as it does not incorporate arousal,
physiological states, attention, and other cognitive processes associated with affect (most
notably perhaps is links between affective states, attention, and modulation of learning rates;
e.g., as incorporated in47 and48.
In a more comprehensive approach, Smith & Lane (2015)49 proposed that embodied emotions
(emotions involving perception of bodily states) are appraised, perceived, and regulated through
an iterative and hierarchical system operating at different time-scales (explaining the rapid and
slow components of emotional responses)49. In this conceptualization, representations of
emotionally relevant stimuli could be triggered by either sensation or imagined stimuli. When
emotionally relevant content is deemed to be present, the body’s internal states can be adjusted
while changes are made to cognitive processes (such as allocation of attention). As certain
cognitive processes occur more slowly, they can then regulate the initial emotional response in
a top-down manner. Importantly, they map their proposed hierarchical model onto a putative
neural hierarchy, implicating key regions for interoception and emotion processing, such as the
insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Building on this work, they conceptually explored individual
differences in emotional experience as being the result of differences in trait emotional
awareness (tEA)50. Here, tEA refers to a set of factors influencing the perception and
understanding of emotions: abstractness (linking sensations to concepts), granularity
(conceptualizing affective states using fine-grained emotion concepts), and self-other distinction
(the capacity to differentiate the emotions of self and others). They argue that differences in tEA
could explain why people experiencing similar affective triggers may have different experiences
and reactions - a concept familiar to any practicing therapist.
Smith et al. (2019)42,51 subsequently explored how active inference could be used to model
emotion conceptualization (i.e., the process of assigning conceptual meaning to cognitive and
bodily responses to emotional stimuli). In their formal simulations, an agent was specifically
modeled as inferring and reporting its emotional states based on both internal (interoceptive52,
cognitive) and external (contextual) cues42, where each emotion category was mapped to a
specific combination of these cues. In this setup, when the model was presented with
inconsistent inputs, its confidence in classifying the emotion category decreased. When there
were unpredictable transitions between emotions, the model also showed challenges in
maintaining stable emotion concepts, leading to uncertainty and instability in its emotional
state53 (as might be seen, for example, in borderline personality disorder). The model could also
be initialized with prior expectations about its likely emotions. If the model started with biased
initial beliefs (e.g., overrepresenting negative emotions), it took longer to recognize other
emotions (a state similar to depression). Finally, attention allocation was crucial; if the model
focused more on external cues (e.g., social context), it developed weaker awareness towards its
internal cues. For related proposals on emotion-related conceptualization processes and their
link to interoception and predictive processing, see54,55.
Motivated by the different proposals described above, Smith et al. (2020) (see replication in5)
applied a Bayesian perception model to behavioral and electrocardiogram data in patients with
anxiety, depression, eating disorders, or substance abuse disorders. Relative to a healthy
sample, all patient groups showed a reduced ability to infer the timing of their own heartbeats in
a cardiac interoceptive task56. Here, the model suggested this was due to reduced confidence in
the cardiac signal, and not due to altered prior expectations. This suggested a specific
mechanism whereby patients might have difficulty using interoceptive information to regulate
visceral states or infer their emotional meaning.
In other work, active inference has been used to model approach-avoidance conflict, with
increased decision uncertainty and altered drives toward affective avoidance demonstrated in
those with anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders 57,58. In general, active inference
approaches can be used to model affect as a state determined by internal and external
observations, and in terms of the confidence an agent has in their own model of the world.
As evident in this brief review of example approaches, active inference (and related Bayesian
models of cognition) may offer broader resources than current applications of (model-free) RL
for capturing the multidimensional nature of affect and emotion. However, empirical tests
directly comparing these approaches to capture emotional dynamics remain to be done59. This
will be an important direction for future work, as will increasing the number of studies which
examine longitudinal trajectories of computational parameters60.
The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter
The HGF22 is a Bayesian model with links to other Bayesian approaches, such as active
inference. Like in active inference, it assumes that agents model the causes of their sensory
input and try to predict the inputs they will receive. Its hierarchical nature allows for the
modelling of different levels of beliefs about sensory input and uncertainty about this input. As
an example of this, we will discuss the modelling of the conditioned hallucinations task. In this
task, participants learn a Pavlovian association between a visual and an auditory stimulus
during the presentation of varying levels of auditory noise. They can then hallucinate the
presence of the auditory stimulus when the visual stimulus is presented, but no auditory
stimulus is. These “conditioned hallucinations” are increased in people with auditory
hallucinations and with psychosis proneness in the general population and track hallucination
severity over time61–63. The HGF applied to behavioral data for this task has three levels of
beliefs. The first tracks whether the participant believes that the auditory stimulus was present;
the second tracks the association between the visual and auditory stimulus; and the third tracks
the perceived volatility (instability) of the association between the auditory and visual stimuli. In
addition to these levels, there is a parameter that tracks the relative weighting of expectations
(known as prior beliefs, or priors) and sensory observations. In general in Bayesian models,
when priors (or other sources of information) are more precise (e.g. more certain or held with
greater confidence), they are given more weight in perceptual decisions. Using this modelling
approach, hyper-precise priors have been shown to drive conditioned hallucinations, and have
been directly associated with neuroimaging61.
The HGF has also widely been used to model behavior in various reversal learning tasks.
Studies repeatedly show that psychotic-like experiences and positive symptoms were
associated with increased perception of environmental volatility across social and non-social
domains. For example, in social learning tasks, where participants need to infer the intentions
of a confederate or an avatar, higher environmental volatility was associated with paranoid
ideation64,65, and shown to be higher in patients with schizophrenia66. Similarly, when predicting
non-social outcomes in the predictive inference task, it was associated with delusional ideation
in non-clinical and with positive symptoms in a clinical sample67. Interestingly, it has been
associated with specific types of affect68–70. For example, expected volatility in the environment
(and prior expectations about how volatility will change over time) has been associated with
subjective stress levels44, and more anxious individuals have shown different patterns of neural
responses in the insula linked to prediction uncertainty71. Related approaches have also shown
that anxiety is linked to greater tendencies to infer categorical changes in the hidden context
(latent hidden states) generating observations72, following on a prior body of work suggesting
learning rates are greater, and less flexible, in those with higher anxiety. Within the Bayesian
inference framework, and evidenced by the update equations of the HGF, greater learning rates
can arise from both greater expected volatility or underestimations of sensory or observational
noise. Once accounting for both in one model, higher schizotypal traits still relate to higher
uncertainty about the environmental volatility, while subclinical symptoms related to depression
and anxiety, as well as negative symptoms of patients with schizophrenia, are associated with
reduced learning about the reliability of sensory information67. Taken together, this suggests that
while psychotic symptoms are linked with issues in building more abstract statistical models of
the environment, supported by cortical areas, negative affect is linked to misestimation of
outcome uncertainty leading to greater expectations that the environment will change
unpredictably over time, due to an aberrant bottom-up signal. Theoretically, this is quite
sensible, as, if greater negative affect is taken as a sign that one’s current model is inaccurate
(i.e., due to repeated prediction errors in a changing environment), it will be optimal to increase
trust in new observations and update beliefs more quickly73, allowing one’s model to once again
reflect an accurate representation of the current environment and reduce the associated
negative affect. However, if this uncertainty cannot be reduced (perhaps due to the source of
uncertainty being within the observer rather than in the environment, which can at least be
sampled differently to reduce uncertainty), this may sustain negative affect. This will be crucial
in our discussion of the psychosis prodrome below. As such, the HGF can be used to model
affect as a function of (potentially inaccurate) perceived uncertainty about the environment.
Drift-diffusion models
Roberts and Hutcherson (2019) reviewed the literature testing affective influences on decision
making mechanisms within Drift Diffusion models (DDMs)74. Four parameters are usually
estimated in DDM paradigms. The first is drift rate, which represents the speed at which
information accumulates towards a certain decision threshold. In one study, those with high
anxiety were found to show a higher drift rate towards recognizing threatening words, even
when the valence of the word was irrelevant to the task75. This suggests they treated the
threatening stimuli as carrying a more reliable signal. The second core parameter is the decision
threshold, which represents the point at which enough evidence has been collected to make a
decision. A higher decision threshold can lead to more cautious (and slower) decisions by
favoring accuracy over speed. 74note the complexity of how affect might influence decision
threshold. On the one hand, negative feedback could increase decision thresholds (i.e., making
behavior more cautious on subsequent trials). However, other negative experiences, such as
anger, might instead decrease decision threshold and make behavior more impulsive.The third
parameter in DDMs is the initial bias, which starts evidence accumulation closer to one decision
threshold than the other. Here, one suggestion is that simple affective priming effects could bias
this starting point in favor of congruent affective responses76. The last parameter is non-decision
time, which represents the time required for sensory/perceptual processing of the stimuli and
action initiation (i.e., processes unrelated to the decision itself). In this case, arousal levels
associated with different emotional states, such as anxiety77, may affect sensory/perceptual
processing time, modifying non-decision time74. There is also evidence that drift rates may have
direct clinical correlates. For example, Pe et al. (2013) found that specific symptoms
(rumination) were associated with greater drift rate for negative stimuli, potentially linked to
negative attentional biases 78.
While simple to use, responsive to affective states, and mappable to neurobiological
processes79–81, it is important to highlight that standard DDM approaches are also limited in a
number of ways. For example, they do not directly model affect; rather, parameter estimates
from the model can be correlated with (or experimentally modified) by affect in different
contexts. In addition, they are restricted to decision-making contexts (though they can be
generalized beyond binary decisions)82 and not designed to model a number of other cognitive
or perceptual processes relevant to affect.
Having reviewed a number of example models and representative findings related to the role of
affect in computational psychiatry, we will now consider progress, challenges, and future
directions for this field.
Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions in Computational Models of Affect
Recent advances in computational psychiatry have significantly enhanced our understanding of
affective processes in psychiatric disorders. We identify three key strengths in the current
literature. First, affect and mood are increasingly recognized as contextual factors that
dynamically alter both current and future expectations, directly impacting learning and decision-
making processes42,51,56,74. This perspective represents a major step forward in linking affective
states with cognitive and behavioral outcomes in a systematic and quantifiable manner. Second,
computational models have effectively captured the interplay between internal experiences and
reactions to environmental stimuli, highlighting how individuals may differentially process the
same external events depending on their internal emotional states and tEA43,49. This interplay
suggests a personalized dimension to emotion processing, with implications for conditions such
as depression and schizophrenia, where interoceptive disturbances have been observed56,83.
Third, the literature has begun to integrate both state- and trait-like dimensions of affect,
providing a more nuanced understanding of short-term affective fluctuations versus stable
individual differences in emotional experience42,50.
Despite these promising advances, several challenges remain. Current models have yet to fully
integrate social and contextual influences on affect-driven learning and belief updating, limiting
their applicability to real-world phenomena. Social cognition—including trust, cooperation, and
emotional contagion—remains underexplored, despite compelling theoretical work suggesting
that social reinforcement and feedback significantly shape affective processing 42,50,51,84.
Computational models have largely focused on individual decision-making in isolated contexts,
neglecting the interactive and interpersonal dimensions of affect regulation. Another key
limitation is the oversimplification of affect as a unidimensional (positive-negative continuum)
construct. In addition, most models and experiments to date do not capture the longer-term
temporal fluctuations of affect, which are dynamically shaped by prior experiences, uncertainty,
and environmental context. Active inference models have begun addressing this issue by
considering affect as arising within a hierarchical inference process that updates over time, yet
the interactions between affective states, interoception, and social context require further
refinement and empirical validation. We argue that comparing reinforcement learning (RL) and
active inference within a unified framework presents a promising direction for future research85.
There is a significant opportunity to use models incorporating affect to explore sex differences in
the expression and treatment of psychiatric symptoms86,87. The influence of changing hormone
levels on cognition and affect throughout the female reproductive lifecycle has often been either
ignored or perceived as an unwanted source of variance, even though hormones have
significant neurobiological effects88. This has led to biased recruitment, and a lack of
understanding of how hormonal fluctuations can influence affective symptoms, such as in the
premenstrual dysphoric syndrome89–91. Computational modelling of the dynamic interplay
between affect, symptoms and hormones in females can therefore not only importantly inform
future treatment development studies but can also serve as an excellent use-case for
developing tools that are sensitive enough to capture subtle changes in affect over long time
periods.
Taking these strengths and limitations into consideration, one key area for further advancement
is in understanding the role of affect in longitudinal modifications of individuals’ models of the
world. The seeds of this are present in the current literature. For example, in a reinforcement
learning context, pathological negative affective states may promote biased reward
expectations, which can in turn lead to choices that reflect these (maladaptive) expectations.
However, we argue that the current use of affect is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and that the
role of affect in shaping perception and explanatory models - for example, the form and content
of prior beliefs that may drive psychotic symptoms2,61,92–94 - may be more nuanced. In the
following section, we will turn to a conceptual model that illustrates a putative role for affect in
the development of psychotic symptoms.
Potential role of affect in the psychosis symptom development and the prodromal period
The earliest phases of psychosis constitute an affectively charged period. Retrospective studies
of prodromal symptoms observed that depressive symptoms often emerge first, followed by
negative symptoms, and then by attenuated psychosis symptoms9514,95,9697. Delusional
mood98,99, a sense of enhanced significance in the environment that needs explanation, occurs
often prior to the development of frank delusions, which themselves tend to be negatively
affectively valenced100,101. Finally, both people with clinical psychosis and those at high risk for
psychosis are known to have increased sensitivity to stressful events, suggesting a phenotype
of affective vulnerability101,102. As such, from the earliest phases of the prodrome to frank
psychosis, there is a prominent role of affective symptomatology. Despite this, computational
accounts of psychosis development have not comprehensively addressed the role of affect in a
longitudinal sense. Here, we will attempt to extend our recent model of psychotic symptom
development2 to include an affective dimension, more fully encompassing known
phenomenology.
Our model posits that the development of psychosis begins with increased cortical noise due to
neurobiological factors such as NMDA receptor dysfunction. This increased cortical noise leads
to aberrant prediction error signalling and impaired capacity of the brain to communicate and
incorporate new information effectively. This intrinsic source of noise provides the germ for
delusional belief formation, which has previously been linked to aberrant prediction error
signalling (see 2,103,104). From this point, multiple routes towards psychotic symptoms may be
possible.
One possibility is that this biologically generated noise leads the brain to overestimate noise
within sensory signals generated by the environment. If so, sensory inputs would be treated as
unreliable sources of information, leading to a relative up-weighting of prior beliefs and slow
learning (e.g., one would be more likely to perceive what is expected). This increased weight on
prior beliefs is consistent with results of multiple studies using the conditioned hallucination
task61–63. When making decisions, this high expected noise would also reduce confidence in
one’s model’s ability to generate desired outcomes, corresponding to negative affect as posited
within the active inference framework (as described above). In other words, the agent would
experience negative affect because it infers it is not able to improve its ability to predict and
control sensory input through action.
An alternative possibility is that this biologically generated noise is mistakenly treated as signal
(i.e., as though it is reliable). In this case, instead of overestimating environmental noise, it
would instead be forced to explain this input by inferring the state of the world is constantly
changing (i.e., it would form the belief that environmental contingencies are highly
unstable/volatile). This inference that the world is ever-changing would entail a down-weighting
of prior beliefs and fast learning. In other words, the model would begin to overfit to noisy
biological signals and show unstable fluctuations in beliefs over time. This is consistent with
other work suggesting overfitting of visual and somatosensory/proprioceptive sensory input in
psychosis (e.g., alterations in visual pursuit and force-matching, among others; see105). Even in
this case, however, over longer timescales one might expect higher levels of processing to infer
these constantly shifting beliefs are not effective at explaining sensory data and that this data
may in fact be less reliable than initially estimated. This is speculative, but could represent a
more indirect route to eventually down-weighting sensory signals and up-weighting prior beliefs.
Thus, one might assume that under both possibilities the longer-term result is a reduced
reliance on sensory signals and a relative increase in reliance on prior beliefs. This
compensatory increase in dependence on prior beliefs would then set the stage for frank
psychosis. Specifically, psychosis onset could represent the point at which over-weighted
(hyper-precise) priors finally overwhelm the corrective influence of sensory information, which
had, until then, prevented these priors from generating threshold-level percepts92,93. Under this
model, the attenuated psychotic symptoms seen in the prodrome would simply be caused by a
less severe version of the imbalance between priors and sensations present during frank
psychosis.
While this model does explain many of the observations in psychosis phenomenology (see106
and 2 for discussion), it does have limitations. First, it does not address the early development of
negative symptoms, of which affective symptoms are an integral component. Second, it does
not address the cause of the valenced nature of delusions and hallucinations. To address these
gaps, we add an affective component to the model below.
Extension to cortical noise and negative symptoms
First, we link the early increase in cortical noise to the development of negative symptoms,
which have recently been shown to correlate with computational measures of low-level noise67.
Cortical noise and the degeneration of grey matter 107 and white matter tracts 108,109 would lead
to degradation in communication between cortical regions, in addition to bottom-up signal
degradation that we have already tied to aberrant prediction error signaling. This can account
for the distributed changes in multiple brain networks seen in negative symptoms 110. This
neural dysfunction has been shown to affect areas relevant to reward processing111, consistent
with an RL approach to understanding negative symptoms in terms of reduced reward
sensitivity and reward-driven learning34,35. As such, anhedonia and avolition in negative
symptoms can be conceptualized as a reduction in the integrity of reward processing. We
discuss reduced expression of emotions in the section on social withdrawal. The proposed
dysfunction in communication between brain regions also has important implications for affect
dysregulation, as we argue in the following section.
Noise and negative affect
We propose that neural signal degradation, which initially results in the formation of negative
symptoms, also plays a role in the development of a negatively valenced state during the
prodrome. This likely underlies the development of negatively valenced hallucinations and
delusions and would be consistent with the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia112, which
posits large scale dysconnectivity between frontal and temporal regions underlying the illness.
We argue that this dysconnectivity could lead to negative affect via dysfunction of emotion-
related regions113, such as the insula and amygdala, which also underlie key psychosis
symptoms, such as paranoia and hallucinations61,114,115. In addition, increased perception of
environmental instability (parametrized as volatility) during delusion formation can be pointed to
as a potential source of negative (e.g. fearful, uneasy) affect116, which could then be
incorporated into the delusional belief.
Negative belief-emotion spiral
Consistent with the computational models described above, this negative affective state may
cause the observed increase in sensitivity to stresses experienced in daily life seen in the high
risk state117 by continually biasing future expectations. Increased stress sensitivity creates a
negative filter on information processing that may further reinforce negative beliefs and privilege
negative observations. In an active inference framework, we might model this stress sensitivity
as an increased precision (or learning rate) on negatively valenced observations.This would be
present especially in the context of overall reduced sensory precision (i.e., greater expected
noise in environmental signals)62 or increases in expected environmental instability (volatility)
early in the prodrome. This would then lead to an uncertain, fearful, and uneasy affective state
that is potentially discordant with actual signals from the environment–in other words, delusional
mood.
This interplay between affect and unusual beliefs is bi-directional, and it will extend through
time. Negative beliefs will reinforce the negative affective state, and negative affect will reinforce
negative beliefs. The observations present in the environment that might normally rescue this
negative belief-emotion spiral (such as positive events or pleasant interactions with friends and
family) are then limited in their ability to do so, as they are experienced with reduced precision,
and may be sampled less extensively due to potentially reduced levels of directed exploration
(i.e., selecting more uncertain options) caused by negative symptoms. This is in keeping with
greater confidence in (likely negatively valenced) prior beliefs and consequent discounting of
mood-incongruent sensory information. In fact, it has been observed empirically that individuals
with psychosis show reduced levels of directed exploration37, but increased levels of random
exploration38. This is consistent with some other studies (but not all) suggesting greater negative
affect is linked to lower directed exploration (reviewed in118). It is also notable that the active
inference framework discussed above specifically predicts both lower directed exploration (i.e.,
less dependence on expected free energy) and greater random exploration (more noisy, value-
independent choice) in those with greater negative affect.
The Development of Valenced Positive Symptoms and Social Withdrawal
Psychotic beliefs formed in the context of negative affect, and the privileging of negatively
valenced information and internal states, can jointly account for the specifically negative valence
of hallucinations and delusions in clinical populations. This belief formation occurs in the context
of cortical signal degeneration (see2) and with a reduction in cognitive flexibility119,120. The longer
this process persists, the stronger these priors become, and the less viable the alternative
models of the world - resulting in the development of (negatively valenced) crystallized false
beliefs93,121. This would explain why longer durations of untreated psychosis and more insidious
symptom onset is associated with worsened outcome in schizophrenia 95,122,123.
Interestingly, reduced neural pathology in healthy voice hearers compared to patients with
schizophrenia has been observed124. Under our model, this should result in less of the signal
degradation and uncertainty that drives negative affect. This would then result in less negatively
valenced hallucinations - a finding consistently observed in this population125.
One additional symptom that may be better explained by this updated model is social
withdrawal. An initial sense of fearfulness or uncertainty might increase aversion towards social
engagement126–128. This would be consistent with the RL findings discussed above, which
showed aberrant exploration under uncertainty in negative symptoms36, and with other work
linking alterations in exploration with negative affect and psychopathology more broadly118,129–
132. In addition, consistent with RL modelling of negative symptoms, social anhedonia may
cause increased social isolation128, potentially as a result of reductions in reward sensitivity35,133.
In line with the active inference frameworks described above, the person experiencing these
symptoms would additionally observe themselves being less social, and enter self-states of
loneliness, depression, social defeat, or social exclusion, further disincentivizing social
interaction. While speculative, this negatively-biased conceptualization of their social situation
could underlie reduced emotional expression in negative symptoms, which has previously been
linked to reduced amplification of felt emotions in schizophrenia (despite similar felt
emotions)134; e.g., if I believe that I am isolated from others, or that they may be a risk to me,
and I have a reduced perception of the value of social interaction, I may be more likely not to
place effort into making my emotions explicit (given that the goal of this is to facilitate
interpersonal interaction). Recent work has begun to link altered learning under uncertainty in
social contexts to negative symptoms, reinforcing the idea that negative symptoms result at
least in part from an impaired understanding of social situations64.
The self-reinforcing cycle of isolation would likely further degrade the amount and quality of
contradictory information in the environment, reducing the stimuli which could counteract the
growing prior hyper-precision121. Indeed, this reduction in directed exploratory behavior with
negative affect is precisely what is suggested by the active inference approaches discussed
above (e.g. 46). These continuously increasing maladaptive prior beliefs would likely incorporate
these observations as they are formed. This would explain the themes of self-deprecation,
isolation from, and potentially of persecution by, others that are common in delusions and
hallucinations.
It should be noted, however, that positive and negative symptoms do not necessarily co-occur,
with positive symptoms tending to fluctuate more than negative symptoms, and that different
computational correlates of negative vs. positive symptoms have been observed67, which may
call into question a role for negative symptoms and their associated low-level noise in the
generation of positive symptoms. While this requires further longitudinal study, we suggest that
this may be related to a separation in time. The low-level noise that generates negative
symptoms is likely present prior to and regardless of whether positive symptoms are generated,
but this noise provides the conditions in which negatively valenced priors can form, with these
priors then driving hallucinations and delusional conviction independently of negative symptoms
and low-level noise. Vice versa, negatively valenced priors may well form in other ways which
are not associated with the presence of negative symptoms; longitudinal studies of symptom
development with computational phenotyping would be required in order to identify these
groups.
Formalizing the addition of affect
Affect would be added to this model formally in two components: a trait-like component, which
would be roughly equivalent to the clinical definition of mood, and a state-like component,
representing sensitivity to environmental cues and momentary affect (as discussed in the
sections above). Each component could be further resolved into emotion networks composed of
different positive and negative emotions, which would likely have differential activations
dependent on factors such as premorbid personality and traumatic experiences. This would help
account for the fact that delusions and hallucinations often contain content that is emotionally
relevant to the individual’s premorbid context, such as trauma135,136. In addition, it would be
expected that the precise content of the eventual psychotic phenomena would depend on the
precise affective context present during development. For example, sad and self-critical states
during the prodrome would be expected to give rise to critical and self-deprecating
hallucinations; and more fearful or anxious affect might be expected to give rise to more
paranoid beliefs and hallucinations. In addition, previous work137 has suggested that finding
meaning through the construction of delusional narratives (“apophany” in classic
phenomenology99, and coincident with prior hyper-precision in our model), in the context of
preceding states of uncertainty and lack of trust in the world, can be associated with more
positive emotions.
We would expect that parameters representing these components would change in value over
time, with negative affective states strengthening across the prodromal period. Additionally, we
would expect reciprocal reinforcement between the trait- and state-like components, due to the
negative belief-emotion spiral, making both relevant from a treatment planning perspective. In
addition, we might expect to be able to decompose the state-like component to include an
interoceptive dimension, consistent with both the active inference literature described above
connecting interoceptive deficits with psychopathology and previous demonstration of somatic
sensation alterations in schizophrenia138,139. Consistent with the Smith et al models described
above, deficits in interoceptive inference may reduce the ability of patients developing psychosis
to interpret, understand, and regulate their own emotions- making it both more difficult to
regulate dysregulated affect, and increasing the uncertainty about the source of negative affect,
which may further increase the need for highly precise, negatively valenced priors to “explain”
the presence of the negative affect.
Modelling these affective components separately may be relevant for treatment planning, as
temporary alleviation of affective state may not be effective as a treatment if a ‘reservoir’ of
negative affectivity in the trait-like component (perhaps driven by maladaptively highly-precise
priors which are difficult to update with low-precision observations62) will simply re-establish the
negative state-like component in short order.
While this model would explain several phenomenological observations, in order to establish its
validity it would be helpful to have specific predictions. Several of these are included below.
Crucially, if validated through longitudinal computational phenotyping studies which can assess
the temporal order of events with respect to changes in information processing, this model
would provide a staging framework for the psychosis prodrome. Stages and parameter
estimates at each stage (e.g., the strength of an individual’s current prior beliefs) could be
correlated with neurobiological signatures, and these neurobiologically-validated computational
measures could then help identify novel treatment avenues and serve as biomarkers of illness
progression and eventually as predictors of treatment effectiveness.
One area where this computationally-informed model of affect could have immediate and
practical utility would be in better differentiating patients truly at risk for psychosis from those
with attenuated psychotic symptoms in the context of trauma who will likely not develop a
primary psychotic illness, given the high rate of trauma-related disorders in clinical high-risk
samples140. Another area where this model may prove useful is in understanding sex differences
in psychosis development. Women tend to experience more severe affective symptoms in
psychosis as well as during psychosis risk141,142. In addition, men experience more negative
symptoms, including increased asociality97, and there is some evidence of differential
performance in social appraisal in males versus females142,143. Computationally phenotyping
men and women using tasks or approaches consistent with our proposed model may help
clarify the causes of these sex differences. One area for further expansion of this model, while
out of scope of the current work, is language, which is affected in psychosis and is core to both
positive and negative symptoms144. Another key area will be to examine the influence of inter-
individual variation in the development of psychotic themes. For example, many patients have
grandiose delusions, rather than persecutory and negative delusions, and this model would
need to be expanded in order to fully characterize how these more ‘positive’ positive symptoms
could be explained. One possibility is that grandiose ideation is a result of negative affect- the
“manic defense”145; another possibility is that those with grandiosity or mania have a more
greater sensitivity to reward146 (see147 for discussion). Indeed both may be true in different
people- highlighting that learning about subgroups of patients who deviate from the model we
propose based on their premorbid cognitive or affective makeup will be key. One final area for
further research is relationship of each element of this model with neurotransmitter signalling
changes across the prodrome- for example, considering the finding that there is dopamine
dysregulation prior to the onset of psychosis (see148).
Model predictions
1. If priors driving hallucinations/delusions are affectively laden, we would expect that tasks
that tap into affective domains would produce stronger experiences when there is an
affective compared to a neutrally valenced condition. We are currently investigating this
with an affective version of the conditioned hallucinations task61.
2. We should expect affective changes to precede the development of hallucinations and
delusions in the psychosis prodrome if they are part of the causal chain that leads to the
priors that drive them, and we should expect trauma to potentiate this process. As
discussed, significant evidence exists for this prediction (e.g.14,96).
3. We would expect that the precision afforded to negatively valenced information would
begin to increase early in the prodrome and would correlate with the strengthening of
maladaptive priors (i.e., while the precision afforded to other information is also gradually
decreasing). However, as noted, there may be inter-individual differences such that, for
example, some prodromal individuals would potentially experience a bias towards
positive valence, potentially leading to grandiosity.
4. We should expect there to be a temporal correlation between worsening affect and the
onset of either increases in expected environmental instability (volatility) or increases in
expected noise in sensory input (i.e., lower sensory precision-weighting, increased
weighting of prior beliefs), as these are thought to potentially underlie negative affect.
5. We would expect that affective themes experienced earlier in prodrome (and influenced
by premorbid experiences, trauma and cognitive and affective makeup) should be
replicated in the priors driving hallucinations and delusions later on, and therefore in the
themes of these symptoms. Here we would expect to be able to examine and parse
inter-individual differences and define potential subgroups within our proposed model.
6. Treatment of depressive symptoms earlier in the prodrome should reduce the intensity of
negative affect present in positive symptoms, especially for self-critical psychotic
symptoms; this would be due to a modulation of the intensity of the affect during the
generation of the maladaptive prior. However, as affect shape but does not cause prior
hyper-precision, this would not necessarily prevent the psychosis from onsetting.
7. After controlling for prodrome length, we would expect measures of sensitivity to stress
during the prodrome (such as performance on stressful tasks149) to correlate with
increased symptom severity after illness onset.
8. Treating affective states early in the prodrome should change the intensity and content
of symptoms; however, since affective change provides context to the developing
symptoms, but is not the primary process, treating them would not necessarily prevent
the development of psychosis.
CONCLUSION
In this review, we have discussed how computational approaches have enabled us to better
understand the role of affect in information processing within psychiatric illness. Using these
principles, we have extended a recent model of psychotic symptom development to include
affect as an important source of context during symptom development. Given the fact that
affective states can be modified, they may serve as an important focus of treatment during the
prodrome. Likewise, considering and parsing different affective states during illness and illness
development using computational tasks may help improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
planning in a range of psychiatric conditions.
Figure 1. Negative Belief-Emotion Spiral (Blue): Within our Bayesian conceptualization of the
prodrome, expectations (priors) form the lens by which incoming evidence (observations) is
interpreted. Negative affect may increase the precision on negative observations and limit
sampling of corrective, positive observations (via aberrant exploration). Negative interpretations
may subsequently reinforce negative beliefs, further biasing future expectations and
interpretations. Over time, beliefs crystallize, shaping negatively valenced delusions and
hallucinations. Negative Affect-Isolation Spiral (Purple): Negative affect may also inhibit social
engagement and underlie negative conceptualizations of one’s sociability. This would result in
outward symptoms of loneliness, social defeat, and even limited social expression.
Biopsychosocial Underpinnings of Negative Affect (Gray): Negative affect likely stems from
biological (degradation of cortical signals, disconnection of emotion areas), information
processing (e.g. perceived environmental instability, greater expected noise, deficits in
interoception) and social (e.g. isolation) factors.
