## Modeling Autonomous Shifts Between Focus State and Mind-Wandering Using a Predictive-Coding-Inspired Variational RNN ModelThis study investigates potential neural mechanisms underlying autonomous shifts between a focused state and mind-wandering by conducting model simulations. We modeled perception processes of continuous sensory sequences using our previously proposed variational recurrent neural network model, which was developed based on the free energy principle. The model’s adaptation mechanism, referred to as the meta-prior w, regulates the complexity term within the free energy. Specifically, the model demonstrates that mind-wandering occurs more frequently during tasks that are less demanding, such as simply attending to breathing.The authors state: “Thecurrentstudyextendedthismodelbyintroducinganadaptationmechanismofameta-levelparameter,referredtoas themeta-priorw,whichregulatesthecomplexityterminthefreeenergy.”Furthermore, the model demonstrates that shifts between the focused and mind-wandering states occur when the meta-prior w is adjusted. The model’s adaptation mechanism, referred to as the meta-prior w, regulates the complexity term within the free energy.The authors state: “Thecurrentstudyextendedthismodelbyintroducinganadaptationmechanismofameta-levelparameter,referredtoas themeta-priorw,whichregulatesthecomplexityterminthefreeenergy.”The model’s adaptation mechanism, referred to as the meta-prior w, regulates the complexity term within the free energy.
