Tactile-based Active Inference for
Force-Controlled Peg-in-Hole Insertions

Abstract—Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great
promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-
in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to
visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial
grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-
