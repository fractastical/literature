Active inference on discrete state-spaces: a synthesisThe authors state: “Active inference is a framework for understanding how the brain generates perceptions and actions by integrating sensory information with prior beliefs about the world.”The authors state: “Active inference provides a computational account of how the brain constructs its representations of the world.”The authors state: “The key idea is that the brain does not simply passively receive sensory information, but actively constructs its own representations of the world.”The authors state: “The core of active inference is the idea that the brain uses a generative model to produce its perceptions and actions.”The authors state: “The free energy principle provides a formal framework for understanding how the brain minimizes its uncertainty about the world.”The authors state: “The free energy principle is a measure of the discrepancy between the brain’s predictions and its sensory observations.”The authors
