### OverviewThis summary analyzes Dalton A R Sakthivadivel’s “Regarding Flows Under the Free Energy Principle: A Comment on “How Particular is the Physics of the Free Energy Principle?” by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz, and Buckley.” The paper investigates the core argument of the original critique, which posits that the Free Energy Principle (FEP), when applied in its conventional state-based formulation, is uninformative about the dynamics of many physical systems. This summary extracts key quotes, identifies central claims, and summarizes the paper’s findings, emphasizing the proposed shift towards a path-based model as a potential solution to the identified limitations.### MethodologySakthivadivel’s commentary centers on the authors’ assertion that the FEP, in its standard state-based formulation, fails to adequately describe the behavior of linear systems. The paper highlights the original authors’ concern regarding the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, stating: “In [AMTB22, section3.2], the authors discuss how the marginal flows of internal and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, respectively, are uniformative about a linear system’s behaviour.” This observation is supported by Figure5 of the target paper, which demonstrates a “poor correlation between system dynamics and marginal dynamics,” leading to the conclusion that the FEP is a “poor descriptor of the system.” The authors’ approach involves a critical examination of the assumptions underlying the FEP’s state-based formulation, specifically the reliance on gradients and marginal flows. As the authors note, “The authors argue that the absence of solenoidal couplings is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of system-ness.”### ResultsThe primary finding of Sakthivadivel’s commentary is the proposed solution: a shift towards a path-based formulation of the FEP. The paper argues that this approach, incorporating dynamical trajectories, o...

REGARDING FLOWS UNDER THE FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE:
A COMMENT ON “HOW PARTICULAR IS THE PHYSICS OF THE
FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE?” BY AGUILERA, MILLIDGE,
TSCHANTZ, AND BUCKLEY
DALTON A R SAKTHIVADIVEL
Abstract. In a recent technical critique of the free energy principle (FEP) due to
Aguilera-Millidge-Tschantz-Buckley, it is argued that there are a number of instances
wheretheFEP—asconventionallywritten,intermsofdensitiesoverstates—isuninform-
ativeaboutthedynamicsofmanyphysicalsystems,andbyextension,many‘things.’ In
this informal comment on their critique, I highlight two points of interest where their
derivations are largely correct, but where their arguments are not fatal to the FEP. I go
ontoconjecturethatapath-basedformulationoftheFEPhaskeyfeatureswhichrestore
its explanatory power in broad physical regimes. Correspondingly, this piece takes the
positionthattheapplicationofastate-basedformulationoftheFEPisinappropriatefor
certain simple systems, but, that the FEP can be expected to hold regardless.
1. Two problems raised by the target paper
We briefly recount two primary conclusions of the target paper. One is presented by
[AMTB22] as a counterexample to the generality of certain solenoidal descriptions of flow,
andtheother, totheclaimthatfreeenergygradientsareinformativeaboutlinearsystems.
1.1. No solenoidal coupling is no strict sign of system-ness. One of the primary
results of [AMTB22] is that the lack of solenoidal couplings between external and other
states, which one (I emphasise preemptively: not completely faithful) reading of the FEP
might suggest is a general feature of physical systems, is rare. The rationale for this is
introducedinAssumption1ofthepaperandrelevantresultsaregivenin[AMTB22,section
3.1],inFigure4andequations30through37. Thepresenceofsolenoidalcouplingsinlinear
systems (i.e., the absence of sparse coupling), along with the extrapolation that they will
be present in more complicated, non-linear systems, is suggested as an indication that the
FEP does not hold for many systems which it might seek to describe. As it is argued,
the consequence of this is that sparse coupling is a sufficient, but not necessary, sign of
system-ness. Under this general reading of the FEP, their result is initially in conflict with
the way systems and system-ness are described.
1.2. Free energy is uninformative about the flow of systems under linear fluctu-
ations. In [AMTB22, section 3.2], the authors discuss how the marginal flows of internal
and external states on free energy and surprisal gradients, respectively, are uniformative
about a linear system’s behaviour. In particular, Figure 5 of the target paper shows a
poor correlation between system dynamics and marginal dynamics; this might lead one to

believe the FEP is a poor descriptor of the system. As such, the very application of the
FEP to linear systems is called into question by the authors.
2. Two possible path-based solutions
Now, I propose some potential solutions to the issues raised by [AMTB22], mainly in
the language of probabilities over the flows—the paths of evolution—of a noisy system.
Since the FEP is naturally path-based [Fri19, FCS+22, BDCF+22], it is fitting that the
problemsposedcanbecircumventedbyreturningtopaths. Assuch, Ipositthattheabove
arguments are not fatal to the FEP.
One might expect path-based descriptions to be superior to state-based ones for one
simple reason: maximum calibre is asymptotically maximum entropy. This laconic state-
ment hides a more profound observation that systems in non-equilibrium regimes, where
fluctuations do not obey the ensemble properties typical of a system, are described well
by probabilities over the possible trajectories of the system instead [Sei12, TH13]. This
is referred to as the principle of maximum calibre by Jaynes [Jay85, PGLD13]. Non-
stationary diffusion processes, non-equilibrium systems whose sampling statistics change
from time-point to time-point, are also well-described by maximum calibre [GDAD20].
Besides maximum calibre, the evolution of diffusing systems in non-stationary regimes is
famously solved backwards by the path integral [Øks03, DM04, GJ12]. In [Fri19], it is
stated throughout that generalised coordinates of motion are the proper, dynamical set-
ting for the FEP, and that connections between the FEP and the fluctuation theorems of
stochastic thermodynamics are natural. In the recent papers [FCS+22] and [BDCF+22],
this is used to great effect. Most importantly, the problems summarised in Sections 1.1
and 1.2 here are indications of the fact that a state-based formulation is simply not an apt
description of certain systems.
Here, I sketch out two ways in which the previous issues—and implicitly, many more
questionssurroundingtheFEP—mayberesolved,bylookingatpathsasopposedtostates.
I am grateful to Karl J Friston for helpful discussions about these ideas, and for sharing
preliminary work writing the FEP in terms of dynamical trajectories explicitly.
2.1. No solenoidal coupling is a special case of path-wise independence. The key
idea behind the FEP, of which sparse coupling is but a shadow, is that of individuation.
In [AMTB22] it is demonstrated that, amongst linear systems, the sorts of conditional
independencies underlying the Markov blanket are difficult to construct. It is inferred that
they will be rare in general, and that sparse coupling only holds for particular systems. I
contendthattheMarkovblanketasitistypicallypresentedisaspecialcaseofindividuation
alongthedynamicalevolutionofasystem. Assoonasonecommitstoanideaofa‘thing’in
thecontextoftheFEP,onecommitstoanindividuationofthatthingfromitsenvironment,
such that the system evolves along its own set-points and distinguishes its structure from
thatoftheexternalmilieusurroundingit. Inthiscase, theflowofasystemisconditionally
independent of its environment.
A concrete way in which this construction should avoid problems raised by [AMTB22]
is that the stereotypical structure of the Hessian should become unnecessary, and these
conditionalindependenciesshouldbemadeobviousfromeithertheJacobianofthesystem,
or the probabilities over system-like trajectories given environmental dynamics. With no
density over states there is no wondering about solenoidal flows and conditional independ-
encies; these go away when states go away. A lack of solenoidal coupling may describe
REGARDING FLOWS UNDER THE FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE 3
specific systems in an interesting way, but ought to be a special case of this more general
construction.
2.2. Linear systems match, but do not track, minima of free energy. Inthetarget
paper, the example of a linear system is used, where it is shown that these systems do not
exhibit interesting or informative behaviour under gradient flows of the free energy. The
authors infer that free energy is not a useful quantity to describe simple systems, and that
it will be even more difficult to use the FEP insightfully in the more complicated systems
which are of interest to the FEP.
Here, the paths-based view clarifies the role of non-stationary dynamics in the FEP.
Under linear fluctuations, the system dissipates to a fixed point µ∗ on average. The most
likely state that the FEP references is trivial, and there is simply nothing interesting about
the free energy of this system—the system engages in mode-matching by dissipating to µ∗,
but does not engage in any dynamical mode-tracking, and hence the flow on free energy
is trivial. To that end, note that Figure 5 of [AMTB22] demonstrates precisely this: the
evolution of a small number of samples is not representative of the FEP.
Writingflowsalongfreeenergygradientsinthelanguageofinformationgeometry(where
beliefs typically change), it becomes apparent that the FEP does apply to systems with
stationary sufficient statistics—but by and large, has nothing interesting to say about
them. Instead, these sorts of marginal flows appear to have a home in maximum calibre,
whose marginal densities along the flow of a mode correspond to specific beliefs. Suppose
the trajectory taken by the system satisfies equation 3.6 in [PDCF20] or equation 22 in
[AMTB22], i.e.,
(cid:90) t
(1) (cid:104)µ(t)(cid:105) = f (µ ,b)ds,
ω µ s
0
with (cid:104)···(cid:105) being an expectation with respect to realisations of noise ω. For a sample path
ω
γ, one can denote (1) identically as
E [γ] = C(t).
p(γ)
If π is the space of paths and γ = {µ ,...,µ } is a path therein, the idea is to construct
0 n
mode-tracking by constraining maximum calibre in the following way:
(cid:90) (cid:18)(cid:90) (cid:19)
− ln{p(γ)}p(γ)dγ −λ(t) γp(γ)dγ −C(t) ,
π π
whereγ isatrajectoryofstates,andtheconstraintis(1). Inotherwords,thattheensemble
average (i.e., the average with respect to a density over realisations of sample paths) of γ
equals a particular function C(t). Assuming independence across steps in time simply for
notational ease, the resultant density,
(2) exp{−λ (µ ,...,µ )},
0,...,n 0 n
is the concatenation of several individual beliefs (each of which is parameterised by some
mode) according to the laws of joint probability:
exp{−λ(n)µ(n)}exp{−λ(n−1)µ(n−1)}...exp{−λ(0)µ(0)}.
Mapping this flow into a statistical manifold, the flow appears to describe an inference
process where the belief at every µ changes. In particular, each such density has µ as a
t t
parameter, given as its sufficient statistic. Conjecturally, a process modelled by (2) can be
4 DALTONARSAKTHIVADIVEL
read as a system which performs dynamical inference about where the mode may be at a
future time-step, and then flows towards that mode.
Since this appears to be equivalent to the FEP formulation in [Fri19] and [PDCF20],
it is clear that the FEP is not indeed a very useful treatment for linear systems, where
the ensemble average of γ is the constant function equal to µ∗. That is, it is clear that
the interesting, mode-tracking behaviour of non-linear systems which is key to the utility
of the FEP is absent from this description. To that end, it is likely that, in virtue of
aiming towards ‘things’ (defined as individuated systems with a particular partition) and
not arbitrary systems, the FEP is naturally most informative for non-linear or chaotic
systems, where it has been used to effect [FHU+21].
Along the same lines, only the fluctuations of linear systems contain any non-trivial
dynamics, whicharewashedawaybythemode-matchingundertheFEP.Thatthedensity-
over-states formulation assumes such a limit—an idealised non-equilibrium steady state,
valid for an ensemble of systems and not a particular realisation of a system—rather than
using probabilities of trajectories, manifests this uninformativeness. Probabilities over
trajectories, meanwhile, could include transients or few-body systems [PGLD13], and are
also better suited to dynamical modes.
As such, the FEP has little of interest to say about linear systems, because linear
systems are not interesting. This sort of reformulation should resolve the tension between
the indicated papers and [AMTB22], by demonstrating more clearly that the FEP is not,
after all, useful for linear systems; but that this is by design.
3. Closing remarks
It must be reasserted that this comment takes a middle way between dismissing and
sermonising the FEP: the foregoing points of critique, first raised in [AMTB22], are math-
ematically correct. However, I do not believe they invalidate the FEP—nor, one presumes,
do the authors of [AMTB22], who instead produce a working model of the FEP and point
out what is not possible within that model. Rather than show that the FEP per se is
incorrectly formulated, I view [AMTB22] as demonstrating that the FEP needs further
unravelling—for instance, returning to the paths-based constructions intimated through-
out [Fri19]—to make the nature of the tools it offers clear.
