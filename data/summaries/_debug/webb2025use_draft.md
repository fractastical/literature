### OverviewThis paper investigates the use of gaze-derived confidence of inferred operator intent in adjusting safety-conscious haptic assistance. The authors state: "Humans directly completing tasks in dangerous or mentally accomplish the task. The correspondence issue is inherent in the system as the operator lacks sufficient sensory feedback." They note: "Many are not always possible where these tasks are increasingly be performed remotely by teleoperated robots." The study demonstrates that incorporating the operator’s gaze can improve accuracy, execution time, and reduce operator error.### MethodologyThe authors state: "The proposed system takes advantage of the natural visuo-motor behavior of human beings. Several human visuomotor and cognitive behavior studies indicate that one’s gaze leads their hands during execution of a grasping task." The system uses a gaze-based approach to infer the operator’s intent and confidence level. The authors state: “The operator’s gaze is employed to intuitively indicate the target before the manipulation.” The system uses a potential hybrid control method, which combines the operator’s gaze with a manually-defined control position. The authors state: “The potential hybrid controller takes two position inputs, a target (the gaze target, p⃗ ) and a manually-defined control position ( joystick control location, p⃗ ).” The system uses a Gaussian curve to represent the influence of the gaze-derived confidence. The authors state: “The shape determines how quickly the influence of the field increases in each direction.” The system uses a confidence threshold of60% to determine when the operator’s intent is sufficiently clear.### ResultsThe authors state: “The operator’s gaze leads their hands during execution of a grasping task.” The experimental results show that the use of gaze-derived confidence improves the success rate of the grasping task.
