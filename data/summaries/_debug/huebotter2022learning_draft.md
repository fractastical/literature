### OverviewThis paper investigates learning policies for continuous control via transition models. The authors argue that animals do not have perfect inverse models of their limbs, and that learning the transition (forward) model from interaction is a viable approach to driving the learning of an amortized policy. The research proposes a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. The study evaluates the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in a reaching task, concluding with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control. "The authors state: “It is doubtful that animals have perfect inverse models of their limbs(e.g.,whatmusclecontractionmustbeappliedtoeveryjointtoreachaparticularlocationinspace).”### MethodologyThe core of the approach lies in learning a transition model, denoted as υ, which predicts the next state given the current state and control input. This model is implemented as a recurrent neural network. Simultaneously, a policy model, denoted as π, is learned to generate control actions based on the current state and target state. The authors highlight that the transition model is used to directly drive the learning of the policy. “According to the paper: “we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy.” The model is trained using a loss function that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual states. The authors also use a modular neural network architecture, consisting of a recurrent neural network for the transition model and a feedforward neural network for the policy model. “In the Introduction, the authors state: “deep active inference”### ResultsThe model performance is evaluated by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in a reaching task.
