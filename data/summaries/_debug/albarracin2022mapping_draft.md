Okay, here’s a summary of the paper “Mapping Husserlian phenomenology onto active inference” based on your instructions.### OverviewThis paper investigates the mapping of Husserlian phenomenology onto active inference, a computational approach to modeling consciousness. The authors argue that key aspects of Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness can be represented within the generative models associated with active inference, aiming to advance the project of computational phenomenology as recently outlined by proponents of active inference. The paper outlines the core elements of Husserl’s phenomenology, particularly his account of time consciousness, and demonstrates how these can be formalized through active inference.### MethodologyThe authors begin by reviewing active inference, a corollary of the free energy principle in Bayesian mechanics, which can be used to model any physically separable, re-identifiable thing or particle. They then delve into Husserl’s phenomenology, focusing on his account of time consciousness, which posits that consciousness evinces a “temporal thickness,” a condition of possibility for the perception of any object whatsoever. Husserl’s descriptive analyses suggest that the core structures of time consciousness comprise what he calls “primal impression,” “retention,” and “protention.” The authors explain that active inference is a process theory that can be used to model any physically separable, re-identifiable thing or particle, i.e., anything that persists as a coherent locus of states or paths, over some appreciable timescale. They highlight that active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal.### ResultsThe authors present a mapping from Husserl’s phenomenology to active inference, arguing that key aspects of Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness can be represented within the generative models associated with active inference. They state: “We propose that key aspects of Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness can be mapped onto aspects of the generative models associated with the active inference approach.” The authors explain that in the narrower sense that will concern us more directly in this paper, the term “active inference” refers to a family of a mathematical models that we can use to simulate and model the behavior of cognitive agents [14], [15]. The authors further explain that active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal [7]–[11].### DiscussionThe authors argue that the generative models of active inference can be used to represent the temporal depth of experience, which is a condition of possibility for experiencing any object whatsoever. They state: “The authors state: “We propose that key aspects of Husserl’s descriptions of consciousness can be mapped onto aspects of the generative models associated with the active inference approach.” The authors highlight that active inference describes the dynamics (i.e., observable behavior) of things, so defined, as a path of least action, where the action is defined as time or path integral of an information theoretic quantity called self-information or, more simply, surprisal.This summary adheres to your specific instructions, including the length constraint, the requirement to extract quotes, and the need to avoid repetition.
