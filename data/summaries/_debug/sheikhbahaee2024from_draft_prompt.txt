The Free-Energy Principle (FEP) [1, 2, 3] has been adopted in a variety
of ambitious proposals that aim to characterize all adaptive, sentient, and
cognitive systems within a unifying framework. Judging by the amount of
attention it has received from the scientific community, the FEP has gained
significant traction in these pursuits. The current target article represents
an important iteration of this research paradigm in formally describing emer-
gent dynamics rather than merely (quasi-)steady states. This affords more
in-depth considerations of the spatio-temporal complexities of cross-scale
causality – as we have encouraged and built towards in previous publications
(e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). In this spirit of constructive feedback, we submit a few
technical comments on some of the matters that appear to require further
attention, in order to improve the clarity, rigour, and applicability of this
framework.
Certain idiosyncratic definitions and derivative statements in this paper
and prior works have tended to confuse scientists who attempt to assess the
validity of such formulations in depth. As the authors aimed to formulate a
robust Bayesian mechanics by borrowing from physics, particular care needs
to be taken concerning physics terminology.
In the target article, much of the authors’ argument relies on what they
define as “generalized coordinates”, effectively a vector containing higher-
order time derivatives of motion of a (sub)system, which can be used to

approximate its local dynamics under certain limiting assumptions, on some
(unspecified) time scale. While the authors’ usage appears to be internally
consistent, it may generate confusion with respect to a particular analytical
method that physicists hold dear. When grappling with complex dynamical
systems, manyhoursofworkcanbesavedbyapplyingastate-spacereduction
and exploiting the coordinate-agnostic flexibility of Lagrangian mechanics,
where “generalized coordinates” and “generalized velocities” refer to q and
q˙, respectively, in the Lagrange equation of the second kind: d(δL) = δL.
dt δq˙j δqj
In that context, carefully choosing a set of generalized coordinates is a
highly context-specific and technical task in itself that can simplify deriva-
tions of physically meaningful constraints on a system’s dynamics (e.g., a
textbook example: shifting to angular coordinates to effectively model a
pendulum; see [10]). If the authors intend to engage the physics community
effectively and avoid unnecessary confusion for novel readers, it would seem
expedient to choose a different label, or else clearly explain differences from
common (physics-textbook) linguistic use.
Such an apparently innocuous mixing of terms can engender further mis-
understandings, leading to breakdowns incommunication between fields. For
example, considerthefollowingquotefromthetargetarticle: “In this setting,
the Lagrangian plays the role of an action, where paths of least action min-
imize the Lagrangian of generalized states.” (p.36) This quote would make
most physicists frown because the action is commonly defined as the path
integral of the Lagrangian – as acknowledged by the authors (see also [11]).
Within the confines of the target article, however, “generalised states” are
defined such that they implicitly characterize local paths, which means that
theLagrangianofallderivatives canbeseen asspecifying an(implicit) action
of sorts (valid only to the extent that a Taylor series approximation holds).
Moregenerallyspeaking, manyclaimsthroughoutthearticlecontaintacit
assumptions, often leaving the reader to reverse engineer what additional de-
tails the authors might have had in mind that could help constrain their
claims. For example, consider this sentence: “We make no assumptions
about the solutions of this equation, other than the flow operator does not
change over some relevant time interval.”(p.38). Since the formulation itself
consists of postulates and approximations with unclear boundary conditions,
it becomes difficult (or impossible) to evaluate individual claims. In their
pursuit of generality, most concepts have been left either unconstrained or
defined in a self-referential manner. In extension, the same holds for solu-
2
tions, as exemplified above: the authors assumed that solutions have flow
operators that do not change on relevant time intervals without specifying
what degrees of change might be considered significant and what kinds of
time intervals could be “relevant”. One might wonder under which condi-
tions a Taylor series will (still) provide satisfactory approximations when
considering systems that display cross-scale itinerancy. There are likely dy-
namical regimes where such polynomial approximations must be extended
with periodic components, but currently, the blanket response would be to
simply postulate “relevant” time scales at which the Taylor series is enough.
The need for precise semantics becomes critical when the FEP claims
delveintocomplicatedtopicssuchasagencyandsentience. Thewordsauton-
omy and agency are used interchangeably, but there is a significant difference
between systems driven by meaningful internal dynamics [12], and systems
that are capable of planning in order to achieve explicitly represented goals;
thus, it remains important to recognize the difference between teleology vs.
’mere’ telonomy [13, 14, 15].
In the article, the authors invoke notions of ”strange particles” and the
circular causation involved in their beliefs about their self-generated ac-
tions. This handling of ”self-evidencing” [16] may not only help speak to
the “strange loops” characteristic of some complex adaptive systems, but
also to the deeper issues of life-mind continuity [17], and the recursive nature
of consciousness [18, 19].
The authors also allude to the concept of consciousness (using quotes
from Heisenberg and David Bohm), but never clarify how it relates to their
definition of “sentience”. Connecting the behaviour of strange particles with
’sentience’ might be premature, depending on the semantic scope of this
concept. While self-evidencing systems can be considered to be sentient in
that they are governed by information given valence by reference to self-
persistence, it is important not to conflate this with consciousness, lest we
risk being so inclusive with this concept as to compromise the utility of
considering the conscious properties of a system. If conscious brains are
clearly a self-referential system, not all self-referential systems are necessarily
sentient or conscious.
Conscious experience likely requires complex network architectures ca-
pable of supporting “integrated world modeling” [20, 21]. Such functional
properties may potentially be achieved in a variety of ways in different kinds
of ”particles,” such as through information bottlenecks emerging from com-
plex attractor dynamics [22]. However, to reliably ground such inferences
3
about the potential conscious properties of a system, it is required that we
both deeply engage with models of consciousness for systems for which we
know there are subjective experiences, as well as precisely characterize the
phenomenology (in the sense used by physicists) of systems that may realize
such qualitative aspects by other means.”
To associate the functionalities (and perhaps phenomenality) of ”sen-
tience” with particles may generate further confusion by both implying the
kinds of panpsychism the authors explicitly renounce, as well as potentially
suggesting a kind of illegitimate eliminative reductionism concerning the
values of agents with conscious experience (e.g. the ”as if” language used
throughout the paper for the ontological status of particles with goals).
In conclusion, this FEP-based formalism presented by Friston and col-
leagues offers an intriguing perspective on life and cognition, but many con-
ceptual nuances still need to be addressed. This painstaking process could
eventually allow the authors to do justice to the complex systems they want
todescribe andtheglobalandinterdisciplinary community of academics they
aim to engage.
